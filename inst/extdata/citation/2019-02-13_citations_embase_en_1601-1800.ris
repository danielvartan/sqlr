N2  - Introduction: Snoring is common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester. Most investigations of snoring during pregnancy have utilised questionnaires to determine the presence and severity of snoring. This study administered questionnaires and recorded snoring during sleep in 202 women in order to validate the use of questionnaires against objective measurement of actual snoring. Aim: To determine the efficacy of questionnaires to determine the presence of snoring in pregnant women including AHI. Methods: Berlin questionnaires were administered to 202 pregnant women. One question asked “Do you snore?” Snoring was then recorded in the woman's home using a SonoMat™ (Home sleep test) device, a thin mattress in which sensors measure and record sound and movement from the participant and the ambient sound. AHI were determined. The results from the questionnaire were compared to recorded snoring and AHI results Results: 124 women answered “Yes” to the question “Do you snore?” and 78 women answered “No” and “I don't know” for score purpose were included in “No”. The average gestation was 28 ± 7 weeks. There were no significant differences between the percentages of snoring recorded in <20% or >20% of night spent snoring. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that questionnaire results are not a reliable method of determining whether snoring is present, and overnight monitoring should be used to rule our sleep disordered breathing, particularly when hypertension is present.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period, using the theoretical framework of appraisal theory of emotions. Background: Self-reports of poor sleep reflect, and are consistent with, low maternal mood during the perinatal period, yet the psychological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been sufficiently addressed. Appraisal theory of emotions suggests that emotional experiences are the outcome of how individuals judge their circumstances and previous research has identified particular appraisal dimensions that trigger maternal distress. Identifying the appraisals underlying the subjective perception of poor sleep quality could help to clarify which appraisal dimensions are related to the association between subjective sleep quality and maternal mood Methods: One hundred and twenty two pregnant women completed measures of sleep, mood and appraisal during the third trimester of gestation, within 7-10 days after childbirth and at 10-12 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and an appraisal questionnaire. Additional demographic and obstetric information was obtained from the participants. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals. Results: Overall, the participants reported low to moderate levels of distress. Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhoodrelated issues, as well as with negative expectations about the future. Conclusions: Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress, as identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood, and has implications for practice and intervention.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy and postpartum are periods of increased vulnerability for some psychiatric disorders. Recent studies reveal a prevalence of mental illness that reaches 14% during both periods, with mood and anxiety disorders being the most frequent, specially during the 1st and 3rd quarters [1]. When left untreated, psychiatric disorders imply serious consequences for the pregnant woman and the fetus, namelly higher maternal mortality as well as higher occurrence of spontaneous abortion, prematurity and lower weight at birth. It may also imply deficient nutrition and maternal care, dificulties on the bounding process and delay of psychomotor development. Thus, early clinical evaluation and appropriate treatment, are essential during this period. Since 1995, the Psychiatric Liaison Consultation in Bissaya Barreto Maternity integrates the Early Intervention Unit (UIP), which is formed by a multidisciplinary team that ensures a specific intervention in pregnancy and postpartum periods in women with psychiatric illness. This multidisciplinary team includes psychiatrist, obstetrician, nurses, social workers and psychologist. Purpose of the Study: Compare neonatal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to psychotropic drugs for sleep disorders during pregnancy, with and without Depressive symptomatology, with pregnant women without psychiatric symptomatology and not exposed to any therapy during pregnancy. Methodology: The authors conducted a case-control study to compare neonatal outcomes between pregnant women exposed to psychotropic drugs for sleep disorders (antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines), observed at the Psychiatry- Obstetric Consultation (study group), and pregnant women followed at the Obstetric Consultation, without psychopathology during pregnancy, therefore not exposed to psychiatric medication (control group). The authors assessed the study group for the presence of psychopathology, focusing on the presence of sleep disorders and its correlation with the presence of depressive disorders. Several data were collected from the clinical processes and include the type and the dosage of psychotropic drug prescribed, Apgar scores at birth, weight at birth, type of delivery, gestational age at delivery and other relevant clinic parameters, like neonatal complications. During pregnancy, all women of both groups underwent ultrasound monitoring quarterly, with biometry. The study has 6 months of duration (January 2014 to July 2014). Results: Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences - SPSS (19th version). A p value lower than 0.05 indicates statistical significance for a particular variable. Conclusions: Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in the group exposed to psychiatric medication are as good as in the control group, supporting that the use of psychotropic drugs during pregnancy is safe to the mother and the baby, as long as used with caution. Early psychiatric intervention during pregnancy, in conjunction with obstetrics, is the gold standard to follow up pregnant women with mental illness and the results this study will bring more development to an area that still offers some controversy.

N2  - Introduction: Central apnoeas (CA) are common in healthy infants and children. The central apnoea (CAI) index is defined as the number of central apnoeas per hour of sleep. Population based studies in children have reported CAI of between 0-6 (Traeger et al., 2005; Montgomery- Downs et al., 2006; Verhulst et al., 2007; Scholle et al., 2011) with the incidence falling with age (Montgomery-Downs et al., 2006; Scholle et al., 2011). A CAI of >1 event/h is considered diagnostic for central sleep apnoea (Iber et al., 2007). In infants, particularly those born preterm, CAs are very common with apnoea of prematurity occurring in more than 85% of infants born prior to 34 weeks of gestation and this is inversely related to gestation at birth (Henderson-Smart 1981). CAs occurring in a repetitive pattern of more than 3 events are termed periodic breathing. Periodic breathing is also more common in infants born preterm than those born at term and the incidence decreases with increasing postnatal age. It is believed that this decrease in incidence is due, at least in part, by maturation of the central nervous system. CAs in infants and children are usually considered benign because they occur in healthy infants and children and are usually not associated with significant oxygen desaturation. Results: Studies have however shown that movement-induced CAs were more common in children with obstructive sleep apnoea compared to non snoring control children and were associated with significant increases in heart rate and blood pressure (O'Driscoll et al., 2009). In both term and preterm infants periodic breathing is associated with cyclical changes in cerebral oxygenation and cerebral blood volume (Jenni et al., 1994; Urlesberger et al., 2000). Recent studies by our group have shown that in some preterm infants who have been discharged from hospital and followed longitudinally significant falls in cerebral oxygenation continue until 6 months post-term corrected age. Conclusion: Central apnoeas are common in infants and children and conventionally are considered benign, however recent evidence suggests that they may have a role in the adverse consequences of sleep disordered breathing in children. In infants there are few longitudinal studies assessing the impact of persistent CA on developmental outcomes and more studies are required to elucidate these.

N2  - Introduction Studies in Western populations have found that individual differences in sleep quantity and quality affect developmental functioning in children. A recent study has suggested that problems with sleep quantity and quality are highly prevalent amongst Singaporean children (Aishworiya et al, 2012). Based on the existing literature that sleep is crucial for development and that sleep problems are common in Singaporean children, this study aims to investigate if sleep plays a role in predicting developmental outcomes in Singaporean children. Previous research (Ward et al, 2010) reported that greater time spent awake after sleep onset (WASO), a measure of sleep quality, was associated with poorer (visual) cognitive processing. Most research is based on cross-sectional studies. Here we investigated whether quantity and quality of infant sleep at age 6-months predicts toddler Bayley's cognitive, language and motor performance at age 24-months. Methods In this study, a subset of 68 six-month-old infants were included from the larger Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort study (Soh et al, 2013). Inclusion criteria were term born infants between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age, APGAR score ≥9, normal birth weight (2500 g to 4000 g), and no maternal complications during pregnancy. The infants wore a sleep actigraph watch on their ankles for 5 to 7 days and parents were asked to keep a weeklong diary of the infant's sleep patterns. Actigraphy measures age 6-months and Bayley's cognitive, language and motor measures age 24-months were analysed using linear mixed models in SPSS, controlling for effects of gender and maternal education and trait anxiety at 26 weeks of pregnancy. Results Analyses highlighted significant associations between longer 6-month WASO and poorer Bayley's performance at 24-months. Bayley's cognitive scaled scores decreased by an average of 0.072 for each additional WASO minute (t61 = -2.81, P = 0.007). For the language composite, Bayley's receptive and expressive scaled scores decreased by an average of 0.069 and 0.056 respectively for each additional WASO minute (receptive: t61 = -2.67, P = 0.010; expressive: t61 = -2.42, P = 0.019). Furthermore, each additional WASO minute also predicted a 0.063 decrease in Bayley's gross motor scaled scores (t61 = -2.60, P = 0.012). There was a marginal association between WASO and Bayley's fine motor performance, where each additional WASO minute was associated with a 0.054 decrease in fine motor scaled scores (t61 = -1.77, P = 0.082). Conclusion Since longer WASO is a marker of poor sleep quality, results from the current study show that early measures of infant sleep quality are useful predictors of later child development across different domains (cognition, language, motor). This suggests that sleep is important for multiple developmental outcomes throughout childhood. In light of the high prevalence of sleep problems amongst Singaporean children, further studies are needed to explore potential causes these sleep problems and how individual differences in sleep affect developmental outcomes longitudinally.

N2  - Paediatric asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease in Australia. Sleep disturbances are common in asthmatics with poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Although the causal direction of this relationship is unknown, improvement in one could benefit the severity of the other. Aim: The aims of this study were to confirm, using a single birth cohort, the nature and strength of association between sleep quality, snoring and asthma in the adolescent and young adult population, and to identify to what extent asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years independently predicted themselves or each other at 21 years. Methods: Data from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015 participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 and 21 years. The cross sectional association between asthma, sleep quality and snoring was analysed at both 14 years and 21 years. Predictive analysis examined the longitudinal relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 and 21 years. Cross tabulation with the χ2 test was used for categorical data & binary logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios using SPSS. Results: Sleep disturbance and snoring were associated with asthma at 14 years [odds ratio 1.51(1.25-183), 1.73 (1.49-2.01)]. Similar association was noted at 21 years, albeit only significant in females. This association persisted in females when analysed for asthma severity variables. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 strongly predicted themselves at the age of 21[p < 0.001]. In addition, snoring and sleep disturbance at 14 predicted asthma at 21 and asthma at 14 predicted snoring at 21 years, especially in females[p < 0.001]. Discussion: The predictive relationship seen between sleep and snoring at 14 years and asthma at 21 years allows a possible opportunity to address these issues at a younger age and reduce the incidence of early adult-onset asthma in females. Similarly aggressive management of asthma in adolescence may lead to a reduction in snoring and potentially associated sleep disordered breathing.

N2  - Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy [SUDI], is the biggest single component of post neonatal death in the developed world. Unfortunately, like many indigenous groups, Maori have an elevated risk for SUDI. The Maori community developed a culturally-appropriate sleep device (wahakura) as an alternative to direct bedsharing. However, there is currently no research showing what happens when a significant number of babies use this device. Aim: To compare the wahakura with a standard bassinet on recognised dangers in sleep environments (bedsharing, infant sleep position, hypoxia and hyperthermia), other possible consequences (maternal sleep quality and quantity, maternal fatigue) and to investigate the potential benefits of a culturally-sensitive sleep device for promoting breastfeeding. Methods: 200 mainly Maori participants were recruited through midwifery practices in deprived areas, and randomized to receive a wahakura or a bassinet during pregnancy. At 1, 3 and 6 mths, mothers completed questionnaires regarding their use of the allocated or other sleep devices, bedsharing, infant sleep position, maternal sleep quality and quantity, maternal fatigue, and breastfeeding. Infrared video, infant HbO2 saturation, heart rate and peripheral temperature were recorded overnight at 1 month of age. Results: Participants were relatively high risk with 29% of mothers being single, 59% in the most deprived quintile, 75% of Maori ethnicity and 43.6% had some smoking in pregnancy. Intention to treat analysis was used. Infant sleep position was not different between groups (80.9 vs 82.8% supine, p = .636). Maternal sleep quantity (p = .835) and quality (p = .25) was also not different with 59% of each group describing enough sleep at 1 month and good or very good sleep quality in 95%. The numbers of mothers fully breastfeeding were also equivalent across groups (p = .374) with 48, 39 and 15% fully breast feeding at 1, 3 and 6 mths. Conclusion: Preliminary analyses show that the safety and benefits of the wahakura are at least equivalent to the currently recommended bassinet. The wahakura appears to represent a safe, culturallyappropriate sleep device to offer to parents. Further analysis of the video data, including a pragmatic analysis will increase understanding of the risks and benefits to mothers and infants when using the wahakura.

N2  - Introduction: Wrist actigraphy is widely used to measure sleep in healthy individuals. Compared to polysomnography (PSG), the accuracy of actigraphy to detect sleep is good (accuracy approx. 84%), mainly due to its strong capability to detect periods of sleep (sensitivity approx. 90%) despite its poor capability to detect wake periods during sleep (specificity approx. 48%). Given the low overall specificity it is possible that the accuracy of actigraphy is influenced by individual differences in sleep quality. Methods: 100 healthy young adults young adults (53 males, 47 females, 23 ± 0 years, BMI 26 ± 6 kg/m2) from theWestern Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study underwent a single night of simultaneous PSG and wrist actigraphy (GTX3+). Arousal index (number of arousals of ≥3 seconds, AASM 2012 definition) and awakening index (number of transitions from sleep epoch to wake epoch) were obtained from PSG. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were assessed by epoch-by-epoch comparison of actigraphy to PSG. Regression and correlation analyses were undertaken between sensitivity, specificity and accuracy compared to each individual's arousal index and awakening index. Results: PSG-derived awakening index was 4 ± 1 events/hr (range 2 to 8) and arousal index was 10 ± 6 events/hr (range 0 to 34%). Overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 84 ± 8% (range 49 to 97%), 90 ± 8% (range 48 to 100%), and 44 ± 20% (range 0 to 83%) respectively. Individual measures of accuracy were inversely correlated to awakening index (r = -0.53, p < 0.05) but not arousal index. Individual measures of sensitivity were inversely correlated to awakening index (r = -0.44, p < 0.05) but not arousal index. Individual measures of specificity were correlated to awakening index (r = 0.22, p < 0.05) but not arousal index. Summary: With increasing number of overnight awakenings: (i) the capacity of actigraphy to detect periods of sleep decreases; (ii) its capacity to accurately detect periods of wake increases; and (ii) the overall accuracy of actigraphy decreases. In contrast, the accuracy of actigraphy is not affected by brief arousals from sleep. Conclusions: Care should be taken where using actigraphy in adults who are otherwise healthy but who have poor sleep quality.

N2  - Introduction: Bryophyllum pinnatum is an herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine, and has been shown to be associated with improvements of sleep quality in pregnancy [1]. Only few and minor or moderate side-effects have been reported [2,3]. Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality. Here the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B. pinnatum was investigated. Patients and methods: In this prospective, observational study, cancer patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B. pinnatum (350 mg tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf press juice, Weleda AG, Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets with the dinner and 2 before going to bed). Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSGI), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale, ESS) and fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS) were assessed at the beginning of the treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 21 completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Results: Patients were 62.5 ± 8.68 years old and in their majority female (18 out of 21). A preliminary analysis of the data revealed that during treatment with B. pinnatum the PSQI decreased from 12 ± 3.5 to 9 ± 3.4 (p < 0.01), and ESS changed from 8 ± 3.0 to 7 ± 3.8 (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant change in FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of the patients, with only 6 patients reporting possible side-effects (fatigue n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion: Bryophyllum pinnatum seems to be a suitable treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled clinical trials on the use of B. pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.

N2  - Melatonin is an indoleamine produced by the pineal gland and secreted in a circadian manner. In the past few decades, research over this topic has been enhanced. Melatonin has many important roles in the human physiology: regulator of the circadian rhythms, sleep inducer, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic. This paper reviews the involvement of melatonin in embryo fetal development. The pineal gland develops completely postpartum, so both the embryo and the fetus are dependent on the maternal melatonin provided transplacentally. Melatonin appears to be involved in the normal outcome of pregnancy beginning with the oocyte quality and finishing with the parturition. Its pregnancy night-time concentrations increase after 24 weeks of gestation, with significantly high levels after 32 weeks. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the embryo and fetus since early stages. There is solid evidence that melatonin is neuroprotective and has a positive effect on the outcome of the compromised pregnancies. In addition, chronodisruption leads to a reproductive dysfunction. Thus, the influence of melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to the entertaining of circadian rhythmicity, but further studies are needed.

N2  - PURPOSE: Pregnant women have a 2-3 fold higher probability of developing restless legs syndrome (RLS - sleep-related movement disorders) than general population. This study aims to evaluate the behavior and locomotion of rats during pregnancy in order to verify if part of these animals exhibit some RLS-like features.
METHODS: We used 14 female 80-day-old Wistar rats that weighed between 200 and 250 g. The rats were distributed into control (CTRL) and pregnant (PN) groups. After a baseline evaluation of their behavior and locomotor activity in an open-field environment, the PN group was inducted into pregnancy, and their behavior and locomotor activity were evaluated on days 3, 10 and 19 of pregnancy and in the post-lactation period in parallel with the CTRL group. The serum iron and transferrin levels in the CTRL and PN groups were analyzed in blood collected after euthanasia by decapitation.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the total ambulation, grooming events, fecal boli or urine pools between the CTRL and PN groups. However, the PN group exhibited fewer rearing events, increased grooming time and reduced immobilization time than the CTRL group (ANOVA, p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pregnant rats show behavioral and locomotor alterations similar to those observed in animal models of RLS, demonstrating to be a possible animal model of this sleep disorder.

N2  - PURPOSE: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are common in pregnancy and are associated with adverse outcomes including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. In previous studies we demonstrated that levels of unconjugated estriol, placenta associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and angiogenesis markers were altered in pregnant women with OSA compared to pregnant controls at low risk for OSA. As snoring, a result of partial airflow limitation, is one of the components of OSA, we aimed to examine the relationship between markers of placental and fetal wellbeing and snoring in pregnant women. METHODS: A secondary analysis of a cohort of pregnant women screened for SDB in immediate post-partum period was performed. Non-snorers were defined as women answering “never” to question about snoring from the multivariable-apnea prediction index; snorers answered “frequently” or “always” to the same question. Women with available first and second trimester markers of fetal and placental wellbeing were selected. Marker levels were reported as multiples of median (MoM) and later adjusted in a regression analysis for body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: The study identified 141 pregnant women with habitual snoring and 166 controls with available markers (mean age/mean BMI: 29/27.8 vs 28.1/24.1 respectively). Median levels of markers of fetal wellbeing (alpha feto-protein) and feto-placental wellbeing (unconjugated estriol) were significantly lower in snorers compared to non-snorers (0.9 + 0.38 (SD) compared to 1.0 + 0.42 (SD); p=0.026) and (0.95 + 0.37 (SD) compared to 1.06 + 0.33 (SD); p=0.016) respectively. This difference was no longer significant once adjusted for BMI (p=0.64; p=0.58). On the other hand, markers associated with preeclampsia (PAPP-A, inhibin-A and human chorionic gonadotropin) were not significantly different between snorers and non-snorers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that snoring does not independently alter markers of placental and fetal wellbeing. The difference between these data and those found in women with OSA suggest that intermittent hypoxia and/or arousals are necessary to alter placental and fetal markers. The association of snoring with preeclampsia may be mediated by other mechanisms. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Alterations in placenta - secreted markers require a more profound insult than the partial airflow limitation associated with snoring.

N2  - In New Zealand, the Maori SUDI rate is 5 times that of non Maori, non Pacific (2.34 deaths per 1000 live births vs 0.52). Many deaths are associated with bedsharing and maternal smoking. These behaviours have proved resistant to change. The wahakura (flax bassinet) is designed from a cultural perspective as a potentially safer sleep place. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device. Aim: to compare wahakura with bassinets as sleep options acceptable to Maori families. Methods: 200 participants were recruited, through midwifery practices supporting mainly Maori families in deprived areas, and were randomized to receive a wahakura (W) or a bassinet (B) during pregnancy. Baseline data was collected during pregnancy and then questionnaires on sleep practices, breastfeeding and maternal and infant well-being were completed at 1, 3 and 6 mths. At 1 month, overnight videosomnography, oximetry and temperature recordings of 80 bassinet and 79 wahakura babies were completed. This paper reports on the results of overnight videosomnography. Results: Participants were relatively high risk with 67% identifying as Maori, 55% residing in areas with a NZ deprivation score of 9-10 (10 being most deprived) and 55% reporting some smoking in pregnancy, Intention to treat analysis was used. Mean study time (B:9.9 vs 10.1 h), mean asleep time (B:6.7 vs W:6.7), head covered time (B:0.45 vs 0.43 h), and breastfeeding (B:0.38 vs W:0.44) were not significantly different. Similarly, the number of head coverings (mean, B:2.1 vs W:1.5, p = 0.4) and breastfeeding events (B:3.2 vs W:3.9, p = 0.3) were not different between groups. On the study night babies slept in a bassinet (mean time B:6.7 h vs W:1.9 hr, p < 0.0001), wahakura under adult bed-covers (B:0 vs W:0.4 h), wahakura on bed-covers (B:0 vs W:1.8 h), and wahakura off the bed (B:0 vs 2 h), in mother's bed (B:1.7 h vs 2.1 h, p = .48) and in a cot (B:0.4 vs W:0.5, p = .74). Conclusion: This study suggests it is as reasonable to provide a wahakura as it is to provide a bassinet as a safe sleep intervention in this population. The findings show no difference between the behaviours for the two options. Further pragmatic analysis will provide greater understanding of behaviour while sleeping in the wahakura.

N2  - Background and aims: Although cases of pregnancy in acromegaly are rare, approximately 150reported, it is important that women with acromegaly who desire pregnancy receive preconception counselling. We recently had 3 women with acromegaly wishing to achieve pregnancy. Our objectives were to review the literature of acromegaly and pregnancy and to identify the key challenges of preconception counselling. One patient was recently diagnosed and 2 had longstanding acromegaly well controlled on medical therapy. Methods: Case series of 3 women with recent desire for pregnancy. Issues were identified from chart review and discussion with staff involved. Literature review of acromegaly and pregnancy was conducted. Results: Important issues that were identified included: impact of acromegaly on fertility, whether treatment plan should be modified if planning pregnancy, optimal timing of conception, if and when to discontinue treatment (prior to or after pregnancy), screening for associated conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea), risk of progression of acromegaly/tumour growth during pregnancy, impact of acromegaly on pregnancy outcomes, surveillance during pregnancy (interpretation of GH, IGF-1 levels, MRI), overlap of normal pregnancy symptoms and acromegalic symptoms (eg. Carpal tunnel), choice of method of delivery (risk of valasalva during vaginal delivery if significant residual tumour/tumour growth) and impact on neonatal outcomes and breastfeeding. Conclusions: Pregnancy can be safely achieved in patients with acromegaly. There is little evidence to guide recommendations around conception and pregnancy surveillance. Patients can be reassured that in most situations, pregnancy proceeds without complication and that medical treatment can be used during pregnancy if necessary.

N2  - Objectives: During pregnancy and as a new mother sleep deprivation is known to impair mood. We investigated the factors that may mediate this relationship to give mothers with poor sleep more options to help improve their mood. Method: 184 women expecting their first babies were recruited into the study. Participants (18+) had no history of major depression. Outcome variables included depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale: EPDS), sleep (Insomnia Severity Index: ISI and Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue: MAF), coping strategies (Brief COPE) and selfefficacy (Self-efficacy Scale: SES). These were examined using online questionnaires during the third trimester of pregnancy and 6 weeks postnatally. Results: During pregnancy, insomnia and fatigue explained 32% of the variance in depression (p < .05). Certain coping strategies including distraction, denial, behavioural disengagement, venting and self-blame collectively mediated the relationship between insomnia and depression (z = 4.316, p < 0.001) as well as fatigue and depression (z = 3.88, p < .001). At six weeks postpartum, coping strategies including emotional support, instrumental support, venting, positive reframing, planning, acceptance and self-blame mediated the effect of insomnia (z = 2.09, p < 0.05) but not fatigue on depression. Self-efficacy independently predicted depression both during pregnancy (p < .01) and the early postpartum (p < .01). Conclusions: Although insomnia and fatigue were consistently related to lower mood both during pregnancy and postnatally, coping strategies were important mediators of these relationships. Coping strategies should be considered as a possible approach in preventing poor mood in first time expectant mums.

N2  - RATIONALE: Many asthmatics report symptoms from early childhood. Allergic responses can develop in infancy, and decline in lung function associated with asthma may occur by school-age. Understanding development of allergic responses and patterns of recurrent childhood wheezing leading to persistent asthma is the primary goal of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study. The overarching hypothesis of the CHILD Study is: “Exposure to indoor pollutants including chemical agents and microbiological agents, by interaction with host genetics, hormonal, metabolic, psychosocial, physiological, nutritional and immunological factors, increases the risk of allergy and asthma in infancy and early childhood”. METHODS: From 2008-2012, 3629 pregnant women were recruited in multiple urban and rural centres with a wide range of climates, environments and housing types. Over 3300 infants meeting inclusion criteria (singleton pregnancy, delivery >35 weeks, no serious congenital or health concerns at birth) are currently in follow-up. Mothers and infants are studied intensively before and after birth, examining genetics, epigenetics, innate and adaptive immunity, together with psychological, physiological and environmental risk factors; multiple allergic and respiratory phenotypic outcomes are determined. Environmental exposure data include repeated detailed questionnaires, a home inspection, estimates of outdoor air pollution and biologic sampling. Other assessments include maternal nutrition, child feeding patterns, infections, psychosocial characteristics, stress, child health and development of allergic diseases. Children are seen at 3 months, and again at 1, 3 and 5 years; clinical and environmental data are updated multiple times between visits. Parental assessments include health history, spirometry, allergy skin testing, and blood for DNA and biomarkers. Several hypothesis-driven sub-studies are now linked to CHILD, including assessment of sleep disorders in early infancy, determinants of early exposure to plasticizers, and studies of the infant microbiome and health. RESULTS: The table provides demographics of the recruited families, prevalence of selected exposures in pregnancy∗ or observed in a home visit at 3 months, selected health outcomes and objective assessments to one year. CONCLUSIONS: The CHILD Study has completed recruitment and is following over 3300 children, their mothers and most fathers. By age 1 year, 15% have objective evidence of atopy by skin test reactivity, 10% have experienced wheezing, 23% report atopic dermatitis/eczema while 9% report food allergy. Continuing genetic, environmental, microbiome, innate and adaptive immune profiling as well as physiological and psychosocial studies based on this national longitudinal birth cohort will enable greater understanding of the origins of allergy and asthma.

N2  - Background: Preterm birth is associated with increased risk of the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and cardiovascular disease in adulthood, which may be due to impaired cardiovascular control. The baroreflex is the primary mechanism by which autonomic control of blood pressure (BP) occurs. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) has been shown to be altered by preterm birth. In term infants it is reduced in the prone position, the major risk factor for SIDS. To date, the effect of prone sleeping on BRS in preterm infants has not been assessed. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of prone sleeping on BRS in preterm infants born across a range of gestational ages. Methods: Daytime polysomnography was performed at 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months and 5-6 months post-term age on 21 very preterm (mean gestation 29.4 ± 0.3 wk), 14 preterm (mean gestation 33.1 ± 0.3 wk) and 17 term (mean gestation 40.1 ± 0.3 wk) infants. Blood pressure was measured using a Finometer™ cuff (Finapress Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Data were recorded in both the supine and prone positions. BRS was calculated using cross spectral analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in BP and heart period (HP). The effects of sleep state and position were determined using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) within very preterm, preterm and term infant groups. The effects of post-term age and gestational age at birth (very preterm, preterm or term) were determined using two-way ANOVA within each sleep state and position. Results: Systolic BP was lower in very preterm (p < 0.01) and preterm (p < 0.05) infants compared to term infants in QS and lower in very preterm compared to term infants in AS (p < 0.05) in the prone position at 2-3 months CA. There was no effect of gestational age at birth on systolic BP at any other age. There was no effect of gestational age at birth on HP at any age. BRS was lower in the prone position in very preterm infants at 2-4 weeks in AS (p < 0.05). Maturation of BRS was delayed in very preterm compared to preterm and term infants. Conclusions: Maturation of BRS after term-equivalent age is altered in very preterm infants. Although this is unlikely to contribute to increased SIDS risk, it may predispose very preterm infants to cardiovascular disease in adulthood.

N2  - Background and aims Preterm birth with very low birth weight. Methods We studied the association of preterm birth with 24-hour ambulatory BP and variabilityof BP in 42 young adults (mean age 23.2y) born early preterm (=37 weeks) in Northern Finland population. Wake and sleep period were distinguished with accelerometry in 72.4% of subjects, and for others by time (awake 9 am-11 pm, sleep 01 am-07 am). Results Adults born early preterm had 5.6 mmHg (95% CI 1.9-9.3) higher 24-hour SBP, 2.9 mmHg (0.4-5.4) higher 24-hour DBP, 6.4 mmHg (2.8-10.1) higher awake SBP and 4.0 mmHg (0.4-7.5) higher sleep DBP when adjusted for age, sex and use of an accelerometer. Adults born early preterm had also higher within-subject standard deviation (SD) of 24-hour SBP and DBP, awake SBP and DBP and sleep DBP (Figure). Also adults born late preterm had higher SD of 24-hour DBP and sleep SBP and DBP when adjusted for age, sex and use of an accelometer. When adjusted for maternal BMI, smoking during pregnancy and hypertensive pregnancy disorder, parental education, subject's height and BMI, physical activity and smoking, the results were somewhat attenuated. Mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (error balls) in mean (mmHg) and SD (mmHg) of ambulatory blood pressure measurement between adults early and late preterm compared to controls (zero line) adjusted for age, sex and use height and BMI, smoking during pregnancy and hypertensive pregnancy disorder, parental education, subject's height and BMI, physical activity and smoking. Conclusions Higher 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and variability of BP may indicate that adults born early preterm are in greater risk for later cardiovascular outcomes. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains an important cause of infant death, particularly amongst infants born preterm. Prone sleeping is the major risk factor for SIDS and it has recently been shown that prone sleeping alters cerebrovascular control in term infants. As preterm infants are at greater risk for SIDS, we hypothesised that cerebrovascular control would be reduced in preterm infants in the prone position and in preterm compared to term infants. Methods: 35 preterm (mean gestation 31.2 ± 0.4 wk) and 17 term (mean gestation 40.1 ± 0.3 wk) infants. Infants underwent daytime polysomnography at 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months and 5-6 months postterm corrected age (CA). Infants slept both prone and supine and were presented with cardiovascular challenges in the form of 15° head-up tilts (HUT). Cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) was recorded (NIRO- 200 spectrophotometer, Hamamatsu Photonics KK, Japan) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was recorded using a Finometer™ cuff (Finapress Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The percentage change for cerebral TOI and MAP following each HUT, with the baseline being the 30 beats preceding each HUT was calculated. The effect of sleep position and preterm birth on baseline data was determined using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Student- Newman Keuls post-hoc analysis. Results: Preterm infants had lower baseline MAP compared to term infants in both sleep states in the prone position at 2-3 months CA (p < 0.05 for both). Cerebral TOI was significantly lower in preterm compared to term infants in both sleep states and positions at 2-4 weeks CA (p < 0.01 for all) and in both sleep states in the prone position at 2-3 months CA (p < 0.05 for both). In the prone position TOI increased following the HUT, in contrast to no change seen in the supine position. The response of TOI to HUT was similar but more variable in preterm compared to term infants. Conclusions: Cerebrovascular control is altered in the prone position in preterm infants. Whilst overall the response to HUT was similar between term and preterm infants, greater variability in preterm infants suggests persistent immaturity of cerebrovascular control which may contribute to their increased risk of SIDS.

N2  - Introduction: Asthma has well-described associations with both circadian rhythm abnormalities and exposure to maternal smoking. Clock genes including nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D member 1 (NR1D1) and retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (ROR alpha) modulate immune function (J.E. Gibbs et al., PNAS, 2012; N. Acevedo et al, PLOS ONE, 2013). Tobacco exposure alters clock gene expression in adult mice (H. Hadden et al., J. Appl. Physiology, 1985), but has not been extensively investigated in neonates. We hypothesized that tobacco toxin exposure during development via maternal smoking would cause abnormalities in clock gene expression in the offspring. We tested this hypothesis in a murine model of prenatal cigarette smoke exposure. Methods: Adult female C56Bl/6 mice were exposed to 3 cigarettes daily, 5 days per week, throughout pregnancy. Lung tissue from the offspring was harvested at postnatal day 14 (P14), the RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. We used qPCR (endogenous control = 18S) to examine the mRNA expression of aryl hydrolase nuclear translocator (Bmal1), ROR alpha, and NR1D1. Controls were tobacco-naïve P14 mice. For both tobacco toxin-exposed and naïve mice, lung tissue was examined from mice euthanized at 11 AM, noon, and 2 PM (N ≥3 for each group at each time point). For each gene, expression was additionally related to the circadian rhythm expression pattern by comparison to the expression of circadian albumin D binding protein (Dbp). Student's t-test was used to compare differences between groups. Results: Tobacco toxin exposure via maternal smoking significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the mRNA for both NR1D1 and Dbp in the lungs of juvenile mice at P14 at the 11AM time point. Moreover, maternal smoking caused a significant (P < 0.05) alteration in the circadian expression pattern (gene expression compared to Dbp expression) for both ROR alpha and NR1D1 at the 11AM and noon time points. In contrast, Bmal1 expression showed only trends toward decreased expression in the tobacco toxin-exposed mice. Conclusions: We conclude that maternal smoking causes abnormalities in the expression of clock genes in the lung tissue of the offspring, and disrupts the diurnal expression pattern of these genes. These changes are dynamically regulated, with substantial differences within tobacco exposure groups noted over a three-hour sampling period. The abnormalities in clock gene expression pattterns persist well into the postnatal period. We speculate that disruption of clock genes may modulate effects of maternal smoking in the offspring, including increased asthma risk.

N2  - Background Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) occurs less frequently in the first month of life, peaks between 2 and 4 months of age, and decreases thereafter. Prone sleeping (placing an infant to sleep on his/her stomach), bed sharing, parents not sleeping in the same room as the infant, an infant not using a pacifier during sleep, overheating, and maternal smoking during pregnancy have been suggested as contributing factors for SIDS. Aim To examine SIDS in low birth weight infants. Methods Compilation. Results Infants who are born prematurely or who have low birthweight have up to four times the risk of SIDS than those infants born at term, and this risk increases with decreasing gestational age or birthweight. Low birth weight infants have a significantly higher risk of SIDS, a risk tightly correlated with prematurity. High SIDS incidence among low birth weight, very low birth weight, and extremely low birth weight infants persists despite increased overall survival within these infant populations. As a result, an increase in SIDS deaths could be expected in the lower birth weight infants because of the decreased competing mortality pressures during the neonatal period. In low birth weight and normal birth weight infants, we would anticipate a less marked increase in survival and, because of their increased maturity, a less apparent effect on SIDS rates. Conclusion Parents of low birth weight infants require appropriate SIDS prevention education, including information about the dangers of environmental tobacco exposure and prone infant sleep.

N2  - Introduction: Objective: To assess the efficacy of modafinil on fatigue in patients with Chronic Hepatitis C. Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is present in about 8% of the veteran population. Fatigue accompanies HCV infection in 53%-67% of patients and is sufficiently severe enough to impair activity in 17%. Modafinil is a unique wake-promoting agent that has been found to be effective in the treatment of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. Methods: Patients aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of HCV and mean score >27 on the fatigue severity scale (FSS) were eligible for the randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial. Exclusion criteria included hemoglobin <12, total bilirubin >2, uncontrolled diabetes with HBA1c >8, congestive heart failure with EF <35%, malignancy, or pregnancy. Patients received either placebo or 100 mg of modafinil for 2 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated with self-rating scales: fatigue severity scale (FSS) [score= 9-63], Epworth sleep scale (ESS) [score=0-24], and CES-D depression scale [score=0-60]. Change scores were calculated as pre-score minus post-score. Adverse events were also recorded. The independent samples t-test was used to compare groups on change scores. Results: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 4 were lost to follow-up. Eleven patients received modafinil and 10 received placebo. Ten patients in each group completed all outcome measures. No significant improvement in fatigue, sleep, or depression was demonstrated. FSS decreased 7.4 for the modafinil group (pre=50.2, post=42.8) vs. 6.4 for the placebo group (pre=48.9, post 42.5) [p=0.87]. ESS decreased 2.5 for the modafinil group (pre=12.3, post=9.8) vs. 0.8 for the placebo group (pre=10.9, post 10.1) [p=0.38]. CES-D decreased 5.35 for the modafinil group (pre=24.0, post=18.65) vs. 1.9 for the placebo group (pre=25.4, post 23.5) [p=0.36]. Serious adverse events were not found. The most common adverse events were headache and nausea. Conclusion: While 100 mg modafinil daily did not improve fatigue, sleep, or depression compared to placebo, our study was an exploratory study with limited power (n=10 for each group). We showed the feasibility of such a study (i.e., low dropout rate and no serious adverse events) and recommend a future investigation with a larger sample to determine the effectiveness of modafinil to reduce fatigue in HCV patients. The lack of improvement in fatigue in the modafinil group may have also been due to lower dose of modafinil used.

N2  - Introduction We report an unusual case of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in a child with Down syndrome characterized by life threatening episodes of hypoxemic respiratory failure, that was later diagnosed as an auto-immune disease. Case DB is a 12 year old Native Canadian boy with Down syndrome, who was born at 34 weeks gestation but had no previous cardio-respiratory problems. He initially presented with a brief history of cough and fever and developed severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. Chest x-ray showed diffuse airspace and interstitial infiltrates and he improved with high flow oxygen and antibiotics. Six months later, he re-presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV). CT chest showed bilateral air space opacities, diffuse ground glass changes, extensive cystic changes and interstitial thickening. Echocardiogram was normal. Alveolar lavage was negative for infectious agents, hemosiderin, lipid laden macrophages and PAS staining. A lung biopsy showed diffuse airspace enlargement, interstitial fibrosis and no evidence of vasculitis. There were abundant plasma and lymphocytic interstitial infiltrates with the overall pattern suggestive of an autoimmune disease. He deteriorated post operatively and improved with intravenous steroids and NIV. Further history revealed no travel, no infectious contacts, and remote exposure to rats. Investigations showed a normal immune workup, negative auto-antibodies except for a positive ANA and negative rat precipitins. Over the ensuing months, he developed poly-articular arthritis affecting his small joints and is now rheumatoid factor positive. A repeat CT scan shows persistent marked cystic changes (Fig 1). He has had two further episodes of hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring NIV and is now maintained on monthly pulses of steroids, methotrexate and azithromycin. Discussion Children with trisomy 21 present with respiratory issues commonly due to underlying cardiac abnormalities, recurrent infections, aspiration, and sleep disordered breathing. Cystic lung disease, typically asymptomatic sub-pleural blebs, is also described in up to 30% of children1. Trisomy 21 is the most common chromosomal condition associated with interstitial lung disease and is classified as an alveolar growth abnormality and often presents early in life2. Although children with Down syndrome are at increased risk of autoimmune disease, this is the first case presenting with ILD secondary to an autoimmune process. It highlights the importance of identifying the cause of respiratory issues as the respiratory symptoms can be the first presentation of a systemic disease.

N2  - Background and aims Temperament in very preterm infants (VPI) has been rarely studied. We used a short version of the Bates Infant Characteristic Questionnaire (ICQ) to explore maternal reported child difficultness in an area-based cohort of Italian VPI. Methods Study population included 1196 infants (response rate 85%). A medical examination was carried out to assess infants' health and presence of disabilities. A postal maternal questionnaire was used to measure development and temperament. We used the sections corresponding to 'Fussy-difficult' and 'Unadaptable', with 12 items rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale. Higher scores indicate more problematic temperament. Statistical analysis included factor analysis and calculation of Cronbach alpha. To assess validity, comparisons with sleep and eating problems reported by mothers independently from ICQ were carried out. Results For this study only singletons born from Italian mothers were considered (n. 586); 55% were males, and 21% were below 28 weeks gestation. Forty infants (7%) had at least one severe disability. Mean ICQ score was 34.1 (SD 10.1), and median 33 (range 13-69). Factor loadings were comparable to the original English version, and internal consistency was satisfactory (alpha 0.88 for fussy-difficult and 0.71 for Unadaptable). Infants with difficulties getting to sleep, frequent night awakenings, and 'picky eaters' had significantly higher ICQ scores (p values <0.01). Conclusion The short version of the ICQ may represent a quick and easily administered tool for the identification of difficult temperament traits in clinical and research settings.

N2  - The novel high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods combined with modern sample preparation procedures for determination of neopterin, kynurenine, tryptophan and creatinine were developed and validated. The methods can be used for determination of target analytes in various human fluids as urine, serum, amniotic fluid, exudate and wound liquids to monitor immune response, progression of the disease and therapy response. Introduction: Neopterin, unconjugated pteridine derivate, is produced in significant quantities by human monocyte-macrophages after stimulation with interferon gamma. It represents a useful and important parameter to monitor the activation of the immune system that accompanies many diseases. Elevated levels of neopterin in serum and urine were found in different pathological situations: nephrotic syndrome, autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, acute myocardial infarction and many other diseases (1). Recently, some authors combine neopterin with intracellular oxidative stress and it is described as a possible link to apoptosis (2). Kynurenine is one of the main metabolites of amino acid tryptophan. Activated catabolism of tryptophan was observed in diseases associated with activation of the immune system, such as infection, autoimmune and malignant diseases. Studies show that increased tryptophan catabolism contributes to the modulation of oxidative stress in tissues and changes in the stimulation of glutamate receptors. This phenomenon occurs especially in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, during attacks of epilepsy and sclerosis multiplex. The serum kynurenine levels significantly increased in patients treated with hemodialysis. The kynurenine/tryptophan ratio correlates with disease progression in lung cancer (3), while high kynurenine levels were observed in multiple trauma patients (4) etc. Kynurenine also affects thermoregulation and sleep and significantly increases during pregnancy. The kynurenine /tryptophan ratio always correlates with neopterin levels (4-6). Development of the new methods for determination of these biomarkers can lead to better diagnostic capabilities and also can improve treatment of serious diseases and care of individual patients. One of the suitable techniques for analysis is HPLC, routinely used in all types of analytical laboratories. The main advantages are its ability to separation, identification and quantification of substances of different structure in a wide concentration range during a single analysis with high sensitivity and automation possibilities. Also, another important part of analysis is sample preparation procedure, which is fundamental for the analysis of biological material. Its implementation depends on the overall success of the analytical determination - both in qualitative as well as quantitative terms. Combination of new HPLC trends with modern sample preparation techniques is one of the main principles of the method development in the Research Laboratory of the 3rd Internal Gerontometabolic Clinic, University Hospital Hradec Králové. Results: Three novel HPLC methods for determination of neopterin, kynurenine, tryptophan and creatinine in various biological fluids were developed and validated. Separation was achieved by modern stationary phases as: hybrid particular stationary phase, monolith of 2nd generation - High Resolution and connection of two monoliths. Fast sample preparation procedure was provided by microtitration plates. Target analytes (Figure) were determined in urine, serum, amniotic fluid and in wounds. Determination of neopterin, kynurenine and tryptophan in different biological liquids can provide deeper knowledge about: (i) prognosis of various diseases and efficiency of the treatment (urine), (ii) rejection after kidney transplantation, as well as progression of kidney diseases and effectiveness of their treatment (serum), (iii) maturation of pteridine metabolism in the fetus (amniotic fluid), (iv) prognosis of tuberculosis (pleural fluid) and (v) immune system activity and response to therapy directly in affected place, which allows to predict exactly the progress of the disease at early stagesd (exudates, ascites, wound). Discussion: The results could contribute to increased knowledge about the immune system activation in serious diseases. This fact will help to increase the effectiveness of existing schemes in therapy. In addition, the newly developed methods can be used to get closer knowledge in clinical practice to identify the optimal therapeutic strategy for the treatment of high-risk patients (elderly, diabetics, cancer patients, etc.).

N2  - Fetal movements (FM) related heart rate accelerations (AC) are an important maturation criterion. Since Doppler-based time resolution is not sufficient for accompanying heart rate variability analysis, the work is aimed at a comprehensive FM-AC analysis using magnetocardiographic recordings from fetuses during sleep.We identify FM and AC by independent component analysis and automatic recognition algorithms. We investigate associations between FM and AC of different magnitude by means of event coincidence and time series cross-correlation over the maturation period of 21-40 weeks of gestation (WGA).FM related AC appear with increasing AC magnitude and WGA. Vice versa, AC related FM appear independent of WGA, but more frequently with increasing AC amplitude. The FM-AC correlation exists already at 21 WGA and further increases with WGA while the variability of its time delay decreases. Hence, FM and AC are clearly associated over the whole investigated maturation period. The increase of FM related AC runs parallel to the increasing AC magnitude.The MCG methodology was confirmed and results from previous Doppler-based analyses reproduced. Hence, MCG recordings allow the collective analysis of heart rate variability based maturation indices and FM related AC. This synergism may improve the diagnosis of fetal developmental disorders.

N2  - Background: Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) has persistent high rates in deprived indigenous communities and much of this mortality is attributable to unsafe sleep environments. Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Maori community in New Zealand has reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device. Methods/Design: This two arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from Maori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related) touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal sleep patterns. Discussion: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken worldwide.

N2  - The mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and their intrinsic rhythmicity develop gradually during ontogenesis. In the rat, the SCN forms between embryonic day (E) 14 and E17, with gestation terminating at E21-22. Overt SCN rhythmicity is already present in the late embryonic stage. The aim of the present study was to determine when the fetal SCN clock develops in vivo and whether overt rhythmicity results from a functional fetal clock. To achieve this goal, the prenatal development of rhythmic expression of clock genes was measured with a more sensitive method for detection of the clock gene expression than previously. Fetal SCN were collected at 3 h intervals during the 24 h period on E19 and E21 by laser dissection and expression of clock genes (Per2, Nr1d1 and Bmal1) and genes related to cellular activity (c-fos, Avp and Vip) was measured by qRT PCR. At E19, the expression of canonical clock genes Per2 and Bmal1 was not rhythmic; however, the expression of all other studied genes followed clear circadian rhythms. At E21, Per2 and Bmal1 expression exhibited low amplitude but significant rhythmicity. From E19 to E21, the levels of the non-rhythmic transcripts (Per2 and Bmal1) decreased; however, the levels of the rhythmic transcripts (Nr1d1, c-fos, Avp and Vip) increased. In summary, these data demonstrate that at E19, rhythms in Per2 and Bmal1 expression were absent in the fetal SCN; however, the expression of Nr1d1 and other genes related to cellular activity was driven rhythmically. Therefore, at the early stage in vivo, the developing fetal SCN clock could theoretically be entrained by oscillation of Nr1d1 which may be driven by the maternal rather than fetal circadian system.

N2  - Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, resulting in a pressing need to identify risk factors leading to effective interventions. Limited evidence suggests potential relationships between maternal sleep or vital exhaustion and preterm birth, yet the literature is generally inconclusive.Methods: We examined the relationship between maternal sleep duration and vital exhaustion in the first six months of pregnancy and spontaneous (non-medically indicated) preterm birth among 479 Peruvian women who delivered a preterm singleton infant (<37 weeks gestation) and 480 term controls who delivered a singleton infant at term (≥37 weeks gestation). Maternal nightly sleep and reports of vital exhaustion were ascertained through in-person interviews. Spontaneous preterm birth cases were further categorized as those following either spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. In addition, cases were categorized as very (<32 weeks), moderate (32-33 weeks), and late (34- <37 weeks) preterm birth for additional analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: After adjusting for confounders, we found that short sleep duration (≤6 hours) was significantly associated with preterm birth (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.19) compared to 7-8 hours of sleep. Vital exhaustion was also associated with increased odds of preterm birth (aOR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.79-3.23) compared to no exhaustion (Ptrend <0.001). These associations remained significant for spontaneous preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. We also found evidence of joint effects of sleep duration and vital exhaustion on the odds of spontaneous preterm birth.Conclusions: The results of this case-control study suggest maternal sleep duration, particularly short sleep duration, and vital exhaustion may be risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. These findings call for increased clinical attention to maternal sleep and the study of potential intervention strategies to improve sleep in early pregnancy with the aim of decreasing risk of preterm birth.

N2  - Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is transmitted by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei to humans by tsetse flies. HAT occurs in two stages, the second of which, the neurologic stage, when the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier, leads to serious sleep cycle disruptions, paralysis, progressive mental deterioration, and ultimately results in death without effective treatment. Existing therapies have poor safety profiles, difficult treatment regimens and limited effectiveness. DNDi is therefore aiming to develop an orally administered drug which is effective in both stages of the disease and safe in the whole population, including women in childbearing age and children. DNDi, Anacor Pharmaceuticals and Scynexis have developed SCYX-7158, an orally active clinical drug candidate, belonging to a unique boron-based chemical class, the oxaboroles. Here we present results of a full, ICH-compliant package of reproductive toxicology studies including effects on male and female fertility, mating behavior, developmental toxicity and peri/postnatal development which involved maternal, pup and milk toxicokinetics. NOEL for dams during pregnancy and lactation was set at 15 mg/kg/day which gave a Cmax of 11,300 ng/mL and anAUC0-t (last) of 507,000 ng h/mL on Lactation Day 21. At this dose, duration of gestation, physiology of parturition, rat embryofetal development in utero and pup survival were unaffected by treatment. Pup development during lactation and post-weaning development and behavior, including the reproductive performance of the F1 generation were also unaffected despite having determined that SCYX-7158 was secreted in maternal milk. These data corroborate the good safety profile of SCYX-7158 already demonstrated in non-pregnant animals.

N2  - Intrauterine infection or inflammation in preterm neonates is a known risk for adverse neurological outcomes, including cognitive, motor and behavioral disabilities. Our previous data suggest that there is acute fetal brain inflammation in a mouse model of intrauterine exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We hypothesized that the in utero inflammation induced by LPS produces long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the exposed mice that could be determined by using continuous quantitative video/EEG/electromyogram (EMG) analyses. A single LPS injection at E17 was performed in pregnant CD1 dams. Control dams were injected with same volumes of saline (LPS n= 10, Control n= 8). At postnatal age of P90-100, 24-h synchronous video/EEG/EMG recordings were done using a tethered recording system and implanted subdural electrodes. Behavioral state scoring was performed blind to treatment group, on each 10. s EEG epoch using synchronous video, EMG and EEG trace signatures to generate individual hypnograms. Automated EEG power spectrums were analyzed for delta and theta-beta power ratios during wake vs. sleep cycles. Both control and LPS hypnograms showed an ultradian wake/sleep cycling. Since rodents are nocturnal animals, control mice showed the expected diurnal variation with significantly longer time spent in wake states during the dark cycle phase. In contrast, the LPS-treated mice lost this circadian rhythm. Sleep microstructure also showed significant alteration in the LPS mice specifically during the dark cycle, caused by significantly longer average non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycle durations. No significance was found between treatment groups for the delta power data; however, significant activity-dependent changes in theta-beta power ratios seen in controls were absent in the LPS-exposed mice. In conclusion, exposure to in utero inflammation in CD1 mice resulted in significantly altered sleep architecture as adults that were circadian cycle and activity state dependent. © 2014 IBRO.

N2  - Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasingly a concern for a risk factor of poor pregnancy outcomes. However, to date, most research studies have relied on subjective research such as Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Therefore, our research design used polysomnography, which is an objective measurement to define OSA in pregnancy. The study aimed to measure the incidence of OSA in pregnancy, to reveal clinical examination which will be objective screening tool for OSA in pregnancy, and prove that OSA is a risk factor of poor pregnancy outcomes. Methods: Fifty healthy pregnant women who received antenatal care at Chiangmai University Hospital during October 2012 through April 2013 were measured by physical examination and polysomnography at GA 28th to 32nd weeks, and followed until the end of pregnancy to see the difference of poor pregnancy outcomes in OSA and non-OSA group. Results: The incidence of OSA in pregnancy was 12%. OSA related to more overall poor pregnancy outcomes (relative risk [RR] = 5.86 [2.16-15.96], P = .007), more preterm labor (RR = 19.33 [3.89-220.79], P < .001), and more preeclampsia (RR = n/a, P = .012). Friedman tongue position (FTP) equal or more than gr III was considered the screening tool for OSA in pregnancy, which yielded 66.7% sensitivity and 84.1% specificity. Conclusions: OSA could lead to a high-risk pregnancy, which should be screened by multidisciplinary teams, to establish diagnosis and treatment for maternal and child health.

N2  - Introduction: We recently demonstrated that the intrarenal circadian molecular clockwork is already operational at the end of intrauterine development and may facilitate the postnatal adaptation of homeostatic processes controlled by the kidney. Here, we sought to explore the impact of different patterns of maternal light cues during pregnancy on the integrity of the late fetal renal circadian clockwork and key clockcontrolled genes. Material and methods: Pregnant rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups. The rats were fed ad-libitum under 12h:12h light-dark cycles (LD), constant light (LL), constant darkness (DD), or 3h:21h light-dark cycles (3:21LD). Mothers (6-10 per group) with their offspring were sacrificed at 4-h intervals one day before the expected delivery. Intrarenal circadian gene expression patterns were profiled by real-time PCR for the canonical clock genes Clock, Per2 and Rev-erbα and the clock-controlled genes NHE3, αENaC, SGK1, and AVPR2. Results: Kidneys of fetuses with maternal LD exposure displayed circadian expression of all investigated genes [Clock (p=0.008), Rev-erbα (p=0.014), Per2 (p=0.014), NHE3 (p<0.001), αENaC (p<0.001), SGK1 (p=0.017), and AVPR2 (p=0.003)]. Fetuses with maternal LL exposure exhibited robust circadian expression with phases similar to those observed at LD [Clock (p=0.004), Rev-erbα (p=0.027), Per2 (p<0.001), NHE3 (p<0.001), αENaC (p<0.001), SGK1 (p<0.001), AVPR2 (p=0.022)]. In contrast, circadian fluctuations of gene expression were completely absent in fetuses with maternal DD exposure. In pups whose mothers were exposed to short rest period cycles (3:21LD), the circadian rhythmicity of Per2 and Rev-erbα were lost and a distinct phase shift was seen for Clock and the clock-controlled genes. Conclusions: Our findings confirm that the circadian clock network becomes operational even before birth. Oscillatory gene expression in the developing kidney is affected differentially by different alterations of the light-dark cycle during gestation. Hence, asynchronous light exposure during pregnancy might affect immediate postnatal kidney functions.

N2  - One of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It is diagnosed in the 5th to 7th decade and is common in males. ALS in women of childbearing age and coexisting pregnancy is uncommon. We would like to describe the first reported case in which non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was acutely initiated in a pregnant patient with ALS Case report A 25-year-old patient, G2P1, had complaints of speech, swallowing difficulty and tiredness that she credited to her pregnancy. She later developed weakness in her right arm and sought consultation. Physical exam revealed myopathic facies, dysarthria, tongue atrophy and fasciculation, weakness in neck flexor and right arm muscles. After two months ALS was diagnosed. Fetal development was uncomplicated. At her first visit to the respiratory department at 32 weeks of gestation, she had no pulmonary complaints. Examination revealed weak cough capacity, peripheral saturation 98% (room air) and decreased forced vital capacity (42% of predicted). Transcutaneous CO2 and O2 measurement was normal during sleep. Four days later she was admitted with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea and respiratory exhaustion. NIV with oronasal mask was acutely initiated and well tolerated despite poor bulbar function. Due to rapid deterioration a caesarian section was performed under NIV and spinal anesthesia. Intubation and total anesthesia with was averted. A healthy male baby was born. Postoperative NIV could be weaned slowly to only nighttime use and she was discharged with domiciliary NIV. Conclusion Acute NIV in pregnant ALS patient with respiratory distress could be safely initiated.

N2  - Objectives: The frequency of snoring increases from 7.9% during the 1st trimester to 21.2% during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. This increase is associated with sleepiness, higher initial BMI and higher prevalence of edema, but not with weight gain during pregnancy. Self-reported snoring is a surrogate of upper airway flow limitation which can be objectively measured with nasal prongs and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcCO2) monitor. Our aim was to characterize the patterns and occurrence of sleep-induced upper airway flow limitation during normal pregnancy. Methods: Sixteen healthy women went through a standard polygraphic sleep recording in a sleep laboratory when pregnant for 31- 33 weeks. The respiratory effort was monitored with thoracoabdominal belts, nasal airflow with nasal pressure cannula and the gas exchange with pulse oximeter and transcutaneous carbon dioxide. Results: Severe continuous flow-limitation with tcCO2 increases was observed in 3/16 (19%) women. A new, previously undescribed pattern of oscillating flow limitation with transient tcCO2 changes occurred in 9/16 (56%) women. Overall, 75% of women presented with sleep-induced upper airway flow-limitation with tcCO2 changes. Conclusions: Pregnancy markedly predisposes to upper airway flow-limitation during sleep, which may affect maternal or fetal wellbeing. Flow limitation during sleep may also play a role in the previously described associations between habitual snoring, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy-associated sleep disorder is a new category on the latest version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. It is a significant problem for pregnant women.
PURPOSE: The present follow-up study assesses the association between sleep quality during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and obstetric-neonatal outcomes.
METHODS: A prospective follow-up study design was used. Follow-up examination of the obstetric birth records in the immediate postpartum period were carried out on 128 second-trimester and 120 third-trimester women and their newborns in two hospitals in Taiwan. Poor sleep quality was identified using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were collected from October 2007 to June 2008.
RESULTS: The prevalence of poor sleepers (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score > 5) was 58% for second-trimester participants and 66% for third-trimester participants; participants who were unemployed reported a significantly higher prevalence of poor sleep quality than those who were employed. Subsequent review of the participant's obstetric birth records revealed that third-trimester poor sleepers were more likely to have had a vacuum-assisted delivery.
CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study identified poor sleep quality during the third trimester as a novel risk factor for vacuum-assisted delivery. We suggest that prenatal healthcare providers focus greater attention to the sleep disturbance condition of pregnant women and provide proactive sleep counseling to facilitate pregnant women's adjustment to the new psychosocial and physiological demands of motherhood.

N2  - Objectives: To determine if sleep duration at 3 years predicts body composition at 4 years of age. Methods: Southampton Women's Survey is a population-based cohort study of 12 583 women aged 20-34 years. Children born to those who subsequently became pregnant (n = 3159) were followed up. Mothers reported their child's total 24 h sleep time at age 3 years. Fat, bone and lean mass were derived using dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) at age 4 years in a subset of children. The relationship between sleep and body composition was assessed in multiple regression analyses with adjustment for maternal education, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, child's age, sex, height at DXA, age last breastfed, dietary quality at 3 years, TV watching and hours actively on the move. Results: Mean 24 h sleep duration of the 898 children (475 boys) who had a DXA scan was 11.5 h. Shorter sleep duration was associated with higher BMI (β = -0.2366 kg/m2 per hour, 95% CI -0.3724, -0.1007) and fat mass (β = -0.1188 kg per hour, 95% CI -0.2288, -0.0089), but also with lean mass (β = -0.1287 kg per hour, 95% CI -0.2142, -0.0434) and total bone mineral density (β = -0.0039 kg per hour, 95% CI -0.0075, -0.0004). Conclusions: We confirm previous findings that shorter sleep in early childhood predicts greater BMI and fat mass but also report novel findings that shorter sleep predicts greater lean and bone mass. Our data suggest that the inverse relationship between sleep and BMI is not determined by adiposity alone.

N2  - Objectives: The effect of age on sleep stages, the spectral composition of NREM sleep and sleep microstructure was investigated in a large sample of women. Methods: Ambulant PSG recordings were obtained on one occasion in 400 non-pregnant women that were randomly selected from a representative sample (oversampling of snorers). Subjects with incomplete data, severe somatic disease or being on drugs that might interfere with sleep architecture were excluded. Thus, 245 women (age: 49 ± 11.1, range 22- 72 years) were included in the present analyses. Sleep scoring, spectral analysis and microstructure analysis (C3-A2) were conducted using automatic analysis and verified manually by a sleep scoring expert. AHI was based upon visual scoring. Linear regressions analyses (adjusted for AHI) with age (continuous) as predictor were conducted. Results: Age was associated with decreases of Total Sleep Time (η2 0.09), time in N2 (η2 0.02), N3 (η2 0.03), REM sleep (η2 0.08), and delta power (log transformed) during NREM sleep (η2 0.04). No significant effect on beta power during NREM sleep and REM density was observed. Spindle density (η2 0.12) and K-complexes (log transformed) (η2 0.11) showed a linear decrease by age. Similar results were obtained when only subjects with non-severe AHI were included. Conclusions: Increasing age was as expected associated with decreased sleep time, which was mostly due to decreased REM duration whereas REM density was not altered. The decrease in sleep spindles and K-complexes during N2 sleep presumably indicates a decrement of sleep protective mechanisms with increasing age.

N2  - Objectives: Women complain more of sleep than do men, but little is known about the relation to the macro- and microstructure of sleep and how age affect this relation. This was the topic of the present study. Methods: Ambulatory polysomnographical (PSG) recordings were obtained in a representative sample of 400 non-pregnant women (oversampling of snorers) and analysed through automatic analysis and manually verified. Subjective sleep quality ratings (poor, rather poor, average, good, very good sleep) at awakening after recording and age (cutoff 50? years) were related to PSG-derived data using a two-factor ANOVA (300 participants after exclusions). Results: Good subjective sleep and lower age were associated with higher sleep efficiency (91 ± 2 vs. 83 ± 2% for young participants and 85 ± 2 vs. 72 ± 2% for older participants) and less: WASO, changes from sleep to Stage wake, and Stage changes/h). Stage 1% increased with poor sleep (no age effect). Number of sleep spindles increased with poor sleep in young subjects only, while K-complexes and spectral data (delta, theta, beta power in NREM or REM) were not related to sleep quality. Also total sleep time was significantly lower with poor sleep and higher age (418 vs. 373 min for young participants and 386 vs. 328 min for older participants. Conclusions: Good sleep quality is related to more sleep continuity in a large, representative group of women, although the criteria decrease with age; older women need less continuity for sleep being labeled as 'good' (or poor).

N2  - Objectives: The management of narcolepsy during pregnancy is still unclear and puzzling. Oral L-Carnitine was recently demonstrated effective in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy patients. Moreover, L-Carnitine therapy present no contraindications during pregnancy and could be advantageous. We test oral LCarnitine treatment in a narcoleptic patient during pregnancy. Methods: Oral L-carnitine therapy titrated up to 500 mg b.i.d was administered to a narcolepsy patient during pregnancy. Subjective and objective daytime sleepiness were assessed after conception and before L-Carnitine treatment as well as at the end of the second trimester,by means of Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). Results: The patient was diagnosed as affected by narcolepsy without cataplexy when she was 25-year old. She was successfully treated with modafinil. Since she manifested the need to be pregnant modafinil was slowly withdrawn. After conception patient complained severe sleepiness. Her ESS was 19 and MSLT documented a mean sleep latency (MSL) of 4.2 min and three sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs). Therefore, patient started oral L-Carnitine treatment titrated up to 500 mg b.i.d. Patient well tolerated therapy and referred a progressive improvement of sleepiness. At the end of the second trimester ESS was 14 and MSLT showed a MSL of 16 min without SOREMPs. Conclusions: The management of narcolepsy during pregnancy is still debated. We report the first patient successfully treated with oral L-Carnitine during pregnancy. The safe profile of L-Carnitine in pregnancy should induce to evaluate its efficacy in large controlled studies.

N2  - Background and aims: There is growing evidence suggesting than type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep breathing disorders. However, it is unknown whether or not these sleep disturbances affect the structure of sleep. Materials and methods: For this purpose we designed a case-control study between 28 patients with T2DM and 56 non-diabetic subjects, closely matched by age, gender, BMI, waist and neck circumferences, and smoking status. Subjects were also matched for their apnea-hypopnea index (IAH) [31.2 (1.0 to 106.3) vs 33.9 (1.2 to 109.1) events per hour, p=0.924]. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examination included a electroencephalography and respiratory polysomnography, as well as oxygen saturation measures and the degree of sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Studies with less than 5 hours of correct signal recording were ruled out. Results: No differences in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep (13.5±8.2 vs. 12.8±7.4 % of total time of sleep, p=0.689) nor in the Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) Sleep stages (stage 1: 18.6±12.4 vs. 15.1±13.0 %TTS, p=0.243; satge 2: 58.1±14.0 vs. 59.3±12.5 %TTS, p=0.688; stage 3: 12.5±10.5 vs. 12.3±10.2 %TTS, p=0.924; stage 4: 13.8±10.8 vs. 12.4±10.4 %TTS, p=0.594) were observed between subjects with and without T2DM. However, T2DM patients showed a higher number of microaurousals (or brief awakenings) events than control subjects [34.1 (4.6 to 101.4) vs. 22.7 (1.3 to 93.1) events per hour during the total time of sleep, p=0.023]. A significant positive correlation between microarousals and the AHI was detected (r=0.807, p<0.001). Finally, a stepwise regression analysis showed that both the AIH and the presence (or not) of T2DM (but not gender, age, BMI, neither neck circumference) independently predicted microarousals (R2=0.593). Conclusion: T2DM adversely affects structure of sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for higher rates of microarousals. As sleep fragmentation has been involved with increased levels of lipids and blood pressure, this increased rate of microarousals may be implicated in the progression of cardiovascular disease in T2DM.

N2  - Dysfunction of the serotonin system is involved in sleep and emotional disorders. Because serotonin (5-HT) has a facilitating role in development, the question arises about the long term impact of a serotonergic dysfunction in early life. Indeed, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly used pharmacological treatment for depression, and there is mounting concern about their effects on the developing foetus in treated depressed pregnant women. In fact, such SSRI treatments often cause sleep and behavioural disorders in the infant but there are no data about their long-term effects, i.e., until adolescence/adulthood. In animal models, transient neonatal exposure to SSRIs (fluoxetine or escitalopram) induces in the progeny a life-long depression-like phenotype in the form of sleep anomalies, anhedonia, increased helplessness and enhanced response to acute stress. We have shown that these alterations: 1- depend on the functional status of 5- HT1A receptors that is disrupted by the SSRIs and: 2- can be prevented by augmenting the neonatal SSRI treatment with a 5-HT1A receptor blocker, pindolol. Interestingly in adult depressed patients, pindolol increases the therapeutic action of SSRIs, suggesting that it might be possible in pregnant mothers to augment the SSRI treatment with 5-HT1A compounds that would both prevent the deleterious effects of SSRI on the progeny and increase the antidepressant therapeutic efficacy.

N2  - Objectives: DNA methylation is one of the key epigenetic mechanisms that mediate the effect of environment on gene expression. The aim of this study was to find out if impaired quality of maternal sleep during pregnancy leads to changes in methylation of the fetal genome and, eventually, to characterize the consequences of these changes for the child0s development. Methods: Our sample comprised 32 full-term newborn from the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. The DNA was extracted from umbilical cord blood collected at delivery and epigenotyped by the Illumina450K chip. We searched for changes in methylation of genome-wide distributed CpG sites in relation to subjective quality of maternal sleep during pregnancy ('How well have you been sleeping during the past month'), that was used as a continuous variable in analysis with R- Packages MINFI, IlluminaHumanMethylation450kmanifest and Limma. Pathway analyses were performed with the Ingenuity Systems. Results: The methylation level of eight sites in the fetal genome associated to mother0s quality of sleep at P < 1x10-4 (unadjusted), comprising genes involved in DNA synthesis and micro-RNA targeting. Pathway analysis for the sites with P < 1x10-3 showed enrichment of genes involved in Cell Death and Cellular Development (P < 5x10-5), Cellular Growth and Proliferation, and Cellular Development. Conclusions: This is to our knowledge the first study that relates mother0s sleep during pregnancy to the neonate0s genome-wide methylation. It seems plausible that poor maternal sleep quality during the fetal life could have an effect on developmental processes at cellular level during the very early development.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a public health issue. Pregnancy is associated with a high prevalence of OSA. However, the consequences of gestational OSA are unknown. We hypothesized that intermittent hypoxia (IH), characteristic of OSA, induces prenatal and neurodevelopmental abnormalities of cardiorespiratory and cognitive functions, which could be related to a systemic and tissue inflammation. Methods: A classic model of IH was applied to pregnant mice using 5% FiO2, 30 cycles /h,10 h/day, during the last 10 days of gestation. The IH model was characterized by monitoring transcutaneous oxygen saturation and the mothers' weight. The pups' evaluation consisted of daily weighing, measuring cardio respiratory parameters at basal state and during hypoxic and hypercapnic challenges at 5 and 12 days of age. Cognitive functions were evaluated by the object recognition test (ORT) at 60 days of age. Cytokine assays was performed in serum and tissue samples (Merck Millipore ®, Magpmag- 24k -Billerica, Massachusetts). Results: The IH induced oxygen desaturations and delayed weight gain in pregnant mice without showing inflammation. The study of IH exposed pups revealed 1 / transient respiratory anomalies such as an increase in basal normoxic ventilation (Ve, Ttot), 2 / a persistent growth retardation at all ages till 30 days and 3 / no differences in cognitive function. Discussion: These results are consistent with the current literature and suggest an impact of IH. The prospects inspired by our work are the study of the consequences of a less severe IH model, closer to human pathology.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort study is to define early development of sleep, and the effects of infant and parental sleep and family environment on the child's development. Methods: Altogether 1667 mothers and 1602 fathers from Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Finland, participated in the study during the last pregnancy weeks in 2011-13. Questionnaires were implemented prenatally for the parents and at 3, 8, and 24 months after the birth for the parents and the baby. During the delivery, cord blood sample of infants and parental blood or saliva samples were gathered for molecular genetic studies. The cohort included several subsamples: thesleepeducationgroup(n = 178particpantsand183controls),home polysomnography group (n = 88) and actigraphy group (n = 446). Results: Frequent difficulties in falling asleep, night wakings (3 or more per night), early morning awakenings, or subjective poor quality of sleep were present among 14%, 37%, 11%, and 27% of the mothers prenatally, and 8%, 44%, 8%, and 23% at the three months. The corresponding values for the fathers were 5%, 4%, 3% and 7% of the fathers prenatally, and 4%, 9%, 5% or 12%, at the three months. Conclusion: The preliminary data analysis shows that subjective quality of sleep improves slightly in mothers from prenatal period to 3 months of postnatal age, while the sleep quality of fathers deteriorates. Despite these changes, mothers, as compared to fathers, experience more symptoms of insomnia both prenatally and postnatally.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major public health issue because of its prevalence and morbidity. Pregnancy is associated with a high prevalence of OSA. However, the consequences of gestational OSA are poorly known. We hypothesized that intermittent hypoxia (IH), an hallmark of OSA, induces prenatal and neurodevelopmental abnormalities of cardiorespiratory and cognitive functions. Theses anomalies could be related to a systemic and tissue inflammation. Methods: A classic model of IH was applied to pregnant mice using 5% FiO2, 30 cycles /h 10 hours a day, during the last 10 days of gestation. The IH model was characterized by monitoring transcutaneous oxygen saturation and the mothers' weight. The pups' evaluation consisted of daily weighing, measuring cardio respiratory parameters at basal state and during hypoxic and hypercapnic challenges at 5 and 12 days of age. Cognitive functions were evaluated by the object recognition test (ORT) at 60 days of age. Cytokine assay was performed in serum and tissue samples (Merck Millipore, Magpmag-24k -Billerica, Massachusetts). Results: The IH induced oxygen desaturations and delayed weight gain in pregnant mice without showing serum and tissue inflammation. The study of IH exposed pups revealed: 1 / transient respiratory anomalies such as an increase in basal normoxic ventilation (Ve, Ttot), 2 / a persistent growth retardation at all postnatal ages till 30 days and 3 / no differences in cognitive function evaluated by the ORT. Discussion: These results are consistent with the current literature and suggest an impact of IH. The prospects inspired by our work are the study of the consequences of a less severe IH model, closer to human pathology.

N2  - Objectives: During pregnancy and as a new mother sleep deprivation is known to impair mood. We investigated the factors that may mediate this relationship to give mothers with poor sleep more options to help improve their mood. Method: One hundred and eighty-four women expecting their first babies were recruited into the study. Participants (18 + ) had no history of major depression. Outcome variables included depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale: EPDS), sleep (Insomnia Severity Index: ISI and Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue: MAF), coping strategies (Brief COPE) and self-efficacy (Self-efficacy Scale: SES). These were examined using online questionnaires during the third trimester of pregnancy and 6 weeks postnatally. Results: During pregnancy, insomnia and fatigue explained 32% of the variance in depression (P < 0.05). Certain coping strategies including distraction, denial, behavioural disengagement, venting and self-blame collectively mediated the relationship between insomnia and depression (z = 4.316, P < 0.001) as well as fatigue and depression (z = 3.88, P < 0.001). At six weeks postpartum, coping strategies including emotional support, instrumental support, venting, positive reframing, planning, acceptance and self-blame mediated the effect of insomnia (z = 2.09, P < 0.05) but not fatigue on depression. Self-efficacy independently predicted depression both during pregnancy (P < 0.01) and the early postpartum (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Although insomnia and fatigue were consistently related to lower mood both during pregnancy and postnatally, coping strategies were important mediators of these relationships. Coping strategies should be considered as a possible approach in preventing poor mood in first time expectant mums.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING AND SUBJECTS: A total of 1765 women were invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11-16 weeks of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors, smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic medicine.
RESULTS: Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%). Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p < 0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with multiparity.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.

N2  - This presentation will review a personal selection of ten articles from 2013 onwards set in the context of other work. The focus is on papers addressing clinical topics and original manuscripts not systematic reviews. Viral infections and allergy are covered elsewhere. Tobacco wars: the fruits of the victor The benefits of preventing second hand smoke exposure, in terms of admissions to hospital for respiratory and cardiovascular disease, have been well documented. We also know that maternal smoking is a risk factor for preterm delivery. Over a period from January 2002 to December 2011, comprising 606,877 deliveries [1] there was a stepwise deline in preterm delivery as a result of successive tobacco control interventions in Belgium (banning smoking in the workplace, then in restaurants, then in bars serving food). These data should encourage a renewed battle with the industry for the future health of our children; and as an aside, beware the gathering storm of e-cigarettes-we must fight to ban sexy advertisements peddling them as a step-up to tobacco smoking, rather than as with nicotine patches, a step-down for those who want to quit. Tobacco: the consequences linger on That maternal smoking is a BAD THING in the early years of life is well known. The duration of the ill effects is not. The Brisbane group [2] reported the 14 year follow-up of 1129 subjects, 237 of whose mothers smoked in pregnancy (92 reported current smoking). Maternal smoking in pregnancy was associated with reduced lung function, an asthma diagnosis, and altered immune function, but not with atopy or increased bronchial hyper-responsiveness. The ongoing risk of pregnancy smoking is clear, but some of the mechanisms are not; there is more to Tobacco harm than just reducing airway calibre. We must win the war on tobacco. A miss is not as good as a mile: the late preterm delivery The long-term respiratory sequelae of extreme prematurity are well described, but the problems of the late pre-termer are under-appreciated. Babies born at 33-34 weeks have airflow obstruction persisting into the teenage years, to a similar degree as 25-32 weekers. 44,173 women in Finland delivered 2661 babies between 1989 and 2008. Asthma was diagnosed in the children if they had a certificate of the diagnosis from a doctor and had been reimbursed for asthma medications [3]. There was an increased risk of asthma even in “early term” (37-38 weeks), with a stepwise greater risk for the late preterm (33-36 weeks) and the moderately (≤32 weeks).We cannot be sure what the airway disease is from this manuscript, and we know that in BPD survivors the evidence for airway inflammation is minimal. Nonetheless, there are a lot of babies born just before term; look out for ongoing respiratory morbidity into adult life. Is it asthma, Dr? What is the airway disease in Sickle cell disease (SCD) Respiratory disease and a diagnosis of asthma are both common in SCD, but as is often the case, the diagnosis of asthma may be given out with more liberality that thought. Fifty SCD children who had previously been shown to have only minimal evidence of pulmonary vascular disease were shown to have obstructive spirometry compared to ethnic and age-matched controls [4]. However there was no difference in bronchial responsiveness or eosinophilic inflammation, at least as judged by exhaled nitric oxide, between the two groups, suggesting that another cause for airway disease must be sought. For sure, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should not be dispensed without careful thought to SCD children. Inhaled steroids: a price to pay? But surely this is a lot of fuss about nothing? ICS are very safe, so if they are a little bit overprescribed, does it matter? We all know that high dose systemic steroids are immunosuppressive, and that the airways have a complex set of defences against infection, so why should not ICS be locally immunosuppressive? They are; in addition to increasing the risk of pneumonia in COPD, there is now evidence of an increase in TB risk [5]. 4139 Koreans with TB were matched with 20,583 controls; ICS use was associated with a dose dependent increased risk of TB diagnosis. This was not seen in those also using oral corticosteroids, presumably because these had a far greater risk for TB, drowning out an additional burden from ICS. There seems to be a drive by Pharma to produce ever more potent ICS; we need to be mindful of the potential for even more immunosuppression with such compounds. New may not necessarily be beautiful. Do old dogs need new tricks: Tuberculosis diagnosis in a resource poor area Continuing the theme of maybe the old being better, a manuscript from South Africa [6] examined whether T-spot added value to the diagnostic pathway of TB in 491 smear negative children. Culture confirmed TB was most associated with cough and fever for more than 2 weeks, night sweats, malaise and a history of household contact; and HIV status. Adding T-SPOT to chest radiography and tuberculin skin testing racked up costs but did not add diagnostic value. A really important message for high TB burden,low resource parts of the world. All I want is the air that I breathe: chILD This manuscript [7] reported on a novel interstitial lung disease (ILD) from Korea (there are also reports in adults). There were 138 cases between 2006 and 2011, with an increasing annual incidence. The mean age at presentation was 30.4 months, and typical symptoms were cough and dyspnoea. There was rapid progression, air leaks were common and there no response to treatment. Eighty (58%) children died. The pathology included centrilobular interstitial fibrosis, bronchiole and bronchiolar destruction, and alveolar filling with foamy histiocytes. When the suspected humidifier disinfectant was withdrawn, there were no new cases. I present this paper to alert us that what we inhale can cause harm, and to be on the alert for new iatrogenic diseases. Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF): what can we expect? Increasingly most children with CF are diagnosed on a combination of immunoreactive trypsin and CF gene identification on dried blood spots in the newborn period. The prognosis and management of these patients has been controversial, with some groups reporting that there is rapid deterioration of lung function and the appearance of bronchiectasis and other CT scan changes. The London group have reported that, by contrast lung function improves over the first year of life, and that CTat a year reveals such mild changes that most cannot be scored reproducibly [8]. This work sets a benchmark for the results of screening for CF, and also emphasises that (a) scoring systems suitable for moderate and severe disease may not apply to mild, and (b) it is essential to show that scoring is reproducible before introducing it as a clinical tool. Another orphan: lung attacks and bronchiectasis “Exacerbation” has long been the expression used to describe an acute deterioration of a respiratory disease. This feeble phrase implies that these are benign and reversible, whereas “lung attacks” are in fact associated with a permanent decline in the context of many diseases including asthma and CF, and the prevention of lung attacks is seen as a priority and an end-point in clinical trials. Nearly 100 indiginous children with bronchiectasis were randomised to once weekly azithromycin (30 mg/kg) or placebo for 12-24 months [9]. The azithromycin treated children had a halving of bronchiectasis lung attacks (95% confidence intervals 0.35-0.7) albeit at the expected cost of increased macrolide resistance. This manuscript firmly establishes the role of azithromycin in those children with bronchiectasis requiring repeated courses of antibiotics. To sleep, perchance not to wake up Snoring children have long been seen as a subject of mirth, but a recent paper highlights the morbidity and even mortality associated with paediatric sleep disordered breathing [10]. 2,998 children aged 0-19 with OSA were matched with 11,974 controls. There was increased morbidity in in a large number of organ systems in the three years before diagnosis, and a five year death rate of 70/10,000 for OSA compared with 11/10,000 for controls.We must do more to identify and treat these children from all over the world.

N2  - Objective: To determine the transfer of 2-Naphthol (NPH) in full-term human placental tissues using the ex vivo human perfusion model. Methods: A total of six placentas were obtained from women undergoing elective Caesarean section or vaginal delivery at term. Schneider's ex vivo human placental perfusion model was adopted. The perfusate at fetal side was circulated at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The flow at maternal intervillous space was at a rate of 12 ml/min. After equilibration, the perfusate in the maternal compartment was replaced with fresh perfusate containing 2- NPH at 100ug/mL, antipyrine at 50 mg/mL. Samples were obtained from the maternal and fetal circulations at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360minutes. Results: A total of 6 term placentas were perfused. The mean weight of the perfused cotyledonwas 26.3 (±5.5) grams. The fluid shift between the fetal and maternal compartments was <3ml/h. All pre-perfused placental samples contained 2-Naphthol (NPH) in their tissues with a mean NPH level of 7.98 (± 1.73) ug\g compared to a mean of 15.58 (± 4.53) ug\g after 360 minutes perfusion. The initial drop in the concentration of NPH in the maternal compartment was rapid. It dropped 5.54 ug\g in the first 15 minutes and 13.8 ug\g in 360 minutes. However, the increase of NPH concentration on the fetal side was much slower. The transfer rate of NPH was much lower than that of antipyrine. The highest transfer index was at 120 minutes. In conclusion, pregnant women seem to be exposed to high levels of environmental NAP. Its metabolites, NPH, and accumulates in term placentas. NPH has the ability to rapidly cross the placenta from the maternal to the fetal compartment within 15 minutes. The placenta seems to play a role in limiting the passage of NPH in the fetal compartment.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Given the uncertainties regarding safety and efficacy of ART in the obese patient, the purpose of this study was to survey the IVF centers across the United States to determine what policies, if any, have been instituted in response to an increasing overweight and obese population. DESIGN: Survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent to Medical Directors at 395 IVF centers in the SART database regarding recommendations, policies, and restrictions for overweight/obese patients who desire infertility treatment. 77 surveys were received. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 58.4% perform 100-499 fresh ART cycles per year, and 19.7% practice in mandated states. 50 centers (64.9%) state they have a policy for obesity and offering ART, including in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI), intrauterine insemination (IUI), and donor egg recipient cycles. Of those with policies, 64.0% depend specifically on BMI; 30.0% include BMI combined with other criteria. Other criteria included weight, neck/abdomen/waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, fat%, inadequate trial transfer, anesthesia clearance, and medical comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and sleep apnea. 84% of programs with policies state they have a maximum BMI at which they will perform IVF, with 28.6% setting a limit at 40 and 9.5% setting a limit at 45. Similarly, 62.0% of programs reported a maximum BMI for donor egg recipients (mode BMI 40), but only 38% had a maximum BMI for IUI. When asked what criterion primarily dictates the exclusion of patients in ART, 62% reported anesthesia requirements. 14% selected safety during ongoing pregnancy and 14% selected IVF outcomes and success/miscarriage rates as their primary consideration. About half (50.6%) of centers have an affiliated outpatient anesthesia department with a policy regarding BMI, often setting a limit at 40 (35.9%); many require anesthesia consultation for ART. If weight loss is required before ART, 85.7% of respondents refer patients to a nutritionist/dietician, and 67.5% refer to another specialist such as bariatric surgery, endocrine, or psychology. When asked the highest BMI the center recalls treating, the maximum reported was 62, minimum 31, and mode 45. CONCLUSION: While some centers do not have policies regarding obesity and access to ART, those that do consider BMI and other criteria related to efficacy, procedural safety, safety in pregnancy, and overall health status. Policies vary widely and the topic requires continued discussion.

N2  - There is limited data on early lung function in African infants despite a high prevalence of respiratory disease. Aim: To assess antenatal and early life factors associated with low lung function in early infancy in a low and middle income setting. Method: Infants enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Lung Health study, a birth cohort study in a peri-urban area of South Africa, had lung function at 6-10 weeks of age. Infants were not tested within 2 weeks of a respiratory tract infection. Lung function was measured in unsedated infants during sleep using standardised methodology. Measurements, made with the infant quietly breathing through a face mask and bacterial filter, included tidal breathing (TBFVL), exhaled nitric oxide (NO) and sulphur hexafluoride multiple breath washout (MBW) measures using an ultrasonic flow meter and chemoluminescent NO analyzer. Information on antenatal and birth exposures was prospectively collected with questionnaires and urine cotinine antenatally, at birth and post-natally. Results: Four hundred and thirty seven infants were tested at a mean age of 6.8 (SD 2) weeks, corrected for prematurity. Fifty percent of infants were male, 34% were exposed to maternal smoking in pregnancy and 43% were exposed to passive maternal smoke exposed. Median gestational age at birth was 39 weeks (IQR: 38-40) and birth weight 3 kg (IQR: 2.7-3.4). Testing was successful in 420/437 (96%) of children for MBW, 434/437 (99%) TBFVL and in 430/437 (98%) for exhaled NO. Birth weight was positively associated with tidal volume at a corrected age of 7 weeks: for every 1kg increase in birth weight there was an average 5ml increase in tidal volume at 7 weeks (P<0.001, 95%CI 4.26 to 6.4). Both maternal smoking and passive maternal smoke exposure during pregnancy were associated with changes in TBFVL and NO measures: ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow over total expiratory time (tPTEF/tE) was 5% lower (95%CI:-8.3 to -2; P<0.01) for infants whose mothers smoked and 3.7% lower (95%CI: -6.7 to -0.8; P=0.01) for infants with passive maternal smoke exposure compared to infants whose mothers did not smoke or have passive smoke exposure. NO output (VNO) was 1.3 nL.sec-1 higher (95%CI: 0.1-2.4; P=0.03) for infants whose mothers smoked and 1.3 nL.sec-1 higher (95% CI: 0.3-2.4; P=0.01) for infants with passive maternal smoke exposure compared to infants whose mothers did not smoke or have passive smoke exposure. Smoke exposure had no significant effect on MBW measures. Prematurity (<37 weeks) was not associated with low lung function at 7 weeks in this cohort. Analyses were adjusted for infant length, weight, birth weight and length, gender, smoke exposure and prematurity. Conclusions: Intrauterine and early life exposures have a significant impact on lung growth and function in early infancy which may constitute a risk for subsequent respiratory illness.

N2  - Summary: In this review obesity is to be defined in context of recent development in surgery and its mortality and morbidity, specifically bariatric surgery. Recent publications related to ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia in obese are discussed : peripheral nerve blocks and catheters, central neuraxial , lumbar plexus as well as chronic pain interventions. Principles of ultrasound imaging and way to improve the picture quality in obese patients are explained. Finally examples of ultrasound images in morbidly obese patients are presented and discussed. Introduction: Obesity has been defined as BMI (BodyMass Index) >30kg/m2 and morbid obesity as twice ideal body weight. In XXI century in developed countries pandemic of obesity has been observed. More than 1.4 billion adults, 20 and older, were over weight. Overall, more than 10% of the world's adult population was obese. Around 3.4 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. Culture of high calories fast food with decrease outdoor activities is about to blame. General mortality in obese population used to be twice as normal with increased risk of cardiac, pulmonary and metabolic complications.1 More recently bariatric surgery has become popular and attractive showing rapid improvement in metabolic condition such diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia even before measurable weight loss. National Bariatric Surgery Registry audit presented outcome after 8710 surgeries in the UK showing in - hospital mortality 1:1000 and overall complications about 2.6% .2 Overall 30 day mortality after elective procedures in the UK has been calculated as 6.7 per 1000 as presented by Aylin et al. 3 Obese patient present a challenge for an anaesthetist for both intraoperative and postoperative management. Beginning with pre-existing comorbidities such as sleep apnoea, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease , hypertension, diabetes mellitus through vascular access , difficult airway management, positioning to prevention of postoperative complications and adequate pain control. Regional anaesthesia solely or combined with general anaesthesia seems to be an attractive option in such demanding population both in avoiding general anaesthesia and reducing opioid consumption. However anatomical landmarks for regional anaesthesia are often of no use and even in expert hands failure rate is high. High Resolution Ultrasonography has become golden standard of regional anaesthesia over the last 20 years since the article by Kapral et al .4 describing ultrasound guided supraclavicular brachial plexus in 1994. Wallace et al. described indirect ultrasound guidance for epidural anaesthesia in obese pregnant patients back in 1992 5. Both papers have been a visionary work as resolution of ultrasound images were at the time very limited and enormous progress in this field has been made . PubMed search on 25.05.2014 using : “ obesity and ultrasound and regional anaesthesia” revealed 13 publications. Three were in language other than English . Six were related to peripheral nerve blocks four to TAP block ( transversus abdominis plane block) in bariatric surgery, one to peripheral catheter insertion, chronic pain and central neuraxial respectively. Peripheral nerve blocks- single shot and catheters: In pre-ultrasound era Franco et al.6 reviewed retrospectively 2020 nerve stimulator guided supraclavicular blocks performed in their institution between February 1996 and April 2003. 455 blocks ( 22.5%) were performed in obese patients ( BMI> 30). Overall success rate in this subgroup was 94.3% (P<0.01) comparing to 97.3% in the non-obese population. Shroeder et al.7 analysed retrospectively 528 ultrasound guided interscalene block .They found that elevated BMI was associated with an increased time required for block performance , intra and post operative opioid administration, higher pain scores , as well as increased nausea and vomiting in PACU. Shwemmer et al. 8 assessed differences in success of ultrasound guided interscalene block between normal BMI < 25 and excessive weight BMI > 25. Identification of nerve structures in obese group required more time 5 ( +- 1 min) comparing to patient of normal weight 4 ( +- 1 min)and was found difficult in 3 patients. Sufficient block was achieved in 94% of control and 77% of overweight group respectively but difference were not statistically significant . Mariano and Brodsky9 pulled out the data from 5 previously published randomised controlled trials comparing ultrasound and nerve stimulation guided perineural catheter insertion techniques. They identified 51 obese and 69 nonobese patients. All patients but one in non-obese group had successful catheter placement. 12 and 8 femoral catheters, 7 and 13 infraclavicular, 8 and 12 interscalene, 24 and 36 popliteal in obese and nonobese group respectively. Procedural time for catheter insertion were similar in both groups 7( 4-15 min) and served as a primary outcome. There were no statistical differences in secondary outcomes such as block efficacy, procedure related pain, fluid leakage, vascular puncture and catheter dislodgement. All above results should be interpreted cautiously. Firstly they present retrospective data with a bias of recording accuracy. Secondly criteria of primary and secondary outcome such as block effectiveness and procedure time or overall success differs among the studies. Thirdly they all come from centres of excellence experience with the techniques however difference in local population needed to be considered. Lastly there might be difference in procedure performance depending on the nerve/ plexus to be blocked ( e.g. interscalene v. sciatic) and BMI with minimal difference around 30 to significant in patient with BMI 40 and more. Further study are needed especially in subpopulation with morbid obesity but up to date result suggest that both ultrasound and nerve stimulator guided technique are useful tool in nerve location for single shot and catheter techniques.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate medical comorbidity patterns in patients with a narcolepsy diagnosis in the United States. Methods: Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Research Databases were accessed to identify individuals ≥18 years of age with at least one diagnosis code for narcolepsy ± cataplexy (ICD9 347.0, 347.00, 347.01, 347.1, 347.10 or 347.11) continuously insured between 2006 and 2010, and controls without narcolepsy matched 5:1 on age, sex, region, and payer. Extensive sub-analyses were conducted to confirm the validity of the narcolepsy definitions. Narcolepsy and control patients were compared for frequency of comorbid conditions, identified by the appearance of ≥1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and depression. Results: The final study group included 9312 narcolepsy patients and 46 559 controls (each group, average age 46.1 years; 59% female). Compared with controls, narcolepsy patients demonstrated a statistically significant excess prevalence of comorbid diagnoses in all CCS multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; OR 3.8, 95% CI 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/ sense organs [excluding narcolepsy], (20.7% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9). Conclusions: Narcolepsy is associated with a significant burden of medical comorbidity.

N2  - Background: Assessing lung mechanics non-invasively in healthy infants offers the potential to better understand lung growth and function. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) requires minimal co-operation from the patient, but has rarely been used in infants. Aim: To assess the feasibility of a modified FOT to measure respiratory mechanics in unsedated infants. Method: Infants enrolled in a birth cohort study in South Africa had lung function measured at 6 to 10 weeks of age using FOT. Respiratory impedance (Zrs) was measured in the frequency range 8-48 Hz via a facemask during natural sleep. Respiratory system resistance (R), compliance (C) and inertance (I) were calculated from the Zrs data. Results: Of the 219 infants tested, 198 (90%) infants had successful measurements. The mean (SD) values of R, C and I were 52.2 (18.1) hPa.s.L-1, 0.83 (0.4) mL.hPa-1 and 0.071 (0.041) hPa.s2.L-1, respectively. Gender was a determinant for R and C, while C was significantly affected by maternal smoking during pregnancy. Resistance (R), Compliance (C) and Inertance (I) by gender and maternal smoking Conclusion: The modified FOT technique is a feasible method for measuring respiratory mechanics in healthy unsedated infants. The FOT has the potential to be used as a tool in the assessment of determinates of early lung function. (Table Presented).

Aim: To assess antenatal and early life factors associated with early lung function in African infants. Method: Infants enrolled in the Drakenstein child health study, a South African birth cohort had lung function measured at 6-10 weeks of age. Measurements, made with the infant breathing via a facemask in natural sleep, included tidal breathing, exhaled nitric oxide and multiple breath washout measures. Information on antenatal and postnatal exposures was collected using questionnaires and, for tobacco smoke exposure, urine cotinine. Results: Successful tests were obtained in 425/448 (95%) infants with a mean (SD) age of 7.5 (4) wks, weight 4.8 (0.8) kg, length 54.7 (3) cm and gestation 38.6 (2.3) weeks; 228 (51%) infants were male, 67 (15%) preterm (<37 weeks); 83 (19%) infants mothers were HIV infected, 148 (34%) mothers smoked and 187 (43%) were exposed to household tobacco smoke. Two hundred and thirteen (48%) infants were Black African and 235 (52%) were mixed race. Prematurity did not effect outcomes, smoking results below. Lung function by smoke exposure Conclusions: Intrauterine and early life exposures have a significant impact on lung growth and function in early infancy which may constitute a risk for subsequent respiratory illness.

N2  - Objective: To study signs of impaired airway function prior to lower airway infection in preterm infants Design/Methods: 156 consecutively born infants, born at 27-33 weeks gestation, and 109 term infants were enrolled in a prospective study of lung and airway function. Lung function was studied using tidal breathing infant spirometry during quiet sleep at term The infants were assessed by the study nurse or doctor at every airway infection during the first year after birth and nasopharyngeal viral swabs were taken Results: Among infants born at 27-31 weeks, 9 % were hospitalized and 18 % were treated in ambulatory care due to bronchiolitis Among 32-33 weeks infants , 6,2 % needed hospitalization for bronchiolitis and 14 % had ambulatory care. Term infants had bronchiolitis in only 1,8 %: only 0,9 % in hospital Early bronchiolitis(during first 6 months) was caused by: 77% RSV, 23 % rhinovirus. Late bronchiolitis(after 6 months) was due to: RSV 43 % %, rhinovirus 33 % and others 24% In preterm infants who had early bronchiolitis,there was no difference in airway function before the bronchiolitis compared to preterms who did not have bronchiolitis Conclusions: Preterms who had bronchiolitis during the first six months after birth did not have impaired lung or airway function before the bronchiolitis. Preterm infants,who had RSV infection during first 6 months after birth, often had bronchiolitis compared to term infants, who mainly had upper airway symtoms. RSV was the main cause of bronchiolitis during the first 6 months, and RSV and also rhinovirus and to a lesser extent other viruses during 6-12 months after birth.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research study was to determine the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in women with PCOS by ascertaining depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and coping strategies. DESIGN: A descriptive, correlational study using an online survey with five validated questionnaires. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive, correlational, and multiple regression procedures were used to analyze the relationships among the variables using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 21. A sample of 72 women with PCOS clinically confirmed by the Rotterdam criteria, aged 18-40, not pregnant, and able to read and write in English was recruited from an urban metro area. The study sample was adequate to show significance with a power of 0.8, an alpha of 0.05, and a 0.2 effect size. Variables were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Spielberger's Trait Anxiety Scale, Perceived Stress Scale-10, theWays of Coping Questionnaire, and the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Questionnaire (PCOSQ). RESULTS: 30.6% of the sample had severe levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or suicidal ideation.Women with severe psychosocial distress used significantly less adaptive coping processes (p < .05) and more maladaptive coping (p < .05). Weight was PCOSQ subscale with lowest mean at 2.87. Depressive symptoms and BMI explained 43.6% of variance in emotions PCOSQ subscale and 38.5% of variance in weight PCOSQ subscale. BMI explained 14% of variance in body hair PCOSQ subscale. Increased depressive and anxiety symptoms in the sample included loss of energy (70.8%), sleep changes (70.9%), excessive worry (77.8%), and lack of self-confidence (80.5%). CONCLUSION: Women with PCOS are at risk for depression, anxiety, and, in a fewcases, suicidal ideation.Acomprehensive measure captures psychosocial distress better than a single tool. Regular screening for depression and psychosocial distress is indicated in this population. Coping skills should be assessed, and need further examination in women with PCOS.Weight is an area of concern to women with PCOS and should be discussed in relation to HRQL.

N2  - Background: Assessment of quality of life after childbirth is an important health-outcome measurement for new mothers and is of special interest in midwifery. The Mother-Generated Index (MGI) is a validated instrument to assess postnatal quality of life. The tool has not been applied for making a cross-cultural comparison before. This study investigated (a) responses to the MGI in German-speaking women in Germany and Switzerland; and (b) associations between MGI scores on the one hand and maternity and midwifery care on the other.Methods: A two-stage survey was conducted in two rural hospitals 10 km apart, on opposite sides of the German-Swiss border. The questionnaires included the MGI and questions on socio-demographics, physical and mental health and maternity care, and were distributed during the first days after birth and six weeks postpartum. Parametric and non-parametric tests were computed with the statistical programme SPSS.Results: A total of 129 questionnaires were returned an average of three days after birth and 83 in the follow-up after seven weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in the MGI scores between the German and the Swiss women (p = 0.22). Significantly more favourable MGI scores were found associated with more adequate information during pregnancy (p = 0.02), a more satisfactory birth experience (p < 0.01), epidural anaesthesia (p < 0.01), more information (p = 0.01) and better support (p = 0.02) during the time in hospital and less disturbed sleep (p < 0.01). Significantly lower MGI scores were associated with the presence of a private doctor during birth (p = 0.01) and with exclusive breastfeeding during the first postnatal days (p = 0.04).Conclusion: The MGI scores of these German-speaking women were higher than those in other studies reported previously. Thus the tool may be able to detect differences in postnatal quality of life among women with substantially divergent cultural backgrounds. Shortcomings in maternity and midwifery care were detected, as for example the inadequate provision of information during pregnancy, a lack of individualised postpartum care during the hospital stay and insufficient support for exclusively breastfeeding mothers. The MGI is an appropriate instrument for maternity care outcome measurement in cross-cultural comparison research.

N2  - Short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and insomnia frequently characterize sleep in pregnancy during all three trimesters. We aimed: (i) to review the clinical evidence of the association between conditions of sleep loss during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) to discuss the potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may be involved. A systematic search of cross-sectional, longitudinal studies using Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO, and MeSH headings and key words for conditions of sleep loss such as 'insomnia', 'poor sleep quality', 'short sleep duration', and 'pregnancy outcome' was made for papers published between January 1, 1960 and July 2013. Twenty studies met inclusion criteria for sleep loss and pregnancy outcome: seven studies on prenatal depression, three on gestational diabetes, three on hypertension, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, six on length of labor/type of delivery, eight on preterm birth, and three on birth grow/birth weight. Two main results emerged: (i) conditions of chronic sleep loss are related to adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) chronic sleep loss yields a stress-related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and abnormal immune/inflammatory, reaction, which, in turn, influences pregnancy outcome negatively. Chronic sleep loss frequently characterizes sleep throughout the course of pregnancy and may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Common pathophysiological mechanisms emerged as being related to stress system activation. We propose that in accordance to the allostatic load hypothesis, chronic sleep loss during pregnancy may also be regarded as both a result of stress and a physiological stressor per se, leading to stress 'overload'. It may account for adverse pregnancy outcomes and somatic and mental disorders in pregnancy.

N2  - In recent years, anxiety disorders have reached epidemic proportion worldwide. These disorders are common among pregnant women and may be harmful not only to the mother but also to the fetus. The serotonergic system is known to modulate mood, emotion, sleep and appetite. Altered activity of brain serotonergic system has been implicated in a wide range of behavioral disorders, including anxiety. Serotonin transporter mediates serotonin levels in the synapse, and its inhibition by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) serves as the first line treatment for anxiety disorders. Treatment with SSRIs during pregnancy might lead to development abnormalities of the offspring. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of maternal exposure to escitalopram, commonly used SSRI, compared with a novel herbal treatment developed in our laboratory, during pregnancy on the expression of serotonin transporter in offspring mice. On the eighth day of their pregnancy, female mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups: (a) herbal treatment (30mg/kg per day) (b) escitalopram (15mg/kg per day) (c) vehicle (d) control (did not receive any treatment). On post natal day 30, offspring's anxiety-like behaviors and physiological changes, were evaluated. We found that offspring of mice treated with escitalopram, herbal treatment or vehicle during pregnancy demonstrated lower levels of serotonin transporter in the hypothalamus and pre-frontal cortex than controls. In addition, the herbal treatment showed the least anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze, and that the escitalopram was the least active in the open field test. These results suggest that further studies are needed in order to understand the implications of SSRIs or herbal treatments on the serotonergic physiology in pregnant mice.

N2  - Hypothesis/aims of study: Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a condition of varying degrees of complexity, characterized by different stages and involving various combinations of alterations (anterior, apical or posterior). The relationship between POP severity to quality of life has been evidenced for some authors [1,2]. However the impact of these different situations in the quality of life has not been still established. The study aims to analyze the association between quality of life impairment with POP of different degrees of complexity and staging. Study design, materials and methods: Sixty-five women with bulge symptoms and staged as Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POP-Q) stage 2 (n = 15), stage 3 (n = 30), and stage 4 (n = 20) were included in this cross-sectional observational study. It was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and all persons gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. Women with neurological disease or collagen, anal incontinence, pregnant women who had given birth or undergone any gynecological surgery 12 months before were excluded. All participants answered the Prolapse Quality of life Questionnaire (P-QoL). The scores for each domain range from 0-100. High total score indicates a greater impairment of quality of life, while low score indicates good quality of life. All patients were examined in lithotomy position and in rest to define the POP-Q. All patients were examined by the same investigator. For statistical analysis non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariate linear regression were used. Statistical tests were performed with a type 1 error set at a < 0.05 and the bold was used to identify the statistical significance. Results: The mean age was 64 (range 35 to 89) years old and mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.8 (range 16.8 to 40.8). Fifty-eight women (90 %) were postmenopausal, 20 (29.3 %) had undergone hysterectomy, 35 (53.9 %) complained of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and 49 (75.4 %) complained of urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). Older women had more advanced stages of prolapse (p = 0.006). Women with higher parity had higher staging of prolapse (p = 0.03). Vaginal delivery was also associated with more advanced stages of POP (p = 0.008). The complaints of SUI were more common in women with lower stages (p = 0.01). BMI, the number of cesarean sections, the largest newborn weight and surgeries for POP and SUI were similar among prolapse stages. Patients with concomitant 3 POP had worse quality of life scores than patients with only 1 POP in P-QoL domains as “severe measures”, “social limitations” and “prolapse impact”, “role limitations”, and “physical limitations”. The domains “personal relationship”, “emotion” and “sleep/energy” did not associate with staging or POP complexity (p≥0.05). There was no difference between patients with only 1 and 2 POP. Staging was not associated with any domains of the P-Qol (table 1). Table 1: Association of the P-QoL domains to staging and complexity of POP according to the presence of only one vaginal prolapse (anterior, posterior or apical), the combination of two or to the presence of three types of prolapse simultaneously. The scores obtained in patients with 1 POP were used to determine the independent variable. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were used to control (Table Presented). Interpretation of results: Some aspects of quality of life were compromised in subjects with more complex prolapses in comparison to more simple ones and these aspects might not be justified by aging, vaginal deliveries, parity, obesity, urinary leak or staging. These results suggest that the complexity of the prolapse may be more important to impact the quality of life than staging. Similar studies were not found to compare these results. Concluding message: The presence of concomitant anterior, apical and posterior POP is associated with worse quality of life rather than higher staging.

N2  - Background: There is robust evidence that new onset depression after liver transplant (LTX) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Yet, there is paucity in the data analyzing the effect of depression treatment on LTX outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine if depression treatment influences outcomes after LTX. Methods: Single-center, longitudinal cohort study of LTX patients from Oct 2010-June 2013. Exclusions were pediatrics, prisoners, and pregnancy. Depression diagnosis was based on PMH and documentation from psychosocial providers. Patients were separated into 3 groups for analysis: no depression, adequately treated depression, and inadequately treated depression. Depression was considered adequately treated if the Antidepressant Treatment History Form was >3. Results: 161 patients were included in the analysis; 103 without depression, 24 with adequately treated depression and 34 with inadequately treated depression. Baseline characteristics were similar. Patients with inadequately treated depression had significantly more encounters with a healthcare provider and numerically more complications after LTX, including those requiring readmission or requiring outpatient interventions (Table 1). Graft loss tended to be higher in these patients (Figure 1). The adequately treated depression group was more likely to be on antidepressants at 30 and 60 days post-LTX (Table 1). The inadequately treated group was significantly more likely to be on a sleep aid 30 days post-LTX (p=0.014). Benzodiazepine and opioid use were similar between groups. Conclusion: Inadequately treated depression leads to increased healthcare resource utilization in LTX. Patients with adequately treated depression have similar outcomes as those without depression. Use of sleep aids early post-LTX may be a surrogate indicator of inadequately treated depression. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Amplitude integrated electroencephalogaphy (aEEG) is becoming an important tool for the assessment of cerebral activity in preterm newborns. Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological lesion/death. Preterm newborns with a birth weight ≤1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and bandwidth (BW). Key outcomes were severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV III/IHP, a low-voltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological lesion/death. Absent SWCs during the first 72 h were also related to death. Conclusion: Early aEEG patterns can be predictive of neurological outcome in the preterm newborn. Low-voltage tracing and absence of SWCs are associated with severe neurological lesions/death. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions.
DESIGN: Repeated measures.
SETTING: Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: 122 pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation.
METHODS: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and appraisals.
RESULTS: Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related issues as well as with negative expectations about the future.
CONCLUSIONS: Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research. This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Estimating fatigue severity with a psychometrically sound instrument provides the most fundamental information for understanding women's fatigue experience and assessing the need for intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the 7-item Lee Fatigue Scale-Short Form (C-LFS-SF) in pregnant and postpartum women.
METHODS: The study was composed of two phases: translation of the scale into Chinese and examination of content validity, and testing to establish the reliability and validity. A convenience sample of 124 women completed health-related questionnaires, kept a fatigue diary and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days during the third trimester of pregnancy and within three months postpartum.
RESULTS: The C-LFS-SF showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha≥.97) and stability over the 7 days at each time point (intraclass correlation coefficient>.87). Exploratory factor analysis showed that 88-94% of the total variance was explained by the one-factor fatigue model. Significant associations among the C-LFS-SF and actigraphic sleep quantity and quality variables supported adequate construct validity.
CONCLUSIONS: The C-LFS-SF has satisfactory psychometric properties and is an easy and promising tool for assessing maternal fatigue during routine prenatal and postpartum care. This scale needs to be further tested in a more diverse population of pregnant and postpartum women, like women with high risk pregnancies or with medical conditions.

N2  - Introduction: Bariatric surgery has increased significantly over the last decade. Aside from assessment of menstrual function, very little has been published about these patients' reproductive history. Since females comprise the majority of those undergoing these procedures, important aspect of their OB/GYN history and fertility issues may provide insight for present and future care of these women. Methods: Reproductive health surveys were given to 100 consecutive women who were scheduled for bariatric surgery at our institution. Patients were asked to return these surveys by mail. They were then reviewed and collated as was information from their preoperative visit. Age-matched patients with BMI<35 (n=100) were randomly selected from our OB/GYN clinic to serve as controls. Results: Of the 100 surveys issued 77 were returned (77%). The mean BMI was 43.3 and age 38.8 yrs; 96% were premenopausal and 48% were less than 36 yrs old. These were compared to age matched controls with BMI <35. Irregular menses were noted in 31% (controls= 12%, p=0.003) with PCOS reported in 19% (controls= 8%, p=0.04). A prior pregnancy was achieved by 87% of patients. Overall, 15% of their pregnancies were complicated by miscarriages (controls= 11%, p=NS) , 27% gestational diabetes (controls=10%, p=<0.001) and 19% preeclampsia (controls= 4%, p=0.012). Future fertility was a major concern in 26%, overall, and 47% in those under 36. This did not differ significantly from controls. Of the 53% using contraception equal numbers employed OCP (26%), Tubal Ligation (22%), Condoms (20%) and IUDs (20%). This did not differ significantly from controls. The leading co-morbidities were sleep apnea (40%; controls= 6%, p<0.001) and depression (31%; controls=12%, p=0.003) while only 10% had preexisting diabetes mellitus (controls 4%, p=NS) Conclusion: The unique female concerns such as menstrual control, future fertility, contraception needs, pregnancy history and depression are currently not being addressed. A preoperative visit with an OB/GYN may help to educate and inform women on these reproductive health issues.

N2  - Bariatric surgery is still a challenge concerning long term results in patients with BMI over 53. Laparoscopic Gastric by pass and Sleeve Gastrectomy are less effective than duodenal switch but both have easier follow up and management after surgery. We reveal 5 years experience with both techniques in super obese patients with BMI from 53 to 65 and weight from 266 to 178 kilos. Overall 49 patients were included in the study. They were 38 men and 11 women, aged from 21 to 55 years old. All patients had gastric baloon as a first stage procedure and laparoscopic gastric by pass or sleeve gastrectomy as a second stage procedure. The gastric by pass was done in 33 cases. We standardized the procedure as biliary limb was cut at 75 cm and jejunal limb was 175 cm long. The sleeve gastrectomy was fashioned using 36 Chr tube.We started resection of stomach 6 cm before pylorus in the first 11 cases and then moved to start stapling the stomach above its angle in the next 5 cases. Patients were discharged on 5th postoperative day and their follow up was from 1 year to 5 years after surgery. Major postoperative complications as leak were noted in two cases - female patients, 41 and 52 years old. The complications were managed with emergency laparoscopy, abdominal wash out and drainage, then endoscopic stents after the procedure. One of the patients developed renal failure and was transferred to another hospital. The postoperative mortality was 2.3% and complication rate of 3.1%. Overall 35 patients had Diabetes type 2, 12 had sleep apnea and 45 higher blood pressure. Followup showed reduction of weight from 54 to 123 kilos in the first two years after baloon placement and surgery. Regain of weight was found in 3 patients. Two cases were managed with dietitian and psychological support, in one case a band was put on the gastric pouch. Full resolve of Diabetes type 2 was noticed in 75% of the cases, sleep apnea improved in all patients. Blood pressure was monitored to normal levels in 90% of cases. Anaemia or B12 deficiency after surgery in our patients. Nutritional support and intake of supplements was given in 24 cases.We did not find any severe Two female patients were pregnant and had babies 1 to 3 years after surgery. Bariatric surgery in super obese patients was more difficult and complication rate was higher than in literature. Co-morbidity of those patients, technical difficulties during surgery and management of complications were major problems to deal with. But follow up showed that it was easier and weight loss was good in super obese patients in spite of recommendations for duodenal switch.

N2  - Circadian variation in biological rhythms has been identified as affecting both labour pain and the pharmacological properties of analgesics. In the context of pain, there is also a growing body of evidence suggesting the importance of adult attachment. The purpose of this study was to examine whether labour pain, analgesic consumption and pharmacological effect are significantly affected by the time of day and to analyse whether this circadian variation is influenced by women's attachment style. This prospective observational study included a sample of 81 pregnant women receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Attachment was assessed with the Adult Attachment Scale - Revised. The perceived intensity of labour pain in the early stage of labour (3 cm of cervical dilatation and before the administration of PCEA) was measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain was also indirectly assessed by measuring the consumption of anaesthetics. The latency period and the duration of effect were recorded for a chronopharmacology characterisation. Pain, as assessed with the VAS, was significantly higher in the night-time group than in the daytime group. An insecure attachment style was significantly associated with greater labour pain at 3 cm of cervical dilatation (p < 0.001) and before the beginning of analgesia (p < 0.001) as well as with higher analgesic consumption and lower pharmacological efficacy (p < 0.05). The time of day was significantly associated with the pharmacological effect: the latency period was longer at night, and the duration of the pharmacological effect was longer during the daytime. The interaction between time of day and attachment style was not significant for any of the study variables. Our results provide evidence of the importance of circadian variation in studying labour pain and the pharmacological effect of labour analgesia involving epidural blockage with a PCEA regimen. Moreover, although there was no evidence that attachment style influenced the circadian variation, these data emphasise that insecure attachment patterns are a risk factor for greater labour pain and analgesic consumption, which should be considered in pain management approaches.

N2  - Objective Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that maternal Mallampati class (MC), as a marker for OSA, is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Study Design We performed a retrospective secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of term births (≥ 37 weeks). Fetal anomalies and aneuploidy were excluded. Primary outcome was small for gestational age (SGA). Secondary outcomes included preeclampsia, neonatal cord arterial blood gas pH < 7.10 and < 7.05, base excess < - 8 and < - 12 mEq/L. Outcomes were compared between mothers with low MC airways and high MC airways using logistic regression. Results A total of 1,823 women met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were found in the risk of SGA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-1.2), preeclampsia (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.9) or neonatal acidemia (aOR 0.8, 95% CI 0.3-2.0), between high and low MC. Conclusion High MC is not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. © Thieme Medical Publishers.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbance and depression are among the most prevalent symptoms reported by women during pregnancy. Available data on the association between sleep and symptoms of depression in pregnant women are sparse and methodological limitations are noted. This study aimed to examine objective and subjective sleep disturbances and risk for clinical depression in third-trimester pregnant women. Methods: One hundred and sixty healthy third trimester pregnant women wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days to assess objective sleep quality and quantity. Their subjective sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with subjective poor sleep quality deined as a PSQI score > 5. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to evaluate symptoms of depression. The presence of clinical depression was deined by a CES-D score ≥ 16. Results: Women were 31.93 ± 4.43 years of age at 32.71 ± 2.53 weeks gestation, and 110 (68.8%) worked full-time. Objective actigraphy data showed that 72 (45.0%) women slept < 6.5 hours a night, 109 (68.1 %) women had a sleep eficiency < 85%, and 30 (18.8%) women required more than 30 minutes to fall asleep. Seventy-four (46.3%) women had subjective poor sleep quality, and 31 (19.4%) women had clinical depression. Clinical depression risk was signiicantly increased in women with objective nighttime sleep < 6.5 hours (OR = 6.16) and subjective poor sleep quality (OR = 5.10). Conclusion: Objective nighttime sleep < 6.5 hours and subjective poor sleep quality in healthy third-trimester pregnant women is associated with signiicant risks for clinical depression.

N2  - Introduction: Many pregnant women complain of poor sleep beginning in early pregnancy. Given that evidence implicates poor sleep as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes, it is imperative to ind nonpharmacological methods to improve sleep. Exercise has been shown to improve sleep quality and continuity among non-pregnant populations. Presently, few investigations have examined the beneits of exercise on sleep during pregnancy. Methods: The effects of time period and exercise on sleep eficiency in 183 pregnant women were investigated using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) while controlling for several covariates: Marital status, income, race, highest education level attained, age, BMI, caffeine consumption, depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Time period consisted of three levels (weeks 10-12, weeks 14-16, weeks 18- 20 gestation). Exercise was treated as a time-varying dichotomous variable: Those who exercised according to American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) guidelines (> 500 MET minutes/week) and those who did not. A natural log transformation of sleep eficiency was employed as the dependent variable to satisfy the normality assumption. Results: The main effect of time period was statistically signiicant (p = 0.02). Sleep eficiency increased over time in the sample as a whole. The main effect of exercise on sleep eficiency was not statistically signiicant (p = 0.28). However, the interaction between time period and exercise had a signiicant effect on sleep eficiency (p = 0.037). Further investigation of this interaction revealed a small but signiicant difference between subjects who met ACOG guidelines compared to those who did not during the third time period (p = 0.015). No signiicant differences between exercise groups were observed during the irst period (p = 0.97) or second period (p = 0.75). Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that incorporating the recommended amount of exercise in early pregnancy may impart positive effects on sleep. The interaction between exercise and sleep may have signiicant health implications, since positive health behaviors are associated with superior pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: 79% of the pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders, as 70% of pregnant women have some of the Depression symptoms. These disorders are the result of physiological, hormonal and physical changes of pregnancy occur from different causes, can affect disorders before, during and after childbirth can be involved in causing depression during pregnancy and may be aggravated by disregarding health behavior. This study evaluated the impact of behavioral health sleep education on the improvement of depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders. Materials and Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial, conducted on 96 pregnant women with sleep disorder (According to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality questionnaire). Tools for data collection included demographic questionnaire and beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire. After sampling (easy), participants were randomly (simple) divided into two groups. case group was presented health behavior sleep education during a four-hour session then followed up by Fill out the beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire in the one and two month after intervention by the subjects. The control group received no intervention (except routine prenatal care). Finally statistical methods used to analysis the result by spss version 18. Results: Significant change was reported in the depression of pregnant women with sleep disorders in the case group in comparison to the control group one and two month after intervention (p≤0.05). Conclusion: Findings from this study add support to the reported effectiveness of behavioral health sleep education in the prenatal care and clinical management of insomnia in pregnancy.

N2  - Pregnant women, both before and after childbirth, frequently experience memory deficits and disrupted sleep. In the present study we assessed the relationship between false memory generation and fragmented sleep during pregnancy and motherhood. We tested 178 pregnant women and 58 female non-pregnant childless controls, during pregnancy (15-35th week of gestation) and again after childbirth (8-13th month). False memories were defined as memories of gist words that were semantically related to studied word lists but were not presented during learning of these lists in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy in the home environment for seven consecutive nights. Compared to the controls, the group of pregnant women produced more false memories and displayed more fragmented sleep both during pregnancy and after childbirth. However, false memory generation was not correlated to measures of sleep fragmentation. These results show that pregnant women suffer from sleep fragmentation and a higher susceptibility to false memories, but leave open the question as to whether both phenomena are related. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Thesedisordersarethe result ofphysiological, hormonal, and physicalchangesoccurring in pregnancy due todifferent causes such as fetal Sex. This study aimed to evaluate the association of fetal sex and common complaints of pregnancy in pregnant women with sleep disorder. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted on 972 pregnant women with sleep disorders referring to two selected health care centers in Makou affiliated to Urmia University of Medical Sciences during June-Oct 2012. Data collection tools included demographic characteristics and Pittsburgh Standard Sleep Quality. Sampling was done by convenient sampling. Pregnant women with sleep disorders (Based on the PSQI) were selected as the subjects then demographic characteristics and beck depression standard questionnaires was completed by women, and statistical methods used to analysis. Results: The results indicated that there were significant association (p≤0.05) between fetal sex to backache (r=0.129) and vomiting(r=0.204). Women with female fetus's more than male experienced backpain and vomiting. Other complaints were not significantly different. Conclusion: Fetal gender is independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Although the added risk is relatively small, further investigation of the mechanisms underlying this association may contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of pregnancy complications such as sleep disorders.

N2  - Introduction: Rates of perinatal depression remain high and are associated with mental and physical health problems for mothers and their babies. In general populations and in pregnant women, sleep has been investigated as a contributing factor for depression. Whether or not pregnancy sleep affects postpartum mood and functioning remains unclear. Antidepressant treatment also affects sleep quality but has not been examined as a factor in the relationship between sleep and ongoing depression. Methods: 192 pregnant women (mean age 28.15 [SD = 5.727], 34.6% minority, 38.1% low SES, 44.7% unmarried, 45.2% with major depressive disorder (MDD) during pregnancy, and 39% with serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment participated in this study. Depression status was obtained with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSMIV Psychiatric Diagnoses. Level of depressive symptoms was obtained with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) and level of stress with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was utilized to measure sleep quality. All measures were administered in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and one month postpartum. Results: Using hierarchical linear regressions, adjusted for income and maternal education status, pregnancy PSQI scores explained 3.2% of the variance of postpartum IDS scores (p < .001) above and beyond the variance explained by pregnancy IDS scores and SRI treatment. SRI treatment was associated with higher PSQI scores even when MDD remitted. Pregnancy PSQI scores also explained 1.7% of the variance of postpartum PSQ scores (p < .011), beyond the variance explained by postpartum IDS scores. Conclusion: In a large sample of women, there is a unique effect of pregnancy sleep quality on postpartum depression and stress regardless of pharmacological treatment. These indings support prenatal sleep quality as a protective factor for postpartum depression and stress that could lead to high-impact avenues for improving perinatal health.

N2  - Introduction: Insuficient sleep and poor sleep quality among pregnant women have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, data regarding the frequency of and factors associated with sleep disturbances among pregnant women are lacking. Our objective was to determine sleep duration and continuity among nulliparous women, and to identify factors associated with variations in these sleep measures. Methods: Women enrolled in the nuMoM2b study, a multi-center prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with a singleton gestation, were recruited at the 2nd study visit (16 0/7-21 6/7 weeks') to wear an actigraph (ActiWatch, Philips Respironics) for 7 consecutive days. Sleep duration and continuity (measured by sleep fragmentation index, sleep eficiency, and wake time after sleep onset (WASO)) were studied in relation to factors previously associated with poor sleep quality (BMI, race/ethnicity, household income). Results: Actigraphy-derived sleep data (n = 369) indicates that median sleep duration was 7.5 (IQR 0.9) hours and was signiicantly in luenced by race/ethnicity with white, non-Hispanic women having the longest sleep duration (p < .0001). All sleep continuity measures were signiicantly associated with BMI, race/ethnicity and household income. Speciically, worse sleep continuity was seen in women with increasing BMI and in those with incomes below the poverty line; white, non- Hispanic women had better sleep continuity. With one exception, the demographic characteristics remained signiicant in multivariable models for the sleep continuity measures. For sleep fragmentation, poverty was no longer signiicant after adjustment for race/ethnicity. Conclusion: Nulliparous women sleep > 7 hours per night, on average. However, sleep-continuity measures indicate a wide range in sleep quality that is impacted by BMI, race/ethnicity and household income. The causes of and pregnancy outcomes associated with variations in sleep quality warrant further investigation.

N2  - Introduction: Disturbed sleep and impaired sleep quality are common complaints during pregnancy. Sleep disturbances associated with decreased delta spectral power are potential risk factors for pregnancy complications. However, there are few electroencephalography (EEG) studies on sleep during pregnancy. In this study, we aimed to assess if delta power differs between good sleepers and poor sleepers across pregnancy. Thus, the power spectral analysis (PSA) of sleep EEG was performed in pregnant women in both the irst and third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of previous prospective study. Pregnant women (n = 103; mean age = 27.06 ± 7.22 yrs) completed sleep questionnaires including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and underwent full lab-polysomnography in both the irst and third trimester of pregnancy. The PSQI is used to identify 'good sleepers' and 'poor sleepers'. Average spectral proiles were created for each NREM and REM cycle after removing waking and movement epochs and epochs containing micro or miniarousals. Random effect mixed linear regression analysis was used to explore relationships of delta power with sleep quality in NREM and REM cycles between two trimesters. Results: Mixed models showed signiicant group (good sleepers vs. poor sleepers) differences in delta power between the irst and third trimesters (b = -0.064, p = 0.037) after adjusting for age, objectively measured sleep eficiency, AHI, BMI, nap frequency, race and parity. Good sleepers had higher delta power than poor sleepers in both trimesters. Poor sleepers had lower delta power in the third trimester. However delta power in REM cycle did not differ between good and poor sleepers across pregnancy trimesters (b = -0.041, p = 0.19). Conclusion: Women who are good sleepers had high delta power in both trimesters in comparison with women who are poor sleepers. Sleep disturbances modify delta power during slow wave sleep. Improving sleep quality may improve the outcomes of pregnancy which are associated with decreased delta power.

N2  - Introduction: In nonpregnant population it has been shown that slowwave sleep (SWS) decreases in those with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), compared to those without SDB. There are few electroencephalography (EEG) studies on sleep during pregnancy. Furthermore, the changes in EEG sleep parameters during pregnancy, and especially the possible changes in total SWS, are inconsistent. The aim of the study is to determine if SWS changes during pregnancy by using Power Spectral Analysis (PSA) and to test the hypothesis that a greater decrease in SWS during pregnancy occurs in women with SDB. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of previous prospective study. Pregnant women (n = 103; mean age = 27.06 ± 7.22 yrs) completed sleep questionnaires and underwent full lab-polysomnography in the irst and third trimesters. Ten and 27 women in the irst and third trimesters, respectively, have AHI > 5. Average spectral proiles were created for each NREM cycle after removing waking and movement epochs and epochs containing micro or miniarousals. Linear regression was performed to explore relationships between delta power and changes between two trimesters. Using delta power changes between two trimesters as the outcome variable, AHI changes and demographic variables having a p < 0.2 in a bivariate analysis were reevaluated in full linear regression models as independent variables. Results: Delta power changed signiicantly between two trimesters (b = -0.06, p = 0.019, but the signiicance disappeared after adjusting for BMI (kg/m2), total sleep time and frequency of naps per week (b = -0.13, p = 0.051). However, AHI changes between two trimesters were signiicantly associated with delta power changes, after adjusting for age, race, parity, BMI gain and changes in total sleep time between trimesters (b = -0.019, p = 0.024). Conclusion: Delta power does not differ signiicantly between the irst and third trimesters. However, PSG-conirmed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may alter the quantity of delta power between trimesters.

N2  - Introduction: There is evidence indicating that Latinos in the U.S. experience short sleep duration. Socioeconomic and cultural factors may provide an explanation for why Latinos experience insuficient sleep. Insuficient sleep has negative physiologic and metal consequences. Because of the multiple life demands, such as childcare and work, and environmental factors, such as noise and light pollution, low-income Latino women experience insuficient sleep. However, few studies have examined the perceptions of sleep in this population. The purpose of this study was to describe the perceptions of sleep and its beneits, and the consequences of insuficient sleep among low-income Latino women of child-bearing age living in the U.S. Methods: Thirty-four low-income Latino women, between the ages of 21-35, responded in writing to ive semi-structured interview questions that elicited their perceptions of the importance of sleep and the impact of insuficient sleep on their health and daily lives. Responses to the ive interview questions were coded and collated into themes. The themes that emerged from the data analysis were used during four dissemination focus groups to validate results with the study participants. Results: The themes that emerged were “Sleep is the food for the body” where women explained how sleep was crucial to maintain and protect health. The second theme that emerged was “No sleep means I can't function.” In this theme participants described how insuficient sleep affects their day-to-day activities and family duties. Conclusion: Understanding how this group of Latino women perceives sleep and the impact of sleep deprivation in their lives will facilitate the creation of culturally sensitive programs that promote sleep in this undeserved population.

N2  - Introduction: Poor sleep is a frequent complaint often overlooked as a normal part of pregnancy; yet, relatively little is known about insomnia disorder during pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (gestational ages 18-32 weeks) were enrolled in a treatment study of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI). Eligible women who met DSM-IV criteria for insomnia and had no co-morbid affective or sleep disorders were recruited from community obstetric clinics. At baseline, participants completed an insomnia history timeline, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and one week of sleep diaries. Results: Fifteen women (age 32.1 ± 5.6) with a mean gestational age of 27 weeks (SD = 4.5 weeks) have enrolled in this study to date. Forty percent of women reported having at least one previous insomnia episode. Seventy three percent reported the current episode began during their current pregnancy. The ISI average score was 16.5 (SD = 4.1), with 46.7% of participants reporting being “very dissatisied” and “much distressed” with their sleep. Based on sleep diaries, the average sleep eficiency was 79% (SD = 6.1) with women on average taking 28.3 (SD = 19.8) minutes to fall asleep, waking 2.8 (SD = 1.3) times per night, and being awake for a total of 56.9 (SD = 37.7) minutes per night. Conclusion: Pregnant women enrolling in a study of non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia present with moderately severe insomnia, sleep patterns characterized by long time awake after sleep onset, and low sleep satisfaction scores. These indings suggest that insomnia during pregnancy warrants clinical attention and emphasizes the importance of demonstrating effective treatment in this population.

N2  - Introduction: Reliable assessment of inspiratory low limitation (IFL), characterized by lattening on a nasal pressure transducer tracing and likely relecting increased upper airway resistance, could enhance evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing, particularly among symptomatic patients with a low apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). However, the assessment of IFL is not standardized and despite the variety of manual and automated methods reported, few have been rigorously validated. We report here on the current agreement seen across multi-center manual scoring, with the long-term goal of developing a standardized, consensus-based approach for visual scoring of IFL in sleep studies. Methods: Consensus scoring rules for IFL were developed at each of 4 laboratories (McGill, Harvard, NYU, Instituto Do Sono). A total of 1000 epochs, sampled from 5 sleep studies on pregnant women with low AHI and varying degrees of IFL, were independently evaluated. Using software to tag each breath manually, 8 scorers rated IFL as follows: normal (N), intermediate (I) and deinitely low limited (FL). Breath-by-breath agreement was tabulated. Results: Of 5283 scored breaths, 1139 (21.6%) had > 80% agreement and were comprised of 52% FL-breaths, 16% I-breaths and 32% Nbreaths. The overall agreement across all breaths revealed an intra-class correlation coeficient of 0.46 (95% CI 0.41, 0.51). The agreement across breath categories was fair for FL-breaths (kappa = 0.36), poor for I-breaths (kappa = 0.12) and fair for N-breaths (kappa = 0.37). Conclusion: In this initial assessment, trained scorers from different sleep centers working with local deinitions of IFL varied substantially in their scoring, indicating that IFL is likely inconsistently identiied in clinical and research settings. Further work is required to establish a standardized, consensus-based approach that can then be applied to validate automated algorithms and evaluate relationships between IFL and clinical outcomes where AHI is low, such as in pregnancy and pediatric sleep apnea.

N2  - Introduction: The Surgeon General and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months, but only 13% of babies are exclusively breastfed at six months. The frequency of breastfeeding is even lower among women with comorbidities such as hypertension, gestational diabetes, and depression. These conditions are also more common in pregnant women with symptoms of sleepdisordered breathing (SDB). Importantly, SDB symptoms affect up to 35% of women by the third trimester. However, it is not known whether SDB plays a role in the frequency of breastfeeding. Methods: Pregnant women in their 3rd trimester were enrolled in a study of SDB and pregnancy outcomes. They completed a battery of sleep questionnaires including screening for SDB. Habitual snoring, as a surrogate measure of SDB, was deined as snoring ≥ 3 nights/week. Medical records were reviewed for infant feeding method at discharge and at the 6-week post-partum visit. Results: Thus far data from 104 mother-infant dyads have been collected. The mean age of women was 32.3 ± 6.0 years and 45% were irst time mothers. In total, 58% reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Overall, exclusive breastfeeding occurred in 75% of women at discharge, with an additional 7% who breastfed and supplemented with formula. There were no differences in the frequency of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge between women with and without habitual snoring during pregnancy (72.1% vs. 70.5%). At the 6-week follow up, the frequency of exclusive breastfeeding had reduced to 30% in the non-habitual snorers and 21% in women who reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Conclusion: Women with SDB during pregnancy may constitute another group who warrant additional support and education regarding breastfeeding and its many rewards.

N2  - Pregnant women are one of the susceptible groups for hypertensive disorders, since changes in pregnancy lead to increased stress on the cardiovascular system and finally result in pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia. Several studies on pregnant women have shown higher risks of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia following exposure to air pollution. So that pregnant women exposed to particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels during pregnancy, experience significant higher systolic blood pressure throughout pregnancy. On the other hand, prenatal and post-natal studies conducted in infants of population-based cohort study implicate the adverse effect of air pollution on normal function of respiratory system, lung volume, and inflammation of respiratory pathways and sleep quality of 5-week-old infants.

N2  - Introduction: While sleep continuity disturbance (insomnia) is a known risk factor for medical and mental health problems, to date no work has been undertaken on the speciic association between insomnia and reproductive health. Accordingly, the focus of the present investigation was to evaluate, in a preliminary way, whether sleep continuity disturbance is a risk factor for infertility. Methods: A pilot investigation was undertaken at the University of Pennsylvania's fertility practice that involved patients' completion of an online questionnaire in concert with a systematic review of each patient's electronic medical record data. Each individual (n = 57) completed a survey comprised of instruments to assess sleep; mood; stress; reproductive history; and demographics. The present analysis utilized the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) in women seeking fertility care to evaluate whether insomnia is associated with pregnancy history. Results: Twenty-ive per cent of women seeking infertility care reported clinically signiicant insomnia symptoms (ISI > 7). Women without elevated insomnia symptoms reported more prior pregnancies (M = 2.17; SD = .94) than women with elevated insomnia symptoms (M = .57; SD = .54) (p < .01). The number of pregnancies and insomnia severity did not vary by age or BMI. Conclusion: Women seeking fertility care appear to experience insomnia at higher rates than population norms (i.e., Ohayon's estimate that 8-18% of the population report dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity) and that insomnia in this group may be associated with reduced fecundity. If subsequent analyses and studies bear out this association, this may suggest that infertility care may be more successful given concomitant treatment for insomnia.

N2  - Introduction: Short sleep duration is associated with diabetes and pregnancy morbidity. Research in animal models has described a link between diabetes mellitus and elevated 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a biomarker of oxidative damage to DNA. We sought to evaluate the correlation between gestational diabetes (GDM) and 8-OHdG levels in maternal urine and umbilical cord blood (UCB) in term pregnant women with short sleep duration. Methods: A nested case cohort study was performed of term pregnancies enrolled in a prospective sleep disorders protocol. Subjects completed validated sleep questionnaires to assess for hypersomnolence and sleep duration. SSD was deined as ≤ 5 hours per night of sleep along with an abnormal sleep survey. Maternal urine and UCB was collected, stored at-80°C, and analyzed in duplicate for levels of 8-OHdG. Statistical analysis was performed using chi square, Man Whitney U and Spearman correlation. P < 0.05 was considered signiicant. Results: The cohort included 64 women and 32% had SSD. Comorbid conditions included obesity (38%), GDM (6%), gestational hypertension (3%), and chronic hypertension (3%). There was no signiicant correlation between 8-OHdG levels in UCB samples and maternal urine samples (r =-0.078, p = 0.63). The maternal urinary levels of 8-OHdG were similar between women with and without short sleep duration (29,400 ± 6,426 vs 30,977 ± 11,110 ng/mL, p = 0.29). Women with GDM had a higher umbilical cord 8-OHdG than women without GDM (18,298 ± 7,865 vs.12,092 ± 4,004 ng/ml, p = 0.008). A positive correlation between glucose values on the 1 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and levels of umbilical cord 8-OHdG (r = 0.53, p = 0.02) was noted but the correlation between glucose values and maternal urinary 8-OHdG (r = 0.39, p = 0.09) did not reach statistical signiicance. Conclusion: In our cohort, GDM but not SSD was associated with elevated levels of 8-OHdG in UCB but not maternal urinary samples. Further investigations are needed to identify the mechanisms leading to adverse pregnancy outcome among women with SSD.

N2  - Brief Introduction: Recently, in connection with possible different pathogenetic mechanisms of development, there is evidence of the division of preeclampsia on the early (before 34th week of pregnancy), and late (after 34th week). However, the exact pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not fully understood. Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the development of preeclampsia in connection with sleep apnea syndrome and the number of studies devoted to this issue is increasing. Materials & Methods: The study included 36 patients aged from 20 to 41 years, who were divided into two groups depending on the time of manifesting of preeclampsia. Inclusion criteria were: mild and severe preeclampsia, singleton pregnancies and woman's consent for the study. Exclusion criteria were: genetic fetal malformations, hypertension, severe somatic disorders and multiple pregnancy. Polysomnography was performed, as well as morphological study of the placentas. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 6.0. Clinical Cases or Summary Results: The average age of patients in the group with the early and late preeclampsia was 33.05 ± 1.36 years and 33.67 ± 1.18 years, and the number of nulliparous women was 10 and 9 people, respectively, and they were not statistically different (p>0.05). It should be noted that in this study early preeclampsia significantly differed from the late weight limitation on the time of prolongation of pregnancy. So, in group 1 in 61.1% (n = 11) cases preeclampsia was severe, and in 38.9% (n = 7) preeclampsia was moderate, whereas in group 2 severe preeclampsia was diagnosed in 11.1% (n = 2) cases and in 88.9% (n = 16)moderate preeclampsia (p<0.05). A lower value of the expression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 was set in placentas of women who suffered early preeclampsia. The most pronounced decrease of VEGF (by 17.1% in comparison with the control indicators) was observed in mesenchymal cells and VEGFR-2 in the syncytiotrophoblast by 29.7%. While indicators in the expression of VEGF during the late preeclampsia don't differ from those of the control group (p<0.05). Sleep apnea diagnosed significantly more frequently in the late (88.9%) compared with the early preeclampsia (5.5%). The average value of the index apnea/hypopnea in pregnant women with sleep apnea syndrome was 5.7 in the second group and 0.44 in the first group (p<0.05). The maximum index apnea-hypopnea in the group with late preeclampsia was 8. Conclusions: The decrease of level of expression of VEGF and its receptors in terminal placental villi, expressed in more observations with early preeclampsia demonstrates the role of endothelial growth factor vessels in the development of preeclampsia before 34th week of pregnancy. The revealed changes in immunohistochemical profile in terminal placental villi indicate damage to the placenta and accordingly lie at the basis of violations of prenatal development. However, the observed differences in placental terminal villous at the early and late preeclampsia, apparently, reflect the different pathogenetic mechanisms of their development. Basing on these data we can expect that the main cause of early preeclampsia is a disturbance of trophoblast invasion, late preeclampsia may be associated with pathogenic mechanisms such as intermittent hypoxia at night sleep apnea, which leads to endothelial dysfunction, systemic inflammatory response, oxidative stress.

N2  - Introduction: Research has shown that a bi-directional relationship exists between sleep and depression. Comparatively little research has investigated whether similar relationships exist between sleep and postpartum depression (PPD). Current research within this ield is limited b y cross-sectional designs and reliance upon subjective measures of sleep. Polysomnographic (PSG) evidence is lacking. The aims of this study were to: 1) examine longitudinal changes to sleep and fatigue from late pregnancy through to twelve weeks postpartum, and 2) examine relationships between subjective sleep, PSG-measured sleep, fatigue and PPD. Methods: Participants included healthy perinatal women (n = 29) who were asked to complete a week of sleep diaries along with the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), during the third trimester of pregnancy and at one and twelve weeks postpartum. Additionally, participants underwent one night of home PSG during the third trimester of pregnancy. Results: A series of repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed that, compared to late pregnancy and twelve weeks postpartum, the irst postpartum week was characterised by signiicantly less total sleep time (TST), more awakenings, more daytime napping and increased fatigue (ps < .05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that increased sleep onset latency and increased total amount of sleep during late pregnancy signiicantly predicted week 1 EPDS scores, after accounting for depressive symptoms during pregnancy (R2 = .554, F(2,23) = 11.01, p < .001). The strongest predictor of week 12 EPDS scores was depressive symptoms during pregnancy (R2 = .641, F(1, 18) = 28.59, p < .001). In contrast there were no signiicant correlations between pregnancy PSG sleep stage variables and PPD scores. Conclusion: Women experience signiicant changes to sleep across the perinatal period, with the poorest sleep occurring in the irst postpartum week. Dificulty falling asleep, increased TST and symptoms of depression during late pregnancy, signiicantly increase the risk of developing PPD.

N2  - Introduction: Well-controlled laboratory studies have demonstrated that sleep restriction in young adults alters appetite regulation, particularly with more desire for high-calorie food, which may increase the risk for weight gain. However, the relevance of these laboratory indings to real life is uncertain. We used a home-based intervention aimed at extending bedtimes and evaluated its effects on sleep duration and food desire in at-risk individuals. Methods: Overweight young adults (age: 21-40 years; BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) reporting average self-reported sleep duration of less than 6.5 hours were recruited. Exclusion criteria were insomnia, regular napping, shift work, extreme chronotype, recent travel across time zones, eating or psychiatric disorders, acute or chronic medical condition, alcohol abuse, smoking, pregnancy or childbirth (past year), any prescription medications, and current enrolment in diet or exercise programs. Habitual bedtimes for 1 week (baseline) were followed by bedtimes extended to 8.5 hours for 2 weeks (intervention). Participants were unaware of the intervention until after the baseline period. Participants received individualized behavioral counseling on sleep hygiene on the irst day of the intervention period. Sleep duration was continuously measured by actigraphy. Participants completed visual analog scales of vigor and appetite after baseline and intervention periods. Results: Participants (n = 10) had a mean age of 28.6 years and mean BMI of 28.0 kg/m2. Bedtime duration was increased by 1.8 hours with the intervention (6.4 vs. 8.2, p < 0.001). Sleep eficiency and latency were similar during both study periods. On average, participants obtained 1.6 hours more sleep with extended bedtimes (5.6 vs. 7.1; p < 0.001) and reported being less sleepy (p = 0.004) and more vigorous (p = 0.034). Sleep duration increased by an average of 1.4 hours on weekday nights and 1.9 hours on weekend nights. Additional sleep was associated with 14% decrease in overall appetite (p = 0.030) and 62% decrease in sweet and salty foods (p = 0.017). Desire for fruits, vegetables and protein-rich nutrients was not affected by added sleep. Conclusion: Sleep duration can be successfully increased in real life conditions and obtaining adequate sleep increases vigor and decreases cravings for weight promoting sweet and salty foods in overweight young adults who habitually curtail their sleep. This is the irst demonstration that sleep extension is feasible and has beneicial effects in real life settings where individuals have priorities and other responsibilities competing with sleep.

N2  - Introduction: Infants born with congenital abnormalities of the upper airway have signiicantly high risk for obstructive sleep apnea due to their anatomical and physiological predisposition towards airway collapse. This puts them at increased risk for failure to thrive, neurocognitive deicits and sudden infant death. Early diagnosis and management may have a signiicant role in minimizing the long-term complications. Treatment options in infants are often surgical and based on the underlying etiology. Report of Case: 86-day-old baby with Trisomy 21, esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal istula and patent ductus arteriosus was referred for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Baby was born at 39 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery, and had tracheoesophageal istula repair on the irst day of life. She had a soft cry, persistent stridor, and reported choking at night. Weight gain since birth was suboptimal at 15-20 grams per day. Physical exam was signiicant for Down's facies with mid-face hypoplasia, bilateral epicanthal folds, and glossoptosis. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) showed severe obstructive sleep apnea with an apnea-hypopnea index of 17 (46 in REM), stridor and paradoxical breathing. Minimum oxygen saturation was 89%. End tidal CO2 was normal. Therapeutic trial of supplemental oxygen via nasal canula didn't have signiicant beneit. Airway evaluation revealed moderate laryngomalacia and left vocal cord dysfunction. She is scheduled to undergo supraglottoplasty with follow up PSG 1 month after surgery. Conclusion: Infants with moderate to severe OSA and failure to thrive must receive aggressive treatment. Studies have shown poor tolerance to CPAP by infants. Adenotonsillectomy is effective in older children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Surgical management of laryngomalacia with supraglottoplasty is favored in infants with OSA. Other treatment modalities include lip-tongue adhesion, mandibular distraction osteogenesis, placement of nasopharyngeal tube and tracheostomy. This case demonstrates the need for aggressive evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of patients at risk for airway obstruction.

N2  - Introduction: Suboptimal sleep duration may contribute to the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through alterations in the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. However, few studies have studied the relationship between sleep and indicators of kidney function. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between self-reported sleep duration and kidney function in persons without CKD. Methods: Adults (≥ 20 years; N = 7,790) from the 2007-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were assessed for their habitual sleep duration (coded as < 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9+) and biomarkers of current kidney functioning including their urine albuminto- creatinine ratio (UACR) and glomerular iltration rate (GFR) estimated from the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant, had a previous sleep disorder diagnosis, or clinical indications of CKD (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g, GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, or self-reported kidney/liver problems). Weighted multinomial and polynomial regression analyses assessed whether UACR and GFR varied across sleep duration groups after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, body mass index, and self-reported history of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes. Results: After adjustment, sleep duration was associated with UACR both linearly (p = .016) and quadratically (p = .02), and GFR (only linear [p = .022]), such that elevated UACR was associated with shorter and longer sleep durations and higher GFR was associated with shorter sleep durations. Conclusion: In an U.S. representative sample of adults without CKD or diagnosed sleep disorders, extremes in reported sleep duration were related to higher 24-hour urine albumin excretion and short sleep duration was associated with a higher rate of glomerular iltration. Future research is needed to understand whether these associations indicate increased risk for kidney damage and cardiovascular risk.

N2  - Introduction: Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is an autosomal dominant muscle sodium channelopathy characterized by laccid muscle weakness or paralysis. Attacks can be precipitated or made worse by cold, rest after exercise, anesthesia, potassium loading, hunger, emotional stress, pregnancy and glucocorticoids. Sleep has not been well described as one of the triggers for paralysis. HPP can be confused with sleep paralysis and in some cases with cataplexy. Many patients go undiagnosed for decades. Neurology and sleep literature is lacking in sleep associated periodic paralysis. Methods: 61 year old woman with life long sleep onset associated paralysis which has resulted in chronic insomnia and fear of falling asleep. Paralysis can also be precipitated by eating salted peanuts. Results: She comes from a large family where many members suffer from the same condition (maternal grandmother, mother, sister, brother, and daughter) and only one of her brothers has been formally diagnosed. She was referred to sleep medicine clinic to evaluate for “narcolepsy variant” and was diagnosed there with HPP. Conclusion: HPP has varied presentations and should be considered in patients with sleep onset paralysis thus preventing prolonged time to appropriate diagnosis and treatment which can last for decades.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disruptions are more commonly reported in women compared to men and typically coincide with periods of hormonal luctuations like during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy or menopause. We have previously shown using a rat model that sex differences in sleep are due to effects of estradiol (E2) on sexually differentiated brain circuitry. These indings raise the possibility that the eficacy of sleep promoting drugs may be different in males and females and that E2 may modulate drug eficacy. Data from our laboratory suggest that orexin, a key neuropeptide involved in arousal, mediates E2's suppression of sleep. Here, we test the prediction that sleep promotion by dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORA-12, a gift from Merck) will be sex and E2 dependent. Methods: Gonadectomized female and male rats were itted with EEG/ EMG transmitters (Data Sciences International) and randomly assigned to either DORA-12 or vehicle treatment groups. DORA-12 (30 mg/kg) or vehicle was given orally prior to lights out (ZT12) each day. Females received an oil injection and then two doses (5 μg and 10 μg) of estradiol benzoate 24 hrs apart at ZT21, while males received only oil injections. Mean time in wake, NREM and REM sleep was determined for the 12 hr dark period designated baseline and E2-day. Results: As previously shown, DORA-12 signiicantly suppressed wake in males 3-4 hr post-administration. Wakefulness returned to VEH levels by ∼ZT15. Surprisingly, wake suppression and consequently increased sleep in both oil and E2-treated females were steady across the 12 hr dark phase following DORA-12 administration. However, the magnitude of the sleep suppression was signiicantly attenuated in females treated with E2 and DORA-12. The effects of DORA-12 were signiicantly suppressed by E2 in the irst 6 hr following administration. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the eficacy of DORA-12 is sex and E2 dependent. Sex differences in sleep circuitry and/or drug metabolism may contribute to increased sleep promotion in females compared to males.

N2  - Purpose: Prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems, however the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study was designed to investigate whether prenatal AED exposure affects the quality of neonatal brain activity measured by EEG. Method: Pregnant women (n = 48) with epilepsy treated with AEDs were recruited in the Helsinki area. Fullterm babies from these pregnancies born between 4/2010 and 9/2013 were compared to a cohort of newborns (n = 54) unexposed to AEDs or other neurotropic drugs. The EEG was recorded during daytime sleep at 41-42 weeks of conceptional age. The EEG was assessed both visually and by using a custom-scripted detection algorithm. We focused on measuring the known neonatal oscillatory activities (bouts) at theta (temporal (TT) and frontal (FT) areas) and alpha (frontal [FA]) frequencies during active sleep. We counted their number visually, while computerized analysis defined the average duration of single bouts and their proportional duration within the record. Results: Both the visual and automated analysis showed that the oscillatory bouts at theta frequency (TT, FT) were comparable in the study groups, and visual analysis found no difference in alpha range either. However, the average duration of FA bouts was slightly but significantly (p = 0.035) longer in the newborns exposed to AEDs (mean 0.47 ± 0.017s [SEM]) as compared to the control newborns (mean 0.44 ± 0.013 s). Conclusion: The use of AEDs during pregnancy has very little effect on the oscillatory activities in the neonatal brain. The mechanisms or physiological significance of frontal alpha frequency activity in the newborn is unknown, hence the upcoming follow-up of this cohort may offer insights into the neurodevelopmental significance of frontal alpha oscillation in newborns.

N2  - EEG is informative and safe method to assessment cerebral functions in premature infants. Formations of typical neonatal EEG patterns in premature infants depend on postmenstrual age and brain damage. There are two main background EEG patterns of premature infants before 34 weeks: trace discontinue and constant activity. We analyzed 10 EEG of preterm infants 24-33 weeks of gestation, with ischemic brain damage, recorded with 13 electrodes for median duration 60'. EEG was recorded on the neonatal intensive care unit at 1 week after birth. All infants were divided in two groups: first group included 6 premature infants with intraventricular hemorrhage 3-4 stages (medium gestations age was 26 ± 3 weeks, medium Apgar score 2.8/ 4.2), and second group included 4 premature infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - HIE (medium gestations age was 27 ± 5 weeks, medium Apgar score 4.0/5.8). Results: EEG in all infants with intraventricular hemorrhage showed trace discontinue. In this pattern intervals of depression of activity more 10'' (17-36'') were present in all patient with interventricular hemorrhage and in only one infant with HIE. Main EEG rhythm of constant activity was delta 1-3 Hz. Interhemispherical asymmetrical activity more than 50% recognized in 4 infants with intraventricular hemorrhage, and in 3 - with HIE. Asymmetrical burst activity recorded in 5 infants with intraventricular hemorrhage, and in 1 with HIE. Sleep-awake cycle wasn't detected. Conclusions: depression of bioelectrical activity within trace discontinue was more sever in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage, pathological interhemispherical asymmetrical activity was recorded in infants of both groups, and asymmetrical burst activity was detected primarily in infants with intraventricular hemorrhage.

N2  - Objectives Recent studies suggest that shift workers who experience exposure to light at night could be at increased risk for adverse reproductive outcomes. Method Defined by cyclical patterns of circulating hormones, the reproductive system is vulnerable to shifts in circadian rhythms, either through sleep disturbances, altered melatonin production, exposure to light at night, or some other mechanism. Several occupational groups, including health care workers, law enforcement, firefighters, and manufacturing workers are required to work night shifts. Worldwide, millions work at least one night per month. Results Research will be reviewed on shift work and reproductive outcomes, including menstrual cycle patterns, fertility, pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, and birth weight. The limitations of current research will also be discussed: is there a dose response effect from the number of years of shift work, or can the effects be reversed once shift work stops? Are there different effects from permanent night shift versus rotating shift involving nights? Conclusions Future research needs will be identified, including the need for validation of self-reported shift work data and the mechanisms by which shift work affects reproductive health. Recommendations for shift workers and employers will be explored.

N2  - There is growing evidence suggesting than type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep breathing disorders. However, it is unknown whether these sleep disturbances affect the structure of sleep. For this purpose we designed a case-control study between 28 T2DM patients and 56 non-diabetic subjects, closely matched by age, gender, BMI, waist and neck circumferences, smoking status, and the apnea-hypopnea index (IAH). The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory disease, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease, alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examination included a electroencephalography and respiratory polysomnography. No differences in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep (13.5±8.2 vs. 12.8±7.4 % of total time of sleep, p=0.689) nor in the Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) Sleep stages (stage 1: 18.6±12.4 vs. 15.1±13.0 %TTS, p=0.243; stage 2: 58.1±14.0 vs. 59.3±12.5 %TTS, p=0.688; stage 3: 12.5±10.5 vs. 12.3±10.2 %TTS, p=0.924; stage 4: 13.8±10.8 vs. 12.4±10.4 %TTS, p=0.594) were observed between subjects with and without T2DM. However, T2DM patients showed a higher number of microaurousals (or brief awakenings) events than control subjects [34.1 (4.6 to 101.4) vs. 22.7 (1.3 to 93.1) events per hour during the TTS, p=0.023]. A significant positive correlation between microarousals and the AHI was detected (r=0.807, p<0.001). Finally, a stepwise regression analysis showed that both the AIH and the presence (or not) of T2DM (but not gender, age, BMI, neither neck circumference) independently predicted the presence of microarousals (R2=0.593). Therefore, T2DM adversely affects structure of sleep, becoming an independent risk factor for higher rates of microarousals. As sleep fragmentation has been involved with increased levels of lipids and blood pressure, this increased rate of microarousals may be implicated in the progression of cardiovascular disease in T2DM.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive events during apneas typically occur during the inspiratory phase. Central apneas are commonly seen with neurologic conditions or heart failure. We present a series of relatively healthy patients with expiratory apneas due to possible palatal obstruction, which can sometimes mimic central apneas. Methods: Retrospective review of eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with clinical suspicion for expiratory apneas, and various degrees of central apneas, who underwent clinical evaluation and overnight polysomnography. Results: Eight patients with a median age of 36 years (3-53 years), BMI of 25.7 ± 5.6 and AHI of 26.4 ± 22.4 were studied. One pregnant patient exhibited sudden mid-exhalation breathing pauses starting with a light lapping noise, breath holding for 5 to 10 seconds, sudden exhalation out through the mouth, a few cycles of hyperventilation, and repeated breath holding episodes. This resolved postpartum. Video of expiratory palatal obstruction was documented in two patients. One of these patients had complete resolution after palatal surgery. Four patients had history suggestive of REM-related central events, with two of these four patients documenting central events only in stage REM. In three patients, cardio-ballistic oscillations were not seen in the nasal channel, implying obstructed breathing. Four patients endorsed moaning. In one of these patients, moaning resolved partially after surgery. Conclusion: Expiratory apneas have been described in the literature. The indings presented in this study suggest that palatal obstructions during nasal exhalation can be mistakenly scored as central apneas. Classic central apneas are seen in lighter stages of non-REM sleep, particularly after arousals or sleep stage changes. Two patients in our series had central events only in stage REM. Polysomnography revealed tracings typical for central apneas, including lat nasal, oral, chest and abdominal signals for more than 10 seconds. These events begin mid-exhalation, ending with sudden oral exhalation. Vocalization during central apneic episodes can also occur. Shorter pauses may lead to symptomatic obstructions and arousals, with many of these events being scored as a RERA or an arousal. Expiratory palatal apneas must be considered in healthy, younger individuals with central apneas of unclear etiology. Catathrenia can also possibly be explained by expiratory palatal obstruction. A thorough history and physical examination must be undertaken to look for the presence of expiratory soft palatal obstruction during nasal exhalation.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common cause of sleep disturbance (PREVALENCE -6%) in the middle aged population. This clinical syndrome is described as a movement-responsive, quiescegenic nocturnal focal akathisia usually with dysesthesias. RLS can be primary or secondary. Primary is idiopathic and is familial in up to 40% cases. Secondary causes include iron deiciency anemia, renal failure and pregnancy. RLS has been reported in association with central and peripheral nervous system pathology such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, ALS, stroke, spinal stenosis, lumbosacral radiculopathy, acute spinal cord lesions and polyneuropathies. However, a literature search has not revealed prior reports of RLS in association with brain tumors. Report of Case: We report 3 cases of RLS: 1 case appeared at the diagnosis of brain tumor, the other two got exacerbated after resection of brain tumors. Two of these cases did not have other factors causing RLS, and in one case RLS persisted after iron supplementation. Case1: A 32 year old female with rosette forming glioneural tumors in the tectal and pineal regions, and in bilateral thalami. Around the time of diagnosis of her tumor, she developed RLS symptoms that were “very severe” based on the IRLS rating scale. Case2: A 44 year old female with a history of right frontal lobe glioblastoma for which she underwent tumor resection. After tumor resection, she developed RLS symptoms which were “very severe” based on the IRLS rating scale. Case3: A 62 year old male with prolactinoma that was resected trans-sphenoidally. Post resection, he developed RLS symptoms that were “very severe” based on the IRLS scale. Conclusion: We present cases of brain tumor that possibly have an association with RLS, and this is as yet unreported. Clinicians should be aware of the possible association, and be vigilant to look to for and treat these symptoms in such patients.

N2  - A 37 y.o. primipara was closely followed because of severe bronchiectasis (FEV1 1.4 l = 45%). In week 29+6 she complained about increased dyspnea and productive coloured sputum. Nocturnal hypoxia (mean 89%), decrease in lung function (FEV1 1.26 l = 40%, FVC 3.07 l = 84%) and daytime oxygenation (93%) were detected. She was admitted to an obstetrics ward and treated interdisciplinary to a) protect the child, b) prolong pregnancy with optimized ventilation, c) avoid caesarean section to maintain the patients' ability to cough, and d) avoid intubation. Besides physiotherapy, oxygen, inhaled and intravenous antibiotics, ventilation was monitored non-invasively using ptCO2. In week 31 intermittent nocturnal hypercapnia (ptCO2max 6.2 kPa) developed. Succeeding lung function testing revealed an FEV1 increase to 1.4 l (45%), but FVC decreased to 2.84 l (84%). Sustaining treatment goals, nocturnal non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was installed and physiotherapy reinforced. Basic assisted/controlled mode was chosen, resulting in normoventilation. Dyspnea and cough were well controlled. In week 33, NIV-modifications became necessary, causing undulating hypo- and hyperventilation during sleep. We thus switched to volume assured ventilation (iVAPS). iVAPS maintained ptCO2 within normal range. Induction of natural birth was undertaken in week 36 but was followed by stalled labour, foetal tachycardia and necessitated daytime ventilatory support. At 36+2, a healthy girl was delivered by semielective caesarean section under continued iVAPS ventilation. iVAPS modus ensured perfect adaption of ventilation to changed pulmonary restriction patterns and could be stopped shortly after birth. Conclusion: ptCO2 was a key in following management goals in this high-risk pregnancy and ensured safe late delivery.

N2  - Background: We are unaware of any other multidisciplinary multi-angled systematic approach to harness all the rich sources and types of available information, encompassing the full reproductive period from pre-pregnancy through into childhood. In February 2013, we were able to create a virtual MS Centre of Excellence (MS-CERCH) with the goal of initiating a multidisciplinary, coordinated platform capable of addressing a number of important clinical and developmental questions by bringing together population-based data derived from linking multiple health administrative and education-related databases together with detailed clinical, interview-based and questionnaire derived information. This platform will provide prospectively collated data for: (i) women with MS (including drug therapies, all pregnancy outcomes, reason(s) for any pregnancy losses, MS relapse rates corrected for MS course prior to pregnancy); (ii) men with MS who are fathering a pregnancy (including drug exposure during conception, relapse rates post delivery related to the stress and loss of sleep with a newborn); and (iii) the children of parent(s) with MS, including early, mid and late childhood developmental outcomes (0-12 years). Methods: The meeting included a wide range of health care professionals, researchers and trainees who exchanged ideas and discussed feasibility. Results: The MS-CERCH mandate was agreed upon, namely “To provide evidence in reproductive decision-making and parenting related issues to individuals with MS and related disorders”. Work is in progress to conduct collaborative projects. Conclusions: The purpose of this abstract is to introduce this multicentre endeavour to international colleagues who may want to join with MS-CERCH.

N2  - Histamine has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, appetite, endocrine homeostasis, body temperature, pain perception, and learning andmemory processes. Histamine neurons, which are located entirely in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) of the posterior hypothalamus, send axonal projections to nearly all central nervous systembrain regions. We have previously reported that the voluntary consumption of moderate quantities of ethanol during pregnancy causes long-lasting alterations in histamine H3 receptor-mediated inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission in the dentate gyrus of adult Long-Evans offspring. Whether this alteration is a consequence of direct effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on histamine neurons has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined whether prenatal ethanol exposure alters the number of histaminergic neurons in the TMN. Long-Evan rat dams consumed either a 0% or 5% ethanol solution for four hours each day throughout pregnancy. Themean daily ethanol consumption of 2.72 g/kg has been previously reported to produce a mean peak maternal serum ethanol concentrations of 84 mg/dL. Six adult male offspring fromeach prenatal treatment group were perfused with 4%paraformaldehyde and then serial coronal sections collected throughout the TMN for light microscopic immunohistochemistry. The sections were stained with an antibody against histidine decarboxylase (HDC) and HDC-positive neurons counted in each section. No significant differences were observed in either the total number of HDC-positive cells throughout the TMN or within individual clusters of HDC-positive neurons. These results indicate that the total number of histaminergic neurons does not appear to be affected by moderate prenatal ethanol exposure. Whether higher levels of maternal ethanol consumption affects histamine neurons remains to be investigated. Further, subsequent studies could examine the distribution and density of HDC-containing nerve terminal fibers in various cortical and subcortical brain regions as well as other markers of histaminergic transmission, including the activity of HDC and N-methyltransferase, the enzymes respectively responsible for the synthesis and degradation of transmitter-specific histamine.

N2  - CASE: Thomas is a 5-year 6-month-old boy whose parents requested an urgent care appointment because he has recently been suspended from kindergarten stating "and his doctor must see him before he can come back." His suspension from kindergarten was due to kicking and biting his classmates, but he has also become increasingly aggressive at home. His teacher reported that he has always had a high activity level and difficulty shifting attention between tasks, as well as noncompliance with rules and directions. He is noted to have learning challenges and is showing difficulties in the concept of numbers and letter sounds. The practice has followed Thomas since his healthy birth. He has a history of delayed language development, and he received early intervention services from 2 years of age. He spoke his first word at 2 years 6 months. He started a half-day preschool program at 3 years of age. He had difficulty acclimating to preschool, interacting with peers, and was described as "hyperactive" by his teachers. His program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom. His parents have always described him as a "difficult child." He gets frustrated easily and can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs or requests are not met. He has difficulty falling asleep, has frequent night awakenings, and often has trouble getting back to sleep. His self-help skills are poor, and he has difficulty with activities such as brushing his teeth and dressing. His parents report that he does not seem to remember rules from day to day. He was evaluated at 5 years of age and diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but his response to stimulants has been limited. Thomas is an only child. His parents are college educated and professionally employed. They deny drug use, domestic violence, and guns in the home. They reported that prior to the pregnancy, they enjoyed "partying" with friends on the weekends, but Thomas's mother reported that she stopped drinking as soon as she realized she was pregnant. All are wondering whether this child might have a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, although he seems to have no clear facial dysmorphology. It is unsure what the next step might be and if there is value added in pursuing this diagnosis. What do you do next?

N2  - Objectives Flight attendant occupational exposures include cosmic ionising radiation and circadian disruption. We wanted to determine whether these and other occupational exposures were associated with spontaneous abortion among female flight attendants. Method Female flight attendants from three US airlines in three cities were interviewed. Company records of over 1.9 million individual flights during the study period were assessed for exposure to galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle event radiation, and circadian disruption. Measures of physical job demands and other occupational factors were obtained from the interview. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for age, parity, and nonflying status. Results Among 2273 women interviewed, 840 pregnancies among 673 women met inclusion criteria. There was evidence to suggest that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may be associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion in weeks 9-13 of the first trimester (odds ratio (OR)=1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-3.20). The risk of a first trimester spontaneous abortion was significantly increased with 15 h or more of flying during home base normal sleep hours (OR=1.54; 95% CI 1.07-2.21) and with high physical job demands (OR=2.49; 95% CI 1.49-4.16). Conclusions Spontaneous abortion was associated with several flight attendant occupational exposures. This is the first report of these associations based on a quantitative assessment of distinct exposures generated from individual flight records.

N2  - Background: The United Kingdom has one of the highest rates of stillbirth in Europe, resulting in approximately 4,000 stillbirths every year. Potentially modifiable risk factors for late stillbirths are maternal age, obesity and smoking, but the population attributable risk associated with these risk factors is small.Recently the Auckland Stillbirth Study reported that maternal sleep position was associated with late stillbirth. Women who did not sleep on their left side on the night before the death of the baby had double the risk compared with sleeping on other positions. The population attributable risk was 37%. This novel observation needs to be replicated or refuted.Methods/Design: Case control study of late singleton stillbirths without congenital abnormality. Controls are women with an ongoing singleton pregnancy, who are randomly selected from participating maternity units booking list of pregnant women, they are allocated a gestation for interview based on the distribution of gestations of stillbirths from the previous 4 years for the unit. The number of controls selected is proportional to the number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital over the previous 4 years.Data collection: Interviewer administered questionnaire and data extracted from medical records. Sample size: 415 cases and 830 controls. This takes into account a 30% non-participation rate, and will detect an OR of 1.5 with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% for variables with a prevalence of 57%, such as non-left sleeping position.Statistical analysis: Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and unconditional logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders.Discussion: The hypotheses to be tested here are important, biologically plausible and amenable to a public health intervention. Although this case-control study cannot prove causation, there is a striking parallel with research relating to sudden infant death syndrome, where case-control studies identified prone sleeping position as a major modifiable risk factor. Subsequently mothers were advised to sleep babies prone (" Back to Sleep" campaign), which resulted in a dramatic drop in SIDS. This study will provide robust evidence to help determine whether such a public health intervention should be considered.Trial registration number: NCT02025530. © 2014 Platts et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this review was to summarize evidence for the effectiveness of music therapy (MT) and to assess the quality of systematic reviews (SRs) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Study design: An SR of SRs based on RCTs. Methods: Studies were eligible if they were RCTs. Studies included were those with at least one treatment group in which MT was applied. We searched the following databases from 1995 to October 1, 2012: MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, Global Health Library, and Ichushi-Web. We also searched all Cochrane Database and Campbell Systematic Reviews up to October 1, 2012. Based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, we identified a disease targeted for each article. Results: Twenty-one studies met all inclusion criteria. This study included 16 Cochrane reviews. As a whole, the quality of the articles was very good. Eight studies were about "Mental and behavioural disorders (F00-99)"; there were two studies on "Diseases of the nervous system (G00-99)" and "Diseases of the respiratory system (J00-99)"; and there was one study each for "Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-90)", "Diseases of the circulatory system (I00-99)", and "Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O60)". MT treatment improved the following: global and social functioning in schizophrenia and/or serious mental disorders, gait and related activities in Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. Conclusion: This comprehensive summary of SRs demonstrated that MT treatment improved the following: global and social functioning in schizophrenia and/or serious mental disorders, gait and related activities in Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. MT may have the potential for improving other diseases, but there is not enough evidence at present. Most importantly, no specific adverse effect or harmful phenomenon occurred in any of the studies, and MT was well tolerated by almost all patients. © 2014 Kamioka et al.

N2  - Background: Previous studies indicate that objective and subjective sleep parameters correlate with prenatal depressive symptoms. Poor sleep is associated with circadian rhythm disruptions. However, the role of rhythm disruptions in the pathophysiology of prenatal depression has not been evaluated. We assessed the role of sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances on the severity of depressive symptoms in late pregnancy. Methods: Twenty-one women in their third trimester of pregnancy were studied. Depressive symptoms and sleep quality were assessed using the Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Objective sleep parameters were assessed using Actigraphy. The Biological Rhythm Interview for Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) was used as a self-reported proxy for circadian rhythmicity. Results: EPDS scores were strongly correlated with BRIAN (r=0.69, p<0.001) and moderately correlated with PSQI (r=0.32, p=0.14). EPDS score was not associated with sleep efficiency (r=-0.08, p=0.71) and was only modestly correlated with wake after sleep onset (r=-0.22, p=0.30), number of awakenings (r=0.20, p=0.35), and sleep fragmentation (r=0.26, p=0.24). Following linear regression, BRIAN was the only significant predictor of EPDS (t=3.224, p=0.005). Furthermore, BRIAN score alone accounted for 45% of the variance in EPDS (adjusted R2=0.45). Conclusions: Contrary to previous research, subjective and objective sleep parameters were only modestly correlated with prenatal depressive symptoms. Circadian rhythm disruptions accounted for a larger proportion of the variance in depressive symptom severity. These preliminary results suggest that circadian rhythms are likely a significant component of the pathophysiology of prenatal depression. Future objective studies of circadian rhythmicity during late pregnancy are required.

N2  - Background: Elevated body mass index (BMI) has been identified as a risk factor for depression and for cardiovascular disease(CVD). Decreases in autonomic response and circadian interruptions may partially reflect BMI's contribution to this risk. As pregnancy is a period of increased susceptibility to the development of depressive mood and other CVD obstetric complications including preeclampsia, we assessed the impact of pre-pregnancy BMI on autonomic and circadian function during pregnancy. Methods: Our sample consisted of 24 women(28-34 weeks gestation). Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was calculated by averaging reported pre-pregnancy weight, and reported weight gain since conception subtracted from current weight. Women were grouped by normal BMI(<25) and moderate to high BMI(≥25). Biological rhythms were assessed using the self-report Biological Rhythm Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry(BRIAN) and autonomic functioning was examined through 24 hour electrocardiography, focusing on heart rate variability(HRV). Statistical analysis included Welch's t-tests with the false discovery rate correction. Results: Significant differences were observed between normal and overweight women in HRV(ASDNN5:t(21)=2.38, p=0.035; SDANN5:t(21)=2.43, p=0.035; SDNN:t(21)=2.61, p=0.031), where high BMI was associated with decreased HRV. BRIAN scores also differed between groups(t(21)=2.93, p=0.023), with the overweight women having increased scores, suggesting increased circadian disruption. The activity(t(21)=4.08, p=0.004) and social(t(16)=2.97, p=0.023) subscales of the BRIAN significantly contributed to the group differences, while sleep and eating did not. Conclusions: Women who have a moderate to high BMI prior to pregnancy manifest altered autonomic and circadian functioning. This may predispose women to the development of depressed mood and risk for CVD obstetric complications, such as preeclampsia.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Despite frequent sleep-related complaints among pregnant women, there is a paucity of data describing sleep changes in normal pregnancy. Recent investigations have focused on sleep disturbances and adverse perinatal outcomes with disordered sleep. This study describes longitudinal sleep changes in normal pregnancy. METHODS: Sleep actigraphy has been validated to provide accurate sleep-wake cycle data using a wrist-worn device by measuring varying degrees of movement. Nine women were followed throughout uncomplicated pregnancies, collecting actigraphy data 7 consecutive nights each trimester, including time to sleep onset (sleep latency), time awake after sleep onset, number and duration of awakenings, and total sleep time. Quantitative data were compared using repeatedmeasures analysis of variance, and P<.05 was significant. RESULTS: Time awake after sleep onset and number of nighttime awakenings increased as pregnancy progressed (34.2-46.6 minutes first to third trimester, P=.03; 43.7-57.1 episodes second to third trimester, P=.03). Sleep latency decreased as pregnancy progressed but not significantly. No difference was observed in total amount of sleep. CONCLUSIONS: This study objectively demonstrates a number of sleep changes previously subjectively assumed in pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, women are awake more after initially falling asleep both in the time spent awake and the number of awakenings. Although there is a trend toward decreased sleep latency, it is not clear at this time. Studies using larger sample sizes will be needed to further define sleep changes in a normal pregnancy.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Regional anesthesia as a standard of care for labor pain relief or for Cesarean section in Obstetric anesthesia is widely practiced. In the high-risk obese parturient, it is even more crucial to provide a safe regional anesthetic in order to avoid the risks of general anesthesia. Obesity in women of reproductive age is associated with obstructive sleep apnea, preeclampsia, and a greater likelihood for difficult intubation. Since thrombocytopenia of < 100 × 109. L-1 affects about 1% of parturients, the current literature suggested a platelet count cut-off at 75 to 80 × 109. L-1 for the safe placement of regional anesthesia. But, one study by Tanaka et al, advocated for a lower cut-off at 50 × 109. L-1 which excluded preeclamptic patients. In this study, our goal was to integrate the incidence of obesity, preeclampsia, and thrombocytopenia, given the large, high risk patient population seen at our institution, and further investigate the safety and efficacy of regional anesthesia forthe support of lowering the safe platelet count to as low as 50 × 109. L-1. METHODS: The Clinical Looking Glass (CLG), the patented hospital software program, was utilized to identify 20,244 obstetric patients who delivered in our hospital between September 2009 - 2013. A retrospective, detailed chart review was then performed for 256 parturients (1.3%) who had platelet counts </= 100 × 109. L-1 noted at the time of pre-anesthesia assessment. The etiology of the thrombocytopenia, type of anesthetic technique, mode of delivery, major neurological and anesthetic complications, and BMI were also collected. There were no exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the 256 parturients, 151 (59%) had received regional anesthesia. From 80 - 100 × 109. L-1, 75% of the patients (131/175) received regional anesthesia (89 epidural/37 spinal/5 CSE) and the mean BMI was 31.37 +/- 5.65. From 50 - 79 × 109. L-1, 25% of the patients (19/76) received regional anesthesia (10 epidural/9 spinal) and the mean BMI was 31.41 +/- 4.94. One out of 13 patients below 50 × 109. L-1 received an epidural regional anesthetic and the mean BMI was 35.82 +/- 10.20. There were no neurological complications found. CONCLUSION: From our high risk parturient population, an average BMI of > 30 was found in all the subgroups, with the highest present with a platelet count < 50 × 109. L-1. The lack of complication with regional anesthesia placed in our parturients supports the need to promote its safe use for a platelet count > 50 × 109. L-1. In the future, the supplemental look at the platelet function with the count can further help identify those with a greater risk for complications from regional anesthesia.

METHODS: We recruited 29 pregnant women (13 nulliparous, 16 multiparous) and 13 nonpregnant women as controls who met the criteria for inclusion (ie, healthy, ages 18-35 years, body mass index 20-35 kg/m2). Sleep quality and duration were measured using Actigraphic sleep watches. Oral glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1C, and cortisol levels were also measured. RESULTS: One-way analysis of variance yielded no significant differences among the three groups in bedtime sleep duration (F [2, 38] 1.240, P,.301, or daily sleep content, F [2, 37] 1.538, P≤.229). Significant differences were in the high number of wake episodes (F [2, 37] 9.855, P<.001) and higher sleep fragmentation index in pregnant women (F [2, 37] 5.023, P<.012). We found a significant correlation between increased sleep disturbances and elevated hemoglobin A1C in pregnant women (r=0.4649, n=25, P<.017). By contrast, cortisol levels did not correlate significantly with elevated HbA1C (r=20.2398, n=25, P,.229). Three pregnant women had elevated 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test scores (greater than 153 mg/dL glucose). These same pregnant women also had poor sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: The results were consistent with our proposition that poor sleep quality may be a risk factor for gestational diabetes mellitus.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: An efficient and efficacious method to screen for sleep disturbance in the clinical setting has not been systemically designed for use among pregnant women. The current study used a large prospective database to derive a short-form sleep scale and examined its predictive value on pregnancy risks. METHODS: Data were collected from 1,157 gravidae attending three outpatient clinics (2010-2012). Sleep patterns were assessed by the Berlin questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and questions on napping behavior. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to construct a short-form sleep scale, which would be predicted to perform with a higher degree of sensitivity and specificity among gravidae. Adjusted relative risks of pregnancy risks were estimated for the short-form scale, body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2, hypertension, and screening positive on the Berlin questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale using generalized linear models. RESULTS: Our derived short-form sleep scale consisted of four items on snoring frequently, bothersome snoring, stopped breathing while sleeping, and falling asleep while driving. Factor loadings ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 (P<.001) and demonstrated adequate model fit (root mean square error of approximation 0.04, confirmatory fit index 0.99, Tucker- Lewis Index 0.98). A higher score on the short-form sleep scale was associated with preeclampsia (adjusted relative risk 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.59). A body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2, hypertension, and screening positive on the Berlin questionnaire were associated with gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, small-for-gestational age neonate, large-for-gestational age neonate, or both. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was not associated with outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This four-item scale on sleep disturbance during pregnancy was associated with preeclampsia adjusting for confounders. This scale may be used by clinicians to quickly assess the effect of sleep disturbance on pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is a rare encephalitis first described in 2007. It comprises 1-4% of all cases of encephalitis. We describe the case of a parturient with a history of paraneoplastic anti -NMDA receptor encephalitis secondary to ovarian teratoma and discuss the anaesthetic management of her delivery. Case report: A 36-year-old woman was referred to our highrisk anaesthetic antenatal clinic at 32 weeks of gestation. Six years previously the patient had presented with increasing confusion which progressed to coma. A diagnosis of anti - NMDA receptor encephalitis was made due to ovarian teratoma; anti-NMDA receptor antibodies were detected by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. She underwent salpingooophorectomy but required tracheostomy with prolonged ventilation and recovery. Residual problems included shortterm memory impairment, fatigue and balance problems, obstructive sleep apnoea requiring CPAP and symptomatic tracheal stenosis secondary to tracheostomy. A multidisclinary approach was required for the management of her delivery. ENT review was undertaken to assess severity of tracheal stenosis. Neurology review suggested current antibody levels were unlikely to be significant. Delivery was by elective caesarean section under combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia. Surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful with good maternal and fetal outcome. Discussion: Anti -NMDA receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune neurological disorder, with 80% of cases occurring in young women. It can present with psychiatric symptoms , impaired consciousness and centra l hypoventilation. Antibodies bind to the NR1/NR2 heteromers of the NMDA receptor causing inhibition of the receptor and its down-regulation and action of drugs acting at this receptor, such as ketamine, nitrous oxide and tramadol, may be altered. Antibodies are of IgG type, which may cross the placenta and this may have implications for the neonate. Like other autoimmune disorders, it may improve during pregnancy with risk of relapse post partum. 3.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as diagnosed by polysomnography has been associated with preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The use of validated screening tools in pregnancy is unknown. We sought to examine the association between a positive screen on one validated OSA tool, the STOP-BANG Questionnaire, and preeclampsia or IUGR. METHODS: We performed a cross sectional study of pregnant women admitted to the antepartum unit. Demographic and pregnancy data were obtained from the medical record. Obstructive sleep apnea screening was performed using the STOP-BANG Questionnaire. The relationship between OSA screen positive status and the preeclampsia or IUGR was analyzed using a χ2 test for proportions and a multivariable logistic regression to control for potential confounders. RESULTS: One hundred three pregnant women participated in the study; 19 (18.3%) screened positive on the STOP-BANG Questionnaire. Forty-two percent of women who screened positive had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia compared with 13% who screened negative (P=.003). This association was maintained after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio 6.1, 95% confidence interval 1.7-22.1). There was no association between screen positive status and IUGR. Fifty-three percent of participants stated they would accept a formal sleep study during pregnancy if recommended by their health care provider. There was no difference in acceptance rate between screen negative and positive patients (50% compared with 68% P=.146). CONCLUSION: In pregnancy, a positive screen on the STOP-BANG Questionnaire was associated with preeclampsia. Future studies are needed to validate the performance of this tool against polysomnography during pregnancy, which most participants stated they would be willing to complete.

N2  - Study Objectives: A recent trend in increasing rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality despite quality improvements has been noted. The goal of this study is to estimate the national prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women and examine associations between OSA and pregnancy-related morbidities, including in-hospital maternal mortality. Design: A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis. Setting: A nationally representative sample of maternal hospital discharges from 1998-2009. Patients or Participants: The analytic sample included 55,781,965 pregnancy-related inpatient hospital discharges. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was used to identify hospital stays for women who were pregnant or gave birth. Among these women, we determined length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes to identify OSA and other outcome measures. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between OSA and each outcome. The overall rate of OSA was 3.0 per 10,000; however, the rate climbed substantially from 0.7 in 1998 to 7.3 in 2009, with an average annual increase of 24%. After controlling for obesity and other potential confounders, OSA was associated with increased odds of pregnancy-related morbidities including preeclampsia (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.2-2.9), eclampsia (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3-8.9), cardiomyopathy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI, 7.5-10.9), and pulmonary embolism (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3-8.9). Women with OSA experienced a more than fivefold increased odds of in-hospital mortality (95% CI, 2.4-11.5). The adverse effects of OSA on selected outcomes were exacerbated by obesity. Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with severe maternal morbidity, cardiovascular morbidity, and in-hospital death. Targeted interventions may improve pregnancy outcomes in this group.

N2  - Introduction: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological disorder affecting 7-9% of population. It presents with urge to move one's legs in order to relieve unpleasant sensory symptoms. These feelings occur at rest and usually at night what leads to sleep disturbances and reduced quality of life (QoL). Aim of this study is to disclose changes in iron metabolism in pregnant women with RLS. Methods: We examined 300 consecutive women in the third trimester of pregnancy. After signing informed consent, they filled in the questionnaire based on official diagnostic criteria. Demographic data and RLS characteristics were obtained. All responders underwent routine blood examination. Results: From 300 responders, 31.33% met all criteria and were considered positive for RLS (RLS+). Comparing RLS + and RLS negative (RLS-) group, we found significantly lower levels of haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht) and red blood cells (RBC) in RLS+ (p>0.001). Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and its concentration (MCHC) were also lower in RLS+ (p=0.005 and 0.001) what is typical of iron deficiency. Iron supplementation was significantly lower in RLS-; positively correlated with serum ferritin level and with birth weight (not observed in RLS+). Serum iron levels correlated with Ht and MCH only in RLS-, also birth weight with pregnancy duration. Conclusions: We disclosed significantly lower parameters of iron metabolism in RLS+ compared to RLS- in pregnant women. We emphasized the importance of iron deficiency detection in pregnancy with adequate supplementation if necessary. That prevents the pregnant from decreased QoL and possible pregnancy and/or delivery complications.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The circadian rhythm of key kidney functions such as electrolyte and water excretion involving blood pressure control is driven by the clock gene network. In adults, broad adverse effects of the disturbed circadian rhythm are known, whereas potential role of the maternal circadian clock disturbances in prenatal programming of renal function has not been studied yet.We sought to explore the effect of altered light exposure and restricted feeding schedule on the development of circadian gene expression in the fetal kidney. Methods: Pregnant rats were randomly allocated into 5 groups. The rats were fed ab libitum under 12h:12h light-dark cycle (LD), constant light (LL), constant darkness (DD), or ultradian, 6h:6h light-dark cycle (6-6LD). Another group of pregnant rats was kept under 12h:12h light-dark cycle with food access restricted to the light period (FR). Mothers (6-10 per group) with their offspring were sacrificed at 4-h intervals one day before the expected delivery. Intrarenal circadian gene expression patterns were profiled by real-time rtPCR for the canonical clock genes Rev-erbα and Per2 and the clock-controlled genes NHE3, αENaC, SGK1, and AVPR2. Results: Kidneys of fetuses from mothers kept at LD displayed circadian expression of the investigated genes [Rev-erbα (p = 0.014), Per2 (p = 0.014), NHE3 (p < 0.001), αENaC (p < 0.001), SGK1 (p = 0.017), and AVPR2 (p = 0.003)]. Intrarenal gene expression of the fetuses from mothers exposed to LL exhibited robust circadian expression with phases similar to those observed at LD [Rev-erbα (p = 0.027), Per2 (p < 0.001), NHE3 (p < 0.001), αENaC (p< 0.001), SGK1 (p < 0.001), and AVPR2 (p = 0.022)]. In contrast, circadian fluctuations of intrarenal gene expression were completely absent in fetuses with maternal DD and 6-6LDexposure. In the animals exposed to maternal FR circadian rhythmicity persisted for Per2 (p < 0.001), was lost for Rev-erbα and showed a distinct phase shift for the clock-controlled genes [NHE3 (p < 0.001), αENaC (p < 0.001), SGK1 (p = 0.024), and AVPR2 (p = 0.021)]. Conclusions: Our findings show that in the developing kidney the circadian clock network becomes operational even before birth and oscillatory gene expression is affected differently by different types of light cue modification during pregnancy. In addition, the oscillatory expression of kidney specific clock-controlled genes responds to nutritional cues independently of canonical clock gene input.

N2  - Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is a serious public health issue which threatens maternal and foetal health outcomes. The aim of the study was to explore prevalence of domestic violence among pregnant women in southern Sweden (Scania) and to explore associations with background factors, as symptoms of depression and sense of coherence.Methods: This study has a cross-sectional design and is the first part of a longitudinal, cohort study. Inclusion criteria were women ≥ 18 years, registered at antenatal care when pregnant and who understand and write Swedish or English. Questionnaires were collected prospectively at seventeen antenatal care receptions situated in the two cities and six smaller municipalities in Scania. Statistical analyses were done using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, bivariate logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Study sample included 1939 women. History of violence was reported by 39.5% (n =761) women. Significant differences were obtained between the groups with or without history of violence regarding being single/living apart, unemployment, financial distress, smoking/snuffing, unintended pregnancy as well as history of miscarriage/legalised abortion (p < 0.001). Experience of domestic violence during pregnancy regardless of type or level of abuse was 1.0% (n = 18); history of physical abuse by actual intimate partner was 2.2% (n = 42). History of violence was the strongest risk factor associated with domestic violence during pregnancy, where all women (n = 18) exposed reported history of violence (p < 0.001). Several symptoms of depression (adjusted for low socio-economic status, miscarriage/abortion, single/living apart, lack of sleep, unemployment, age and parity) were associated with a 7.0 fold risk of domestic violence during pregnancy (OR 7.0; 95% CI: 1.9-26.3).Conclusions: The reported prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy in southwest Sweden is low. However, a considerable proportion of women reported history of living in a violent relationship. Both history of violence and the presence of several depressive symptoms detected in early pregnancy may indicate that the woman also is exposed to domestic violence during pregnancy. Increased attention to this vulnerable group of women is needed to improve maternal and child health. © 2014 Finnbogadóttir et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: In our study, 19.3% (n=1396) of depressed mothers had thoughts of self-harm. We examined associations between suicidal ideation (SI) and abuse history, disturbed sleep and anxiety in postpartum women. We hypothesized childhood abuse, sleep disturbance and increased anxiety were associated with SI in depressed postpartum mothers. Methods: For women who were 4-6 weeks postpartum with a positive depression screen (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; EPDS>/=10), we compared groups with no thoughts of self-harm (EPDS item10=0), “hardly ever” (item 10 = 1), and “sometimes” or “quite often” (item 10 = 2 or 3). We recorded exposure(s) to childhood or adult physical or sexual abuse, and examined sleep disturbance with a 6-point subscale (five SIGH-ADS sleep items plus EPDS item 7) and anxiety levels with a 7-point subscale (five SIGH-ADS anxiety items plus EPDS items 4 and 5). Results: Of 648 mothers, 496 (77%) had no SI, 98 (15%) “hardly ever” and 34 (5%) “sometimes” or “quite often”. Mothers who were young, African American, on public health insurance and with depression onset pre-pregnancy or postpartum were more likely to have SI. Lowered global functioning predicted SI in depressed new mothers. Cumulative logistic regression models suggested significant main effects of childhood physical abuse (OR=1.681, p=0.03), sleep disturbance (OR=1.148, p=0.02) or increased anxiety (OR=1.114, p=0.03) and maternal risk for SI. Conclusions: Activation of the ventral striatum, amygdala and regions necessary for emotion regulation and reward processing are altered in depressed postpartum mothers. Having past childhood abuse, sleep deprivation and anxiety could impair decision-making and reward experiences which may contribute to suicidal thoughts in mothers with postpartum depression.

N2  - Objectives: About half of all cancer patients experience moderate or severe pain that diminishes their quality of life by adversely affecting sleep, social relations and activities of daily living. Pain is more common in the late stages of malignancy. Cancer pain can be eliminated or well-controlled on 80 to 90 percent of cases by the use of appropriate drugs. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using tapering dose of etoricoxib plus oxycontin in the pain treatment of cancer patients. Methods: 60 patients were evaluated in Pain Center, International Medical Center, KSA. They all have received an order of tapered etoricoxib plus oxycontin, as follows: 120 mg for 6 days; 90 mg for 14 days; 60 mg for 7 days. And patient was then sustained to 60 mg as per medical condition. Oxycontin: 10 mg per oral two times daily as needed, for a period of 6 months. Inclusive criteria: 28 females, 32 males; ages 36 to 76 years and mean of 56. Exclusive criteria: pregnant women, children, anyone who is allergic to any medication ingredient, history of low blood pressure, patients who has liver or kidney disease or significant cardiac and respiratory depression. Results: Average improvement of about 65% was appreciated, as per numeric pain scale, within 7 days and sustained for at least 3 months or more. Conclusion: Using tapering doses of Cox-2 inhibitor plus narcotic help in establishing pain relief and decrease breakthrough pain and eventually result in less centralized pain and allodynia.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) develops as a consequence of genetic factors, very important in idiopathic RLS, and nongenetic associated conditions. The threshold for RLS symptoms in patients without a relevant genetic risk is higher than in those with a positive family history of the disorder. In this lecture I will review the conditions that are associated with RLS, the mechanisms underlying the appearance of RLS symptoms and the treatments to be used in these situations. One of the most common associated conditions is iron deficiency, with or without anaemia. Low serum levels of iron, and particularly of ferritin, occur in a significant percentage of RLS patients, and may be the ultimate cause of the development of RLS in a given period of life. All possible causes of iron deficiency are associated with RLS, including excessive physiologic (for instance hyper menorrhea) or pathologic blood loss (f.i. from the gut or stomach), pregnancy, renal insufficiency, etc. Iron is a cofactor of tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of dopamine, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of RLS. Iron deficiency also contributes to the development of augmentation, an unexpected worsening of RLS symptoms that complicates the clinical course of these patients. Adequate identification of serum iron and ferritin levels is mandatory in all patients with RLS. RLS symptoms, and particularly, periodic leg movements of sleep (PLMS) or wakefulness (PLMW) occur in patients with a diversity of conditions including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Multiple System Atrophy, Friedreich's ataxia and other ataxias, as well as narcolepsy or spinal cord injury. RLS symptoms in these situations are not essentially different from those occurring in idiopathic RLS that is a disturbing dysaesthesia in the legs, favoured by rest, improving with movement and with a clear nocturnal predominance. However in some conditions, like in spinal injury, the typical set of 4 cardinal symptoms may not be apparent. I will review the evidence in favour of these associations and the difficulties to recognize and treat RLS in those patients.

N2  - Introduction: We describe a 32-years-old male with encephalopathy and drug resistant epilepsy with recurrent episodes of status epilepticus. Methods: The patient was born at term by normal pregnancy after prolonged labour. A significant global developmental delay had been recognized since 6 years of age. At age 5 months he experienced the first epileptic seizure during hyperpyrexia characterized by a left hemiclonic seizure during sleep followed, a few hours later, by a tonic-clonic seizure. Since then he has had monthly febrile and afebrile tonic-clonic seizures, mainly arising from sleep. Despite trials of several antiepileptic drugs, seizures increased on frequency, becoming weekly. Recurrent episodes of intractable status epilepticus worsened by phenilidanthoyn were also reported. At our first assessment (32 years of age) the patient underwent a comprehensive clinical, neurophysiological and neuroradiological study. Results: Neurological examination showed craniofacial dysmorphism and severe delay in language and motor acquisition. Interictal EEG showed diffuse background slowing and independent epileptiform discharges over both the temporal regions. During prolonged video-EEG monitoring we recorded one of his typical status epilepticus clinically characterized by left arm clonic seizures and secondarily generalized seizures. Brain MRI disclosed a mild cerebellar atrophy with evidence of cerebellar sulcus. Molecular analysis of SCN1A gene identified a de novo intronic mutation, causing nucleotidic substitution c.338+3A>C. Conclusions: We describe a new de-novo mutation of SCN1A gene responsible for severe early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy with recurrent status epilepticus resistant to sodium blocker AEDs.

N2  - While the use of creatine in human pregnancy is yet to be fully evaluated, its long-term use in healthy adults appears to be safe, and its well documented neuroprotective properties have recently been extended by demonstrations that creatine improves cognitive function in normal and elderly people, and motor skills in sleep-deprived subjects. Creatine has many actions likely to benefit the fetus and newborn, because pregnancy is a state of heightened metabolic activity, and the placenta is a key source of free radicals of oxygen and nitrogen. The multiple benefits of supplementary creatine arise from the fact that the creatine-phosphocreatine [PCr] system has physiologically important roles that include maintenance of intracellular ATP and acid-base balance, post-ischaemic recovery of protein synthesis, cerebral vasodilation, antioxidant actions, and stabilisation of lipid membranes. In the brain, creatine not only reduces lipid peroxidation and improves cerebral perfusion, its interaction with the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor is likely to counteract the effects of glutamate excitotoxicity - actions that may protect the preterm and term fetal brain from the effects of birth hypoxia. In this review we discuss the development of creatine synthesis during fetal life, the transfer of creatine from mother to fetus, and propose that creatine supplementation during pregnancy may have benefits for the fetus and neonate whenever oxidative stress or feto-placental hypoxia arise, as in cases of fetal growth restriction, premature birth, or when parturition is delayed or complicated by oxygen deprivation of the newborn. © 2014 Dickinson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Introduction Poor sleep quality in pregnancy is frequent. A treatment with sedatives is problematic due to possible adverse effects for mother and embryo/foetus. In the present study, we investigated the sedative effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum, a phytotherapeutic medication used in anthroposophic medicine. In previous clinical studies on its tocolytic effect, B. pinnatum showed a good risk/benefit ratio for mother and child. A recent analysis of the prescribing pattern for B. pinnatum in a network of anthroposophic physicians revealed sleep disorders as one of the most frequent diagnoses for which these preparations are prescribed. Materials and methods In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women suffering from sleep problems were treated with B. pinnatum (350 mg tablets, 50% leaf press juice, Weleda AG, Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration). Sleep quality, daily sleepiness and fatigue were assessed with the aid of standardised questionnaires, at the beginning of the treatment and after 2 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. Results The number of wake-ups, as well as the subjective quality of sleep was significantly improved at the end of the treatment with B. pinnatum. The Epworth Sleeping Scale decreased, indicating a decrease of the tiredness during the day. There was, however, no evidence for prolongation of the sleep duration, reduction in the time to fall asleep, as well as change in the Fatigue Severity Scale after B. pinnatum. No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. Conclusion B. pinnatum is a suitable treatment of sleep problems in pregnancy. The data of this study encourage further clinical investigations on the use of B. pinnatum in sleep disorders. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

N2  - Background: Insomnia and depression are strongly interrelated. This study aimed to describe changes in sleep across childbirth, and to evaluate whether insomnia in pregnancy is a predictor of postpartum depression. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based study was conducted among perinatal women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Women received questionnaires in weeks 17 and 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. This paper presents data from 2,088 of 4,662 women with complete data for insomnia and depression in week 32 of pregnancy and eight weeks postpartum. Sleep times, wake-up times and average sleep durations were self-reported. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Results: After delivery, sleep duration was reduced by 49 minutes (to 6.5 hours), and mean sleep efficiency was reduced from 84% to 75%. However, self-reported insomnia scores (BIS) improved from 17.2 to 15.4, and the reported prevalence of insomnia decreased from 61.6% to 53.8%. High EPDS scores and anxiety in pregnancy, fear of delivery, previous depression, primiparity, and higher educational level were risk factors for both postpartum insomnia and depression. Insomnia did not predict postpartum depression in women with no prior history of depression, whereas women who recovered from depression had residual insomnia. Limitations: Depression and insomnia were not verified by clinical interviews. Women with depressive symptoms were less likely to remain in the study. Conclusions: Although women slept fewer hours at night after delivery compared to during late pregnancy, and reported more nights with nighttime awakenings, their self-reported insomnia scores improved, and the prevalence of insomnia according to the DSM-IV criteria decreased. Insomnia in pregnancy may be a marker for postpartum recurrence of depression among women with previous depression. © 2014 Dorheim et al.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:To describe an interesting presentation of Hyperkalemic Periodic ParalysisBACKGROUND:Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) is an autosomal dominant muscle sodium channelopathy characterized by flaccid muscle weakness or paralysis (1). Attacks can be precipitated or made worse by cold, rest after exercise, anesthesia, potassium loading, hunger, emotional stress, pregnancy and glucocorticoids (2). Sleep has not been well described as one of the triggers for paralysis. HPP can be confused with sleep paralysis and in some cases with cataplexy. Many patients go undiagnosed for decades. Neurology and sleep literature is lacking in sleep associated periodic paralysis.DESIGN/METHODS: Case reportRESULTS:RS is a 61 year old woman with life long sleep onset associated paralysis which has resulted in chronic insomnia and fear of falling asleep. Her paralysis can also be precipitated by eating salted peanuts. She comes from a large family where many members suffer from the same condition (maternal grandmother, mother, sister, two brothers, and daughter) and only one of her brothers has been formally diagnosed. She was referred to sleep medicine clinic to evaluate for “narcolepsy variant” and was diagnosed there with HPP. Genetic testing is pending.CONCLUSIONS:HPP has varied presentations and should be considered in patients with sleep onset paralysis thus preventing prolonged time to appropriate diagnosis and treatment which can last for decades.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To identify quantitative Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) indices of spontaneous brain activity for fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies, and examine the effect of fetal state on these indices.BACKGROUND: The fetal brain remains practically inaccessible to functional evaluation in utero. MEG, being non invasive and not dependent on intervening tissue impedances, may be uniquely suited to fill this gap by recording the magnetic fields generated in the fetal brain. Fetal MEG studies have been reported to show signals similar to delta brushes, sharp transients and the discontinuous patterns described in neonatal EEG.DESIGN/METHODS: MEG was performed using a 151 sensors system arranged in a concave array to accommodate the gravid maternal abdomen. Spontaneous MEG brain activity was examined in 22 low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from 30-37 weeks. Portions of the MEG data showing a “discontinuous pattern” were selected. Subsequently, Burst duration (BD) and interburst interval (IBI) were calculated and studied in correlation with GA and fetal behavioral state (active or quiet sleep).RESULTS: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (-0.21 sec/week, P= 0.0031). The mean IBI at 30 weeks GA was 7.04±0.38 seconds, and decreased to 5.55±0.21 seconds at the 37th week of gestation. This trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep state. With respect to BD, no significant trends were detected with GA and state.CONCLUSIONS: IBI can be quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter using MEG. The decrease in IBI over the course of a normal pregnancy was similar to the trend reported in the preterm neonatal EEG studies. Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such fetal MEG maturational indices.

N2  - Previous research has shown that Hispanics have better health compared to non- Hispanics, also known as the “Hispanic Paradox”. However, few studies have examined whether sleep patterns among Hispanic versus non-Hispanic women differ during pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to examine whether ethnicity influenced quality of sleep during pregnancy. It was hypothesized that Hispanic women would experience fewer sleep disturbances during pregnancy than non- Hispanic women. Our sample included 100 low-income pregnant women (71% Hispanic) who completed anxiety (Prenatal Anxiety Scale) and sleep assessments (PSQI) during the first, second, and third trimesters as part of a larger randomized study on stress management. Repeated measures ANOVA analyses indicated that non-Hispanic women experienced significantly higher sleep deficiencies than Hispanic women throughout their pregnancy [F(1, 85) = 4.1, p < .05]. Among non- Hispanic women, those with high anxiety were found to experience significantly higher sleep deficiencies than those with low anxiety [F(1, 49) = 8.53, p < 0.01]. Anxiety was not found to affect sleep deficiencies among Hispanic women. These results suggest that non-Hispanic women, especially those with high anxiety, may benefit from prenatal programs designed to improve sleep quality during pregnancy.

N2  - Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors. Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and BMI), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N = 161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks), and T3 (18-20 weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomized using established clinical cutoffs. BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL≥ 20 minutes had greater BMI for at T2 (t(128) = 2.71, p = 0.0077) compared to T3. For persistent WASO ≥ 30, the greatest BMI was at T1 when compared to T3 and T2 (t(128) = 2.30, p = 0.0230). SOL as measured by diary was associated with elevated SBP (F(1,158)=6.85, p=0.0098). In contrast, SOL as measured by actigraphy was not associated with elevated BP. Although contrary to anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report long SOL during early pregnancy and this may augment risk for higher blood pressure and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important since CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention.

N2  - Rationale Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are common among pregnant women, and several studies link SDB symptoms with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. However, few prospective studies objectively measuring SDB during pregnancy have been performed. Objectives We performed a prospective cohort study examining risk factors for third trimester SDB in pregnant women. Measurements and methods 105 pregnant women from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania obstetrics practices completed first and third trimester overnight polysomnography studies. We examined whether the number of SDB events per hour of sleep increased during pregnancy. We performed unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate the effects of usual and pregnancy-specific characteristics on development of third trimester obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In secondary analyses, we examined the relationship between objectively measured SDB, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and other adverse maternal-fetal outcomes. Main results Mean Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index increased from 2.07 (SD 3.01) events/h at baseline (first trimester) to 3.74 (SD 5.97) in the third trimester (p=0.009). 10.5% of women had OSA in the first trimester. By the third trimester, 26.7% of women had OSA. In multivariable analyses, first trimester body mass index (BMI) and maternal age were significantly associated with third trimester OSA. Conclusions Third trimester OSA is common. Risk factors for third trimester OSA among women without baseline SDB include higher baseline BMI and maternal age.

N2  - Background: Emerging evidence suggests that abnormal sleep during pregnancy may be associated with adverse outcomes for the infant. Methods: E Moe Mama is a cohort study in New Zealand that investigates sleep and maternal health in late pregnancy and postpartum. Women reported detailed information on their sleep duration, quality, disturbances, and disorders (snoring, breath pauses, twitching legs) between 35-37 weeks gestation. Each sleep measure was dichotomised to indicate problematic/non-problematic sleep. Birth weight and fetal distress during labour were abstracted from medical records. Associations between each sleep variable and birth weight/fetal distress were estimated using linear/ logistic regression, controlling for potential confounders. Results: Complete data were available for 555 women. There was no association between any of the sleep measures and birth weight; e.g. poor sleep quality (General Sleep Disturbance Scale) was associated with a 45 g lower birth weight (95% CI -164 to 75 g, p = 0.5). Sleep duration, poor sleep quality and sleep disorders were not associated with fetal distress. Sleep disturbance (≥3 nights per week) due to back/neck/joint pain or due to feeling too hot or cold were both associated with a doubling in the risk of fetal distress (OR for sleep disturbance due to feeling too hot/cold 2.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 6.0, p = 0.02). Conclusions: We found no evidence of associations between sleep in late pregnancy and infant birth weight. Frequent sleep disturbance due to back/neck/joint pain or due to feeling too hot or cold were associated with greater risk of fetal distress; these associations may be driven by underlying illness.

N2  - Background: Elevated body mass index (BMI) has been identified as a risk factor for depression and for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Decreases in autonomic response and circadian interruptions may partially reflect BMI's contribution to these risks. Objective(s): As pregnancy is a period of increased susceptibility to the development of depressive mood and other obstetric complications including preeclampsia, we assessed the impact of prepregnancy BMI on autonomic and circadian function during this time. Material/Methods: Our sample consisted of 24 women (28- 34 weeks gestation). Maternal prepregnancy BMI was calculated by averaging reported prepregnancy weight, and reported weight gain since conception subtracted from current weight. Women were divided into two groups: normal BMI(<25) and moderate to high BMI(= 25). Biological rhythms were assessed using the self-report Biological Rhythm Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) and autonomic functioning was examined through 24 hour electrocardiography, focusing on heart rate variability (HRV). Statistical analysis included Welch's t-tests with the false discovery rate correction. Results: Significant differences were observed between normal and overweight women in terms of HRV (ASDNN5: t(21) = 2.38, p = 0.035; SDANN5: t(21) = 2.43, p = 0.035; SDNN: t(21) = 2.61 p = 0.031), where high BMI was associated with decreased HRV. BRIAN scores also differed between groups (t(21) = 2.93, p = 0.023), with the overweight women having increased scores, suggesting increased circadian disruption. The activity (t(21) = 4.08, p = 0.004) and social (t(16) = 2.97, p = 0.023) subscales of the BRIAN significantly contributed to the group differences, while sleep and eating did not. Conclusions: Women who are overweight prior to pregnancy manifest altered autonomic and circadian functioning, which may predispose them to perinatal mood difficulties and risk factors for later CVD, including preeclampsia.

N2  - Background: Allostatic load (AL) is the cumulative impact of chronic stress that is associated with adverse health outcomes. Higher AL may also be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We previously developed a novel model of AL to objectively measure AL in early pregnancy. We hypothesized that AL is associated with poorer sleep quality and subjective measures of acute and chronic stress. Methods: Women were from a community-dwelling study population who enrolled at less than 15 weeks gestation and had available plasma samples. We excluded women who later miscarried. We divided nine components among three domains of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory function and calculated AL as the sum of the proportion of components designated high risk for each domain. We used Spearman rank correlations to examine the association of AL to age, income, the prenatal distress questionnaire, the inventory of depressive symptoms (IDS), and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). The Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used to compare AL in blacks vs. non-blacks and in college-educated women vs. noncollege- educated. We used the prenatal distress questionnaire and IDS as measures of acute stress and race and socioeconomic status, captured by education and income, as measures of chronic stress. We used the PSQI as both a measure of disordered sleep and of chronic stress. Results: We identified 103 eligible participants with a mean age of 29.8 +/- 5.0 years, 17.5% black, and gestational age 12.2 +/- 1.1 weeks. AL was positively correlated with the PSQI (rs=0.23, p=0.018). There was no association with age (rs =-0.006, p=0.96), income (rs =0.085, p=0.39), prenatal distress (rs =0.031, p=0.77), or IDS (rs =0.028, p=0.78). Black women had borderline higher AL than non-black women (0.97 +/- 0.63 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.48, p=0.054), and college-educated women had lower AL compared to those without a college diploma (0.57 +/- 0.43 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.55, p=0.045). Conclusion: Higher AL measured in early pregnancy is associated with poorer sleep quality, less education, and black race. These relationships are consistent with previous associations between AL and these chronic stressors observed in nonpregnant populations. This association was not observed with measures of acute stress. AL may be a valuable tool for capturing the physiologic impact of chronic stress on women in early pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance is common during pregnancy. Previous research suggests that prenatal sleep disturbance predicts levels of maternal depression in pregnancy and the postpartum period, which has important implications for child development. Social support during pregnancy is thought to be associated with lower depressive symptoms, but the mechanisms responsible for the protective role of prenatal social support are poorly understood. Methods: Women's (n= 213) subjective sleep quality (measured via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), depressive symptoms (measured via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), and social support (measured via the Social Support Effectiveness Questionnaire) were assessed during early (<22 weeks GA; T1) and late (∼32 weeks GA; T2) pregnancy. Self-reports of depressive symptoms were collected again at 3 to 6 months postpartum (T3). Data Analysis: Linear regression models were used to determine if subjective sleep quality at T1 and T2 were associated with maternal depressive symptoms at T2 and T3, respectively, and if these associations were moderated by social support. Depressive symptoms at the first time point of each model were included to control for effects of pre-existing depression. Results: There was a main effect of sleep quality at T2 on postnatal depressive symptoms at T3 (β=-.87, p<.05), but not of sleep quality at T1 on depressive symptoms at T2 (β=-.69, p=.07). An interaction between sleep quality and social support at T1 showed that sleep quality was a much stronger predictor of depressive symptoms at T2 when social support was low (β= .01, p<.05). The same effect was observed for the association between sleep quality and social support at T2 and postnatal depressive symptoms at T3 (β=.01, p<.05). Conclusions: Social support during pregnancy moderated the association between prenatal sleep quality and subsequent depressive symptoms. Women who reported lower sleep quality and had lower levels of social support were at greater risk of experiencing depressive symptoms at a later time point than women who reported lower sleep quality and higher levels of social support. Access to effective social support may be an important aspect to the promotion of fetal and maternal health, particularly for women who are sleeping poorly.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder that has numerous medical consequences including cardiovascular morbidity. The clinical presentation in women is frequently vague, leading to its under-recognition in this population. Sleep is known to influence several female hormonal cycles including estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); consequently, sleep disruption may have adverse effects on female health including pregnancy. Miscarriage, defined as the loss of a pregnancy in the first trimester, occurs in one in four pregnancies; in up to half of cases, the cause may be unknown. Risk factors for miscarriage include increased age, increased weight, and a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, all of which are also risk factors for SDB. Since SDB is frequently accompanied by sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxemia, we speculate that these factors may contribute to miscarriage risk. If this is the case, then treatment of SDB may be a possible intervention for subsequent pregnancies. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Summary: Hypocretin/orexin peptides are known for their role in the control of the wake-sleep cycle and narcolepsy-cataplexy pathophysiology. Recent studies suggested that hypocretin peptides also have a role in pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a retrospective analysis on pregnancy complications in two different mouse models of hypocretin deficiency. We recorded 85 pregnancies of mice lacking either hypocretin peptides (knockout) or hypocretin-releasing neurons (transgenic) and their wild-type controls. Pregnancy was associated with unexplained dam death before delivery in 3/15 pregnancies in knockout mice, and in 3/23 pregnancies in transgenic mice. No casualties occurred in wild-type pregnant dams (P < 0.007 versus hypocretin-deficient mice as a whole). Hypocretin deficiency did not impact either on litter size or the number of weaned pups per litter. These data provide preliminary evidence of a critical role of hypocretin deficiency in pregnancy. © 2013 European Sleep Research Society.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of leptin and other selected variables on maternal weight gain rate (MWGR) in women with normal and excessive pre-pregnancy weights. Methods: A prospective cohort of 236 pregnant women was followed at the 5-13th, 20-26th and 30-36th gestational weeks. The effects of independent variables on MWGR in normal weight (18.7kg/ m2 ≤ Body Mass Index (BMI) < 25.0 kg/ m2) and overweight/obese (25.0 kg/ m2 ≤ BMI 45.5 kg/ m2) women were assessed using longitudinal linear mixed-effects models. Results: In the final model of women with normal BMIs, the following covariates remained significantly associated with MWGR: leptin (β=0.053, SE=0.013), HDL-c (β=-0.075, SE=0.021), sleep duration (β=-0.267, SE=0.083) and maternal height (β=0.687, SE=0.071). For overweight/obese women, the associated variables were HDL-c (β=-0.069, SE=0.025), fasting glucose (β=-0.066, SE=0.021), smoking habit (former smoker: β=-4.555, SE=2.301) and maternal height (β=0.808, SE=0.151). Conclusion: Leptin presented an effect on MWGR in normal weight women but not in overweight/obese women. The HDL-c levels and maternal height were associated with MWGR throughout pregnancy in both BMI categories. The effect of the duration of sleep on MWGR was only observed in normal weight women, and the effects of fasting glucose concentrations and smoking habits were specific to overweight/obese women.

N2  - Background A rare condition with an exotic name; it is no surprise that knowledge of the painful myoclonic condition known as 'Belly Dancer's Dyskinesia' is limited. A literature search yields few case studies, and none where the condition manifests in pregnancy. Case Miss A is 24-years-old, gravida 5, para 3+1 (early miscarriage), currently in the second trimester. Her partner is 40-years-old and has a deletion of 11q22.3, which her third child has inherited; the clinical significance of this is unknown. All her pregnancies (excepting the miscarriage) have been complicated by Belly Dancer's Dyskinesia, manifesting between the 26th and 30th week of pregnancy, and resolving after delivery. Unfortunately all her children suffer with conditions requiring full-time care; all three suffer with deafness, the first-born also has cerebral palsy and periventricular leucomalacia (PVL), the second has sleep apnoea as well as PVL, and her third child has sleep apnoea and an inherited chromosomal abnormality. Abdominal spasms have been a feature of all her pregnancies, and in her third was one of the indications (as well as obstetric cholestasis and fetal tachycardia) for her delivery by emergency caesarean section at 32 weeks gestation. It cannot be assumed that there is a link between the Dyskinesia and her obstetric complications, but her case prompts thought about the impact of such a condition on the course of pregnancy. The name stems from the physical manifestation of involuntary, rhythmic jerks of the hemidiaphragms, causing rhythmical contractions and uncontrollable abdominal wall movements. The proposed aetiology is wide, and options for management vague. The scope of potential impact on pregnancy is extensive and likely to be variable between cases; in our case there were no problems with antenatal screening, including chorionic villus sampling, and fetal growth monitoring was not affected. However, controlling her periodic pain proved difficult; she required complex analgesia, and advice from Neurologists and Physiotherapists was sought. The pain had a profound impact upon the patient's wishes during pregnancy and requests for expediting delivery. Conclusion The dilemmas facing the obstetrician caring for this patient during her current pregnancy highlight questions that need answering by further research. Are the congenital abnormalities or brain insults in-utero related to the dyskinesia? If so, how do we monitor, manage, and when is the optimum time to stop the dance and deliver a healthy baby?.

The impact of disturbed sleep on working memory performance has been consistently shown in adult populations via night-time disturbance (e.g. snoring) as well as through daytime sleepiness. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between sleep and working memory performance in school-aged children born very preterm. Methods: Parents of 45 VP children completed the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC). Children completed a chronometric (computer) measure of verbal and spatial working memory. Children ranged from 6-9 years, with a mean age of 7.61 y and an even split between boys and girls (51% male). Median gestation age was 27 w (23-32 w). Socioeconomic status, age and gender were controlled in analysis. Results: Snoring and daytime sleepiness were significantly associated with poorer verbal working memory performance. Daytime sleepiness accounted for 11% of variance in verbal working memory performance (p < .05), while snoring uniquely explained 13% of the variance in children's performance (p < .01). No significant relationship was found between sleep and spatial working memory performance. Conclusions: These findings indicate that snoring and daytime sleepiness independently impact upon verbal working memory performance in children born preterm. The results highlight the need to consider both daytime and night-time sleep factors when assessing children's cognition.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Enhance the understanding of the associations between various cognitive tests and test timing used in nutrition research during the first year of life. METHODS: A longitudinal, prospective, correlational design was used to evaluate if a developmental continuity exists in a single cohort of infants. Infants of women (18-35 y) with no pregnancy complications (n=27) were assessed using: Sleep (first 48 hours of life); temperament (ICQ 6 & RITQ, 12 mos.); problem-solving (PS) (Willatts Infant Planning Test, 9 & 12 mos.); and Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII, 6 & 9 mos.). RESULTS: Using Spearmen correlation, there were significant positive correlations between: transitional sleep and unpredictable (r=.455, P=.017), unadaptable (r= .420, P=.026) and dull (r= .416, P=.028), ICQ domains at 6 mos. and FTII scaled novelty score at 6 mos. (r= -.512, P=.008). Quiet sleep was positively associated with the RITQ approachability domain at 12 mos. (r= .662, P=.005). Arousals in active sleep were negatively correlated with PS intentional solutions at 9 mos. (r= -528, P=.016). CONCLUSIONS: Early sleep characteristics are reflective of later infant development in the first year. These data support the notion that continuity exists between early and later developmental measures throughout the first year.

N2  - Background: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is theorised to occur due to an uncompensated hypotensive episode in conjunction with a failure of arousal from sleep; increasing prematurity and prone sleeping are major risk factors. Prematurity is associated with immature cardiovascular control, which persists beyond term-equivalent age and throughout the peak risk period for SIDS occurring at 2-3 months post-term age. However, little is known about the effects of increasing prematurity and prone sleeping on cardiovascular control after term-equivalent age. Method: 13 very preterm (27.3-31.5 wks gestation) and 8 preterm infants (32.2-35.5 wk gestation) underwent daytime polysomnography at 2-3 mths post-term age. Heart rate was recorded during quiet sleep in the supine and prone positions. Autonomic cardiovascular control was assessed using spectral indices of heart rate variability (HRV) in the ranges of low frequency (LF; sympathetic and parasympathetic), high frequency (HF; parasympathetic), total power (LF + HF) and LF/HF ratio (sympathovagal balance). The effect of prematurity was determined using 2-way ANOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc analysis. Results: Overall, HF HRV was significantly lower in very preterm compared to preterm infants (p < 0.05), with a trend towards significance in the prone position (p = 0.065). LF/HF ratio was significantly higher in the very preterm cohort in both supine and prone positions. Very preterm infants displayed significantly higher respiratory rates compared to preterm infants in the prone position (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Very preterm infants display reduced parasympathetic activity resulting in a predominance of sympathetic activity, particularly in the prone position. This may reflect delayed maturation of the parasympathetic nervous system following very preterm birth.

N2  - Background: Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with adverse maternal and child outcomes and contributes to the epidemic of obesity in women of reproductive age. Our aim was to identify early pregnancy factors associated with excessive GWG, in a contemporary nulliparous cohort. Method: Participants in the SCOPE study (from Cork, Ireland, Auckland, New Zealand and Adelaide, Australia) were classified into GWG categories ('not excessive' versus 'excessive') based on pre-gravid body mass index in accordance with 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines. Maternal characteristics and early pregnancy risk factors at 15 ± 1 week's were compared between GWG categories and multivariable analysis controlled for confounding factors that impact on GWG. Results: Of 1950 participants, 17% (n = 335) gained within the recommended range, 74% (n = 1449) had excessive and 9% (n = 166) had inadequate GWG. Women with excessive GWG were more likely to be overweight [adjOR 2.9 (95%CI 2.2-3.8)] or obese [adjOR 2.5 (95%CI 1.8- 3.5)] compared to women with a normal BMI. Other factors independently associated with excessive GWG included younger maternal age (adjOR 1.9), increasing maternal birthweight (adjOR1.1), quitting smoking in pregnancy (adjOR 1.7), increased nightly sleep duration (adjOR 1.8), high seafood diet (adjOR 2.8), being an immigrant (adjOR 1.6), limiting behaviour (adjOR 1.04) and decreasing exercise during pregnancy (adjOR 1.3). Fertility treatment was protective (adjOR 0.59). Conclusions: Nearly three quarters of participants in our cohort had excessive GWG. Identification of subgroups with elevated risk for excessive GWG could enable introduction of targeted interventions to limit GWG and improve obstetric and long-term health outcomes.

N2  - Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, a child under 5 years dies of malaria every minute. These results, though still alarming are better than in the past where a fatal case was recorded every 30 seconds. However, the elimination of this endemic disease remains a major challenge in the tropics particularly in Cameroon. Therefore, identification of community factors especially in rural areas in order to strengthen prevention strategies in the country would be of great asset. Methods & Materials: A cross-sectional and analytical study was conducted from July to August 2011 among rural women in the health district of Dschang, West Cameroon. Data were collected by interview by the use of a questionnaire. Epi Info Version 3.5.3 was used for the analysis and Chi squared test (at α = 0.05) for the comparison of proportions. Results: 517 women, with median age 40 years were enrolled. On average, there were seven people per household with a child ratio (<5 years)/household 3/2. 4.9% of women were pregnant, with 32% having attended no antenatal care. 80% of women (93% of pregnant women), did not sleep under an insecticide impregnated bed net, the main reasons being: non-availability (46%), and non-acceptance (19%). Furthermore, among women complaining of fever (64%), no significant difference (p > 0.9) was observed between those who used the insecticide impregnated bed net and those who did not make use of it. Finally, the presence of the ceiling in some homes (45.2%) proved important as there was a highly significant difference (p < 0.0001) among women complaining of fever who dwelled in houses with a ceiling and those whose homes did not have. Conclusion: The non-use of insecticide impregnated bed nets in rural areas resulted primarily from the non-availability and its non-acceptance. Therefore, a wide distribution of these insecticide impregnated bed nets combined with awareness campaigns, will not only promote accessibility and acceptability, but also their proper use, which will surely aim at achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) number 6.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Women with gestational diabetes (GDM) have a 30-70 % risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) later in life. Postpartum weight retention is highly predictive for future obesity, and further increases risk for T2DM. We sought to identify factors associated with losing at least 75 % of gestational weight gain by early postpartum in women with recent GDM. METHODS: We recruited women with GDM during pregnancy or just after delivery. Pre-pregnancy weight was self-reported at recruitment; gestational weight gain, mode of delivery, and insulin use were extracted from medical records. At a mean of 7.2 (±2.1) weeks postpartum we measured weight, height, and administered questionnaires, including: demographics, breastfeeding, sleep, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Harvard Food Frequency, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. After conducting an analysis of univariates, we used backward selection to fit a multivariable logistic regression model for univariates with p<.2 to identify factors associated with losing 75 % or more of gestational weight gain by early postpartum. RESULTS: Our study included 75 women (mean 33±5 years; pre-pregnancy BMI 31.4 (±5.6) kg/m2; 57 % White, 29 % African-American, 15 % Asian, with 20 % identifying as Hispanic and 34 % low income). Mean pregnancy weight gain was 12.5 kg (±7.8). Fifty-two percent of participants lost at least 75 % of their pregnancy weight gain by the study visit. Dietary composition, fiber intake, added sugars, and glycemic index were similar between those who demonstrated early weight loss and those who did not, and consequently were not included in the multivariate model. Physical activity, sedentary time, race/ethnicity, education, income, mode of delivery, postpartum depressive symptoms, and breastfeeding were also similar between groups and not included in the model. In a multivariate model adjusting for weeks postpartum, only increased age (OR 1.31; 95 % CI 1.06 to 1.76 per year) and less gestational weight gain (OR 0.63; 0.48 to 0.76 per kg) were associated with at least 75 % early postpartum weight loss. Insulin use, nulliparity, and sleep were not retained in the model. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with recent GDM lost at least 75 % of their gestational weight gain by early postpartum. Older women and those who had gained less weight during pregnancy were significantly more likely to have lost at least 75 % of gestational weight. Limiting gestational weight gain may help women with GDM return to pre-pregnancy weight quickly during the postpartum period.

N2  - Objective: To assess the impact of Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in preterm infants (26-34. weeks gestation). Methods: Two groups were tested in a single, level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; standard care or standard care plus FNI) using a randomized controlled trial design. The intervention consists of sessions designed to achieve mutual calm and promote communication of affect between infants and their mothers throughout the NICU stay. EEG recordings were obtained from 134 infants during sleep at ~35 and ~40. weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Regional brain activity (power) was computed for 10 frequency bands between 1 and 48. Hz in each of 125 electrodes. Results: Near to term age, compared to standard care infants, FNI infants showed robust increases in EEG power in the frontal polar region at frequencies 10 to 48. Hz (20% to 36% with p-values <0.0004). Effects were significant in both quiet and active sleep, regardless of gender, singleton-twin status, gestational age (26-30 or 30-35. weeks) or birth weight (<1500 or >1500. g). Conclusion: FNI leads to increased frontal brain activity during sleep, which other investigators find predictive of better neurobehavioral outcomes. Significance: FNI may be a practicable means of improving outcomes in preterm infants. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - Background: BBC Radio 1's Surgery, broadcast live weekly, provides medical and emotional advice to young people across the UK, who call and text with questions regarding sex and relationships. The author, a trainee in genitourinary medicine, has provided medical advice on the programme as resident doctor since 2008. Radio 1 has a weekly listening audience of 10.8 million. This study investigates, for the first time, the basic demographics of young people who contribute to a phone-in radio surgery, the subjects of their queries and medical advice they received. Methods: All callers and text queries to the programme are selected by a Radio 1 producer. In keeping with the General Medical Council's “Good Medical Practice” and with Ofcom broadcasting codes, callers are anonymised and consent is sought prior to discussion of their query on air. A random selection of 10 one-hour radio programmes broadcast on Sundays at 9-10pm from November 2010 to June 2013 was retrospectively reviewed. Results: Over the 10 broadcasts analysed there were a total of 128 queries (40 calls and 88 by text), with a median of 15 queries per show (range 8-16). Two fifths of calls (16/40) and 36.3% of texts (32/88) were from male listeners. Of the 99 listeners who gave their age, the median was 18 years (13- 24 years) for males and 16 years (12-22 years) for females, and is broadly reflective of the station's listenership. Subjects of queries were divided into (a) sexual health problems, such as sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, contraception, puberty and sexual dysfunction (54.7%), (b) general medical queries such as poor sleep, hyperhidrosis, alcohol and drug dependence (19.5%), (c) emotional and relationship queries, such as dating advice (16.4%) and (d) dermatology problems, such as oily skin and acne (9.4%). For 78.4% (91/116) of queries regarding sexual health, general medical problems and dermatology, and 33% (7/21) of emotional queries, additional advice was given to seek further care from a health professional. Conclusions: Traditional media offers rich opportunities to reach out to young people on issues regarding sexual health and relationships. Queries to BBC Radio 1's Surgery reflect a mix of health concerns across a broad range of topics from young men and women aged 12-24. This study highlights the importance of working with partners in the media towards innovative and effective ways to engage with young people about their health, notably young men.

N2  - Aim To compare blood pressure reactions (BPR) of infants to mild stress for evidence of adverse cardiovascular effects of passive exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and early infancy. Methods An observational field study conducted in Crete. We compared 4- to 6-month olds of lifelong nonsmokers minimally (controls, n = 9) or frequently exposed to tobacco smoke (passive smokers; n = 10) with those born to habitual smokers (n = 6). Smoke exposure was verified biochemically (urine cotinine each trimester and at study). We recorded beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) during brief repositioning manoeuvres performed during a daytime nap and analysed BPR (% change in BP during head-up tilt) for associations with maternal and infant cotinine. Results We observed a 20-fold difference between BPR of infants of controls versus passive smokers - exceptional given number of infants (α error/confidence level <10% i.e. power >90%). The BPR declined linearly as the infant's (but not mother's) cotinine level rose (p = 0.04), indicating abnormal BPR was caused mainly by postnatal smoke exposure. Infants of active smokers differed from those of passive smokers. Conclusion Cardiovascular effects of passive smoking by a newborn infant manifest early on and are exceptionally strong. They can be largely avoided by keeping the home smoke rigorously free. ©2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Introduction and objectives: Physiological and hormonal changes occurring in pregnancy increase the risk of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which, along with short sleep (SS) duration, may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Exposure to GDM in the mother increases her lifetime risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D) as well as the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and, in later life, T2D of her children. The aim of this study was to systematically review the collective published evidence of associations between snoring/sleep-disordered breathing or sleep duration and increased risk of GDM. Hypothesis: We assessed the hypotheses that sleep disturbances, and/or short sleep during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of GDM. Materials and Methods: We performed systematic searches using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and PsycINFO to assess the effect of snoring/sleep disordered breathing (SDB) or short sleep (SS) on the development of gestational diabetes (GDM) and impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy. Prospective studies with measures of sleep disturbances at baseline and outcome measures of GDM or levels of glucose 1hr post GCT were included in a meta-analysis. We extracted odds ratios (OR) or relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and pooled them using a random effect model. Results: Overall, 7 studies met the inclusion criteria. They included 4,292 participants with 311 cases of GDM. In the pooled analysis, snoring/SDB and SS were both associated with a greater risk of GDM (RR: 2.27; 95% CI 1.65 to 3.12; P < 0. 00001) and (3.19 [1.56 to 6.54]; P < 0.002), respectively. There was no evidence of heterogeneity but there was evidence of publication bias and not all studies adjusted for obesity. Sensitivity analyses did not influence the pooled risk estimates. Conclusions: In conclusion, sleep disturbances may represent a risk factor for the development of GDM. Further studies are required to address the issues of publication bias and potential confounding, and to extend these observations to high-risk groups like women of ethnic minority groups whose risk of GDM is the greatest. Prevention, detection and treatment strategies need to be explored.

N2  - Objectives: Emerging evidence suggests that maternal obesity (MO) predisposes offspring to obesity and the recently described non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease (NAFPD) but involved mechanisms remain unclear. Using a pathophysiologically relevant murine model, we here investigated a role for the biological clock - molecular core circadian genes (CCG) in the generation of NAFPD. Design: Female C57BL6 mice were fed an obesogenic diet (OD) or standard chow (SC) for 6 weeks, prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation and lactation: resulting offspring were subsequently weaned onto either OD (Ob-Ob and Con-Ob) or standard chow (Ob-Con and Con-Con) for 6 months. Biochemical, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic markers associated with NAFPD were then evaluated and CCG mRNA expression in the pancreas determined. Results: Offspring of obese dams weaned on to OD (Ob-Ob) had significantly increased (p≤0.05): bodyweight, pancreatic triglycerides, macrovesicular pancreatic fatty-infiltration, and pancreatic mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, α-SMA, TGF-β and increased collagen compared to offspring of control dams weaned on to control chow (Con-Con). Analyses of CCG expression demonstrated a phase shift in CLOCK (24.818, p<0.01), REV-ERB-α ( 21.4,p<0.05) and Per2 (3.27,p<0.05) in association with decreased amplitude in BMAL-1 (-0.914,p<0.05) and PER2 (1.18,p<0.005) in Ob-Ob compared to Con-Con. 2-way ANOVA revealed significant interaction between MO and post-weaning OD in expression of CLOCK (p<0.005), PER1 (p<0.005) and PER2 (p<0.05) whilst MO alone influenced the observed rhythmic variance in expression of all 5 measured CCG. Conclusions: Fetal and neonatal exposure to a maternal obesogenic environment interacts with a post-natal hyper-calorific environment to induce offspring NAFPD through mechanisms involving perturbations in CCG expression. © 2014 Carter et al.

N2  - Aims: This study examined whether the association between sleep duration, as well as sleep continuity, and cognitive function differs between normally developing preterm children compared to full-term children during middle childhood. Methods: A total of 58 early preterm (<32 weeks' gestation) and 55 full-term children, aged 6-10 years and enrolled in elementary school, were assessed on sleep duration, sleep continuity and cognitive function. We used in-home polysomnographic recordings of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and nocturnal awakenings. Cognitive tests included intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, verbal memory, and visuospatial memory. Results: Preterm children showed poorer performance in intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, and visuospatial memory (d = 0.38-0.79, p < 0.05) and more objectively assessed nocturnal awakenings (d = 0.40, p = 0.03) than full-term children. Associations of sleep efficiency and cognitive functions (intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, visuospatial memory) were positive and stronger for preterm children (β = 0.17-0.31, p < 0.05), while they were nonsignificant for full-term children. Conclusion: Results confirm lower cognitive test scores and more nocturnal awakenings in normally developing early preterm children compared to full-term children. Furthermore, poor sleep efficiency may aggravate cognitive deficits, particularly in children who are more vulnerable due to premature birth.

N2  - Background: Stress, depression, and anxiety affect 15 to 25% of pregnant women. However, fewer than 20% of prenatal care providers assess and treat mental health problems and fewer than 20% of pregnant women seek mental healthcare. For those who seek treatment, the lack of health system integration and existing barriers frequently prevent treatment access. Without treatment, poor prenatal mental health can persist for years and impact future maternal, child, and family well-being.Methods/Design: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated process of online psychosocial assessment, referral, and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for pregnant women compared to usual prenatal care (no formal screening or specialized care). The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization. Secondary outcomes are postpartum depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem; sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development; parenting stress/competence; and intervention cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. Pregnant women are eligible if they: 1) are <28 weeks gestation; 2) speak/read English; 3) are willing to complete email questionnaires; 4) have no, low, or moderate psychosocial risk on screening at recruitment; and 5) are eligible for CBT. A sample of 816 women will be recruited from large, urban primary care clinics and allocation is by computer-generated randomization. Women in the intervention group will complete an online psychosocial assessment, and those with mild or moderate depression, anxiety, or stress symptoms then complete six interactive cognitive behavior therapy modules. All women will complete email questionnaires at 6 to 8 weeks postrandomization and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Clinic-based providers and researchers conducting chart abstraction and analysis are blinded. Qualitative interviews with 8 to 10 healthcare providers and 15 to 30 intervention group women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Results of this trial will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrated approach to prenatal mental healthcare and the use of highly accessible computer-based psychosocial assessment and CBT on maternal, infant, and family-based outcomes.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01901796. © 2014 Kingston et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: To investigate the relation between restless legs syndrome (RLS) and obstructive sleep apnea symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of diagnostic criteria of restless legs syndrome, demographic characteristics, personal behavior, muscle cramps during pregnancy, past medical illnesses, family history of RLS, and the major symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was administered during a face-to-face interview. Pregnant women with and without RLS were compared in terms of serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, calcium, phosphor, iron, folate, vitamin B12 levels, and obstructive sleep apnea symptoms. Results: There were statistically significant differences between two groups in terms of two of the obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (witnessed apnea and fatigue) (p < 0.01). No statistically significant difference was found with regard to serum calcium, magnesium, iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, vitamin B12, phosphor, and folate levels; however, there were significant differences in terms of total iron-binding capacity. Conclusions: Increasing awareness of restless legs syndrome among obstetricians is essential as it might be related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, which is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:: To examine the link between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and sleep-disordered breathing using complete polysomnography and questionnaires in a case-control study of pregnant women. METHODS:: Pregnant women (body mass index [BMI] less than 35, no prior diabetes or hypertension) were eligible as cases (n=26) if diagnosed with GDM by routine 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Women in the control group without GDM (n=26) were matched for gestational age at polysomnography, BMI, and age. Polysomnography were conducted at home at 24-32 weeks of gestation. Sleepiness score (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), risk for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), and restless legs syndrome were assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS:: Primary outcome apnea-hypopnea index (4.2±3.9 events per hour in women in the case group compared with 3.8±2.3 events per hour in women in the control group) as well as other objective and subjective sleep measures, including oxygen desaturation index, snoring, and flow limitation, were not significantly different between groups. Sleepiness was greater in women in the case group than in women in the control group (9.8±3.6 compared with 7.2±3.6, P=.05). Additionally, 23% of women in the case group compared with 0% of women in the control group (P<.01) reported an Edinburgh Scale score of at least 10 (suggesting significant depression) and 46% of women with GDM reported restless legs syndrome compared to 19% of women in the control group (P=.07). CONCLUSION:: There was no association between GDM and sleep-disordered breathing in pregnant women with prepregnancy BMIs under 35 and no medical comorbidities.

N2  - Background/Aims: Disruptions in circadian/biological rhythms are a hallmark of mood disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). A significant proportion of BD and MDD subjects display abnormal circadian rhythms even during inter-episodic periods. Pregnancy is often marked with changes in circadian rhythms, but no previous studies have compared circadian rhythms in pregnant and non-pregnant women with mood disorders. The objective of this ongoing study is to determine if circadian rhythm disruptions are exacerbated in late pregnancy in women with BD and MDD. Because both manic and depressive episodes are associated with marked changes in circadian rhythms we studied only women during sustained euthymia. Methods: 46 women were included in this preliminary analysis (26 Controls, 10 with BD, 10 with MDD). All groups were agematched. Half of the participants were pregnant and half were non-pregnant experiencing regular menstrual cycles and not on hormonal contraceptives. Clinical assessments were carried out during the third trimester of pregnancy (>26 weeks) for the pregnant group and during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in non-pregnant women. Psychiatric diagnoses were confirmed with the MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Circadian rhythms were assessed through the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN). Severity of mood symptoms was assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). All BD and MDD participants were currently euthymic for at least 3 months (Mean ± SD MADRS = 7.3 ± 4.1; YMRS = 2.1 ± 1.7). Results: No significant differences were found in BRIAN scores between pregnant and non-pregnant groups in either the controls or mood groups (both p > 0.05). However, comparisons of BRIAN scores between mood and control subjects revealed higher BRIAN scores in the mood group, despite pregnancy status (p = 0.0003). Conclusions: These preliminary results show that pregnancy does not seem to affect circadian rhythms in women with or without history of BD/MDD during remission. Rather, our findings are consistent with previous literature suggesting that circadian irregularities are phenotypic characteristics of mood disorders and may have a genetic basis.

N2  - background: Research within the last decade has shown melatonin to have previously-unsuspected beneficial actions on the peripheral reproductive organs. Likewise, numerous investigations have documented that stable circadian rhythms are also helpful in maintaining reproductive health. The relationship of melatonin and circadian rhythmicity to maternal and fetal health is summarized in this review. methods: Databases were searched for the related published English literature up to 15 May 2013. The search terms used in various combinations included melatonin, circadian rhythms, biological clock, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ovary, pregnancy, uterus, placenta, fetus, pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, ischemia-reperfusion, chronodisruption, antioxidants, oxidative stress and free radicals. The results of the studies uncovered are summarized herein. results: Both melatonin and circadian rhythms impact reproduction, especially during pregnancy. Melatonin is a multifaceted molecule with direct free radical scavenging and indirect antioxidant activities. Melatonin is produced in both the ovary and in the placenta where it protects against molecular mutilation and cellular dysfunction arising from oxidative/nitrosative stress. The placenta, in particular, is often a site of excessive free radical generation due to less than optimal adhesion to the uterine wall, which leads to either persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, processes that cause massive free radical generation and organ dysfunction. This may contribute to pre-eclampsia and other disorders which often complicate pregnancy. Melatonin has ameliorated free radical damage to the placenta and to the fetus in experiments using non-human mammals. Likewise, the maintenance of a regular maternal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle is important to stabilize circadian rhythms generated by the maternal central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Optimal circadian rhythmicity in the mother is important since her circadian clock, either directly or indirectly via the melatonin rhythm, programs the developing master oscillator of the fetus. Experimental studies have shown that disturbed maternal circadian rhythms, referred to as chronodisruption, and perturbed melatonin cycles have negative consequences for the maturing fetal oscillators, which may lead to psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn. To optimize regular circadian rhythms and prevent disturbances of the melatonin cycle during pregnancy, shift work and bright light exposure at night should be avoided, especially during the last trimester of pregnancy. Finally, melatonin synergizes with oxytocin to promote delivery of the fetus. Since blood melatonin levels are normally highest during the dark period, the propensity of childbirth to occur at night may relate to the high levels of melatonin at this time which work in concert with oxytocin to enhance the strength of uterine contractions. conclusions: Anumber of conclusions naturally evolve fromthe data summarized in this review: (i) melatonin, of both pineal and placental origin, has essential functions in fetal maturation and placenta/uterine homeostasis; (ii) circadian clock genes, which are components of all cells including those in the peripheral reproductive organs, have important roles in reproductive and organismal (fetal and maternal) physiology; (iii) due to the potent antioxidant actions of melatonin, coupled with its virtual absence of toxicity, this indoleamine mayhave utility in the treatment of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, placental and fetal ischemia/reperfusion, etc. (iv) the propensity for parturition to occur at night may relate to the synergism between the nocturnal increase in melatonin and oxytocin. © The Author 2013.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Maternal physiology undergoes major adaptations in pregnancy to ensure growth and development of the fetus and placenta whilst maintaining maternal wellbeing. Under normal conditions, many physiological processes (e.g. glucose homeostasis and oxidative metabolism), oscillate in circadian patterns driven by biological clocks entrained to the light-dark cycle.Clock genes (e.g. Clock, Bmal1, Per1) expressed within the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues (liver, kidney etc.), drive these metabolic processes in a circadian manner. How pregnancy impacts on clock gene expression and how this relates to changes in metabolic processes seen in pregnancy is currently unclear. Here we examined whether circadian expression of hepatic clock genes changes with the onset and progression of gestation. METHODS: Tissues were collected from C57Bl/6J mice (n=6 per group) at diestrus I in non-pregnant animals, or on day 10-11 or day 18-19 of gestation (term = day 19). Collections were performed at 6 circadian time points (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 0000, 0400h) throughout each 24 h period. mRNA expression levels for the core canonical clock genes were measured by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: While robust circadian rhythms in mRNA expression were evident for both Bmal1 (P<0.001) and Per1 (P<0.001) at all stages, pregnancy resulted in major changes in both their absolute expression and circadian patterns. Bmal1 expression increased dramatically (all circadian time points) between diestrus and day 10 (up to 14-fold; P<0.05), whereas Per1 increased 2- to 4-fold at 0800h (P<0.001), 2000h (P=0.027) and 0000h (P=0.011). Expression of both genes then fell between days 10 and 18 (Bmal1 by up to 96%; P<0.001; Per1 by up to 89%; P=0.002). Pregnancy also altered the circadian expression patterns of both genes; the amplitude of Bmal1 expression fell from 30-fold at diestrus to 12- fold at day 10 before recovering by day 18. In contrast, Per1 amplitude increased from 13-fold at diestrus to 25-fold at day 10 of gestation, but then fell to only 3-fold by day 18. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that pregnancy induces major changes in the core circadian clock machinery of the maternal liver, an effect likely to drive key maternal metabolic adaptations.

N2  - PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10-20 weeks gestation.
METHODS: Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain.
RESULTS: On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality (M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (β = -.18, p < 0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (β = -.18, p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women.
DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal study.

N2  - Adolescent period is a transition from childhood to adulthood by biological, psychological and social changes; The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that adolescence occurs between 10-19 years of age. Sixteen million girls between the age of 15-19 and two million girls under the age of 15 give birth worldwide every year. Nowadays, one of every five girls and in underdeveloped areas, one of every three girls gives birth under the age of 18. A 15 years old girl was referred to us by judicial authorities. In the anamnesis, we noted that the patient went to her boyfriend's house 3-4 months ago, after he told her “come to our house, my sister is here also”, when the patient saw that there was nobody in the house. She got disturbed and wanted to leave but the boyfriend did not let her go, calmed her down saying “do not worry, I will not do anything”. He brought a beverage to drink; she did not remember what happened after drinking it. When she regained consciousness, she was lying together with her boyfriend, she felt so bad and the boyfriend deceived her with false marriage promise. The patient found out that she was pregnant before coming to our policlinic, when we asked her opinion about the coming child; the patient said, “she absolutely did not want to have an abortion, the child kept her hold on to life”. In the mental status examination, it was noted that she felt so unhappy, regret, she could not sleep at night, could not eat properly, wanted to die but would not do it because of her baby, that the incident kept coming to her mind. The patient had dysphoric affect, and depressive thoughts were dominant in her thought content. Major depression diagnosis was considered in this patient. Drug use in pregnancy, although it is generally a concern of adult psychiatry has become a common condition in child and adolescent psychiatry along with the decrease in age at first sexual intercourse. According to Turkish Penal Code article 99, it is possible to terminate the pregnancy until the 20th week in pregnancies resulting from sexual abuse. It is recommended that non-pharmacological treatments should be tried first in treatment of mild and moderate depression in pregnancy. Regarding patients with more severe depression, psychotherapy alone may not be enough, therefore adding an antidepressant agent to the treatment may be necessary. Antidepressant use in pregnancy has been shown to increase in recent years. In one study, it was shown that antidepressant drug use increased approximately fourfold between 1996-2005 and antidepressants were prescribed to 8% of pregnant women between 2004-2005. Our case was presented to draw attention to this topic, because adolescent pregnancies have become more common, it is thought that the number of adolescent pregnancies would keep increasing and in addition, use of drugs in pregnancy and studies on this subject have increased.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: While the adverse effects of maternal obesity on pregnancy outcome (e.g. increased rates of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes) are well recognised, the specific mechanisms underlying such effects remain poorly understood. Because circadian rhythms are integral to metabolic homeostasis and undergo substantial adaptations in pregnancy, they may provide a mechanistic link between obesity and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study examined the impact of obesity on maternal circadian variation in core body temperature (CBT) and clock gene expression in metabolic tissues. It was hypothesised that obesitydriven disturbances to the circadian system may disturb key maternal adaptations that normally occur in pregnancy. METHODS: Female Wistar rats were fed either chow alone (CON) or chow supplemented with a cafeteria diet (CAF) to induce obesity prior to mating. iButton temperature loggers were implanted and programmed to record CBT every 15 min throughout pregnancy. CBT rhythms were assessed by cosinor analysis to derive mesor, amplitude and acrophase. Maternal liver and adipose tissue samples were collected at four hourly time points across day 15 and 21 of gestation. Expression of core clock genes was analysed in these tissues by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Obesity reduced mesor CBT during pregnancy (0.18°C; P<0.01) but did not affect amplitude or acrophase of the temperature rhythm. There was a significant interaction (P<0.02) between diet and pregnancy stage, such that the pre-partum decline in CBT (typically observed in rats) commenced by day 16 in both groups, but was smaller in CAF animals such that CBT values converged in the CON and CAF mothers near term. Preliminary gene expression analysis at 12pm showed hepatic expression of Bmal1 was decreased (43%; P<0.05) while Per2, Per3 and Reverbα were all increased (57%, 64%, 43%; P<0.05) in the CAF group. In contrast, the CAF diet had no effect on clock gene expression in adipose tissue at 12pm. CONCLUSIONS: Diet-induced obesity altered maternal CBT regulation throughout pregnancy without affecting temperature rhythmicity. Hepatic, but not adipose, clock gene expression was also affected by the CAF diet at 12pm. This indicates that obesity disturbs the circadian molecular machinery in a tissue-specific manner. Further analyses across all circadian time points are needed to define the full impact of maternal obesity on the circadian profile of hepatic and adipose clock genes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Kisspeptin, the neuropeptide product of the Kiss1 gene, has a critical role in driving the hypothalamic-gonadal-pituitary (HPG) axis and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons are most abundant in the hypothalamus, particularly in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and arcuate nucleus (Arc). These two populations mediate differential effects, with the Arc regulating negative feedback of sex steroids, and the AVPV regulating positive feedback. The latter is responsible for stimulating the preovulatory LH surge in females, and is consequently under circadian control. Little is known about the role or regulation hypothalamic Kiss1 during pregnancy. We aimed to characterise hypothalamic Kiss1 and Kiss1r mRNA expression in pregnant and nonpregnant mice, and determine whether it is under circadian control. METHODS: Using C57BL/6J mice, brains were collected at six circadian time points: 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm, 12am, 4am at diestrus and proestrus of non-pregnant animals, and days 6, 10, 14 and 18 of pregnancy. Hypothalami were dissected into anterior (containing the AVPV) and posterior (containing the Arc) regions. mRNA levels for target genes Kiss1 and Kiss1r, as well as reference genes, were analysed using quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Analyses confirmed Kiss1 mRNA expression in the AVPV and Arc; quantitative assessment showed no indication of circadian regulation at diestrus or any of the pregnancy time points. During proestrus however, Kiss1 expression increased (2-fold; P<0.05) from 4pm to 8pm, coincident with the occurrence of the LH surge. Similarly, Kiss1r was detectable in both the anterior and posterior hypothalamus at all stages and time points; some variability was observed, however no clear circadian pattern was established. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data are the first to show Kiss1 and Kiss1r expression in the maternal brain during pregnancy. The absence of circadian regulation of Kiss1 during pregnancy, in spite of high estradiol levels, may indicate a disruption of the normal circadian rhythm that operates in the non-pregnant state.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep terror is a parasomnia seen during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. They typically arise from slow wave (N3) NREM sleep. Sleep terrors have been reported to affect approximately 3% of children and <1% of adults. Management of sleep terrors may take many forms. Along with that its etiology is not enlightened completely, an exact clearness doesn't exist about the treatment. Although the most used medicines at pharmacological treatment are benzodiazepines and antidepressants, melatonin and other various agents have been used at treatment. In this presentation we aimed to discuss melatonin treatment in patient with sleep terror in the presence of the literature knowledge. Report of case: 36 months old male patient was consulted to our clinic with complaints of frequently nocturnal awakening, screaming and şuttering for half an hour after falling a sleep, present for a year. There was not any remarcable problem in his birth history, but mother was stressed during pregnancy. She defined her child as stubborn child and claimed that his stubbornness and sleep problems were similar to his husband. Also we learned that patient's 8-year-old brother has difficulty in falling asleep and his sleep time was shorter than expected. Symptoms of autistic spectrum disorder were not observed in patient according to DSM-IV criteria. Patient's neurological evaluation was normal. After diagnosis of sleep terror, melatonin treatment for 1 mg/day has been started by our clinic. Patient tolerated the treatment and was complaint free at the end of the month. Discussion: Sleep terrors are dramatic events that represent a partial arousal state from deep sleep and they are characterized by marked autonomic nervous system activation: tachycardia, tachypnea, tremulousness, mydriasis, and sweating are often present. Management of sleep terrors may take many forms. Although the most used medicines at pharmacological treatment are benzodiazepines and antidepressants, melatonin and other various agents have been used at treatment. We presented 36 month old male patient with symptoms of severe sleep terror and we obtained positive results of melatonin treatment. There is not sufficient information in the literature about the melatonin use in sleep terror. According to this case presentation, melatonin appears to be safe and well tolerated treatment for sleep terror in children . More controlled studies are needed on this issue.

N2  - Background: There are few studies investigating the relationship between respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and asthma in the offspring, and none among mothers with asthma. Infants of mothers with asthma are more likely to wheeze and have a higher risk of developing asthma than infants of non-asthmatic mothers. Methods: A prospective cohort study of viral infection in pregnancy was conducted between 2007 and 2009, and a subgroup of infants of mothers with asthma was followed up at 6 and 12 months of age. During common colds, nasal and throat swabs were collected from mothers and respiratory viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction. Respiratory health of infants was assessed by parent-completed questionnaire. Results: Twelve-month-old infants whose mothers had confirmed viral infections in pregnancy (n = 26) reported more frequent wheeze (40% had 4-12 wheeze attacks compared with 0%), sleep disturbed by wheeze (1 night per week or more in 60% vs. 11%), beta agonist treatment for wheeze (27% vs. 0%), prolonged colds (2 wk or longer 31% vs. 0%), more eczema (40% vs. 6.3%), and parent-perceived asthma (32% vs. 0%), compared with infants whose mothers had common colds without laboratory-confirmed viral infection (n = 16). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a relationship between maternal respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and wheezing illness in infants of mothers with asthma. Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in pregnancy, and infants of asthmatic mothers are at increased risk of asthma themselves. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Pregnancy and postpartum period are periods when psychiatric disorders emerge or exacerbate. These periods are effective in the emergence or the course of OCD. It is reported that OCD is frequent in the third trimester of pregnancy and its characteristics during pregnancy and postpartum are similar. This study will discuss an OCD case starting at 31st week of pregnancy. The woman, aged 32, is married and works as a nurse and has a child aged 4. The patient who sees a blood spot in her uniform washes her uniform immediately after arriving at home, wipes everywhere at home and takes a bath. Then, she starts to worry that diseases such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and AIDS will be transmitted to her from the patients and the vicinity. She reports that hand washing during 36th week of her pregnancy were 50-60 times a day. She runs away from street cats with the fear of contracting rabies. She cannot touch her child, fearing that germ may be transmitted to her child. She sits at a corner at home almost in crinkled position and does not want to get out of bed. She started not to go outside with the fear that germ might be transmitted. She was referred to a psychiatrist with the recommendation of gynecology specialist. Sertraline started to be given to the patient 20 days ago and the dose was increased to 75 mg/day and when sleep withdrawal caused problem 10 days ago, 2.5 mg/day olanzapine was added. It was observed during the examination of her mood that her mood and affection were anxious. It drew attention that she considered a spot on the armchair upholstery to be a blood spot and was afraid and she could not concentrate on the interview and focused on checking the environment. Thoughts that she cannot bear with this situation were dominant in her thought content. She did not have suicide thoughts. Her Y-BOCS score was 30. The patient, who continued pharmacological treatment and had a difficult week because of her obsessions, delivered her baby with caesarean at 37th week. She discontinued her medication, at her own will, since she wanted to breastfeed the infant. Since she experienced an intolerable anxiety 5 days later, she stopped breastfeeding and started to take her medication. When the patient was seen again 2 months after the delivery, 200 mg/day sertraline and 1mg/day risperidone treatment had been gradually started by another doctor. The patient was breastfeeding and was relieved. Her Y-BOCS score was 15. She could take good care of her baby. Her sleep was good. Her anxiety was highly decreased. Hand washing and baths prominently decreased. Her obsessions related to transmittance were partially ongoing. Women should be scanned for OCD in pregnancy and postpartum period. OCD diagnosis should be made in these periods as soon as possible, correct family and patient psychoeducation should be provided, and psychopharmacological treatment and/or psychotherapy should be applied on time.

N2  - Background Our goal is to study the triggers of spontaneous preterm delivery using a case-crossover design. Methods In a pilot study, we enrolled 50 women with spontaneous preterm labour (PTL) and 50 with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) between 2011 and 2012. To assess non-transient risk factors, we also enrolled a control group of 158 pregnant women at their regular prenatal care visits matched to cases by gestational age and calendar time. The index time was defined as the onset of PTL/PPROM (for cases) or interview (for controls). Detailed data were collected through structured interviews regarding factors of interest during the 72 h that preceded the index time. Within case subjects, we compared the frequency of transient factors from 0 to 24 h before index time with that from 48 to 72 h before index time, and estimated matched odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Previously hypothesised chronic risk factors for spontaneous preterm delivery, including mood disorders and stressful events, were more common among cases than among controls. Within cases, skipped meals [OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2, 15.2], disturbed sleep [OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.5, 13.3], sexual activity [OR 6.0, 95% CI 0.7, 69.8], and intake of spicy foods [OR 7.0, 95% CI 1.6, 30.8] were associated with an increased risk for PTL/PPROM within the subsequent 24 h. For physical exertion and other potential risk factors evaluated, the OR was close to the null. Conclusion Skipping meals and disturbed sleep may be associated with imminent PTL/PPROM; sexual activity and spicy food may trigger PTL/PPROM in susceptible women. Larger case-crossover studies will be able to evaluate the impact of modifiable risk factors and acute predictors of PTL/PPROM, and might help guide obstetrical management. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: Enterically transmitted hepatitis A and E are still endemic problem in Nepal. Although a self-limiting disease, they present with complications in few cases, even in non-pregnant women. Prolong cholestasis is one of them. It is assumed that cholestatic type of acute viral hepatitis is present in less than 10 % of acute viral hepatitis due to hepatitis A and E. It is more common in hepatitis A than hepatitis E. This cause morbidity in patients in terms of severe itching and loss of sleep. No definitive treatment is available till now. We aimed to see the effect of low dose steroids in patients presenting with cholestatic hepatitis due to hepatitis A and E. Materials and methods: This retrospective, non-blinded study was carried in Liver Unit of our institution from January 2010 to December 2012. Consecutive patients of acute viral hepatitis presenting with prolong cholestasis were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria were serologically diagnosed case of hepatitis A and E presenting with severe itching and USG showing normal biliary tree. Exclusion criteria were presence of active bacterial infection, past history of liver disease, significant alcohol intake. Patients were selected alternatively for ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg BD or prednisolone 15 mg OD along with other supportive treatment. Alleviation of symptoms, fall in bilirubin and liver enzymes were compared in first and second week of treatment. Result: In three years study period, out of 780 patients of acute viral hepatitis patient, 94 (12 %) presented with severe pruritus along with loss of sleep. 59 patients were suffering from HEV hepatitis while 35 from HAV hepatitis. After excluding 12 patients, 82 patients were enrolled in the study with 41 patients in each arm. Pruritus was more common in patients who had consumed herbal medications before attending to the clinic. Pruritus was relieved significantly in steroid group, within one week of treatment, along with fall in bilirubin. Patient slept well sooner in steroid group. Appetite also increased more in steroid group. Normalization of transamination was little delayed in steroid group. However, the change was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Twelve per cent of acute viral hepatitis present with cholestatic feature in this study. Cholestasis was more common in HAV hepatitis than HEV. Consumption of herbal medication was associated with more sever symptom. Low dose steroid was effective in alleviating pruritus and fall in bilirubin without any significant side effects. Low dose of steroid can be used to treat cholestasis of acute viral hepatitis.

N2  - In 1994 I was contacted by the DRK Kinderklinik Siegen for evaluation of a 4-week-old male infant with multiple congenital malformations and partial trisomy 3q13-qter und partial monosomy 4q35 (46,XY,t(3;4)dup(3)(3q13.3-qter),del4(q35-qter)). This imbalanced karyotype was due to a maternal balanced reciprocal translocation (46,XX,t(3;4)(q13.3;q35)). The infant (R.A.T. 120894/94E1266/6934) was born at 35 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 2090 g, length of 42 cm and OFC 31 cm, Apgar 7/8/10. Dysmorphic facial features included upward slanting palpebral fissures, broad depressed nasal bridge, anteverted nostrils, micrognathia, low set ears, short neck, and short extremities. He had a high arched palate without clefting. A large ventricular septal defect and a type II atrial septal defect were diagnosed, but no signs of cardiac insufficiency. X-ray signs of a skeletal dysplasia were absent. The infant was discharged in satisfactory general condition at the age of two months with a weight of 2850 g, length 49 cm and OFC 34.8 cm. He had left facial paralysis and developed opisthotonus and respiratory stridor. At home he responded to external stimuli. Respiratory stridor and breathing difficulties increased. At the age of 5 months the infant died at home in his sleep. The parents did not consent to an autopsy. I presented a preliminary report at the 21st Arbeitstreffen Klinische Genetik Nordrhein on October 10, 1995 in Düsseldorf. Prior to the birth of this infant the mother had had three spontaneous abortions at 7, 11, and 28 weeks gestation and had given birth to a normal girl, at that time five years old. Chromosomal analysis in Essen confirmed the imbalanced karyotype in the infant and revealed the presence of the balanced reciprocal translocation in the mother and the daughter. The maternal grandmother had a normal karyotype, the paternal grandfather was not available for study. The parents of the patient were informed of the situation by genetic counseling and my written reports. These emphasized that their 5-year-old daughter with the balanced translocation should be reexamined and receive genetic counseling when she reached adulthood. I marked the record of this family not to be discarded after ten years. In addition, I sent an informatory letter to the family in 2001, six years after the patient had died. In November 2013 the patient's sister, now age 25 years, contacted me in Leipzig for genetic counseling to aid in her family planning. Chromosomal analyses of her and her partner are being done, and various options for prenatal diagnosis will be discussed with the couple on December 4, 2013. The size of the patient's duplication 3q appears to be the largest documented in a live-born infant, albeit without a distinctive phenotype. This observation emphasizes the importance of providing long-term follow-up in disorders that can re-occur in consecutive generations in one family.

N2  - Human Psychopharmacology recently published my review into the increase in empirical knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA over the past 25 years (Parrott, 2013a). Deficits have been demonstrated in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, complex visual processing, sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, pain, neurohormonal activity, and psychiatric status. Neuroimaging studies have shown serotonergic deficits, which are associated with lifetime Ecstasy/MDMA usage, and degree of neurocognitive impairment. Basic psychological skills remain intact. Ecstasy/MDMA use by pregnant mothers leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Hence, the damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA were far more widespread than was realized a few years ago. In their critique of my review, Doblin et al. (2014) argued that my review contained misstatements, omitted contrary findings, and recited dated misconceptions. In this reply, I have answered all the points they raised. I have been able to refute each of their criticisms by citing the relevant empirical data, since many of their points were based on inaccurate summaries of the actual research findings. Doblin and colleagues are proponents of the use of MDMA for drug-assisted psychotherapy, and their strongest criticisms were focused on my concerns about this proposal. However, again all the issues I raised were based on sound empirical evidence or theoretical understanding. Indeed I would recommend potentially far safer co-drugs such as D-cycloserine or oxytocin. In summary, MDMA can induce a wide range of neuropsychobiological changes, many of which are damaging to humans. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: Previous investigations have suggested a strong association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. However, the results of the following replication studies were not always concordant. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the more reliable estimate. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Springer Link, and EMBASE to identify all eligible studies published before August 2013. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed or random effects model. Results: A total of 24 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. Findings demonstrated that moderate-to-severe SDB during pregnancy was associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI, 1.29 to 2.46), pregnancy-related hypertension (OR = 2.38; 95 % CI, 1.63 to 3.47), preeclampsia (OR = 2.19; 95 % CI, 1.71 to 2.80), preterm delivery (OR = 1.98; 95 % CI, 1.59 to 2.48), low birth weight (OR = 1.75; 95 % CI, 1.33 to 2.32), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (OR = 2.43; 95 % CI, 1.61 to 3.68), intrauterine growth restriction (OR = 1.44; 95 % CI, 1.22 to 1.71), and Apgar score of <7 at 1 min (OR = 1.78; 95 % CI, 1.10 to 2.91) based on all studies but not gestational age and birth weight. Conclusions: This meta-analysis revealed that moderate-to-severe SDB during pregnancy may be associated with most of adverse perinatal outcomes. Further well-designed studies are warranted to confirm our findings. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - BACKGROUND:: Frequency of pertussis is highly variable from country to country and it depends on multiple factors including case definitions and type of surveillance systems used. Many countries recently reported an increase of pertussis cases especially in infants and adolescents. METHODS:: From April 2006 to March 2011, 15-year-old patients hospitalized with suspected or proven pertussis were reported to the Swiss Pediatric Surveillance Unit. Patients with ≥14 days of cough plus paroxysms, whooping or post-tussive vomiting fulfilled the clinical case definition of pertussis. For laboratory confirmation, Bordetella pertussis polymerase chain reaction was offered free of charge. RESULTS:: Data were available from 159 of 173 reported cases and 130 (90% of them <12 months old) were eligible including 125 laboratory-confirmed B. pertussis infections. Rates per 100,000 population were 2.6 (<16 years) and 38.8 (<12 months), respectively. Most frequent complications were cyanosis (63%) and sleep disturbance (60%); 35 (27%) patients received intensive care and 1 patient died. Source of infection was known in 79 (61%) patients and was mainly a sibling, parent or both. Most patients were unimmunized (65%) or incompletely immunized (30%). CONCLUSIONS:: The high rate of pertussis hospitalization in young infants established in this surveillance project and the incomplete pertussis immunization status in almost all hospitalized patients require further efforts for improvement. In addition, introduction of pertussis immunizations for all adolescents (in 2013), young adults (in 2012) and pregnant women (in 2013) in Switzerland should increase indirect protection of vulnerable newborns and infants too young to be fully immunized.

N2  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that neonatal sleep physiology reflects cerebral dysfunction, we compared neurologic examination scores to the proportions of recorded sleep/wake states, sleep depth, and sleep fragmentation in critically ill neonates. Methods: Newborn infants (≥35 weeks gestation) who required intensive care and were at risk for seizures were monitored with 8- to 12-hour polysomnograms (PSGs). For each infant, the distribution of sleep-wake states, entropy of the sequence of state transitions, and delta power from the EEG portion of the PSG were quantified. Standardized neurologic examination (Thompson) scores were calculated. Results: Twenty-eight infants participated (mean gestational age 39.0 ± 1.6 weeks). An increased fraction of quiet sleep correlated with worse neurologic examination scores (Spearman rho5 0.54, p= 0.003), but the proportion of active sleep did not (p> 0.1). Higher state entropy corresponded to better examination scores (rho= -0.43, p = 0.023). Decreased delta power during quiet sleep, but not the power at other frequencies, was also associated with worse examination scores (rho = -0.48, p = 0.009). These findings retained significance after adjustment for gestational age or postmenstrual age at the time of the PSG. Sleep stage transition probabilities were also related to examination scores. Conclusions: Among critically ill neonates at risk for CNS dysfunction, several features of recorded sleep-including analyses of sleep stages, depth, and fragmentation-showed associations with neurologic examination scores. Quantitative PSG analyses may add useful objective information to the traditional neurologic assessment of critically ill neonates.

N2  - This paper reviews recent work investigating the influence of sleep disturbances on maternal hyperglycemia, particularly gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The incidence and prevalence of hyperglycemia are increasing worldwide, which is cause for concern because GDM and even mild hyperglycemia are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. A better understanding of sleep-related risk factors for maternal hyperglycemia is an important health matter. Evidence demonstrates associations between sleep disturbances, especially sleep-disordered breathing, and hyperglycemia, but causal effects and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions have not been fully elucidated. Subjective sleep assessments show associations between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There are, however, few studies using objective measures to support these findings. Large prospective studies are required to examine causal relationships between sleep disturbances and maternal hyperglycemia. There is also a need for smaller mechanistic studies to understand the pathophysiology. Furthermore, interventional studies are required to address whether improvement of sleep parameters can prevent/decrease the risk of developing maternal hyperglycemia. Taken together, the data suggests that sleep disturbances during pregnancy are important to identify and manage in order to minimize maternal hyperglycemia and GDM, and improve maternal and fetal well-being. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Background: In contrast to postpartum mood episodes in women with bipolar disorder, little is known about the risk of recurrence in men with bipolar disorder who have just become fathers. Case report: We present the case of a man with bipolar disorder who had a manic episode immediately after becoming a father. His spouse had a normal pregnancy, and delivery started during daytime and lasted until the early morning hours. The patient subsequently developed a manic episode, which had a major impact on the family. Conclusions: There is a well-known relationship between sleep loss and the occurrence of a manic episode. The study of psychopathology in the postpartum period in relation to sleep disturbance refers mainly to women. Disturbance of sleep patterns in the perinatal and postpartum period may also negatively impact the course of bipolar disorder in the father. In cases of pregnancy of a male bipolar disorder patient's spouse, preventive strategies for the postpartum period should be planned in advance. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - Background: Following the "back to sleep" recommendations, a striking rise in deformational plagiocephaly (DP) occurred. However, additional maternal, pregnancy and infant conditions may play a role. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for DP at birth. Additionally, given the association between assisted reproductive technologies (ART) use and unfavorable pregnancy events, we explored the association between ART and DP. Patients and Methods: A total of 413 neonates >33 weeks born at L. Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) from May 2011 through to January 2012 were enrolled. Data regarding parental, conceivement, pregnancy and delivery characteristics were recorded. Infants' skull measurements, including the oblique cranial length ratio (OCLR) were taken within 72h after birth. Plagiocephaly was defined for OCLR>105.9. Results: The prevalence of DP was 20.3%. It was associated with twinning (OR 5.0; 95%CI 2.22-11.1), pregnancy complications (OR 2.86; 95%CI 1.49-5.26), prematurity (OR 2.13; 95%CI 0.98-4.54), ART use (OR 2.00; 95%CI 0.90-4.35) and male gender (OR 1.79; 95%CI 0.94-2.50). Adjusting for multiple pregnancies however, the association between ART and DP disappeared. Conclusion: Results show that offspring of pregnancies conceived through ART do not have increased risk of DP. However, our numbers are small thus larger studies are needed for definitive conclusions. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Alteration in the HPA axis is a robust biomarker of anxiety and depression in adults, but questions remain about this association in pregnancy. We examined the longitudinal links between diurnal cortisol and mood symptoms from self-report questionnaire and diagnostic interview in an ethnically diverse, psychosocially at-risk sample of 101 women at mid-pregnancy and early third trimester. There were modest but significant associations between depression and elevated cortisol, indexed by a decreased morning level and diminished diurnal decline; the effects were strongest for diagnostic data from clinical interview. These effects were independent of socio-demographic factors and sleep disturbance. Associations with anxiety and trauma were generally non-significant. These findings extend prior work by showing that significant mood symptoms in pregnancy are associated with altered diurnal cortisol in pregnancy, which may have implications for maternal and child health. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background and objective. Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are common in primary care and may cause severe pain and sleep disturbance. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of magnesium in treating NLC and the side-effect profile of magnesium compared to placebo. Methods. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform registries until August 2012. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing magnesium therapy for NLC in adults with any other comparator were eligible. Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies. To compensate for the heterogeneity in outcome measures, simulations were used to summarize the data. Results. Seven RCTs were included in the review (n = 361), all comparing magnesium to placebo. Three of these trials included only pregnant women. The difference in the median number of leg cramps per week between the placebo and the intervention groups was 0.345 (quantile 2.5%: -0.133, quantile 97.5%: 0.875). This difference was 0.807 (quantile 2.5%: 0.015, quantile 97.5%: 1.207) in the three studies involving only pregnant women and 0.362 (quantile 2.5%: -0.386, quantile 97.5%: 1.148) in the others. Overall gastrointestinal side effects were slightly more common with magnesium therapy than with placebo. The strength of this evidence was weak, mainly due to small study sizes and short follow-up. Conclusions. Magnesium therapy does not appear to be effective in the treatment of NLC in the general population, but may have a small effect in pregnant women. Further research using better designed RCTs is necessary. © The Author 2013.

N2  - Background: Depression and anxiety are important mood changes in childbearing women. However, changes in depression and anxiety over time in women who undergo an elective cesarean section (CS) have not yet been elucidated. We aimed to characterize the trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and patterns of co-occurrence, and examined the associated predictors of depression and anxiety courses. Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of childbearing women (N = 139) who underwent a CS was conducted. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were respectively assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State Anxiety Inventory, in the third trimester and at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 and 6 months postpartum. Results: Group-based modeling identified three distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms: group 1 (low, 30.9%), group 2 (mild, 41.7%), and group 3 (high, 27.3%). Four group trajectories of anxiety symptoms were identified: group 1 (low, 19.4%), group 2 (mild, 44.6%), group 3 (high, 28.8%), and group 4 (very high, 7.2%). Mild symptoms of both depression and anxiety were the most common joint trajectory. Depression trajectories were significantly related to anxiety trajectories (p<0.001). Predictors of the joint trajectory included the pre-pregnant body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1∼6.3) and a poor sleep score (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4∼7.3) in the third trimester. Conclusions: Distinctive trajectories and co-occurrence patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms were identified. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to continuous assessment of psychological well-being among women who undergo an elective CS. © 2014 Kuo et al.

N2  - Background: The incidence of snoring and sleepiness is known to increase during pregnancy, and this might impact maternal health and obstetric outcome. However, the association between snoring and sleepiness during pregnancy is not fully understood. This study was aimed at investigating the development of snoring during pregnancy and prospectively assessing if there is an association between snoring and sleepiness or adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, mode of delivery, and fetal complications. Methods: Consecutively recruited pregnant women (n = 500) received a questionnaire concerning snoring and sleep at the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who had rated their frequency of snoring at both occasions (n = 340) were divided into subgroups according to the development of snoring they reported and included in the subsequent analyses. Additional medical data were collected from the medical records. Results: The frequency of snoring was 7.9% in the 1st trimester and increased to 21.2% in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who snored already in early pregnancy had significantly higher baseline BMI (p = 0.001) than the women who never snored, but snoring was not associated with the magnitude of weight gain during pregnancy. Snoring women were more likely to experience edema in late pregnancy than the non-snorers. Women who started to snore during pregnancy had higher Epworth Sleepiness Scores than the non snorers in both early and late pregnancy. No significant association between obstetric outcome and snoring was found. Conclusion: Snoring does increase during pregnancy, and this increase is associated with sleepiness, higher BMI at the start of pregnancy and higher prevalence of edema, but not with weight gain. © 2014 Sarberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The effects of rapid eye movement sleep restriction (REMSR) in rats during late pregnancy were studied on the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) made by the pups. USVs are distress calls inaudible to human ears. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was restricted in one group of pregnant rats for 22 hours, starting from gestational day 14 to 20, using standard single platform method. The USVs of male pups were recorded after a brief isolation from their mother for two minutes on alternate post-natal days, from day one till weaning. The USVs were recorded using microphones and were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively using SASPro software. Control pups produced maximum vocalization on post-natal days 9 to 11. In comparison, the pups born to REMSR mothers showed not only a reduction in vocalization but also a delay in peak call making days. The experimental group showed variations in the types and characteristics of call types, and alteration in temporal profile. The blunting of distress call making response in these pups indicates that maternal sleep plays a role in regulating the neural development involved in vocalizations and possibly in shaping the emotional behaviour in neonates. It is suggested that the reduced ultrasonic vocalizations can be utilized as a reliable early marker for affective state in rat pups. Such impaired vocalization responses could provide an important lead in understanding mother-child bonding for an optimal cognitive development during post-partum life. This is the first report showing a potential link between maternal REM sleep deprivation and the vocalization in neonates and infants. © 2014 Gulia et al.

N2  - Objective: Our primary purpose was to assess the impact of objectively measured nighttime sleep duration on gestational glucose tolerance. We additionally examined associations of objectively measured daytime sleep duration and nap frequency on maternal glycemic control. Methods: Sixty-three urban, low-income, pregnant women wore wrist actigraphs for an average of 6 full days in mid-pregnancy prior to screening for hyperglycemia using the 1-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Correlations of nighttime and daytime sleep durations with 1-h OGTT values were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between sleep parameters and hyperglycemia, defined as 1-h OGTT values ≥130. mg/dL. Results: Mean nighttime sleep duration was 6.9 ± 0.9. h which was inversely correlated with 1-h OGTT values (r= -0.28, P = .03). Shorter nighttime sleep was associated with hyperglycemia, even after controlling for age and body mass index (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.1-0.8]). There were no associations of daytime sleep duration and nap frequency with 1-h OGTT values or hyperglycemia. Conclusions: Using objective measures of maternal sleep time, we found that women with shorter nighttime sleep durations had an increased risk for gestational hyperglycemia. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our negative daytime sleep findings. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and adverse pregnancy outcomes in a high-risk cohort. Study Design This was a planned analysis of a prospective cohort designed to estimate the prevalence and trends of SDB in high-risk pregnant women. We recruited women with a body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater, chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, prior preeclampsia, and/or a twin gestation. Objective assessment of SDB was completed between 6 and 20 weeks and again in the third trimester. SDB was defined as an apnea hypopnea index of 5 or greater and further grouped into severity categories: mild SDB (5-14.9), moderate SDB (15-29.9), and severe SDB (≤30). Pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, infant weight) were abstracted by physicians blinded to the SDB results. Results Of the 188 women with a valid early pregnancy sleep study, 182 had complete delivery records. There was no relationship demonstrated between SDB exposure in early or late pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth less than 34 weeks, and small-for-gestational-age (<5%), or large-for-gestational-age (>95%) neonates. Conversely, SDB severity in early pregnancy was associated with the risk of developing gestational diabetes (no SDB, 25%; mild SDB, 43%; moderate/severe SDB, 63%; P =.03). The adjusted odds ratio for developing gestational diabetes for moderate/severe SDB was 3.6 (0.6, 21.8). Conclusion This study suggests a dose-dependent relationship between SDB in early pregnancy and the subsequent development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, no relationships between SDB during pregnancy and preeclampsia, preterm birth, and extremes of birthweight were demonstrated.

N2  - Objective: Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes and less mental well-being. In pregnant women with a mental disorder, who frequently suffer from sleep problems, it is unknown whether predominantly objective or subjective sleep quality is more affected. To clarify this, we compared objective and subjective parameters of sleep quality between patients and healthy controls during pregnancy. Methods: This observational study was embedded in an ongoing study among pregnant women with a mental disorder at the department of Psychiatry of Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We compared 21 pregnant women with a confirmed mental disorder with 33 healthy controls (gestational age, 23-29 weeks). To measure objective parameters of sleep quality, all participants continuously wore a wrist actigraph for 7 days and nights. Subjective sleep quality was retrospectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and on a daily basis with the Subjective Sleep Quality-scale (SSQ). Differences in parameters of sleep between patients and controls were tested using a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for parity, gestational age, educational level, and employment status.Results: Objective parameters of sleep quality and subjective sleep quality as assessed by the PSQI did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Daily sleep reports showed that, relative to controls, patients had a significantly worse average SSQ-score (5.2 vs. 7.6, adjusted β = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.03-0.53, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our exploratory study suggests that perceived sleep quality reported on a daily basis by pregnant women with a mental disorder is worse than the sleep quality as measured by wrist actigraphy.

N2  - Background: 79% of the pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders and can affect disorders before, during and after childbirth can be involved in causing depression during pregnancy, according to studies the poor quality of sleep in the second trimester of pregnancy is directly related to depressive symptoms in late pregnancy Also gender difference may have a role in depression. This study aimed to evaluate the association of depression and fetal sex in pregnant women with sleep disorder. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted on 972 pregnant women with sleep disorders referring to two selected health care centers in Makou affiliated to Urmia University of Medical Sciences during Jun-Oct 2012. Data collection tools included demographic characteristics questionnaire, Pittsburgh Standard Sleep Quality questionnaire, and Beck Depression standard questionnaires. Sampling was done by convenient sampling. Firstly, Pittsburg Standard Sleep Quality Questionnaire was completed and the pregnant women with sleep disorders were selected as the subjects then demographic characteristics questionnaire and Beck Depression standard questionnaires was completed by women, and statistical methods (Frequency tables, Pearson, independent t test, ANOVA, Chi-squear and fisher) used to analysis. Results: The results indicated that depression of pregnant women with sleep disorder reported 67.3 percent and there were significant association Between Depression and fetal sex. Pregnant women with male fetus experience depression more than women with female fetus (R= 0.067). Conclusion: Given that a large percentage of pregnant women suffer from sleep disorders and along with it from depression. Hope this period, in addition to usual care, special programs for research, Structured psychiatric interview, changing the social circumstances that many women face them, diagnostic and troubleshooting cause of the disturbance takes place.

N2  - Early-pregnancy short sleep duration is predictive of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia; mechanisms for these associations are unknown. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived peptide involved in regulating food intake and energy expenditure, may play a role in these observed associations. Given inconsistent reports linking short sleep duration with leptin, and absence of studies among pregnant women, we examined the association of maternal sleep duration with plasma leptin in early pregnancy. This cross-sectional study included 830 pregnant women. Plasma leptin was measured in samples collected around 13 weeks gestation. Sleep duration was categorized as: ≤5, 6, 7-8 (reference), and ≥9 hours. Differences in leptin concentrations across categories were estimated using linear regression. Analyses were completed for lean and overweight/obese women. Overall, women with long sleep duration had elevated plasma leptin (p-value = 0.04). However, leptin concentrations were not statistically significantly elevated in women with a short sleep duration. There was no association of leptin with sleep duration among lean women. Among overweight/obese women, a U-shaped relation between leptin and sleep duration was observed: Mean leptin was elevated (β = 21.96 ng/ml, P < 0.001) among women reporting ≤5 hour of sleep compared with reference group; and women reporting ≥9 hours of sleep also had elevated leptin (β = 4.29 ng/ml, P = 0.09). Short sleep duration, and to a lesser extent long sleep duration, were associated with elevated leptin among overweight/obese women. These data add some evidence to help understand mechanistic relationships of sleep duration with pregnancy complications.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep complaints are commonly reported during pregnancy. Sleep disturbances are typically exacerbated in the first and third trimester because of pregnancy-related anatomic changes and hormonal adaptations. Aim: The aim of this research is to assess the frequency of low sleep quality, daytime sleepiness among pregnant women taking into account different etiological factors. Material and methods. 147 pregnant women from the Perinatology Department of Medical Univeristy of Łódź were interviewed to assess their sleep alterations. Taking medicines and concomitant disorders which can affect low sleep quality were eliminated. 140 women in reproductive age represent the control group. The survey was comprised of demographic part and two tests: PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), ESS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) assessing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness respectively. Statistical analysis was performed by means of Statistica. Results: The survey confirmed sleep disorders amid 90,5% of pregnant women. Comparative analysis between pregnant patients and control group revealed a statistically significant difference in frequency of poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness (p<0,05). Simultaneously the impact of sleep disorders on ESS score was not confirmed (p>0,05). However there is a statistical connection between stress level, trimester of pregnancy and PSQI score. The most often causes of sleep disorders were an inconvenient position during sleep, necessity of going to the toilet at night and intensified stress. Sleep disorders increase in I and III trimester of pregnancy and have a complex etiological background. Conclusions: Received data suggests a tenuous relation between low sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. Incorrect scores of test which estimates the sleep quality were much more often observed among pregnant women than in control group (90,5%; 45,7% respectively).

N2  - Background: Pregnant women with complications including pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) often experience disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system. These pathologies are aggravated by sympathetic nervous system activation and may be related to stress. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of and changes in sleep quality and stress in pregnant women with PIH and GDM during the second and third trimesters. Methods: We enrolled 56 women in their second or third trimesters who were diagnosed with PIH or GDM. Participants completed questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SlgA) concentrations were measured as a biological indicator of stress. Results: PSS scores and subjective stress parameters were significantly higher than those reported from previous studies of healthy pregnant women (15.2 points and 15.1 points for the second and third trimesters, respectively).Mean one-day values for SIgA were 168.3 and 205.7. μg/mL for the second and third trimesters, respectively. During the second and third trimesters, SIgA scores were higher than those reported for healthy pregnant women in previous studies. The PSQI component scores sleep disturbance (C5) and sleep duration (C3) in follow up case were significantly higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester. Discussion: This investigation suggests that pregnant women with PIH and GDM experience higher stress levels than do non-pregnant women and healthy pregnant women. Further, our results indicate that sleep quality worsens during the third trimester compared with the second trimester. © 2014 Australian College of Midwives.

N2  - Background and aim: Pregnancy physiology may predispose women to the development of airflow limitations during sleep. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether pregnant women suspected of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are more likely to have airflow limitations compared to non-pregnant controls. Methods: We recruited pregnant women referred for polysomnography for a diagnosis of SDB. Non-pregnant female controls matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) were identified from a database. We examined airflow tracings for changes in amplitude and shape. We classified airflow limitation by (a) amplitude criteria defined as decreased airflow of ≥10. s without desaturation or arousal (FL 10), or decreased airflow of any duration combined with either 1-2% desaturation or arousal, (FL 1-2%); and (b) shape criteria defined as the presence of flattening or oscillations of the inspiratory flow curve. Results: We identified 25 case-control pairs. Mean BMI was 44.0. ±. 6.9 in cases and 44.1. ±. 7.3 in controls. Using shape criteria, pregnant women had significantly more flow-limited breaths throughout total sleep time (32.4. ±. 35.8 vs. 9.4. ±. 17.9, p<. 0.0001) and in each stage of sleep (p<. 0.0001) than non-pregnant controls. In a subgroup analysis, pregnant women without a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) who had an AHI <5 had similar findings (p<. 0.0001). There was no difference in airflow limitation by amplitude criteria between pregnant women and controls (p= 0.22). Conclusions: Pregnant women suspected of OSA have more frequent shape-defined airflow limitations than non-pregnant controls, even when they do not meet polysomnographic OSA criteria. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: Physiologic and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase risk of occurrence and severity of sleep breathing disorders in pregnant women. This study was performed with the aim to determine the frequency of sleep breathing disorders and some related factors in pregnant women referred to delivery ward of Alborz social security hospital of Karaj.
Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive study was performed on 200 pregnant women referred to the delivery ward of Alborz social security hospital of Karaj in 2009. Background information and Stop Bang questionnaire (for sleep breathing disorders screening) were evaluated through interviews, and information related to neonatal weight and Apgar score were evaluatedfrom medical records, and anthropometric indices of pregnant women were measured with balance scale and tap meter. The data was analyzed by SPSS software (version 18) and Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests. P< 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: 91 cases (54.5%) of pregnant women had habitual snoring, 114 (57%) daily sleepiness and fatigue, 43 (21.5%) sleep apnea, 14 (7%) hypertension, 6 (3%) body mass index > 35 kg/m2, and 20 (10%) neck circumference > 40 cm. 29 cases (14.5%) were at high risk for sleep breathing disorders. Statistical significant relationship was found between sleep breathing disorders in pregnant women and increased neck circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased BMI and higher Apgar score and increased birth weight (P<0.001).
Conclusions: Pregnant women are at risk for sleep breathing disorders and sleep breathing disorders are more common in pregnant women with central and general obesity, and higher blood pressure.

N2  - Background: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) has been shown to be associated with negative clinical sequelae such as systemic hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It has been reported in the literature that approximately 53-56 % of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have positional OSA, known as POSA. Potential treatment for SDB in pregnancy: These findings have led to a resurgence of positional therapy as an effective treatment for select patients with SDB. Pregnant patients can also be diagnosed with SDB, the negative consequences of which not only pertain to the patient but to the unborn fetus as well. Despite this, however, SDB is under-diagnosed in pregnant patients and research looking at SDB in pregnant patients and potential therapies are scarce. Conclusions: This article reviews the literature regarding the physiologic respiratory changes that occur during pregnancy, SDB in pregnancy, supine hypotensive syndrome (SHS), complications and current treatments for these events and potential roles for positional therapy in pregnant women whose problems may be specifically position dependent. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Objective: To assess the frequency of obstructive sleep apnoea among women with and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Obstetric clinics at an academic medical centre. Population: Pregnant women with hypertensive disorders (chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia) and women who were normotensive. Methods: Women completed a questionnaire about habitual snoring and underwent overnight ambulatory polysomnography. Main outcome measures: The presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnoea. Results: Obstructive sleep apnoea was found among 21 of 51 women with hypertensive disorders (41%), but in only three of 16 women who were normotensive (19%, chi-square test, P = 0.005). [Author correction added on 16 June 2014, after first online publication: Results mentioned in the abstract were amended.] Non-snoring women with hypertensive disorders typically had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, but >25% of snoring women with hypertensive disorders had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Among women with hypertensive disorders, the mean apnoea/hypopnoea index was substantially higher in snorers than in non-snorers (19.9 ± 34.1 versus 3.4 ± 3.1, P = 0.013), and the oxyhaemoglobin saturation nadir was significantly lower (86.4 ± 6.6 versus 90.2 ± 3.5, P = 0.021). Among women with hypertensive disorders, after stratification by obesity, the pooled relative risk for obstructive sleep apnoea in snoring women with hypertension compared with non-snoring women with hypertension was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.8). Conclusions: Pregnant women with hypertension are at high risk for unrecognised obstructive sleep apnoea. Although longitudinal and intervention studies are urgently needed, given the known relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension in the general population, it would seem pertinent that hypertensive pregnant women who snore should be tested for obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition believed to cause or promote hypertension.

N2  - Objective: Maternal supine posture in late pregnancy and labor is known to compromise maternal hemodynamics and subsequently affect the fetus. Recently, maternal supine sleep position during late pregnancy has been postulated to play a role in stillbirth. However, no objective data exist regarding how often pregnant women sleep supine. This study was therefore conducted to determine the proportion of pregnant women who spend time asleep in the supine position. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from pregnant women who underwent home sleep studies. Results: Of 51 pregnant women, mean gestational age 28.3. ±. 6.9. weeks, the vast majority of women (82.4%) spent some time sleeping in the supine position. The median proportion of overall time spent in the supine sleep position was 26.5% (90%CI 0.0-82.9%). Conclusion: Our data suggest that if supine position plays a role in stillbirth, most women may benefit from education regarding sleep position. Practice implications: Most pregnant women spend time asleep on their back. Given the known data on supine posture and maternal cardiovascular compromise together with emerging data on supine sleep position and stillbirth, it may be pertinent for healthcare providers to provide pregnant women with information about sleep position particularly during late pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Aim: to evaluate the qualitative characteristics of a sleep in pregnant women in the 3rd term of the physiological pregnancy by a questionnaire survey. Materials and methods: we have demonstrated questionnaire survey data of 400 pregnant women (mean age 27,5±8,2 years) in the 3rd term of pregnancy. Questioning conducted using the scale PSQI (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment Questionnaire), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (sleepiness questionnaire Epfort's) and screening questionnaire to identify obstructive sleep apnea. Results: we have determined that 78% of pregnant women to complain about sleep disorders, namely obstructive sleep disordered breathing, insomnia, «restless legs» syndrome, and combinations thereof. The frequency of sleep disorders increases as pregnancy progresses. Obstructive sleep disordered breathing increases with 10,12% in the 1st term to 31,7% in the 3rd term, insomnia - from 14,3% in the 1st term to 37,6% in the 3rd term. In pregnancy increases of sleep latency (from 14,3 to 44,9 minutes), and reduced the duration of a sleep (from 8,7 to 7,8 hours). Conclusions: high frequency of sleep disorders in pregnancy requires early pathogenetic prevention of pathological conditions, both in the mother and in the fetus.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance has become an important health problem for pregnant women. In fact, pregnancy-associated sleep disorder has been recognized as a distinct clinical entity. We aimed to study the relationship between sleep disturbance and preterm birth during pregnancy in a sample of Iranian women. Methods: In this analytical cohort study, 231 pregnant women in their 28th-32nd gestational week were recruited, using the multistage sampling method, from four healthcare centres in Ardabil, Iran, during 2010. The women were followed-up until 37-week gestation. One hundred and twelve women did not have sleep disturbances while 119 women had sleep disturbances. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and a demographic data questionnaire were used for data collection. Data were analysed using SPSS software. Descriptive statistics, t, Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney tests were used as appropriate. Results: The prevalence of preterm labour was 11.8%in women with sleep disorder compared with 11.6% in women without sleep disorder (p = 0.9). Sleep duration less than eight hours, daytime dysfunction and impaired quality of life as a component of ISI showed a significant relationship with preterm birth (p = 0.02, p = 0.044, and p = 0.047, respectively). Conclusion: Although daily dysfunction and lower quality of life because of sleep problems, and total sleep duration were variables associated with preterm birth, we found no significant relationship between sleep disorder and preterm birth.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality among pregnant women have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, data regarding the frequency of and factors associated with sleep disturbances among pregnant women are lacking. Our objective was to determine sleep duration and continuity among nulliparous women, and to identify factors associated with variations in these sleep measures. STUDY DESIGN: Women enrolled in the nuMoM2b study, a multicenter prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with a singleton gestation, were recruited at the 2nd study visit (16 0/7-21 6/7 weeks') to wear an actigraph (ActiWatch, Phillips Respironics) for 7 consecutive days. Sleep duration and continuity (measured by sleep fragmentation index, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset (WASO)) were studied in relation to factors previously associated with poor sleep quality (BMI, race/ethnicity, household income). RESULTS: Actigraphy-derived sleep data (n=369) are presented in the table. Median sleep duration was 7.5 (IQR 0.9) hours and was significantly influenced by race/ethnicity with white, non-Hispanic women having the longest sleep duration (p<.0001). All sleep continuity measures were significantly associated with BMI, race/ ethnicity and household income. Specifically, worse sleep continuity was seen in women with increasing BMI and in those with incomes below the poverty line; white, non-Hispanic women had better sleep continuity. With one exception, the demographic characteristics remained significant in multivariable models for the sleep continuity measures. For sleep fragmentation, poverty was no longer significant after adjustment for race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Nulliparous women sleep > 7 hours per night, on average. However, sleep-continuity measures indicate a wide range in sleep quality that is impacted by BMI, race/ethnicity and household income. The causes of and pregnancy outcomes associated with variations in sleep quality warrant further investigation. (Table presented).
