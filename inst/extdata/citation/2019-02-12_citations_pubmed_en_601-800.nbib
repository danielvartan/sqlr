TI  - Racial/Ethnic Differences in Sleep Disorders and Reporting of Trouble Sleeping
      Among Women of Childbearing Age in the United States.
PG  - 306-314

AB  - Objectives Whether racial/ethnic differences in prevalence/reporting of sleep
      disorders exist in pregnant women/women of child-bearing age is unknown. Study
      objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine
      racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and
      amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15-44 years) in the US. Methods
      Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
      Survey 2005-2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis),
      prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health
      professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status,
      and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences
      in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using
      univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Prevalence of diagnosed 
      sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % 
      non-pregnant (p < 0.01)]. Significantly fewer pregnant and non-pregnant minority 
      women reported adequate sleep (7-8 h) than non-Hispanic white (white) women (p < 
      0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were
      significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) 
      or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority 
      women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white
      women when controlling for amount of sleep. Among pregnant women, these same
      trends were found. Discussion Compared to white women, minority women, despite
      reporting less adequate sleep, are less likely to report trouble sleeping,
      providing evidence of an important health disparity.

TI  - Relationship, social support, and personality as psychosocial determinants of the
      risk for postpartum blues.
PG  - 442-7
LID - 10.5603/GP.2016.0023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to identify factors increasing or
      decreasing the risk for postpartum blues. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 101
      women in their first week postpartum were included in the study. The Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale, questions concerning their medical and social status,
      and psychological tests (the Personality Inventory NEO-FFI, The Mieczyslaw Plopa 
      and Jan Rostowski Marriage Questionnaire, and the Berlin Social Support Scales)
      were used. RESULTS: The probability of postpartum blues was detected in 16.8% of 
      the respondents. The risk decreased with higher satisfaction with intimacy (OR = 
      0.81), partner similarity (OR = 0.78), and the overall satisfaction with the
      relationship (OR = 0.94), while higher disappointment elevated that risk (OR =
      1.12). As far as social support is concerned, further inde-pendent factors
      included perceived available social support (OR = 0.31), perceived instrumental
      social support (OR = 0.24), need for support (OR = 2.74), and protective
      buffering support (OR = 3.41). High level of neuroticism as well as fear of
      childbirth increased the risk for postpartum blues (OR = 2.17 and OR = 1.30,
      respectively). High level of extraversion and better quality of sleep constituted
      protective factors (OR = 0.74 and OR = 0.60, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal
      disappointment with marriage/relationship, neuroticism and introversion, poor
      quality of sleep, fear of childbirth, and seeking social support are among the
      factors signaling the need for careful observation for signs of possible
      postpartum mood disorders both, during hospitalization and the follow-up visits.

TI  - A follow-up study to assess the determinants and consequences of physical
      activity in pregnant women of Cuenca, Spain.
PG  - 437
LID - 10.1186/s12889-016-3130-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the influence of physical exercise on pregnancy
      outcomes has been widely debated. Despite the numerous studies addressing the
      relationship between maternal physical activity and pregnancy outcomes, the
      evidence for consistent and significant impact of regular exercise during
      pregnancy on fetal growth remains lacking. The aims of this study were, first, to
      assess the level of physical activity performed throughout the pregnancy by
      objective (accelerometer) and self-reported (questionnaire) measurements, and,
      second, to ascertain pre-pregnancy physical activity levels, to estimate the
      relationship between levels of physical activity and some pregnancy and neonatal 
      outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study. Participants were 
      pregnant women (n = 194) aged 18 to 40 years who attended for three quarterly
      appointments for pregnancy ultrasound scans at the Virgen de la Luz Hospital in
      Cuenca, Spain. All participants provided written informed consents to participate
      in the study. Physical activity during the pregnancy follow-up was assessed by a 
      self-reported Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire and sleep log; also
      objectively by a GT3X accelerometer (ActiGraph). Furthermore, pregnancy symptoms 
      inventory, nutritional behavioural assessment, socio-demographic characteristics,
      and anthropometry and body composition were measured. At the end of the follow
      up, the following main outcomes were determined: pregnancy outcomes (incidence of
      gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension,
      weight gain during pregnancy, type of delivery, and neonatal outcomes
      (gestational age, birth weight, gender, Apgar score 1 min/5 min, type of
      resuscitation (I/II/III/IV), and pH of umbilical cord blood). Descriptive
      statistics for cross-sectional data, linear mixed regression models for absolute 
      differences in changes baseline-final measurements were used as statistical
      analyses. DISCUSSION: Although the effectiveness of physical activity programmes 
      on improving maternal and neonatal outcomes has heretofore been studied, the
      impact of free time physical activity during pregnancy has not been assessed
      using objective measures. This paper reports the design of a prospective cohort
      study that aims to assess the physical activity levels of pregnant women, and to 
      estimate the relationship between those physical activity levels with maternal
      and neonatal outcomes. This study could contribute to providing evidence for the 
      formulation of recommendations for physical activity for pregnant women.

TI  - TSEN54-Related Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: TSEN54-related pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH)
      includes three PCH types (PCH2, 4, and 5) that share characteristic
      neuroradiologic and neurologic findings. The three types (which differ mainly in 
      life expectancy) were thought to be distinct entities before their molecular
      basis was known. Children with PCH2 usually succumb before age ten years, whereas
      those with PCH4 and 5 usually succumb as neonates. Children with PCH2 have
      generalized clonus, incoordination of sucking and swallowing, impaired motor and 
      cognitive development with lack of voluntary motor development, central visual
      impairment, and an increased risk for rhabdomyolysis complicating severe
      infections. Epilepsy is present in approximately 50%. Neonates with PCH4 often
      have seizures, multiple joint contractures ("arthrogryposis"), generalized
      clonus, and central respiratory impairment. PCH5, which resembles PCH4, has been 
      described in one family. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of TSEN54-related PCH
      is suspected in children with characteristic neuroradiologic and neurologic
      findings, and confirmed by the presence of biallelic TSEN54 pathogenic variants. 
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: PCH2: Treatment of irritability,
      swallowing incoordination, epilepsy, and central visual impairment is
      symptomatic. Physiotherapy can be helpful. PCH4 and 5: No specific therapy is
      available. Prevention of secondary complications: PCH2: Assuring adequate
      hydration during prolonged periods of high fever may help avoid rhabdomyolysis.
      Surveillance: PCH2: Monitoring of respiratory function may be necessary to detect
      sleep apnea. GENETIC COUNSELING: TSEN54-related PCH is inherited in an autosomal 
      recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25%
      chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Individuals with TSEN54-related
      PCH are not known to have reproduced. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and
      prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic
      variants in the family are known.

TI  - Kangaroo supported diagonal flexion positioning: New insights into skin-to-skin
      contact for communication between mothers and very preterm infants.
PG  - 913-20
LID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2016.04.023 [doi]
LID - S0929-693X(16)30256-1 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Skin-to-skin contact shows benefits in the relationship developed
      between a mother and her premature infant. In the skin-to-skin session,
      face-to-face exchanges are impossible in vertical infant positioning. We
      therefore undertook an observational, prospective, single-center study using
      kangaroo "supported diagonal flexion" (SDF) positioning. The first aim was to
      evaluate the safety of kangaroo SDF positioning compared to the usual vertical
      positioning. The second aim was to evaluate SDF positioning on early
      communication between the mother and her infant and to improve their well-being. 
      PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Fifteen mothers and their very premature infants (birth
      26<32 weeks' gestation) were assigned to one of the two kangaroo positioning
      modes, either the current vertical positioning (n=7) or SDF positioning (n=8).
      DESIGN: Physiological variables and critical events were recorded before, during,
      and after ten successive skin-to-skin contact sessions. The first and last
      sessions were videotaped to allow later behavioral measurements. Mothers' risk
      for depression and feelings about the way they experienced communication with
      their infant were assessed through questionnaires. RESULTS: In terms of the
      infant's physiology, no negative effects were associated with SDF positioning in 
      comparison with the usual vertical positioning. SDF positioning led to fewer
      disorganized gestures, negative vocalizations, and drowsiness, in favor of more
      deep sleep. SDF led to more mother-infant eye-to-eye contact as well as maternal 
      vocalizations, smiles, and caressing, although these differences did not reach
      significance. The score for the risk of postnatal depression decreased
      significantly between the first and the last session in the SDF group, whereas it
      did not change in the vertical positioning group. CONCLUSION: These results
      support the idea that the kangaroo SDF positioning technique is physiologically
      safe, has obvious immediate benefits on mothers' infant-directed communicative
      behaviors, and respects the baby's naturally flexed and asymmetrical tonic neck
      posture. It is an innovative, inexpensive, easy-to-use technique in daily
      practice, by all healthcare professionals working in a neonatal intensive care
      unit. These data suggest that the current kangaroo positioning technique could be
      improved. More studies are needed to confirm the benefits and safety of the
      kangaroo SDF positioning in larger groups of preterm infants.

LID - 10.12669/pjms.323.9574 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is a chronic pain disorder usually
      affecting women in their fertile period of life. However, the relationship
      between FS and pregnancy has not been studied in depth. The effect of FS on the
      course of pregnancy is poorly investigated in the current literature. Here we
      aimed to investigate the effects of FS to menarche age, gravidity, parity and
      duration of breastfeeding. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven non-pregnant
      females attending between March 2015-June 2015, to Malatya State Hospital
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic, were included in this
      prospective study. One hundred eleven (111) of them were diagnosed with FS
      according to the American Rheumatology Association (ACR) 2010 criteria and were
      defined as group 1; group 2 comprised of seventy six (76) non-pregnant healthy
      volunteers. All participants were asked about their menarche age, marriage age,
      gravidity, parity, duration of breastfeeding by conducting a basic questionnaire 
      survey. Patients' body mass index (BMI) were recorded. Depression parameters were
      evaluated by Beck Depression Scale (BDS). RESULTS: The average age of the
      patients was 39.04+/-9.21 (FS) and 38.47+/-9.65 (Control) years; first menarche
      age was at 13.28+/-1.38 (FS) and 13.59+/-1.54 years (Control), and marriage age
      was 20.1+/-3.62 (FS) and 20.69+/-3.90 years (Control), respectively. No
      statistically significant difference was found (p=0.598) between BMI values (FS, 
      27.76+/-4.95; Control 26.90+/-4.56 kg/m(2)). The results from both groups were
      similar in terms of gravidity, parity, and breastfeeding duration, with no
      statistically significant differences (p=0.252, 0.093, 0.075, respectively). The 
      only significant difference was found in the depression parameter. The BDS
      results were statistically different between the groups, found higher in FS group
      (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: FS occurs as a result of symptoms such as mood disorder,
      anxiety, cognitive and sleep disorders, and also hormonal changes; no exact cause
      has yet been established. The syndrome usually occurs during fertile period of
      young female. According to the findings of our study, FS has no negative effect
      on the outcome of gravidity, parity, and duration of breastfeeding in Turkish
      women. Further studies about the effects of FS on the course of pregnancy are
      required.

TI  - Targeted Pressure on Abductor Hallucis and Flexor Hallucis Brevis Muscles to
      Manage Moderate to Severe Primary Restless Legs Syndrome.
PG  - 440-50
LID - 10.7556/jaoa.2016.088 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) treatments have included medications with
      many adverse effects and limited utility. A noninvasive device would potentially 
      have extensive use where RLS medications may not be appropriate, such as in
      pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with mild RLS, people who operate
      machinery or drive occupationally, people with severely impaired renal function, 
      or people who are taking medications contraindicated with RLS medications.
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a device that produces targeted
      pressure on the abductor hallucis and the flexor hallucis brevis muscles to
      reduce the symptoms of moderate to severe RLS, and to compare the current
      findings with findings from studies of ropinirole use in patients with primary
      RLS. METHODS: This 8-week single-arm, open-label, clinical trial with a repeated 
      measures design was conducted between April 2009 and August 2012 in 2 offices in 
      Erie, Pennsylvania. Adults with moderate to severe primary RLS were recruited for
      the study. Mean (SD) follow-up was 15.6 (6) months. Patients wore RLS devices (1 
      on each foot) for set periods intermittently throughout the course of the study. 
      The primary end point was mean change in the International Restless Legs Syndrome
      Study Group (IRLSSG) Rating Scale from baseline to day 56, and the secondary
      measure was the Clinical Global Impression scale. A meta-analysis was used to
      compare the RLS device findings with the findings of 3 historic studies of
      ropinirole vs placebo. The demographics, disease severity, inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, and assessment tools were similar among the 4 studies.
      RESULTS: Thirty patients (22 women, 8 men; mean age, 51.5 years [range, 30-75
      years]) participated in the study. Change in mean (SD) IRLSSG score was
      significantly greater for the RLS device (17.22 [6.16]; P<.001) compared with the
      ropinirole vs placebo findings (12 [0.86] vs 8.9 [0.86], respectively; P<.05).
      Sleep loss significantly decreased from 119.5 (61.6) minutes to 22.1 (31.1)
      minutes per night (P<.001). Global Improvement Scale scores indicated
      significantly greater improvement with the RLS device compared with ropinirole
      (27 of 30 [90%] vs 293 of 464 [63%], respectively; P<.05). Mild, transient
      adverse effects of the device (eg, pain, paresthesia) were reported, but these
      effects were relieved by loosening the straps. The RLS device demonstrated none
      of the adverse effects associated with current dopamine agonist therapy, such as 
      augmentation, tolerance, rebound, somnolence, and nausea. CONCLUSION: Producing
      targeted pressure on the abductor hallucis and flexor hallucis brevis muscles
      with an external RLS device reduced the symptoms of moderate to severe primary
      RLS without the adverse effects of medication therapy. (ClinicalTrials.gov number

TI  - Misdiagnosis of narcolepsy.
PG  - 1277-1284
LID - 10.1007/s11325-016-1365-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy is a chronic primary sleep disorder, characterized by
      excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep dysfunction with or without cataplexy.
      Narcolepsy is uncommon, with a low prevalence rate which makes it difficult to
      diagnose definitively without a complex series of tests and a detailed history.
      The aim of this study was to review patients referred to a tertiary sleep centre 
      who had been labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy prior to referral in order
      to assess if the diagnosis was accurate, and if not, to determine the cause of
      diagnostic misattribution. METHODS: All patients seen at a sleep centre from
      2007-2013 (n = 551) who underwent detailed objective testing including an MSLT
      PSG, as well as wearing an actigraphy watch and completing a sleep diary for 2
      weeks, were assessed for a pre-referral and final diagnosis of narcolepsy.
      RESULTS: Of the 41 directly referred patients with a diagnostic label of
      narcolepsy, 19 (46 %) were subsequently confirmed to have narcolepsy on objective
      testing and assessment by a sleep physician using ICSD-2 criteria. CONCLUSIONS:
      The diagnosis of narcolepsy was incorrectly attributed to almost 50 % of patients
      labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy who were referred for further opinion by 
      a variety of specialists and generalists. Accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy is
      critical for many reasons, such as the impact it has on quality of life, driving,
      employment, insurance and pregnancy in women as well as medication management.

TI  - [Clinical implications of polycystic ovary syndrome].
PG  - 392-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous and complex
      endocrine disease which among the female population belongs to the most
      widespread endocrinopathies and it is the most frequent cause of hyperthyroidism,
      anticoagulation and infertility. Insulin resistance is one of the important
      diabetology factors impacting hyperglycaemia in a majority of women with PCOS
      (60-80 %). Clinical expressions of PCOS include reproduction disorders, metabolic
      characteristics and psychological implications. Reproduction disorders include
      hyperthyroidism, menstruation cycle disorders, infertility and pregnancy
      complications as well as early abortions, gestational diabetes and pregnancy
      induced hypertension. Long-term metabolic risks of PCOS include type 2 diabetes
      mellitus, dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. The
      available data confirms higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases in women with
      PCOS. In particular among obese women PCOS is more frequently associated with
      non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, sleep apnoea syndrome and endometrial cancer.
      The literature includes some controversial data about the relationship between
      PCOS and autoimmunity. Women with PCOS are more prone to suffer from insufficient
      confidence with higher incidence of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and
      eating disorders. KEY WORDS: autoimmunity - diabetes mellitus - pregnancy -
      insulin resistance - metabolic syndrome - menstrual disorders - polycystic ovary 
      syndrome.

TI  - 15q Duplication Syndrome and Related Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: 15q duplication syndrome and related disorders (dup15q)
      are caused by presence of at least one extra maternally derived copy of the
      Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR) within chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1.
      The extra copy or copies most commonly arise by one of two mechanisms: A maternal
      isodicentric 15q11.2-q13.1 supernumerary chromosome - idic(15) - typically
      comprising two extra copies of 15q11.2-q13.1 and resulting in tetrasomy for
      15q11.2-q13.1 (~80% of cases); A maternal interstitial 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication 
      that typically includes one extra copy of 15q11.2-q13.1 within chromosome 15,
      resulting in trisomy for 15q11.2-q13.1 (~20% of cases). Dup15q is characterized
      by hypotonia and motor delays, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder 
      (ASD), and epilepsy including infantile spasms. Rarely, dup15q may also be
      associated with psychosis or sudden unexplained death. Those with maternal
      idic(15) are typically more severely affected than those with an interstitial
      duplication. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of dup15q is established by
      detection of at least one extra maternally derived copy of the PWACR, a region
      approximately 5 Mb long within chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: It is suggested that a multidisciplinary team evaluate infants
      for motor and speech development and later assist in referrals for appropriate
      educational programs. Supportive care may include: occupational and physical
      therapy, alternative and augmentative communication, behavioral therapy (e.g.,
      applied behavioral analysis therapy), psychotropic medications for behavioral
      manifestations, and standard management for seizures. Surveillance: Periodic:
      neurodevelopmental and/or developmental/behavioral assessments, and monitoring
      for evidence of seizures and/or change in seizure type. Agents/circumstances to
      avoid: Seizure triggers (e.g., sleep deprivation, stress) and failure to follow
      medication regimen. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Consider genetic testing of 
      sibs of a proband (known to be at increased risk for an inherited maternal
      interstitial 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication) in order to refer those with the
      interstitial duplication promptly for multidisciplinary team evaluation. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: Dup15q caused by: Maternal idic(15) has been de novo in all affected 
      individuals reported to date; thus, risk to sibs is low, but presumed to be
      marginally greater than in the general population because of the possibility of
      maternal germline mosaicism; Maternal interstitial 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication has 
      been de novo in 85% of probands and inherited from the mother in 15%. If the
      mother has the 15q interstitial duplication, the risk to each child of inheriting
      the duplication is 50%. Prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis
      using chromosomal microarray (CMA) will detect the 15q interstitial duplication; 
      however, prenatal test results cannot reliably predict the severity of the
      phenotype even in a pregnancy known to be at increased risk for dup15q.

TI  - Preeclampsia Prediction in Type 1 Diabetes and Diurnal Blood Pressure
      Methodology.
PG  - 127-33
AB  - The most recent Cochrane reviews on oral antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy
      conclude that no substantial benefits for the mother or fetus are demonstrated so
      far. Whether this applies for a high-risk and diabetic pregnancy is doubtful. The
      aim of this short review is an introduction to the field of ambulatory blood
      pressure measurements in pregnancy and in particular in women with type 1
      diabetes. Diabetic pregnancy is complicated with a 50% risk of
      hypertension/preeclampsia. In the nonpregnant, diabetic women minute increases in
      blood pressure as well as in albuminuria are forerunners for incipient and overt 
      nephropathy. Medication is essential and can conserve renal function, modifying
      the risk of renal insufficiency. During pregnancy, renal insufficiency in women
      with diabetes leads to termination of pregnancy. Therefore, detection of minute
      changes based on reliable measurements in this high-risk population is invaluable
      to protect the mother's kidney function and, if possible, prolong pregnancy for
      the benefit of the fetus. Estimates of risk by blood pressure evaluation in these
      women are influenced by pregnancy per se and diabetes vasculopathy. Several
      factors have to be considered as few monitors are validated for use in pregnancy 
      and not many of the different methodologies have undergone thorough
      investigation. The use of absolute values of blood pressure have the advantage
      that fewer assumptions are necessary on how blood pressure behaves due to modes
      of evaluation and biological rhythm. Monitors should be chosen with care
      considering the clinical setting, timing, and population, which influences the
      outcome, thus, the monitors ought to be validated for the specific condition they
      are applied for. The strategy for the studies used for safe conclusions in this
      brief review was chosen with priority of the papers with the best, validated
      methodology on BP measurements, which is by no way guaranteed in numerous recent 
      publications. Inherent characteristics of the measurements to be considered are
      reproducibility, consistency, precision, and trend over scale of measurement.
      Studies on these issues suggest that consistency and precision depend on which
      monitor is used. During pregnancy, the reproducibility and specificity depend on 
      the timing and whether measurements are performed repeatedly. Over- and
      underestimations of blood pressure are typical for 24-h monitoring in high- as
      well as low risk pregnancies. Preeclampsia is associated with urinary albumin
      excretion rate, reduced night/day ratio, and elevated diurnal blood pressure from
      first trimester and onwards. However, due to blunting of the diurnal variation,
      the night/day rhythm provides no good prediction of preeclampsia. Diurnal
      measurement is a valuable estimate of blood pressure in terms of sensitivity,
      specificity, and predictive values.

TI  - The effect of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid supplementation on infant outcomes in
      African American women living in low-income environments: A randomized,
      controlled trial.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: African American women living in urban, low-income environments are
      at high risk for poor nutrition during pregnancy and birth complications.
      OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
      supplementation on birth outcomes and infant development in a sample of African
      American women with Medicaid insurance and living in the city of Pittsburgh.
      DESIGN: The Nutrition and Pregnancy Study (NAPS) is a double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation conducted between 2012 and 2014.
      SETTING: Participants were recruited from obstetric clinics at the University of 
      Pittsburgh Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-four pregnant, African American
      women were enrolled at 16-21 weeks of gestation and randomized to either
      450mg/day of DHA (22:6n-3)(n=43) or a soybean placebo (n=21). Four women (6.3%)
      withdrew from the study: two participants from each study arm; complete data were
      obtained for 49 infants (76.5%) at the 3-month assessment. INTERVENTIONS:
      Supplementation with DHA or placebo continued from the beginning of enrollment
      through delivery. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Data on birth outcomes were
      collected from medical records. At approximately 3 months post-partum, mothers
      brought their infants to the laboratory where the Bayley Scales of Infant
      Development (BSID-III) were administered and cortisol response to the
      Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm was assessed. RESULTS: Infants of mothers
      who received DHA supplementation had higher birth weight (3.174g versus 2.890g)
      than infants of mothers receiving placebo (F [2.40]=6.09, p=0.018, eta=0.36), and
      were more likely to have a 1-min Apgar score greater than 8 (OR=5.99 [95%
      CI=1.25-28.75], p=0.025). Infants of mothers who received DHA compared with
      infants of mothers receiving placebo had lower levels of cortisol in response to 
      the FFSF paradigm (F [1.32]=5.36, p=0.018, eta=0.36). None of the scores on the
      BSID-III differed as a function of active supplement versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS:
      Infants of women living in urban, low-income environments who received DHA
      supplementation had more optimal birth outcomes and more modulated cortisol
      response to a stressor. DHA supplementation may be effective in attenuating the
      negative effects of prenatal stress on offspring development.

TI  - Asthma and sleep disturbance in adolescents and young adults: A cohort study.
PG  - 1019-1025
LID - 10.1111/jpc.13234 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: A longitudinal birth cohort provides an opportunity to study the impact of 
      childhood conditions persisting into adulthood. This study examines the
      cross-sectional association of asthma with sleep quality and snoring in the
      adolescent and young adult population and the extent to which asthma, sleep
      quality and snoring at 14 years independently predict themselves or each other at
      21 years. METHODS: Data from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children
      recruited into the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). 
      Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015
      participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 
      and 21 years. RESULTS: Poor sleep quality and snoring were independently
      associated with asthma at 14 years and 21 years, with stronger associations
      evident in women. At 21 years, associations were mediated by asthma symptom
      severity. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years each strongly and
      independently predicted themselves at 21 years. Asthma at 14 years predicted
      snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted
      asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index.
      CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by
      gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and
      holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21
      years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age.

TI  - Postpartum depressive symptoms and its association to daytime sleepiness and
      restless legs during pregnancy.
PG  - 137
LID - 10.1186/s12884-016-0917-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is a common condition, which consequences might
      be harmful for both mother and child. Since sleep and depression are closely
      related it is possible that women who suffer from sleep related problems during
      pregnancy are more likely to develop depression in the postpartum period. This
      study aims to investigate the possible association between depressive symptoms in
      the postpartum period and sleep related problems during pregnancy. METHODS: In
      this study 293 women in the last trimester of pregnancy answered a questionnaire 
      about symptoms of restless legs, snoring and daytime sleepiness. They also
      completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The same women were screened for
      depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) four to
      ten weeks after giving birth. Additional information about social data, pregnancy
      and delivery was received from the medical charts. RESULTS: Women with postpartum
      depressive symptoms had higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness defined
      as ESS score >/=10 (OR 3.84, CI 1.57-9.39), and restless legs syndrome (OR 2.837 
      CI 1.18-6.84) in last trimester of pregnancy, when adjusted for socio-demographic
      factors and obstetric risk factors. No association was found between postpartum
      depressive symptoms and snoring. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms after
      childbirth are preceded by sleep related problems such as daytime sleepiness and 
      restless legs, already during pregnancy. The results from Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale and a questionnaire concerning Restless Legs Syndrome completed during
      pregnancy might be a valuable contribution for detecting women at risk for
      postpartum depression, enabling preventive interventions.

TI  - Low-level prenatal lead exposure and infant sensory function.
PG  - 65
LID - 10.1186/s12940-016-0148-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lead is a pervasive neurotoxicant that has been associated with
      poorer cognitive, behavioral, and motor outcomes in children. The effects of lead
      on sensory function have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was
      to assess the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant sensory function, as
      measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and grating visual acuity (VA).
      METHODS: Lead was measured in maternal blood in mid- and late-pregnancy (mean
      gestational age = 15.5 and 39.0 weeks, respectively) and umbilical cord blood in 
      a cohort of full-term infants in rural northeastern China. ABR latencies (peaks
      I, III, V) were measured in newborns during unsedated sleep (n = 315). The ABR
      central-to-peripheral (C-P) ratio was calculated as the ratio between the III-V
      and I-III interpeak intervals. VA was measured in 6-week-olds using Teller Acuity
      Cards (n = 1019) and assigned as the narrowest grid the infant fixated on.
      Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between
      tertiles of mid-pregnancy, late-pregnancy, or cord lead and newborn ABR or 6-week
      VA. RESULTS: Higher late-pregnancy lead levels were associated with higher ABR
      C-P ratios and lower VA. In covariate-adjusted analyses, mean C-P ratios were 4.6
      and 3.2 % higher in infants whose mothers had lead > 3.8 mug/dL and lead = 2-3.8 
      mug/dL, respectively, than for infants whose mothers had lead < 2 mug/dL (p-trend
      =0.002). In adjusted analyses for VA, mean scores were 8.5 and 7.2 % lower for
      maternal lead > 3.8 mug/dL and lead = 2-3.8 mug/dL, respectively, compared to
      lead < 2 mug/dL (p-trend =0.009). CONCLUSION: Auditory and visual systems
      maturation appears delayed in infants with higher prenatal lead exposure during
      late-pregnancy, even at relatively low levels. Both systems start myelinating in 
      late gestation and mature rapidly in infancy. Higher ABR C-P ratio and lower
      grating VA scores suggest effects of low-level lead exposure on sensory system
      myelination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and
      the postnatal period. A risk factor for mood disorders is poor sleep quality. In 
      this study we investigate the effects of poor subjective prenatal sleep quality
      on postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression 
      or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population. METHODS: We
      analysed data from a subset of women taking part in a prospective cohort study,
      Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes. The participants completed the 
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory between 26
      and 28 weeks of pregnancy (Time 1) and at 3 months postpartum (Time 2), and the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Time 1. Logistic regression analyses were used 
      to investigate the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and
      postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, while adjusting for prenatal
      depressive/anxiety symptoms and education. RESULTS: Although borderline-high
      depressive/anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictors of postnatal
      depressive/anxiety, independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality during
      pregnancy was also associated with borderline-high postnatal depressive symptoms,
      but not with postnatal anxiety. LIMITATIONS: Sleep quality and prenatal/postnatal
      mood were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more
      susceptible to bias. CONCLUSION: Although treatment of symptoms of prenatal
      depression and anxiety will be the most important for reducing postnatal
      depression and anxiety, in addition to that, future studies may explore
      treatments improving prenatal sleep quality, particularly for women with
      antenatal depressive symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to road traffic noise has been associated with adiposity and
      diabetes in adults. The suggested pathways have been through sleep disturbance
      and stress. Children may be particularly susceptible to noise induced sleep
      disturbance and stress and the effects hereof. OBJECTIVES: To examine the
      association between traffic noise exposure during pregnancy and early childhood
      and adiposity in children. METHODS: We identified 40,974 singletons from the
      Danish National Birth Cohort with parentally given questionnaire information on
      weight and height at 7-years of age. Road and railway traffic noise were modeled 
      at all historical addresses and expressed as time-weighted means for two exposure
      periods (pregnancy and childhood). Adiposity was assessed using BMI z-scores and 
      a dichotomous measure of childhood overweight based on age and sex specific
      cut-offs. Associations were analyzed using linear regression for BMI z-scores and
      logistic regression for risk of childhood overweight, adjusting for socioeconomic
      position, maternal BMI, maternal smoking, maternal age, parity and degree of
      urbanization. RESULTS: We found both pregnancy and childhood exposure to road
      traffic noise to be associated with a higher risk for childhood overweight (odds 
      ratio (OR)=1.06 per 10dB, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.12 for exposure
      during pregnancy and OR=1.06 per 10dB, 95% CI: 0.99-1.12 for childhood exposure).
      There were no associations between road traffic noise and BMI z-scores. We found 
      no associations between railway noise and adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: We found
      suggestions of a positive association between road traffic noise and risk of
      overweight in 7-years old children.

TI  - Cannabis and neuropsychiatry, 1: benefits and risks.
PG  - e551-4
LID - 10.4088/JCP.16f10841 [doi]
AB  - Cannabis is popularly believed to be a relatively benign substance. Cannabis is
      also considered to have potential medical benefits, and medical marijuana has
      been legislated in many parts of the world. However, a recent meta-analysis found
      that cannabinoids were associated with only modest benefits for
      chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, small and inconsistent benefits for
      pain and spasticity, and inconclusive benefits for other indications such as
      improvement of appetite and weight, reduction in tic severity, and improvement of
      mood or sleep. On the flip side, cannabinoids and cannabis have acute and
      long-term adverse effects. In randomized controlled trials, cannabinoids increase
      the risk of total adverse events, serious adverse events, and dropout due to
      adverse events. Cannabis impairs cognition, and driving after cannabis use is
      associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents, including fatal
      accidents. Long-term cannabis use may lead to dependence, respiratory conditions,
      psychosis, and possibly cancer, as well. Cannabis use during pregnancy may
      compromise certain pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth, and use during
      adolescence may compromise neurodevelopment, social adjustment, and vocational
      success. The composition and bioavailability of cannabis vary across preparations
      of the substance and routes of administration; this limits the ability to
      generalize the findings of studies. The findings of older research may no longer 
      apply to current strains of cannabis that are higher in psychotogenic content. It
      is important for medical professionals and the lay public to understand the
      limitations of the efficacy data and the seriousness of the risks associated with
      cannabis use in medical and recreational contexts.

TI  - Is plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 a physiological bottleneck bridging major
      depressive disorder and cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 715-727
LID - 10.1111/apha.12726 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated to affect one in twenty people
      worldwide. MDD is highly comorbid with cardiovascular disease (CVD), itself one
      of the single largest causes of mortality worldwide. A number of pathological
      changes observed in MDD are believed to contribute to the development of
      cardiovascular disease, although no single mechanism has been identified. There
      are also no biological markers capable of predicting the future risk of
      developing heart disease in depressed individuals. Plasminogen activator
      inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a prothrombotic plasma protein secreted by endothelial
      tissue and has long been implicated in CVD. An expanding body of literature has
      recently implicated it in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder as well. 
      In this study, we review candidate pathways implicating MDD in CVD and consider
      how PAI-1 might act as a mediator by which MDD induces CVD development: chiefly
      through sleep disruption, adiposity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
      metabolism, systemic inflammation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis
      dysregulation. As both MDD and CVD are more prevalent in women than in men, and
      incidence of either condition is dramatically increased during reproductive
      milestones, we also explore hormonal and sex-specific associations between MDD,
      PAI-1 and CVD. Of special interest is the role PAI-1 plays in perinatal
      depression and in cardiovascular complications of pregnancy. Finally, we propose 
      a theoretical model whereby PAI-1 might serve as a useful biomarker for CVD risk 
      in those with depression, and as a potential target for future treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether in utero exposure to smoking may
      influence the activity and dynamics of cardiac autonomic control in preterm
      infants. We hypothesized that cardiac autonomic control is altered in preterm
      infants exposed prenatally to smoking and that these effects may vary as a
      function of the sleep state. METHODS: We studied healthy, preterm neonates born
      to mothers who had smoked throughout pregnancy but not since birth (n=16). In
      utero-exposed neonates were matched with control preterm neonates born to
      non-smoking mothers (n=18). Cardiac autonomic control was monitored as a function
      of the sleep state by assessing heart rate variability with both linear and
      non-linear methods. RESULTS: Preterm neonates with in utero exposure to smoking
      displayed alterations (relative to control neonates) in short-term cardiac
      autonomic control in all sleep states. These alterations included low vagal
      activity, elevated sympathetic activity, and low complexity and adaptability in
      heart rate control dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results constitute direct evidence 
      that cardiac autonomic activity and control are altered in sleeping preterm
      infants exposed to smoking in utero. SIGNIFICANCE: These alterations may place
      the affected infants at a higher risk of neurological and cardiovascular
      complications, which could conceivably persist throughout childhood and
      adulthood.

      and it may be caused by multiple influences of both genetic and environmental
      factors from the fetal stage through infancy. In this study, we analyzed a data
      subset from the South Kyushu and Okinawa (SKO) Study Area of Japan Environment
      and Children's Study (JECS) to determine the relationship of allergic diseases in
      infants with mothers' characteristics and/or infants' life habits, especially
      sleeping. METHODS: A total of 3873 mother-infant pairs from the SKO Regional
      Center of JECS were included. The mothers responded to questionnaires in the
      first trimester of their pregnancy and the self-reported questionnaire when their
      infants were 1 year old. Student's t-test, chi-square test, trend test, and
      logistic regression analysis were carried out to analyze the associations between
      the infants' allergic diseases and the mothers' genetic characteristics and/or
      sleeping habits of infants. RESULTS: Maternal allergic diseases were
      significantly associated with increased infant allergy risk (OR: 1.93, 95% CI:
      1.63-2.27). The number of allergic diseases of mothers was also significantly
      associated with infant allergy, and the trend test showed an increasing risk of
      infant allergy (p<0.001). Regarding infants' life habits, the infants who sleep
      in the prone position had a higher allergic disease risk than those who sleep in 
      other positions (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.17-1.83). These significant associations
      were observed regardless of the presence of allergy in mothers. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study suggests that the development of allergic diseases in infants may be caused
      by the multiple participation of both genetic and environmental factors.

AB  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) occurs in 0.6% to 15% of reproductive-aged
      women. Because of an overlap in symptoms of SDB and normal pregnancy findings,
      the diagnosis of SDB in pregnancy is challenging. The repetitive arousals, sleep 
      fragmentation, and hypoxias experienced by patients with SDB lead to an increase 
      in oxidative stress and inflammation. In the nonpregnant population SDB is
      associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and
      stroke. Increasing evidence identifies an association between SDB in pregnancy
      and gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and fetal growth abnormalities.

AB  - The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often
      overlooked change is an increased reporting of sleep disturbance. Although
      casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging 
      evidence implicating significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia
      symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, with adverse outcomes, such as an increase in
      depressive symptomatology or the development postpartum depression (PPD).
      Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with
      maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant, and behavioral or
      emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant
      literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the
      postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.

AB  - AIM: The present observational study aimed to clarify the effects of sleep
      disorders on threatened premature delivery, especially preterm uterine
      contraction. METHODS: The participants included 122 healthy singleton pregnant
      women. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index was used to evaluate the quality of
      sleep during the previous month at the initial examination and at 16, 24, and 32 
      weeks of gestation; scores >5 indicate poor sleep. Threatened premature delivery 
      was defined as preterm uterine contraction >6 times/h and requiring tocolytic
      therapy before 37 weeks of gestation. We analyzed the relationship between poor
      sleep and threatened premature delivery. RESULTS: Poor sleep affected 27% (n=33) 
      at the initial examination, 34% (n=41) at 16 weeks, 37% (n=45) at 24 weeks, and
      41% (n=50) at 32 weeks of gestation. There were 23 patients (19%) with threatened
      premature delivery. Poor sleep affected 35% and 25% of patients with threatened
      and non-threatened premature delivery at the initial examination, respectively,
      52% and 29% at 16 weeks, 48% and 34% at 24 weeks, and 43% and 40% at 32 weeks of 
      gestation. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorders at 16 weeks of gestation were the most
      significantly associated with threatened premature delivery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of maternal sleep and its contribution to maternal and
      fetal health during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised. However, the
      ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been
      questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal
      sleep practices in late pregnancy. METHODS: Thirty healthy women between 35 and
      38 weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with 
      infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep
      positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory
      measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after
      the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and
      Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical
      variables. RESULTS: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. 
      There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire 
      data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening
      (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was
      accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as
      recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman
      plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for 
      estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). 
      One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper
      airways resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the
      number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but
      sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the
      sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that
      cannot.

TI  - Placental genetic variations in circadian clock-related genes increase the risk
      of placental abruption.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - The genetic architecture of placental abruption (PA) remains poorly understood.
      We examined variations in SNPs of circadian clock-related genes in placenta with 
      PA risk. We also explored placental and maternal genomic contributions to PA
      risk. Placental genomic DNA samples were isolated from 280 PA cases and 244
      controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip. We
      examined 116 SNPs in 13 genes known to moderate circadian rhythms. Logistic
      regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs). The combined effect of 
      multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score. We
      examined independent and joint associations of wGRS derived from placental and
      maternal genomes with PA. Seven SNPs in five genes (ARNTL2, CRY2, DEC1, PER3 and 
      RORA), in the placental genome, were associated with PA risk. Each copy of the
      minor allele (G) of a SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 30% 
      reduced odds of PA (95% CI 0.52-0.95). The odds of PA increased with increasing
      placental-wGRS (Ptrend<0.001). The ORs were 1.00, 2.16, 3.24 and 4.48 across
      quartiles. Associations persisted after the maternal-wGRS was included in the
      model. There was evidence of an additive contribution of placental and maternal
      genetic contributions to PA risk. Participants with placental- and maternal-wGRS 
      in the highest quartile, compared with those in the lowest quartile, had a
      15.57-fold (95% CI 3.34-72.60) increased odds of PA. Placental variants in
      circadian clock-related genes are associated with PA risk; and the association
      persists after control of genetic variants in the maternal genome.

TI  - Supine sleep positioning in preterm and term infants after hospital discharge
      from 2000 to 2011.
PG  - 787-93
LID - 10.1038/jp.2016.80 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Supine sleep positioning (SSP) has been shown to reduce the risk of
      sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and preterm infants are at higher risk for
      SIDS. Population-based estimates of SSP are lacking for the preterm population.
      The objectives of this study are: (1) compare the prevalence of SSP after
      hospital discharge for preterm and term infants in the United States; and (2)
      assess racial/ethnic disparities in SSP for preterm and term infants. STUDY
      DESIGN: We analyzed the 2000 to 2011 data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
      Monitoring System of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 35 states.
      We measured prevalence of SSP by preterm and term gestational age (GA)
      categories. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) to evaluate the
      likelihood of SSP for each GA category compared with term infants and the
      likelihood of SSP for non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Hispanic infants compared with
      non-Hispanic white (NHW) infants. RESULTS: Prevalence of SSP varied by GA: 27,
      59.7%; 28 0/7 to 33 6/7, 63.7%; 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 (late preterm), 63.6%; and 37
      0/7 to 42 6/7 (term) weeks, 66.8% (P<0.001). In the adjusted analyses, late
      preterm infants were slightly less likely to be placed in SSP compared with term 
      infants (APR: 0.96, confidence interval: 0.95 to 0.98). There were racial/ethnic 
      disparities in SSP for all GA categories when NHB and Hispanic infants were
      compared with NHW infants. CONCLUSIONS: All infants had suboptimal adherence to
      SSP indicating a continued need to better engage families about SSP. Parents of
      late preterm infants and families of NHB and Hispanic infants will also require
      greater attention given their decreased likelihood of SSP.

TI  - Stress exposure and psychological stress responses are related to glucose
      concentrations during pregnancy.
PG  - 712-29
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12197 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The role of stress in the development of gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) has so far been neglected. We investigated the impact of stress
      exposure (pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events),
      psychological stress responses (perceived stress, subjective experience of
      stress, anxiety, depression, sleep), and physiological stress responses (salivary
      cortisol, plasma copeptin levels) on glucose concentrations during pregnancy.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study, including 203 pregnant women at the maternity
      department of a Swiss university hospital. METHODS: All women underwent routine
      screening for GDM with a 75-g oral glucose-tolerance test at 24-30 weeks of
      gestation. Pregnancy-related and pregnancy-unrelated major life events, perceived
      stress, general psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and amount of sleep 
      were assessed by validated self-report questionnaires. Cortisol was measured
      using fasting and bedtime saliva samples, and copeptin using fasting plasma. All 
      data were collected before communication of the screening test results. RESULTS: 
      Significant positive associations were found between the number of
      pregnancy-related major life events and fasting glucose, while there was no
      association with pregnancy-unrelated major life events. More anxiety and
      depressive symptoms, a higher general level of distress, and a shorter duration
      of sleep were related to fasting glucose, although the latter two were no longer 
      significant when age and BMI were controlled for. However, physiological stress
      responses were not associated with glucose concentrations. When testing for
      unique associations with fasting glucose, more general distress and shorter
      duration of sleep independently accounted for higher fasting glucose levels.
      Finally, when comparing women with and without GDM, we found that women who
      subsequently received the diagnosis of GDM reported more pregnancy-related life
      events. CONCLUSIONS: Some indicators of stress exposure and psychological stress 
      responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant women, 
      thus representing important risk factors for GDM development. Statement of
      contribution What is already known on this subject? Only approximately half of
      women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) report any known risk factors.
      Women after GDM diagnosis reported more major life events compared to healthy
      pregnant controls. What does this study add? Stress exposure and psychological
      stress responses were associated with fasting glucose concentrations in pregnant 
      before women were aware of their GDM diagnosis. These represent important risk
      factors for GDM development and potential targets for intervention.

TI  - Sleep duration and quality, and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant
      Chinese women.
PG  - 44-50
LID - 10.1111/dme.13155 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To examine the association between sleep disturbances during pregnancy and 
      risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. METHODS: From 2010 to 2012, 12 506 women
      in Tianjin, China, were screened using a 50-g 1-h glucose challenge test at 24-28
      weeks' gestation. Those with glucose challenge test values of >/= 7.8 mmol/l were
      invited to further undergo a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational
      diabetes was determined according to the International Association of Diabetes
      and Pregnancy Study Group's definition. Self-reported sleep duration and sleep
      quality during pregnancy was documented using a modified questionnaire. Logistic 
      regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 919
      women (7.3%) had gestational diabetes. Sleep duration was found to have an
      approximate J-shaped association with gestational diabetes risk after adjusting
      for covariates. Compared with a sleep duration of 7-9 h/day (43% of 12 506
      women), the adjusted odds ratios for sleep duration of >/= 9 h/day (55%) and < 7 
      h/day (2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.21 (95% CI 1.03-1.42) and 1.36 (95% CI
      0.87-2.14), respectively. Compared with good sleep quality (37.9% of 12 506
      women), the adjusted odds ratios of moderate (59.9%) and poor sleep quality
      (2.2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.19 (95% CI 1.01-1.41) and 1.61 (95% CI
      1.04-2.50), respectively. CONCLUSION: In pregnant Chinese women, poor sleep
      quality, and shorter and longer duration of sleep during pregnancy were
      independently associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

AB  - Yoga is a mind-body practice that encompasses a system of postures (asana), deep 
      breathing (pranayama), and meditation. Over 36 million Americans practice yoga of
      which the majority are reproductive-aged women. Literature to support this
      practice is limited, albeit on the rise. A prenatal yoga practice has been shown 
      to benefit women who suffer from anxiety, depression, stress, low back pain, and 
      sleep disturbances. A small number of studies have been performed in high-risk
      pregnancies that also demonstrate an improvement in outcomes. The safety of
      performing yoga for the first time in pregnancy and fetal tolerance has been
      demonstrated.

TI  - Immediate effects of phototherapy on sleep in very preterm neonates: an
      observational study.
PG  - 517-523
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12408 [doi]
AB  - Process C (internal clock) and Process S (sleep-wake homeostasis) are the basis
      of sleep-wake regulation. In the last trimester of pregnancy, foetal heart rate
      is synchronized with the maternal circadian rhythm. At birth, this interaction
      fails and an ultradian rhythm appears. Light exposure is a strong factor
      influencing the synchronization of sleep-wake processes. However, little is known
      about the effects of phototherapy on the sleep rhythm of premature babies. It was
      hypothesized that sleep in preterm infants would not differ during phototherapy, 
      but that a maturation effect would be seen. Sleep states were studied in 38
      infants born < 32 weeks gestational age and/or < 1 500 g birth weight. Videos of 
      3 h were taken over the first 5 days of life. Based on breathing and movement
      patterns, behavioural states were defined as: awake; active sleep; or quiet
      sleep. Videos with and without phototherapy were compared for amounts of quiet
      sleep and active states (awake + active sleep). No significant association
      between phototherapy and amount of quiet sleep was found (P = 0.083). Analysis of
      videos in infants not under phototherapy revealed an increase in time spent awake
      with increasing gestational age. The current data suggest that the ultradian
      rhythm of preterm infants seems to be independent of phototherapy, supporting the
      notion that sleep rhythm in this population is mainly driven by their internal
      clock.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of sleep
      disturbances during pregnancy with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. METHODS: 
      In this prospective study, 688 healthy women with singleton pregnancy were
      selected from three hospitals in Chengdu, China 2013-2014. Self-report
      questionnaires, including the sleep quantity and quality as well as exercise
      habits in a recent month were administered at 12-16, 24-28, and 32-36 weeks'
      gestation. Data on type of delivery, gestational age, and the neonates' weight
      were recorded after delivery. After controlling the potential confounders, a
      serial of multi-factor logistic regression models were performed to evaluate
      whether sleep quality and quantity were associated with cesarean delivery and
      preterm birth. RESULTS: There were 382 (55.5%) women who had cesarean deliveries 
      and 32 (4.7%) who delivered preterm. Women with poor sleep quality during the
      first (OR: 1.87, 95% CI [1.02-3.43]), second (5.19 [2.25-11.97]), and third
      trimester (1.82 [1.18-2.80]) were at high risk of cesarean delivery. Women with
      poor sleep quality during the second (5.35 [2.10-13.63]) and third trimester
      (3.01 [1.26-7.19]) as well as short sleep time (<7 h) during the third trimester 
      (4.67 [1.24-17.50]) were at high risk of preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep
      disturbances are associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery and
      preterm birth throughout pregnancy. Obstetric care providers should advise women 
      with childbearing age to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.

TI  - Sleeping for Two: An Open-Pilot Study of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
      Insomnia in Pregnancy.
PG  - 377-393
LID - 10.1080/15402002.2016.1141769 [doi]
AB  - Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common during pregnancy. This study investigated
      the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)
      delivered in pregnancy. Thirteen pregnant women with insomnia participated in
      five weekly CBT-I group sessions. All participants completed the study and
      provided baseline and follow-up data. Significant reductions in insomnia symptoms
      and increases in subjective sleep quality were observed over the course of the
      study. Diary and actigraphy assessments of sleep also changed, such that
      participants reported less time in bed (TIB), shorter sleep onset latency (SOL), 
      increased sleep efficiency (SE), and increased subjective total sleep time (TST).
      Additionally, symptoms of depression, pregnancy-specific anxiety, and fatigue all
      decreased over the course of treatment. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large.
      CBT-I delivered during pregnancy was associated with significant improvements in 
      sleep and mood. The next step in this area of inquiry is to better establish
      effectiveness via a randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Succinic Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Deficiency
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency 
      is characterized by infantile-onset hypotonia, developmental delay, cognitive
      impairment, expressive language deficit, and mild ataxia. Epilepsy is present in 
      about half of affected individuals and is more common in adults. Hyperkinetic
      behavior, aggression, self-injurious behaviors, hallucinations, and sleep
      disturbances have been reported in nearly half of all affected individuals, more 
      commonly in those who are older. Basal ganglia signs including choreoathetosis,
      dystonia, and myoclonus have been reported in a few individuals with
      earlier-onset, more severe disease. Involvement beyond the central nervous system
      has not been described. Individuals with SSADH deficiency typically have
      4-hydroxybutyric aciduria present on urine organic acid analysis. Head MRI
      reveals T2 hyperintensities in multiple regions, involving the globus pallidi,
      cerebellar dentate nuclei, subthalamic nuclei, subcortical white matter, and
      brain stem, as well as cerebral and sometimes cerebellar atrophy. EEG findings
      include background slowing and spike discharges that are usually generalized.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SSADH deficiency is established by the
      identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in ALDH5A1. MANAGEMENT: Treatment
      of manifestations: Management is most often symptomatic, directed at the
      treatment of seizures and neurobehavioral disturbances. A broad spectrum of
      antiepileptic medication has been used to treat this condition. While vigabatrin 
      is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase and thus inhibits the formation
      of succinic semialdehyde, it has shown inconsistent results in treatment of
      seizures associated with SSADH deficiency. Methylphenidate, thioridazine,
      risperidal, fluoxetine, and benzodiazepines have been used for treatment of
      increased anxiety, aggressiveness, and inattention. Additional, non-pharmacologic
      treatments may include physical and occupational therapy, sensory integration,
      feeding and/or speech therapy. Surveillance: Regular neurologic and developmental
      assessments as indicated. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproate may inhibit
      residual SSADH enzyme activity; however, valproate may be considered in
      individuals with refractory epilepsy who have failed other treatments. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: SSADH deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At
      conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being
      affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of
      being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is
      possible if the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family.
      Biochemical testing is not accurate or reliable for carrier determination.
      Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible using molecular 
      genetic testing if the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family, or
      using biochemical testing (either measurement of 4-hydroxybutyric acid in
      amniotic fluid or assay of SSADH enzyme activity in chorionic villus tissue and
      cultured amniocytes).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of respiratory disease in adults
      and children, but communicating the magnitude of these effects in a scientific
      manner that is accessible and usable by the public and policymakers presents a
      challenge. We have therefore summarized scientific data on the impact of smoking 
      on respiratory diseases to provide the content for a unique resource, SmokeHaz.
      METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal
      studies (published to 2013) identified from electronic databases, gray
      literature, and experts. Random effect meta-analyses were used to pool the
      findings. RESULTS: We included 216 articles. Among adult smokers, we confirmed
      substantially increased risks of lung cancer (risk ratio (RR), 10.92; 95% CI,
      8.28-14.40; 34 studies), COPD (RR, 4.01; 95% CI, 3.18-5.05; 22 studies), and
      asthma (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.42; eight studies). Exposure to passive smoke
      significantly increased the risk of lung cancer in adult nonsmokers and increased
      the risks of asthma, wheeze, lower respiratory infections, and reduced lung
      function in children. Smoking significantly increased the risk of sleep apnea and
      asthma exacerbations in adult and pregnant populations, and active and passive
      smoking increased the risk of tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have been
      translated into easily digestible content and published on the SmokeHaz website.

AB  - Women with a diagnosis of bipolar and major depressive disorders are at higher
      risk to develop postpartum depression. The primary objective of this longitudinal
      study was to determine whether daily activity rhythms and sleep parameters differ
      between women with and without a history of a mood disorder across the perinatal 
      period. A secondary objective was to determine whether changes in these
      parameters were associated with postpartum mood. In total, 33 women were included
      in this study, 15 of which had a history of a mood disorder (high-risk group) and
      18 who did not (low-risk group). Sleep and daily rhythms were assessed
      subjectively and objectively during the third trimester (>/=26 weeks gestation)
      and again at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Mood was also assessed at both time points.
      Women in the high-risk group showed greater subjective daily rhythms and sleep
      disturbances across the perinatal period. Objective sleep efficiency was worse in
      the high-risk group in the postpartum period. Changes in both subjective daily
      rhythms and objective sleep efficiency were predictive of changes in depressive
      symptoms across the perinatal period. These findings encourage the development of
      preventative therapeutics to ensure circadian rhythm and sleep stability
      throughout the perinatal period.

LID - 10.1007/s10995-016-1991-3 [doi]
AB  - Objective Only 9 % of women with young children consume a high quality diet. The 
      association between sleep duration and health may be U-shaped. We examined diet
      quality in relation to sleep duration among US women within 5 years of
      childbirth. Methods Data were from non-pregnant women aged 20-44 years within 5
      years of childbirth who completed two 24-h dietary recalls (N = 896) in the
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2012. Self-reported
      weekday/workday sleep duration was categorized as short (</=6 h), adequate (7-8
      h), or long (>/=9 h). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010, range 0-100) estimated 
      overall and components of diet quality. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression 
      models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality,
      adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. Results Thirty-four percent of 
      women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. The average
      diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. Short sleep duration was not
      associated with diet quality. Long sleep duration was associated with lower
      quality diet (beta = -4.3; 95 % CI -8.1 to -0.4), lower consumption of total
      fruit (beta = -0.7; 95 % CI -1.3 to -0.1), whole fruit (beta = -0.9; 95 % CI -1.6
      to -0.2), and total protein (beta = -0.7; 95 % CI -1.3 to -0.03), and higher
      consumption of empty calories (beta = 2.2; 95 % CI -4.3 to -0.1). Conclusions for
      practice Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep
      duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether
      interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality.

TI  - The Relationship between Constitution of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the
      First Trimester and Pregnancy Symptoms: A Longitudinal Observational Study.
PG  - 3901485
LID - 10.1155/2016/3901485 [doi]
AB  - Objective. We report on the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
      constitution in the first trimester and on the association between TCM
      constitution and maternal symptoms related to pregnancy. Methods. Participants
      were followed up until delivery to observe primary measures (gestational
      hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus) and secondary measures (signs of 
      miscarriage, miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, and sleepiness and defecation
      during pregnancy). Descriptive analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic 
      regression analysis were used in this study. Results. 61.8% of the participants
      had unbalanced constitutions. We did not find a significant association between
      the TCM constitution and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes,
      miscarriage, signs of miscarriage, and defecation during pregnancy. And we found 
      that women with unbalanced constitutions in early pregnancy had a greater
      likelihood of severe nausea and vomiting and poor sleep during pregnancy in the
      logistic regression analysis. Conclusions. These results have implications for
      female health care providers and policy makers. Identification of TCM
      constitution may be helpful for understanding nausea and vomiting and poor
      sleepiness during pregnancy, especially in the condition that can not be
      explained by modern medical science, and be helpful for making program to improve
      these uncomfortable symptoms.

TI  - Sleepiness and sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy.
PG  - 1231-1237
LID - 10.1007/s11325-016-1345-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine if there is a difference in the prevalence
      of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleepiness between pregnant and non-pregnant
      women. It also aimed to evaluate if obstetric outcomes were associated to
      sleep-disordered breathing among the pregnant women. METHODS: One hundred
      pregnant women (gestational weeks 24-34) and 80 age- and body mass index-matched 
      non-pregnant women underwent whole-night respiratory recordings (airflow,
      snoring, respiratory movements, body position, pulse oximetry). The women also
      answered a questionnaire including the Epworth sleepiness scale. RESULTS:
      Eighty-nine percent of the pregnant women had normal body mass index (BMI).
      Objectively, recorded snoring was more common among the pregnant women (median 9 
      % of total estimated sleep time) than among the controls (4 % of total sleep
      time, p = 0.005). Three of the pregnant women had OSA (apnea/hypopnea index (AHI)
      >5), but in two cases, this was mainly due to central hypopneas. None had AHI
      >10. Two controls were diagnosed as OSA. Respiratory parameters including snoring
      showed no impact on obstetric outcomes. Total Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS)
      score was higher among pregnant women than among controls (median 9 vs 7, p <
      0.001). There was no difference concerning the separate items. There were no
      significant associations between either subjectively reported or objectively
      recorded snoring and ESS scores. CONCLUSION: There was no increased prevalence of
      obstructive sleep apnea among pregnant women. One reason for this could be that
      the majority of the women in this study were non-obese. Neither OSA nor snoring
      was likely an explanation for the increased daytime sleepiness seen in the
      pregnant women.

TI  - Maternal sleep-disordered breathing and the risk of delivering small for
      gestational age infants: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 719-25
LID - 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-208038 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is unclear whether objectively measured maternal sleep-disordered
      breathing (SDB) leads to poor fetal outcomes. In this study, we prospectively
      assessed whether polysomnography-based diagnosis of SDB in the third trimester is
      associated with the delivery of small for gestational age (SGA) infants. STUDY
      DESIGN: Participants were recruited from a multicentre pregnancy cohort study.
      Eligible participants were evaluated for SDB based on symptoms (snoring and/or
      witnessed apnoeas assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      questionnaire) and in-home complete polysomnography in the third trimester. SGA
      was defined as <10th centile using customised birthweight centiles adjusted for
      maternal parity, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, gestational age
      and infant sex. RESULTS: Of the 234 pregnant participants who completed a sleep
      study, 82% were Caucasian, with mean (SD) age of 31 (4.3) years and a
      prepregnancy BMI of 23 (4) kg/m(2). The delivery of SGA infants occurred in 27
      (12%) of the study participants. The symptoms of SDB had poor overall sensitivity
      and specificity for diagnosing SDB identified by polysomnography. Symptoms of SDB
      in the third trimester demonstrated a potential association with delivering an
      SGA infant, however this did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.36 (95% CI 
      0.85 to 6.54, p=0.10)). However, the odds of delivering an SGA infant were
      significantly increased with polysomnography-based diagnosis of maternal SDB
      (using apnoea-hypopnoea index cut-off of 10, OR 2.65 (95% CI 1.15 to 6.10,
      p=0.02)). CONCLUSIONS: Objectively measured SDB in the third trimester is
      significantly associated with the delivery of SGA infants.

      Depressed Pregnant Women: The PAW Survey.
PG  - 81-95
AB  - Depression affects up to 23% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse
      physical/mental health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Depressed pregnant 
      women may be more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that
      contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. Little is known regarding
      depressed pregnant women's perceptions, uses of, and interests in complementary
      health approaches. Study participants (mean age 28.7 +/- 6.8; n = 1032) included 
      pregnant women >/=8 weeks gestation who responded to a survey assessing physical 
      and mental health and wellness practices. Of those completing the survey,
      depressed pregnant women (n = 272) had significantly higher levels of anxiety (P 
      < .001) and stress (P < .001) and had poorer sleep quality (P < .001),
      mindfulness (P < .001), and social support (P < .001) compared to nondepressed
      pregnant women (n = 760). A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would
      consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress
      management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.

TI  - Population-Based Study of Sleep Apnea in Pregnancy and Maternal and Infant
      Outcomes.
PG  - 871-7
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.5890 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between sleep apnea and pregnancy
      outcomes in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Population-based cohort
      study using linked birth and hospital records was conducted in New South Wales,
      Australia. Participants were all women who gave birth from 2002 to 2012 (n =
      636,227). Sleep apnea in the year before pregnancy or during pregnancy was
      identified from hospital records. Outcomes of interest were gestational diabetes,
      pregnancy hypertension, planned delivery, caesarean section, preterm birth,
      perinatal death, 5-minute Apgar score, admission to neonatal intensive care or
      special care nursery, and infant size for gestational age. Maternal outcomes were
      identified using a combination of hospital and birth records. Infant outcomes
      came from the birth record. Modified Poisson regression models were used to
      examine associations between sleep apnea and each outcome taking into account
      maternal age, country of birth, socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking, obesity,
      parity, pre-existing diabetes and hypertension. RESULTS: Sleep apnea was
      significantly associated with pregnancy hypertension (adjusted RR 1.43; 95% CI
      1.18-1.73), planned delivery (1.15; 1.07-1.23), preterm birth (1.50; 1.21-1.84), 
      5-minute Apgar < 7 (1.60; 1.07-2.38), admission to neonatal intensive
      care/special care nursery (1.26; 1.11-1.44), large-for-gestational-age infants
      (1.27; 1.04-1.55) but not with gestational diabetes (1.09; 0.82-1.46), caesarean 
      section (1.06; 0.96-1.17), perinatal death (1.73; 0.92-3.25), or
      small-for-gestational-age infants (0.81; 0.61-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is 
      associated with higher rates of obstetric complications and intervention, as well
      as preterm delivery. Future research should examine if these are independent of
      obstetric history.

TI  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Type 4
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4 (CMT4) is a group
      of progressive motor and sensory axonal and demyelinating neuropathies that are
      distinguished from other forms of CMT by autosomal recessive inheritance.
      Affected individuals have the typical CMT phenotype of distal muscle weakness and
      atrophy associated with sensory loss and, frequently, pes cavus foot deformity.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CMT4 subtypes is based on clinical findings, 
      neurophysiologic studies, and molecular genetic testing. Detection of biallelic
      pathogenic variants in one of the following 11 genes establishes the diagnosis:
      GDAP1 (CMT4A), MTMR2 (CMT4B1), SBF2 (CMT4B2), SBF1 (CMT4B3), SH3TC2 (CMT4C),
      NDRG1 (CMT4D), EGR2 (CMT4E), PRX (CMT4F), HK1 (CMT4G), FGD4 (CMT4H), and FIG4
      (CMT4J). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment by a team including a
      neurologist, physiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, physical and occupational
      therapists; special shoes and/or ankle/foot orthoses to correct foot drop and aid
      walking; surgery as needed for severe pes cavus; forearm crutches, canes,
      wheelchairs as needed for mobility; exercise as tolerated; symptomatic treatment 
      of pain, depression, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome. Prevention of secondary 
      complications: Daily heel cord stretching to prevent Achilles' tendon shortening.
      Surveillance: Monitoring gait and condition of feet to determine need for
      bracing, special shoes, surgery. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Obesity (which
      makes ambulation more difficult); medications (e.g., vincristine, isoniazid,
      nitrofurantoin) known to cause nerve damage. Other: Career and employment
      counseling. GENETIC COUNSELING: The CMT4 subtypes are inherited in an autosomal
      recessive manner. Parents of an affected individual are obligate carriers of the 
      CMT4-related pathogenic variant present in their family. At conception, each sib 
      of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of
      being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a
      carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for
      pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in an
      affected family member are known.

TI  - Sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy.
PG  - 268-77
LID - 10.1183/20734735.009215 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common and the severity increases
      as pregnancy progresses.Frequent snoring, older age and high pre-pregnancy body
      mass index (>25 kgm(-2)) could be reliable indicators for SDB in early
      pregnancy.SDB screening tools, including questionnaires, used in the nonpregnant 
      population have poor predictive ability in pregnancy.Accumulating evidence
      suggests that SDB during pregnancy may be associated with increased risk of
      adverse pregnancy outcomes, including gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia.
      However, the results should be interpreted cautiously because several studies
      failed to adjust for potential maternal confounders and have other study
      limitations.There are no pregnancy-specific practice guidelines for SDB
      treatment. Many clinicians and practices follow recommendations for the treatment
      in the general population. Women with pre-existing SDB might need to be
      reassessed, particularly after the sixth month of pregnancy, because symptoms can
      worsen with nasal congestion and weight gain. EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To highlight the 
      prevalence and severity of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in the pregnant
      population.To inform readers about risk factors for SDB in pregnancy.To explore
      the impact of SDB on adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, and biological pathways
      for associated adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.To introduce current
      management options for SDB in pregnancy, including medical and behavioural
      approaches. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is very common during pregnancy, and
      is most likely explained by hormonal, physiological and physical changes.
      Maternal obesity, one of the major risk factors for SDB, together with
      physiological changes in pregnancy may predispose women to develop SDB. SDB has
      been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, early
      identification, diagnosis and treatment of SDB are important in pregnancy. This
      article reviews the pregnancy-related changes affecting the severity of SDB, the 
      epidemiology and the risk factors of SDB in pregnancy, the association of SDB
      with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and screening and management options specific
      for this population.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea and the risk of preterm delivery.
PG  - 1111-7
LID - 10.1007/s11325-016-1339-7 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) to preterm delivery (PTD), using the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ).
      METHODS: This was a large, prospective cohort study among pregnant Thai women.
      The BQ was employed for symptom-based OSA screening during the second trimester, 
      and PTD was recorded in 1345 pregnant women. Multivariate models were applied in 
      controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of the
      high risk of OSA was 10.1 %, and it was significantly associated with
      pre-pregnancy body mass index and score on the Perceived Stress Scale. An
      adjusted odds ratio for PTD in women with a high risk of OSA was 2.00 (95 %
      confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.20, 3.34). Stratified analyses, after adjusting
      for confounding factors, indicated that a high risk of OSA was associated with an
      increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (odds ratio (OR) = 2.45, 95 % CI =
      1.20, 5.02), but not with preterm premature rupture of membranes (OR = 1.61, 95 %
      CI = 0.61, 4.26), and medically indicated preterm delivery (OR = 1.83, 95 % CI = 
      0.72, 4.64). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with a high risk of OSA are at an
      increased risk of having PTD, compared with pregnant women with a low risk of
      OSA.

AB  - OPINION STATEMENT: Sleep has a strong influence on interictal epileptiform
      discharges and on epileptic seizures. Interictal epileptiform discharges are
      activated by sleep deprivation and sleep, and some epilepsies occur almost
      exclusively during sleep. Treatment of sleep-related epilepsy should take in
      account the type of epileptic syndrome, the type of seizures, the patient
      characteristics, and also the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Proper
      characterization of the epilepsy is essential to choose appropriate antiepileptic
      drugs. Drugs effective in focal epilepsy may be used to treat benign genetic
      focal epilepsies such as rolandic epilepsy and other focal (frontal or not) sleep
      epilepsies. These include both classical (such as carbamazepine) and new (such as
      levetiracetam and lacosamide) antiepileptic drugs. Drug-resistant cases should be
      evaluated for epilepsy surgery, which may be efficacious in this setting.
      Valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and perampanel are effective
      against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in genetic generalized epilepsies,
      which frequently happen on awakening. Risks of valproate should be considered
      before prescribing it to women of childbearing age. Specific syndromes such as
      ESES require specific treatment such as a combination of high dose steroids,
      benzodiazepines, levetiracetam, and even surgery when an epileptogenic lesion is 
      present. Sleep disorders that may worsen epilepsy such as obstructive sleep apnea
      or insomnia should be adequately treated to improve seizure frequency. Adequate
      control of seizures during sleep (especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures)
      decreases risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

      Patients (<18 Years).
PG  - 91-100
LID - 10.1159/000442758 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data are available about obesity surgery in adolescent patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term outcomes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (LRYGB) in patients <18 years. SETTING: University Hospital, Europe.
      METHODS: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data of patients <18
      years (childhood group; ChG) (n = 28) treated by LRYGB of which 19 were available
      for follow-up between 2.4 and 10.2 years (mean 7.2 years). This group of patients
      was matched with an adult control group (AdG) of randomly chosen patients with
      similar characteristics who underwent LRYGB during the same period. The extensive
      survey included a telephonic questionnaire. RESULTS: 19 (12 females) of the 28
      patients (67.9%) were available for follow-up. Preoperatively, 3 had type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 1 arterial hypertension, 5 dyslipidemia and 1 sleep
      apnea. In the ChG, average BMI after 7 years dropped from 38.9 kg/m2
      preoperatively to 27.5 kg/m2. In the AdG, average BMI decreased from 39.4 to 27.1
      kg/m2 in the same time period (nonsignificant between groups). One patient in the
      ChG needed a reoperation (internal hernia) versus 3 patients in the AdG (1 leak, 
      2 obstructions). All patients resolved their initial comorbidities. Two of 12
      female patients in the ChG became pregnant 6 and 8 years after surgery,
      respectively, despite seemingly adequate oral contraception. Compliance with
      postoperative guidelines was good in 16/19 patients in ChG and in 14/18 patients 
      in the AdG. Overall degree of satisfaction was high: 8.2/10 (SD 1.2, range 6-10) 
      in the ChG and 8.9/10 (SD 1.7, range 5-10) in the AdG. CONCLUSION: LRYGB seems to
      be safe, provide good weight loss, and cure comorbidities in an adolescent
      population. Satisfaction degree is high. Inadvertent pregnancy despite
      conventional contraception is a possible issue.

TI  - Respiratory Rate During the First 24 Hours of Life in Healthy Term Infants.
LID - 10.1542/peds.2015-2326 [doi]
LID - e20152326 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Abnormal respiratory rate (RR) is a key symptom of
      disease in the newborn. The aim of this study was to establish the reference
      range for RR during the first 24 hours of life in healthy infants born at term.
      METHODS: Infants were included at the hospital postnatal ward when time
      permitted. During sleep or a defined quiet state, RR was counted at 2, 4, 8, 16, 
      and 24 hours by placing the bell of a stethoscope in front of the nostrils and
      mouth for 60 seconds. Data on maternal health, pregnancies, and births were
      obtained from medical records and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. RESULTS: 
      The study included 953 infants. Median RRs were 46 breaths/minute at 2 hours,
      thereafter 42 to 44 breaths/minute. The 95th percentile was 65 breaths/minute at 
      2 hours, thereafter 58 to 60 breaths/minute. The fifth percentile was 30 to 32
      breaths/minute. Within these limits, the intraindividual variation was wide. The 
      overall mean RR was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7 to 5.7, P < .001)
      breaths/minute higher while awake than during sleep, 3.1 (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.8, P <
      .001) breaths/minute higher after heavy meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, 
      and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.4, P < .001) breaths/minute higher in boys than girls. 
      RR did not differ for infants born after vaginal versus cesarean deliveries.
      CONCLUSIONS: The RR percentiles established from this study allow for a
      scientifically based use of RR when assessing newborn infants born at term.

TI  - Intimate Partner Violence Is Associated with Stress-Related Sleep Disturbance and
      Poor Sleep Quality during Early Pregnancy.
PG  - e0152199
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0152199 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations of Intimate partner violence (IPV) with
      stress-related sleep disturbance (measured using the Ford Insomnia Response to
      Stress Test [FIRST]) and poor sleep quality (measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index [PSQI]) during early pregnancy. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. In-person interviews were conducted in
      early pregnancy to collect information regarding IPV history, and sleep traits.
      Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated 
      using logistic regression procedures. RESULTS: Lifetime IPV was associated with a
      1.54-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (95% CI: 1.08-2.17) 
      and a 1.93-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.33-2.81).
      Compared with women experiencing no IPV during lifetime, the aOR (95% CI) for
      stress-related sleep disturbance associated with each type of IPV were: physical 
      abuse only 1.24 (95% CI: 0.84-1.83), sexual abuse only 3.44 (95%CI: 1.07-11.05), 
      and physical and sexual abuse 2.51 (95% CI: 1.27-4.96). The corresponding aORs
      (95% CI) for poor sleep quality were: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.13-2.61), 2.82 (95% CI:
      0.99-8.03), and 2.50 (95% CI: 1.30-4.81), respectively. Women reporting any IPV
      in the year prior to pregnancy had increased odds of stress-related sleep
      disturbance (aOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.17-3.67) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.27;
      95% CI: 1.30-3.97) during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Lifetime and prevalent IPV
      exposures are associated with stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep
      quality during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be
      important mechanisms that underlie the lasting adverse effects of IPV on maternal
      and perinatal health.

AB  - Introduction: Moderate exercise training during the pregnancy benefits both the
      pregnant woman and the fetus. The research papers consulted have linked physical 
      activity with the reduction of the number of cesareans, instrumental delivery and
      with a more physiological delivery. It also prevents excessive weight gain in
      women and decreases the risk of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure.
      Aim: The aim of this research is to know if an exercise program of moderate
      character with Water Study Exercise Pregnant (SWEP) method, performed in an
      aquatic environment, contributes to have more favorable results in the perinatal 
      period, both for women and baby. Material and methods: The design is a randomized
      clinical trial. The sample will consist of 364 pregnant women, with a total
      universe of 6,579 births occurred in Granada (Spain) during 2014. The sample was 
      divided into two groups, intervention group and control group. The activity will 
      be carried out in the water sporting facilities of the Faculty of Sports Science 
      of the University of Granada, which have two pools suitable for our purposes: a
      25-meter polyvalent pool and a 12.5-meter pool for training. Results: The
      exercise program designed specifically for the project called SWEP is performed
      from 20 to 37 weeks of gestation (SG), and it consists of three weekly sessions, 
      with duration of 60 minutes each. Sessions will include three phases: warm-up
      phase, the main phase in which the exercise is divided into an aerobic phase and 
      strength training and endurance training phase and a final phase of stretching
      and relaxation. The variables that will be studied are: a) Maternal: weight, BMI,
      blood pressure, O'Sullivan test, postpartum depression, level of self-rated
      health, sleep quality and perceived exertion during physical activity; b) fetal: 
      weight, Apgar scores, head circumference and GA (Gestational age); c) peripartum:
      time dilation, expulsion and delivery, type of delivery, episiotomy, type of feed
      received by the RN and time of exclusive breastfeeding; and d) descriptive: age, 
      occupation, education level, type of exercise done before and OF (obstetric
      formula). Conclusion: With aquatic moderate physical activity during pregnancy
      (method SWEP), we intended to improve the variables above.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous abortion constitutes one of the most
      frequent complication of human pregnancy. Despite intensive research efforts
      undertaken to date, the etiopathogenesis of early pregnancy loss has not been
      fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to analyze the role of selected
      non-somatic risk factors for early pregnancy loss in patients with various
      clinical manifestations of spontaneous abortion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study
      included 242 women hospitalized between 2001 and 2004 in the 3rd Chair and
      Department of Gynecology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland (Teaching Hospital
      No.4) with various clinical categories of spontaneous abortion. Each patient
      completed a questionnaire assessing her exposure to the examined factors. In
      patients with threatened abortion dismissed from the hospital with viable
      gestation, the course of pregnancy was followed-up using questionnaire data and
      medical records. RESULTS: In the studied population of women with abnormal early 
      pregnancy course, a significant impact on the risk of miscarriage was observed in
      case of such factors as: exposure to stress at home and limited number of hours
      of nightly sleep. Factors such as occupational hazards, diet, stress, heavy
      housework and use of cigarettes or alcohol did not exert a significant effect on 
      the risk of miscarriage in the studied population. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      this study confirm the complexity of the early pregnancy loss etiopatogenesis.
      Further research need to be conducted in order to identify the non-somatic
      causative agents of various clinical forms of miscarriage. It may help do select 
      women in reproductive age at high risk of early pregnancy loss and show the ways 
      in which effective preventive measures can be introduced in such population.

TI  - Adapting and testing a brief intervention to reduce maternal anxiety during
      pregnancy (ACORN): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 156
LID - 10.1186/s13063-016-1274-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: National guidelines in the UK, United States of America, Canada, and 
      Australia have recently stressed the importance of identifying and treating
      antenatal anxiety and depression. However, there is little research into the most
      effective and acceptable ways of helping women manage their symptoms of anxiety
      and stress during pregnancy. Research indicates the necessity to consider the
      unique needs and concerns of perinatal populations to ensure treatment
      engagement, highlighting the need to develop specialised treatments which could
      be integrated within routine antenatal healthcare services. This trial aims to
      develop a brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, with a focus on embedding the
      delivery of the treatment within routine antenatal care. METHODS/DESIGN: This
      study is a two-phase feasibility trial. In phase 1 we will develop and pilot a
      brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, blended with group support, to be led
      by midwives. This intervention will draw on cognitive behavioural principles and 
      wider learning from existing interventions that have been used to reduce anxiety 
      in expectant mothers. The intervention will then be tested in a pilot randomised 
      controlled trial in phase 2. The following outcomes will be assessed: (1) number 
      of participants meeting eligibility criteria, (2) number of participants
      consenting to the study, (3) number of participants randomised, (4) number of
      sessions completed by those in the intervention arm, and (5) number of
      participants completing the post-intervention outcome measures. Secondary
      outcomes comprise: detailed feedback on acceptability, which will guide further
      development of the intervention; and outcome data on symptoms of maternal and
      paternal anxiety and depression, maternal quality of life, quality of couple
      relationship, mother-child bonding, infant temperament and infant sleep.
      DISCUSSION: The study will provide important data to inform the design of a
      future full-scale randomised controlled trial of a brief intervention for anxiety
      during pregnancy. This will include information on its acceptability and
      feasibility regarding implementation within current antenatal services, which
      will inform whether ultimately this provision could be rolled out widely in
      healthcare settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN95282830

TI  - Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IVA
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The phenotypic spectrum of mucopolysaccharidosis IVA
      (MPS IVA) is a continuum that ranges from a severe and rapidly progressive
      early-onset form to a slowly progressive later-onset form. Children with MPS IVA 
      have no distinctive clinical findings at birth. The severe form is usually
      apparent between ages one and three years, often first manifesting as
      kyphoscoliosis, knock-knee (genu valgum), and pectus carinatum; the slowly
      progressive form may not become evident until late childhood or adolescence often
      first manifesting as hip problems (pain, stiffness, and Legg Perthes disease).
      Progressive bone and joint involvement leads to short stature, and eventually to 
      disabling pain and arthritis. Involvement of other organ systems can lead to
      significant morbidity, including respiratory compromise, obstructive sleep apnea,
      valvular heart disease, hearing impairment, visual impairment from corneal
      clouding, dental abnormalities, and hepatomegaly. Compression of the spinal cord 
      is a common complication that results in neurologic impairment. Children with MPS
      IVA have normal intellectual abilities at the outset of the disease.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MPS IVA is established by analysis of
      N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase (GALNS) enzyme activity or by the
      identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GALNS on molecular genetic
      testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Enzyme replacement therapy
      (elosulfase alfa, or Vimizim) is available, although the long-term effects of
      this treatment on the skeletal and non-skeletal features of MPS IVA are not yet
      known. Evaluation and management of individuals with MPS IVA are best undertaken 
      by multiple specialists, coordinated by a physician specializing in the care of
      persons with complex medical problems. Physiatrists, physical therapists, and
      occupational therapists help optimize mobility and autonomy. Psychological
      support can optimize coping skills and quality of life; educational professionals
      can optimize the learning environment for a medically fragile individual.
      Surgical intervention is often required for lower extremity malalignment, hip
      subluxation and/or hip pain, upper cervical spine instability, and/or progressive
      thoracolumbar kyphosis. Upper extremity management may include stabilizing
      external wrist splints or partial or complete wrist fusion. Cardiac valve
      involvement may require placement of a bioprosthetic or prosthetic valve.
      Upper-airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea are managed by removal of
      enlarged tonsils and adenoids; diffuse narrowing of the airway may require
      positive airway pressure and/or tracheostomy. The outcome following keratoplasty 
      for corneal opacification varies. Hearing loss is often treated initially with
      ventilation tubes and later with hearing aids. Prevention of secondary
      complications: Potential pre- and postoperative anesthetic concerns secondary to 
      spine anomalies and difficult airway management need to be anticipated. All
      affected individuals should receive influenza and pneumococcal immunizations as
      well as routine immunizations. Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended 
      for those with a prosthetic cardiac valve, prosthetic material used for cardiac
      valve repair, or previous infective endocarditis. Surveillance: For those on ERT:
      physical examination at least every six months; annual assessment of quality of
      life parameters and pulmonary function tests. For all individuals: annual
      endurance tests to evaluate functional status of the cardiovascular, pulmonary,
      musculoskeletal, and nervous systems; annual assessment of upper and lower
      extremities for functionality and malalignment, hips for dysplasia/subluxation
      and thoracolumbar spine for kyphosis; neurologic examination and cervical spine
      radiographs every six months to assess for spinal cord compression; yearly
      whole-spine MRI with flexion-extension views every one to three years. Perform
      annual evaluation of heart rate with electrocardiogram and echocardiogram every
      one to three years depending on disease course. Annual assessment for obstructive
      sleep apnea and pulmonary function; monitor nutritional status using MPS
      IVA-specific growth charts. Perform vision and eye exam at every visit, dental
      evaluation every six to 12 months, and annual audiogram. Agents/circumstances to 
      avoid: Excessive weight gain; beta blockers. GENETIC COUNSELING: MPS IVA is
      inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an
      affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an 
      asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.
      Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies
      at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family have been
      identified.

TI  - Assessment of the usage and effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment
      and insecticide-treated nets on the indicators of malaria among pregnant women
      attending antenatal care in the Buea Health District, Cameroon.
PG  - 172

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy is an immense public health problem with at
      least 50 million pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas. To prevent
      malaria and its complications in pregnancy the World Health Organization
      recommends the use of intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      (IPTp-SP), the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and effective case
      management. In most malaria endemic countries in Africa, 40% of pregnant women
      sleep under ITNs. In Cameroon, about 90% of pregnant women receive the first dose
      of SP, while 64% take the complete dose. Following the 2011 mass-campaign of free
      distribution of ITNs coupled with routine ANC distribution of ITN and adoption of
      IPTp in Cameroon, little has been done to assess the effectiveness of both
      interventions outside of Yaounde, the capital city. This study sought to assess
      the usage and effectiveness of IPTp-SP and ITNs on malaria in pregnancy. METHODS:
      The research was a cross-sectional hospital-based study that included 410
      pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in the Buea Health District. Capillary
      blood samples were collected to check malaria parasite by microscopy and
      haemoglobin levels by microhaematocrit technique. RESULTS: A prevalence of 13.4
      and 41.7% was detected for malaria and anaemia, respectively. The Overall
      coverage of ITN was 32.4% while that of ITPp was 63.2%. Malaria prevalence was
      least (7.2%) amongst women using both IPTp-SP and ITN while those with no
      intervention had the highest malaria prevalence of 18.6% (chi2 = 6.188; P =
      0.103). Of the women with malaria, 12.73% were using ITN and had taken at least
      one dose of SP, 38.18% had taken at least one dose IPTp only, 10.91% were using
      only ITN and 38.18% were not using any preventive measure. There was a difference
      in anaemia status within the different intervention groups (chi2 = 8.673; P =
      0.034). Pregnant women using both interventions were less associated to malaria
      (OR = 0.341, 95% CI = 0.138-0.841) compared to those using only one control
      method. CONCLUSION: Repeated doses of SP in combination with ITN use are
      effective in reducing malaria parasitaemia and improving haemoglobin level of
      pregnant women.

TI  - Maternal Sleep Disordered Breathing and Neonatal Outcome.
PG  - 45-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) during
      pregnancy may adversely influence maternal as well as fetal well being.
      OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of maternal SDB on neonatal neurological
      examination and perinatal complications. METHODS: Pregnant women of singleton
      uncomplicated pregnancies were prospectively recruited from a community and
      hospital low risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep
      questionnaire in the second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation
      (WatchPAT, Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea
      hypopnea index > 5) and non-SDB. Maternal and newborn records were reviewed and a
      neonatal neurologic examination was conducted during the first 48 hours. RESULTS:
      The study group included 44 women and full-term infants; 11 of the women (25%)
      had SDB. Mean maternal age of the SDB and non-SDB groups was 32.3 +/- 2.8 and
      32.5 +/- 4.7 years, respectively (P = 0.86). Mean body mass index before the
      pregnancy in the SDB and non-SDB groups was 25.8 +/- 4.7 and 22.0 +/- 2.5 kg/m2, 
      respectively (P = 0.028). No differences were found between infants born to
      mothers with SDB and non-SDB in birth weight (3353.8 +/- 284.8 vs. 3379.1 +/-
      492.4 g), gestational age (39.5 +/- 0.9 vs. 39.2 +/- 1.5 weeks), 5 minute Apgar
      scores (9.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 9.9 +/- 0.3), and neurologic examination scores (95.2 +/-
      3.9 vs. 94.6 +/- 4.1). P value for all was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      preliminary results suggest that maternal mild SDB during pregnancy has no
      adverse effect on neonatal neurologic examination or on perinatal complications.

AB  - This issue exemplifies the types of articles that JABFM publishes to advance
      family medicine. We have articles on the implications of health system
      organizational structures. Three of these are international articles at the level
      of the national health system (1 from China) and systematic local health
      interventions (1 from Canada and 1 from Netherlands). Inside the United States,
      where there are more family physicians, there is less obesity, and designation as
      a Patient Centered Medical Home is related to increased rates of colorectal
      cancer screening. Review articles on common clinical topics discuss treatments
      that are changing (acne in pregnancy) or lack consensus (distal radial
      fractures). We have articles on making life easier in the office, such as for
      predicting Vitamin D levels, osteoporosis, and pre-diabetes in normal weight
      adults. There are articles to raise awareness of the "newest" testing or
      treatments, that is, auditory brainstem implants. "Reminder" articles highlight
      known entities that need to be reinforced to prevent over-/underdiagnosis or
      treatment, for example, "cotton fever." Another article discusses the increased
      risk for postoperative complications with sleep apnea. We also provide "thought" 
      pieces, in this case about the terminology we are using to extend our concept of 
      patient-centered medical homes.

TI  - Kidney-lung connections in acute and chronic diseases: current perspectives.
PG  - 341-348
LID - 10.1007/s40620-016-0276-7 [doi]
AB  - Lung and kidney functions are intimately related in both health and disease. The 
      regulation of acid-base equilibrium, modification of partial pressure of carbon
      dioxide and bicarbonate concentration, and the control of blood pressure and
      fluid homeostasis all closely depend on renal and pulmonary activities. These
      interactions begin in fetal age and are often responsible for the genesis and
      progression of diseases. In gestational age, urine is a fundamental component of 
      the amniotic fluid, acting on pulmonary maturation and growth. Moreover, in the
      first trimester of pregnancy, kidney is the main source of proline, contributing 
      to collagen synthesis and lung parenchyma maturation. Pathologically speaking,
      the kidneys could become damaged by mediators of inflammation or immuno-mediated 
      factors related to a primary lung pathology or, on the contrary, it could be the 
      renal disease that determines a consecutive pulmonary damage. Furthermore, non
      immunological mechanisms are frequently involved in renal and pulmonary diseases,
      as observed in chronic pathologies such as sleep apnea syndrome, pulmonary
      hypertension, progressive renal disease and hemodialysis. Kidney damage has also 
      been related to mechanical ventilation. The aim of this review is to describe
      pulmonary-renal interactions and their related pathologies, underscoring the need
      for a close collaboration between intensivists, pneumologists and nephrologists.

TI  - Hartsfield Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Hartsfield syndrome comprises two core features:
      holoprosencephaly (HPE) spectrum disorders and ectrodactyly spectrum disorders.
      HPE spectrum disorders, resulting from failed or incomplete forebrain division
      early in gestation, include alobar, semilobar, or lobar HPE. Other brain
      malformations observed in persons with Hartsfield syndrome include corpus
      callosum agenesis, absent septum pellucidum, absent olfactory bulbs and tracts,
      and vermian hypoplasia. Varying degrees of developmental delay are observed.
      Microcephaly, spasticity, seizures, and feeding difficulties are common.
      Hypothalamic dysfunction (manifest as temperature dysregulation and erratic sleep
      patterns) can occur, as well as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and central
      insipidus diabetes. Ectrodactyly spectrum disorders are unilateral or bilateral
      malformations of the hands and/or feet characterized by a median cleft of hand or
      foot due to absence of the longitudinal central rays (also called split hand/foot
      malformation). The number of digits on the right and left can vary. Polydactyly
      and syndactyly can also be seen. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis is established 
      in a proband with the two core features: an HPE spectrum disorder and an
      ectrodactyly spectrum disorder. It can be confirmed by identification of either
      an FGFR1 heterozygous pathogenic variant (in those with autosomal dominant
      inheritance) or FGFR1 biallelic pathogenic variants (in those with autosomal
      recessive inheritance). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Medically
      refractory epilepsy typically requires multiple antiepileptic drugs. Spasticity
      can be treated with physical and occupational therapy and bracing, as well as
      muscle relaxants (when moderate or severe). Sometimes surgery may be required.
      Diabetes insipidus may need treatment with desmopressin; temperature
      dysregulation can be managed by modifying the environment; disturbance of
      sleep-wake cycles can be managed with good sleep hygiene and, if needed, with use
      of melatonin or other sleep aids such as clonidine. Some children may require a
      gastrostomy and/or a tracheostomy. GENETIC COUNSELING: Hartsfield syndrome is
      inherited most commonly in an autosomal dominant (AD) and less commonly in an
      autosomal recessive (AR) manner. AD inheritance: Most probands have a de novo
      FGFR1 pathogenic variant. Germline mosaicism has been observed in two unrelated
      families. AR inheritance: At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a
      25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and 
      a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the FGFR1 pathogenic
      variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing or
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis for a pregnancy at increased risk is possible.

TI  - [ON THE INFLUENCE OF PRENATAL HYPOXIA ON FORMATION OF THE OREXINERGIC SYSTEM AND 
      SLEEP-WAKEFULNESS CYCLE IN EARLY POSTNATAL ONTOGENESIS OF RATS].
PG  - 214-220
AB  - The role of orexin in the organization of sleep-wakefulness cycle (SWC) is well
      known. The aim of this study was to examine the terms of formation of the
      orexinergic system in the rat postnatal ontogenesis and to assess the role of
      orexin A in SWC organization under normal conditions and after prenatal hypoxia
      realized on days 14 and 19 of the embryogenesis. SWC was investigated in
      30-day-old rats with elect- rodes implanted into the somatosensory and occipital 
      cortex. Immunoreactivity in the orexinergic structures of the lateral
      hypothalamus was also studied. It was shown that in the control 14-day-old
      animals the orexinergic structures were at the formation stage whereas in the
      30-day-old ones they were already formed as in adults. In the 14-day-old rats
      prenatal hypoxia evoked retardation of the orexinergic system for- mation terms. 
      In the 30-day-old rats the orexinergic system activity after hypoxia was
      increased, with hypoxia on day 19 activating this system stronger than hypoxia on
      day 14 of gestation. These changes were reflected in the SWC formation in the
      30-day-old rats as shortening of the slow-wave phase of sleep, increase in the
      fitful sleep and in the number of transitions from the slow-wave to the fast-wave
      phase of sleep. The results obtained are discussed in the light of the
      adaptation-compensatory role of the orexinergic system in the postnatal
      ontogenesis after prenatal damage affecting the central neural system.

TI  - Prospective associations between chronic youth sleep problems and young adult
      health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated prospective associations between youth
      sleep problems across childhood and adolescence, as well as the relationship
      between chronic youth sleep problems and young adult health. Exploratory analyses
      investigated this sleep-health relationship in the context of several established
      risk factors, including youth depression and environmental stress. DESIGN: This
      project is an extension of the Mater-University Study of Pregnancy, a
      longitudinal study that followed more than 7000 children across early
      development. SETTING: Brisbane, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred ten
      mother-child dyads assessed from birth to age 20. MEASUREMENTS: We used maternal 
      report measures to assess the persistence of youth sleep problems. We used
      structural equation modeling to explore the relationship between chronic
      maternal-reported youth sleep problems and subjective reports of young adult
      health quality and to assess whether associations remained when other potential
      health risks were included in the model. RESULTS: Path analyses revealed that
      sleep problems in early childhood predicted sleep problems in middle adolescence,
      which predicted sleep problems at age 20. Structural equation models showed that 
      chronic youth sleep problems predicted youth health quality at age 20 (beta =
      .263, P < .001) over and above the effects of early adversity, chronic childhood 
      illness, maternal depression, lifetime youth depression, and chronic youth
      stress. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic sleep problems can emerge in childhood and may
      contribute to negative health outcomes in young adulthood. Chronic youth sleep
      problems remain a significant predictor of poor health when tested against other 
      known health risk factors, suggesting that sleep may be an important health
      intervention target.

TI  - Do changes in subjective sleep and biological rhythms predict worsening in
      postpartum depressive symptoms? A prospective study across the perinatal period.
PG  - 591-8
LID - 10.1007/s00737-016-0612-x [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of sleep and biological rhythms have been widely implicated in the 
      pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD).
      However, less is known about the influence of biological rhythm disruptions
      across the perinatal period on postpartum depression (PPD). The objective of this
      study was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between subjective changes
      in both sleep and biological rhythms and worsening of depressive symptoms from
      pregnancy to the postpartum period in women with and without mood disorders.
      Eighty-three participants (38 euthymic women with a history of a mood disorder
      and 45 healthy controls) were studied. Participants completed subjective
      assessments of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), biological rhythm
      disturbances (Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), and
      depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) prospectively at two
      time points: third trimester of pregnancy and at 6-12 weeks postpartum.
      Multivariate regression analyses showed that changes in biological rhythms across
      the perinatal period predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in both groups.
      Moreover, women with a history of a mood disorder showed higher levels of sleep
      and biological rhythm disruption during both pregnancy and the postpartum period.
      These findings suggest that disruptions in biological rhythms during the
      perinatal period increase the risk for postpartum mood worsening in healthy
      pregnant as well as in pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

LID - 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.11.012 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Mounting evidence suggests that the origins of childhood obesity and
      related disparities can be found as early as the "first 1,000 days"-the period
      from conception to age 2 years. The main goal of this study is to systematically 
      review existing evidence for modifiable childhood obesity risk factors present
      from conception to age 2 years. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Embase, and Web of 
      Science were searched for studies published between January 1, 1980, and December
      12, 2014, of childhood obesity risk factors present during the first 1,000 days. 
      Prospective, original human subject, English-language research with exposure
      occurrence during the first 1,000 days and with the outcome of childhood
      overweight or obesity (BMI >/=85th percentile for age and sex) collected between 
      age 6 months and 18 years were analyzed between December 13, 2014, and March 15, 
      2015. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 5,952 identified citations, 282 studies met
      inclusion criteria. Several risk factors during the first 1,000 days were
      consistently associated with later childhood obesity. These included higher
      maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, prenatal tobacco exposure, maternal excess
      gestational weight gain, high infant birth weight, and accelerated infant weight 
      gain. Fewer studies also supported gestational diabetes, child care attendance,
      low strength of maternal-infant relationship, low SES, curtailed infant sleep,
      inappropriate bottle use, introduction of solid food intake before age 4 months, 
      and infant antibiotic exposure as risk factors for childhood obesity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable risk factors in the first 1,000 days can inform future
      research and policy priorities and intervention efforts to prevent childhood
      obesity.

TI  - The Relationship of Restless Legs Syndrome to History of Pregnancy-Induced
      Hypertension.
PG  - 397-408
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2015.5484 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a burdensome sleep disorder, has been
      associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and related
      disorders. However, the relationship of RLS to history of pregnancy-induced
      hypertension (PIH), a predictor of subsequent CVD, diabetes, and associated
      conditions, remains little explored. In this study, we investigated the
      relationship of RLS to history of PIH in a sample of primary care patients.
      METHODS: Participants were women aged >/=40 years drawn from an anonymous survey 
      study of West Virginia primary care patients. Data collected included detailed
      information on demographics, lifestyle factors, sleep patterns, and
      reproductive/medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic
      questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or unsure about their pregnancy status
      were excluded from the analyses. RESULTS: Of the 498 participants in the final
      analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms
      >/=once/week, 11.9% with symptoms >/=3 times/week); 73 (16.5% of parous women)
      reported a history of PIH, defined as physician-diagnosed preeclampsia or
      gestational hypertension. After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle
      characteristics, obesity, reproductive history, health conditions, and other
      factors, those reporting a history of PIH were approximately twice as likely to
      meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1,
      3.6). These associations increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency
      (adjusted OR for RLS with symptoms >/=3 times/week = 3.8; CI 1.9, 7.6; p for
      trend = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: History of PIH was strongly and positively related
      to current RLS in this study of primary care patients; these findings further
      support a possible role for metabolic dysregulation in RLS etiology.

AB  - Decreased oxygenation during pregnancy and early periods of ontogeny can affect
      normal body development and result in diseases in adulthood. The aim of this
      study was to use the model of prenatal intermittent hypoxia (PIH) and evaluate
      the effects of short-term hypoxia at the end of gestation on blood pressure (BP) 
      control in adulthood. Wistar rats were exposed daily to PIH for 4 h during
      gestational day 19 and 20. In adult male rats, heart rate (HR), systolic BP and
      pulse pressure (PP) were acquired by radiotelemetry during 1 week. On the basis
      of HR variability and BP variability, sympathovagal balance (LF/HF) and
      spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS) were evaluated. Systolic BP and PP were
      significantly elevated in PIH rats in comparison with control rats during the
      light and dark phase of the day, while LF/HF increased only during the light
      phase of the day. In contrast, sBRS tended to decrease only during the dark phase
      in PIH rats. In all measured and calculated parameters, significant circadian
      rhythms were present and were not affected by PIH. In conclusion, our data
      suggest that short intermittent hypoxia at the end of gestation can increase BP
      and PP via significant changes in LF/HF, which occur especially during the
      passive phase of the day. Results suggest that minor changes in the autonomous
      nervous system activity induced by environmental conditions during the perinatal 
      period may contribute to development of hypertension in adulthood.

TI  - Duration of sleep at 3 years of age is associated with fat and fat-free mass at 4
      years of age: the Southampton Women's Survey.
PG  - 412-8
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12389 [doi]
AB  - Many studies have shown that shorter sleep duration in childhood is associated
      with higher body mass index (BMI), and have proposed that it is due to an effect 
      of sleep on adiposity. There is little evidence about the association of sleep
      with fat-free mass. This study examined the association between child's sleep
      duration at age 3 years and fat and fat-free mass at 4 years of age in a
      prospective cohort study of 302 boys and 285 girls. Study participants were
      taking part in the Southampton Women's Survey, a longitudinal study of mothers
      and children from preconception onwards. Total sleep duration at age 3 years was 
      derived from parental report of night sleep and nap duration. Body composition
      was assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at 4 years. Mean total
      sleep duration was 11.5 hours. In linear regression analyses, adjusted for
      potentially confounding factors (maternal educational attainment, prepregnancy
      BMI, smoking during pregnancy, child's gestational age at birth, age at DXA, sex,
      age last breastfed, dietary quality at 3 years, TV watching and hours actively on
      the move and parental social class), shorter sleep in hours was associated with
      higher BMI (kg/m(2) ) [beta: -0.2340, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.373 to
      -0.096], a greater fat mass index (kg) (beta: -0.1182, 95% CI: -0.218 to -0.018) 
      and a greater fat-free mass index (kg) (beta: -0.100, 95% CI: -0.185 to -0.015). 
      Previous research suggested that the association between shorter sleep and higher
      body mass index is due to an effect on adiposity. Our findings are novel,
      suggesting that the relationship between sleep and BMI is also determined by an
      effect on muscle.

      Spectrum Disorder.
PG  - S90-7
LID - 10.1542/peds.2015-2851G [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adopted children with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) differ from the general ASD population in terms of diagnosis, internalizing
      and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, and medications. METHODS: We studied
      163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison
      with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5-17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4]
      years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested
      for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples
      t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical
      variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the
      association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after
      controlling for covariates. RESULTS: After controlling for demographics and
      diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including
      greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P < .001), internalizing behavior 
      (P = .001), and sleep problems (P < .001) in the adopted population. Adoptees
      were also prescribed psychotropic medications (P < .001) more often than the
      nonadoptees. Adoptees received a diagnosis of pervasive developmental
      disorder-not otherwise specified significantly more frequently than controls
      (odds ratio = 1.8; CI = 1.3-2.5; P < .001), despite no significant difference in 
      symptoms on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the
      population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population
      both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems.
      Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated 
      with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early
      childhood experience, and age at adoption.

TI  - [Monitoring and Care of Expectant Mothers with Epilepsy].
PG  - 918-27
AB  - Women with epilepsy are exposed to social stigma, and they have anxiety and lose 
      self-confidence in their social role as a woman. Psychiatrists, especially female
      psychiatrists, are able to support them. Important considerations are: 1)
      Pre-pregnant counseling; Physicians give appropriate advice and guidance. We need
      to provide the latest information on the teratogenicity of AEDs, and replace them
      with a safer combination of AEDs BEFORE pregnancy. Folate supplementation is also
      recommended. 2) Management during pregnancy: Patients are advised to adhere to
      taking AEDs as instructed, which prevents not only seizures during pregnancy but 
      also reduces the risk of miscarriage and premature delivery. Doses of AED are to 
      be increased after the second trimester. 3) Collaborating with obstetricians at
      delivery: Obstetricians are also nervous when faced with women with epilepsy.
      Basically, patients can deliver spontaneously, and the correct way to deal with
      unexpected seizures during labor should be fully understood. 4) Parental care:
      women with epilepsy can breastfeed. Physicians advise other family members on how
      to bottle feed at night to help mothers avoid a lack of sleep due to
      breastfeeding. Childcare is one of the most precious experiences in life.
      Patients with epilepsy, especially women, have a lower self-esteem; however, once
      they experience delivery, they act positively and become even-tempered.
      Physicians should be aware that childcare fosters a profound insight into their
      lives, allowing them to mature as a person.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of acupression at 
      the H7 point on sleep quality during pregnancy. After oral consent had been
      obtained, the midwife invited the women claiming to have poor sleep quality and
      anxiety symptoms to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and
      the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-1. Then, the same midwife, previously trained
      by an expert acupuncturist (I.N.), advised the women to put on the wrist
      overnight compression H7 Insomnia Control half an hour before going to bed and to
      take it off upon awakening, for 10 consecutive days and thereafter every odd day 
      (active group). Women refusing to wear the device for low compliance toward
      acupression were considered as the control group. After 2 weeks, a second
      questionnaire evaluation was completed. In the active, but not in the control,
      group, a significant improvement of sleep quality was observed after H7 device
      application. The study suggests that H7 acupression applied for 2 weeks improves 
      sleep quality in pregnant women. This preliminary result should serve to
      stimulate further studies on the long-term effects of acupression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalised itching is one of the most common dermatological symptoms
      in pregnant women. Having itchy skin during pregnancy may be very frustrating and
      can lead to poor sleep, exhaustion and impaired quality of life. There is a need 
      for a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      pharmacological interventions for treating itching in pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To
      assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating
      generalised itching (not caused by systemic diseases or skin lesions) in
      pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth
      Group's Trials Register (28 January 2016) and the reference list of the one
      identified study. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published, unpublished and ongoing
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for itching in
      pregnancy.Quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs, RCTs using a cross-over design, and studies
      reported in abstract form (without full text) were not eligible for inclusion.
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the one
      trial report that was identified from the search strategy and this was
      subsequently excluded. MAIN RESULTS: There are no included studies as we did not 
      identify any relevant trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Generalised itching (not
      caused by systemic disease or skin lesions) is quite a common symptom in
      pregnancy. However, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to
      guide practice in terms of the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological
      interventions for treating this condition.Well-designed randomised controlled
      trials are needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of topical and systemic 
      pharmacological interventions as well as any adverse effects of the
      interventions. Such studies should consider important outcomes such as relief of 
      itching, women's satisfaction, sleep disturbance, and adverse effects.

TI  - Pregnancy-induced adaptations of the central circadian clock and maternal
      glucocorticoids.
PG  - 135-47
LID - 10.1530/JOE-15-0405 [doi]
AB  - Maternal physiological adaptations, such as changes to the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, are central to pregnancy success.
      Circadian variation of the HPA axis is dependent on clock gene rhythms in the
      hypothalamus, but it is not known whether pregnancy-induced changes in maternal
      glucocorticoid levels are mediated via this central clock. We hypothesized that
      hypothalamic expression of clock genes changes across mouse pregnancy and this is
      linked to altered HPA activity. The anterior hypothalamus and maternal plasma
      were collected from C57Bl/6J mice prior to pregnancy and on days 6, 10, 14 and 18
      of gestation (term=d19), across a 24-h period (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 0000, 0400
      h). Hypothalamic expression of clock genes and Crh was determined by qPCR, plasma
      ACTH concentration measured by Milliplex assay and plasma corticosterone
      concentration by LC-MS/MS. Expression of all clock genes varied markedly across
      gestation, most notably at mid-gestation when levels of each gene were elevated. 
      The pregnancy-induced increase in maternal corticosterone levels (by up to
      14-fold on day 14) was not accompanied by a parallel shift in plasma ACTH (28%
      lower on day 14 compared with non-pregnant levels). Moreover, while circadian
      rhythmicity in corticosterone was maintained up to day 14 of gestation, this was 
      effectively lost by day 18. Overall, our data show that the central circadian
      clock undergoes marked adaptations throughout mouse pregnancy, changes that are
      likely to contribute to maternal physiological adaptations. Importantly, however,
      neither hypothalamic clock genes nor plasma ACTH levels appear to drive the
      marked increase in maternal corticosterone after mid-gestation.

TI  - Maternal sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy impairs the emotional
      and cognitive functions, and suppresses hippocampal long-term potentiation in the
      offspring rats.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s13041-016-0197-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is a serious public health problem
      as it can affect the health of pregnant women and newborns. However, it is not
      well studied whether sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy has
      similar effects on emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring, and if so,
      the potential cellular mechanisms also remain poorly understood. METHODS: In the 
      present study, the pregnant rats were subjected to sleep deprivation for 6 h per 
      day by gentle handling during the first (gestational days 1-7), second
      (gestational days 8-14) and third trimester (gestational days 15-21) of
      pregnancy, respectively. The emotional and cognitive functions as well as
      hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were tested in the offspring rats
      (postnatal days 42-56). RESULTS: The offspring displayed impaired
      hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, and increased depressive- and 
      anxiety-like behaviors. Quantification of BrdU-positive cells revealed that adult
      hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced compared to control.
      Electrophysiological recording showed that maternal sleep deprivation impaired
      hippocampal CA1 LTP and reduced basal synaptic transmission, as reflected by a
      decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic
      current in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together,
      these results suggest that maternal sleep deprivation at different stages of
      pregnancy disrupts the emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring that
      might be attributable to the suppression of hippocampal LTP and basal synaptic
      transmission.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to provide an update on recent advances in
      the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy and
      its effect on maternal and fetal outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Current OSA screening
      tools may not perform well in this population. There are some pieces of evidence 
      linking poorer maternal and neonatal outcome with pregnant patients having OSA.
      At present, there are inadequate data on which to base fetal or maternal
      parameters for treatment of OSA, and no evidence that treatment in the short-term
      impacts maternal or neonatal outcomes. SUMMARY: Further research is needed to
      help in the detection and treatment of OSA in pregnancy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity during pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of
      maternal, fetal and neonatal complications. This study compared placental
      pathology in women with obesity and normal weight gravidas. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study. The sample was randomly
      selected from a total of 1000 deliveries of largely Caucasian population in a
      single institution, recruited for the study of sleep disordered breathing, where 
      the placenta is submitted for pathological examination for clinical indications
      based on national guidelines. Cases (Body mass index - BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2); n =
      47) and controls (BMI < 25 kg/m(2), n = 45) were selected based on BMI obtained
      from the first prenatal visit. Placental pathology, clinical parameters and
      limited outcomes were extracted from medical records. Placental weight range was 
      defined as small for gestational age (SGA) if < 10th percentile, large for
      gestational age (LGA) if > 90th percentile. RESULTS: Mean BMI was 36.2 +/- 5.5 in
      the group with obesity and 21.7 +/- 1.9 in the control group (p < 0.01). There
      was a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes in cases compared to controls
      (14/47 vs. 3/45, p = 0.006) while preterm birth was significantly higher in the
      control group (9/47 vs. 19/46, p = 0.02). There were more LGA placentas in cases 
      versus controls (12/47 vs. 2/46, p = 0.007; even after adjusting for diabetes).
      More histological features of inflammation, marginal insertion of the umbilical
      cord and intervillous thrombi in the parenchyma were also noted in the case
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the current study suggest that maternal obesity 
      measured at early pregnancy may have effects on both placental implantation and
      growth, and further exacerbate the hypercoagulable state in placenta.

TI  - Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a progressive
      multisystem disorder with features ranging over a continuum of severity. While
      affected individuals have traditionally been classified as having one of three
      MPS I syndromes (Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, or Scheie syndrome), no
      easily measurable biochemical differences have been identified and the clinical
      findings overlap; thus, affected individuals are best described as having either 
      severe or attenuated MPS I, a distinction that influences therapeutic options.
      Severe MPS I. Infants appear normal at birth. Typical early manifestations are
      nonspecific (e.g., umbilical or inguinal hernia, frequent upper respiratory-tract
      infections before age 1 year). Coarsening of the facial features may not become
      apparent until after age one year. Gibbus deformity of the lower spine is common 
      and often noted within the first year. Progressive skeletal dysplasia (dysostosis
      multiplex) involving all bones is universal. By age three years, linear growth
      decreases. Intellectual disability is progressive and profound. Hearing loss is
      common. Death, typically caused by cardiorespiratory failure, usually occurs
      within the first ten years of life. Attenuated MPS I. The severity and rate of
      disease progression range from serious life-threatening complications leading to 
      death in the second to third decades to a normal life span complicated by
      significant disability from progressive joint manifestations and
      cardiorespiratory disease. While some individuals have no neurologic involvement 
      and psychomotor development may be normal in early childhood, learning
      disabilities can be present. Clinical onset is usually between ages three and ten
      years. Hearing loss and cardiac valvular disease are common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      The diagnosis of MPS I is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and
      laboratory findings and either identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in
      IDUA on molecular genetic testing or detection of deficient activity of the
      lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations:
      Infant learning programs/special education for developmental delays; hats with
      visors/sunglasses to reduce glare; cardiac valve replacement as needed; physical 
      therapy, orthopedic surgery as needed (joint replacement, atlanto-occipital
      stabilization, early median nerve decompression for carpal tunnel syndrome based 
      on nerve conduction studies before clinical manifestations develop);
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy for eustachian tube dysfunction and/or upper airway obstruction;
      tracheostomy for sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure; PE
      tubes; surgical intervention for cervical myelopathy. Prevention of primary
      manifestations: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered as
      standard of care for children with severe MPS I. Outcome from HSCT is
      significantly influenced by disease burden at the time of diagnosis (and thus, by
      the age of the patient). HSCT can increase survival, improve growth, reduce
      facial coarseness and hepatosplenomegaly, improve hearing, and alter the natural 
      history of cardiac and respiratory symptomatology. HSCT has lesser effects on the
      skeletal and joint manifestations or corneal clouding. HSCT may slow the course
      of cognitive decline in children with mild, but not significant, cognitive
      impairment at the time of transplantation. Due to the morbidity and mortality
      associated with HSCT, it is currently recommended primarily for children with
      severe MPS I. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase (Aldurazyme((R))),
      licensed for treatment of the non-CNS manifestations of MPS I, improves liver
      size, linear growth, joint mobility, breathing, and sleep apnea in persons with
      attenuated disease. The timing of the initiation of ERT is likely to influence
      the outcome. Prevention of secondary complications: Bacterial endocarditis
      prophylaxis for those with cardiac involvement; special attention to anesthetic
      risks. Surveillance: Early and continuous monitoring of head growth in infants
      and children; routine median nerve conduction velocity testing; and educational
      assessment of children with attenuated disease prior to primary school entry.
      Annual assessment by: orthopedic surgeon, neurologist (for evidence of spinal
      cord compression), ophthalmologist, cardiologist (including echocardiogram),
      audiologist, and otolaryngologist. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early
      diagnosis prior to significant disease manifestations is warranted in relatives
      at risk in order to begin therapy as early in the course of disease as possible. 
      GENETIC COUNSELING: MPS I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At
      conception, each child of a couple in which both parents are heterozygous for a
      IDUA pathogenic variant has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being
      an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. 
      Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at
      increased risk are possible if both pathogenic IDUA variants have been identified
      in the family.

TI  - Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) Status in Pregnant Women: Associations with
      Sleep Quality, Inflammation, and Length of Gestation.
PG  - e0148752
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0148752 [doi]
AB  - Mechanistic pathways linking maternal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status
      with gestational length are poorly delineated. This study examined whether
      inflammation and sleep quality serve as mediators, focusing on the
      antiinflammatory omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n3) and proinflammatory
      omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n6). Pregnant women (n = 135) provided a blood 
      sample and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 20-27 weeks
      gestation. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid levels were determined by gas
      chromatography and serum inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor
      necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and C-reactive protein] by
      electrochemiluminescence using high sensitivity kits. Both higher serum IL-8 (95%
      CI = 0.10,3.84) and poor sleep (95% CI = 0.03,0.28) served as significant
      mediators linking lower DHA:AA ratios with shorter gestation. Further, a serial
      mediation model moving from the DHA:AA ratio --> sleep --> IL-8 --> length of
      gestation was statistically significant (95% CI = 0.02, 0.79). These
      relationships remained after adjusting for depressive symptoms, age, BMI, income,
      race, and smoking. No interactions with race were observed in relation to length 
      of gestation as a continuous variable. However, a significant interaction between
      race and the DHA:AA ratio in predicting preterm birth was observed (p = 0.049);
      among African Americans only, odds of preterm birth decreased as DHA:AA increased
      (p = 0.048). These data support a role for both inflammatory pathways and sleep
      quality in linking less optimal RBC PUFA status with shorter gestation in African
      American and European American women and suggest that African-Americans have
      greater risk for preterm birth in the context of a low DHA:AA ratio.

PG  - 579-87
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.5696 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the 
      Spanish-language version of the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test
      questionnaire (FIRST-S) when used in early pregnancy. METHODS: A cohort of 647
      women were interviewed at </= 16 weeks of gestation to collect information
      regarding lifestyle, demographic, and sleep characteristics. The factorial
      structure of the FIRST-S was tested through exploratory and confirmatory factor
      analyses (EFA and CFA). Internal consistency and construct validity were also
      assessed by evaluating the association between the FIRST-S with symptoms of
      depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Item response theory (IRT) analyses were 
      conducted to complement classical test theory (CTT) analytic approaches. RESULTS:
      The mean score of the FIRST-S was 13.8 (range: 9-33). The results of the EFA
      showed that the FIRST-S contained a one-factor solution that accounted for 69.8% 
      of the variance. The FIRST-S items showed good internal consistency (Cronbach
      alpha = 0.81). CFA results corroborated the one-factor structure finding from the
      EFA; and yielded measures indicating goodness of fit (comparative fit index of
      0.902) and accuracy (root mean square error of approximation of 0.057). The
      FIRST-S had good construct validity as demonstrated by statistically significant 
      associations of FIRST-S scores with sleep quality, antepartum depression and
      anxiety symptoms. Finally, results from IRT analyses suggested excellent item
      infit and outfit measures. CONCLUSIONS: The FIRST-S was found to have good
      construct validity and internal consistency for assessing vulnerability to
      insomnia during early pregnancy.

TI  - Blunted neuroactive steroid and HPA axis responses to stress are associated with 
      reduced sleep quality and negative affect in pregnancy: a pilot study.
PG  - 1299-310
LID - 10.1007/s00213-016-4217-x [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Anxiety during pregnancy has been linked to adverse maternal health
      outcomes, including postpartum depression (PPD). However, there has been limited 
      study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during
      pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst 
      antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to
      examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including
      GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during
      pregnancy. METHODS: Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a
      singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a
      2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior. RESULTS: Lower 
      cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone throughout 
      the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with
      greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was
      associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was
      associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced
      paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of
      allopregnanolone + pregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were 
      elevated. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLO +
      pregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to
      negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge
      appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote
      negative emotional responses.

TI  - Salivary melatonin levels and sleep-wake rhythms in pregnant women with
      hypertensive and glucose metabolic disorders: A prospective analysis.
PG  - 34-41

AB  - In preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, the sympathetic nerves are activated,
      leading to disrupted sleep. Melatonin, which transmits information to regulate
      the sleep-wake rhythm and other such biorhythms, has been implicated in insulin
      resistance, antioxidant behaviors, and metabolic syndrome. In addition, its
      reduced secretion increases the risk of hypertension and diabetes. The aim of
      this study was to elucidate the features of melatonin secretion, sleep quality,
      and sleep-wake rhythms in pregnant women with complications. Fifty-eight pregnant
      women with pregnancy complications (hypertensive or glucose metabolic disorders) 
      and 40 healthy pregnant women completed questionnaires, including sleep logs and 
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), during the second to third trimesters.
      Their salivary melatonin levels were also measured. Pregnant women with
      complications had significantly lower morning (p < 0.001), daytime (p < 0.01),
      evening (p < 0.001), night (p < 0.01), daily mean (p < 0.001), peak (p < 0.001), 
      and bottom (p < 0.01) melatonin values than healthy pregnant women. Pregnant
      women with complications also had significantly smaller melatonin amplitudes than
      healthy pregnant women (p < 0.001). Among pregnant women with complications, the 
      duration (p < 0.05) and frequency (p < 0.01) of wake after sleep-onset were
      significantly greater in the poor sleep group than in the favorable sleep group
      which was divided by PSQI cutoff value. Pregnant women with hypertensive or
      glucose metabolic disorder complications had smaller circadian variation in
      salivary melatonin secretion, and their values were lower throughout the day than
      healthy pregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a detailed epidemiological study of Chinese women and the
      relationship between restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and any associated
      complications during delivery. METHODS: A total of 3874 pregnant women (18-40
      years) who had delivered babies at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
      University from May 2011 to May 2014 were enrolled in the study. Using a
      face-to-face interview questionnaire, data were collected pertaining to RLS
      incidence in pregnancy and any associated complications during delivery. The
      relationship between RLS frequency and pregnancy or delivery complications was
      further investigated. RESULTS: Among 12.3% of the eligible participants, RLS
      prevalence occurred at least weekly. Older pregnant women were more likely to
      suffer from RLS. Individuals who experienced RLS at least weekly reported a
      statistically higher frequency of excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased
      prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and preeclampsia compared
      with those without RLS. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that RLS was frequent in
      Chinese pregnant women, especially in those with pregnancy or delivery
      complications such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and preeclampsia.
      Restless legs syndrome was also associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.

TI  - Pregnancy as a Window to Future Cardiovascular Health: Design and Implementation 
      of the nuMoM2b Heart Health Study.
PG  - 519-30
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwv309 [doi]
AB  - The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Nulliparous
      Pregnancy Outcomes Study-Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) Heart Health Study
      (HHS) was designed to investigate the relationships between adverse pregnancy
      outcomes and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The ongoing
      nuMoM2b-HHS, which started in 2013, is a prospective follow-up of the nuMoM2b
      cohort, which included 10,038 women recruited between 2010 and 2013 from 8
      centers across the United States who were initially observed over the course of
      their first pregnancies. In this report, we detail the design and study
      procedures of the nuMoM2b-HHS. Women in the pregnancy cohort who consented to be 
      contacted for participation in future studies were approached at 6-month
      intervals to ascertain health information and to maintain ongoing contact. Two to
      5 years after completion of the pregnancy documented in the nuMoM2b, women in the
      nuMoM2b-HHS were invited to an in-person study visit. During this visit, they
      completed psychosocial and medical history questionnaires and had clinical
      measurements and biological specimens obtained. A subcohort of participants who
      had objective assessments of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy were
      asked to repeat this investigation. This unique prospective observational study
      includes a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort, rich depth of
      phenotypic information about adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical data and
      biospecimens from early in the index pregnancy onward. Data obtained from this
      cohort will provide mechanistic and clinical insights into how data on a first
      pregnancy can provide information about the potential development of subsequent
      risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Unique Aspects of Sleep in Women.
PG  - 430-4
AB  - Sleep in women differs in many respects from that of men. In general, women
      appear to report a greater need for sleep and more subjective complaints of
      non-refreshing sleep than men. Sleep in women is affected at least partially by
      hormonal factors, with women typically suffering from sleep disturbance in
      connection with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause Menstrual cycles
      are associated with prominent changes in reproductive hormones that may influence
      sleep. Sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome may be aggravated by pregnancy.
      Women may also develop insomnia during pregnancy, childbirth and menopause.

TI  - The nuclear receptor REV-ERBalpha represses the transcription of
      growth/differentiation factor 10 and 15 genes in rat endometrium stromal cells.

AB  - Cellular oscillators in the uterus play critical roles in the gestation processes
      of mammals through entraining of the clock proteins to numerous downstream genes,
      including growth/differentiation factor (Gdf)10 and Gdf15. The expression of
      Gdf10 and Gdf15 is significantly increased in the uterus during decidualization, 
      but the mechanism underlying the regulation of Gdf gene expression in the uterus 
      is poorly understood. Here, we focused on the function of the cellular
      oscillators in the expression of Gdf family by using uterine endometrial stromal 
      cells (UESCs) isolated from pregnant Per2-dLuc transgenic rats. A significant
      decline of Per2-dLuc bioluminescence activity was induced in in vitro
      decidualized UESCs, and concomitantly the expression of canonical clock genes was
      downregulated. Conversely, the expression of Gdf10 and Gdf15 of the Gdf was
      upregulated. In UESCs transfected with Bmal1-specific siRNA, in which
      Rev-erbalpha expression was downregulated, Gdf10 and Gdf15 were upregulated.
      However, Gdf5, Gdf7, and Gdf11 were not significantly affected by Bmal1
      silencing. The expression of Gdf10 and Gdf15 was enhanced after treatment with a 
      REV-ERBalpha antagonist in the presence or absence of progesterone. Chromatin
      immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis revealed the inhibitory effect of REV-ERBalpha
      on the expression of Gdf10 and Gdf15 in UESCs by recognizing their gene
      promoters. Collectively, our findings indicate that the attenuation of
      REV-ERBalpha leads to an upregulation of Gdf10 and Gdf15 in decidual cells, in
      which cellular oscillators are impaired. Our results provide novel evidence
      regarding the functions of cellular oscillators regulating the expression of
      downstream genes during the differentiation of UESCs.

TI  - Construct validity and factor structure of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      among pregnant women in a Pacific-Northwest cohort.
PG  - 293-301

AB  - PURPOSE: Poor sleep quality during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric
      and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite its routine use as a sleep quality
      assessment scale among men and non-pregnant women, the psychometric properties of
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) have not been assessed among US
      pregnant women. We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure
      of the PSQI among 1488 pregnant women. METHODS: A structured interview was used
      to collect information about demographics and sleep characteristics in early
      pregnancy. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression,
      Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to assess symptoms of
      depression, anxiety, and stress. Consistency indices, exploratory and
      confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA), correlations, and logistic regression
      procedures were used. RESULTS: The reliability coefficient, Cronbach's alpha for 
      the PSQI items was 0.74. Results of the EFA showed that a rotated factor solution
      for the PSQI contained two factors with eigenvalues >1.0 accounting for 52.8 % of
      the variance. The PSQI was significantly positively correlated with the PHQ-9 (r 
      s = 0.48) and DASS-21 (r s = 0.42) total scores. Poor sleepers (PSQI global score
      >5) had increased odds of experiencing depression (OR = 6.47; 95 % CI =
      4.56-9.18), anxiety (OR = 3.59; 95 % CI = 2.45-5.26), and stress (OR = 4.37; 95 %
      CI = 2.88-6.65) demonstrating evidence of good construct validity. CFA results
      corroborated the two-factor structure finding from the EFA and yielded reassuring
      measures indicating goodness of fit (comparative fit index = 0.975) and accuracy 
      (root mean square error of approximation = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The PSQI has good
      construct validity and reliability for assessing sleep quality among pregnant
      women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are common in women, especially during pregnancy. 
      Previous studies have confirmed the importance of sleep disturbances as a risk
      factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the need for screening and treatment of 
      inadequate sleep. These reports, however, did not examine health-related quality 
      of life which may be affected by sleep long before adverse clinical consequences 
      are detectable in women during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To examine the
      cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related
      quality of life in pregnant women. DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
      SETTING: A university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan and participants' homes.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 164 pregnant women completed questionnaires and wore a
      wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 days each trimester. METHODS: Objective sleep was 
      measured by actigraphy, subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index, and health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2 
      questionnaire across three trimesters. Multiple linear regression analyses were
      performed to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between
      sleep and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Sixty-four (39.0%) women
      consistently had an average sleep efficiency<85% by actigraphy and 40 (24.4%) had
      a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score>5 in all three trimesters.
      Cross-sectionally, more actigraphic daytime sleep (p=0.04) and better subjective 
      sleep quality (p<0.01) were associated with better physical health-related
      quality of life in first-trimester pregnant women. Better actigraphic sleep
      efficiency (p=0.04) and better subjective sleep quality (p<0.01) were associated 
      with better mental health-related quality of life in second-trimester pregnant
      women. Longer actigraphic total nighttime sleep (p<0.01) and better subjective
      sleep quality (p<0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality 
      of life in third-trimester pregnant women. Longitudinally, first-trimester
      actigraphic total nighttime sleep (p<0.05) and subjective sleep quality (p<0.01) 
      predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third
      trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are a highly prevalent and persistent 
      problem in pregnant women. Adequate sleep is essential for women at all pregnancy
      stages and improving nocturnal sleep quantity and quality in early gestation is
      of utmost importance for an optimal health-related quality of life later in
      pregnancy.

TI  - DEPRESSION--A FELLOW TRAVELER WITH SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS.
PG  - 974-81
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem inflammatory disorder
      that occurs primarily in women of childbearing age, immunologic abnormalities
      being a prominent feature of the disease. Psychiatric disorders frequently
      coexist, depression being the most common mood disorder in neuropsychiatric
      lupus. This literature review was performed through searching MEDLINE database
      for full-text English-language articles--original research, systematic review and
      updates published in the last five years (2010-2015), using the keywords
      "depression and systemic lupus erythematosus". The main outcomes identified were 
      prevalence and predictors of depression in various cultural and ethnic groups,
      depression-related clinical issues (suicidal ideation, cognitive impairment,
      altered body image, sleep and sexual disturbances, influence of SLE treatment),
      and influence on quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach that takes into
      account the polymorphism and individual variability of the SLE clinical
      manifestations helps to improve early detection of depression, which is
      responsible for the increased risk of comorbidities, suicidal attempts, decreased
      treatment adherence, and impaired quality of life. Physicians across all
      specialties involved in the care for lupus patients should be aware of the major 
      prevalence of this condition, while helping patients to cope with their disabling
      disease.

TI  - CREBBP and EP300 mutational spectrum and clinical presentations in a cohort of
      Swedish patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome.
PG  - 39-45
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.177 [doi]
AB  - Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder 
      characterized by distinctive facial features, broad thumbs and halluces, growth
      retardation, and a variable degree of cognitive impairment. CREBBP is the major
      causative gene and mutations in EP300 are the cause of RTS in a minority of
      patients. In this study, 17 patients with a clinical diagnosis of RTS were
      investigated with direct sequencing, MLPA, and array-CGH in search for mutations 
      in these two genes. Eleven patients (64.7%) had disease-causing point mutations
      or a deletion in CREBBP and in one patient (5.9%) a causal de novo frameshift
      mutation in EP300 was identified. This patient had broad thumbs, mild
      intellectual disability, and autism. In addition, an inherited missense mutation 
      of uncertain clinical significance was identified in EP300 in one patient and his
      healthy father, and three patients had intronic nucleotide changes of uncertain
      clinical significance in CREBBP. Snoring and sleep apnea were common in both
      groups and four of the patients' mothers had preeclampsia during pregnancy.
      Importantly, difficulties associated with anesthesia were frequently reported and
      included delayed or complicated emergency in 53.3% of patients.

TI  - Sleep Disturbances and Symptoms of Depression and Daytime Sleepiness in Pregnant 
      Women.
PG  - 176-83
LID - 10.1111/birt.12215 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance, depression, and daytime sleepiness are among the
      most prevalent symptoms reported by women during pregnancy. However, available
      data on the association between sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and
      daytime sleepiness in pregnant women are sparse and methodological limitations
      have been acknowledged. The purpose of the study was to examine objective and
      self-reported sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime
      sleepiness in a group of healthy pregnant women. METHODS: A total of 274
      third-trimester pregnant women wore a wrist actigraph continuously for 7 days to 
      assess objective sleep quality and quantity. Self-reported sleep quality was
      assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with self-reported poor
      sleep quality defined as a PSQI score more than 5. The Center for Epidemiologic
      Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to
      evaluate symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness, respectively. RESULTS:
      Sixty-four (23.4%) women were at risk for clinical depression and 69 (25.2%) had 
      daytime sleepiness. Risk of clinically meaningful depressive symptomatology was
      significantly increased in women with objective total nighttime sleep less than 6
      hours (OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.26-5.08]) and self-reported poor sleep quality (OR 3.31 
      [95% CI 1.74-6.30]), even after multiple adjustment. Neither objective nor
      self-reported sleep disturbances increased daytime sleepiness in this group of
      pregnant women. DISCUSSION: Both objective nighttime sleep less than 6 hours and 
      self-reported poor sleep quality in healthy third-trimester pregnant women is
      associated with significant risks for clinical depression. Improving sleep would 
      likely be associated with a reduction in depression symptom severity and an
      attenuation of the prevalence of depression in pregnant women.

TI  - Nonpharmacologic Management of Chronic Insomnia.
PG  - 1058-64
AB  - Insomnia affects 10% to 30% of the population with a total cost of $92.5 to
      $107.5 billion annually. Short-term, chronic, and other types of insomnia are the
      three major categories according to the International Classification of Sleep
      Disorders, 3rd ed. The criteria for diagnosis are difficulty falling asleep,
      difficulty staying asleep, or early awakening despite the opportunity for sleep; 
      symptoms must be associated with impaired daytime functioning and occur at least 
      three times per week for at least one month. Factors associated with the onset of
      insomnia include a personal or family history of insomnia, easy arousability,
      poor self-reported health, and chronic pain. Insomnia is more common in women,
      especially following menopause and during late pregnancy, and in older adults. A 
      comprehensive sleep history can confirm the diagnosis. Psychiatric and medical
      problems, medication use, and substance abuse should be ruled out as contributing
      factors. Treatment of comorbid conditions alone may not resolve insomnia.
      Patients with movement disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, periodic limb
      movement disorder), circadian rhythm disorders, or breathing disorders (e.g.,
      obstructive sleep apnea) must be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic
      insomnia is associated with cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, poor 
      work performance, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular
      disease and all-cause mortality. Insomnia can be treated with nonpharmacologic
      and pharmacologic therapies. Nonpharmacologic therapies include sleep hygiene,
      cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, multicomponent therapy, and
      paradoxical intention. Referral to a sleep specialist may be considered for
      refractory cases.

TI  - [Prevalence and associated factors of low birth weight in the provincial hospital
      of Mohammedia--Morocco].
PG  - 440-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (LBW) constitutes a major public health problem,
      both in developed than in developing countries, due to its extent and its strong 
      association with childhood morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: to estimate
      prevalence of low birth weight and determine its related factors in the
      Prefectoral Hospital in Mohammedia. METHODS: We carried out a cross sectional
      study from May to July 2012 which concerned 713 newborns and theirs mothers. We
      collected information about socioeconomic and anthropometric factors and
      characteristics of pregnancy. A multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS:
      Among the 713 studied newborns, 38 had LBW; the prevalence of LBW was 5,3% (95%
      CI: 3,7%-6,9%). Factors significantly associated with LBW in multivariate
      analysis were: mother age ( OR 9,27; IC95%:2,15-39,85), prematurity (OR 9,34;
      IC95%:1,29-67,32), twin pregnancy (OR 195,07; IC 95%:30,38-125,39) and gender of 
      new born (OR 5,26; IC 95%:1,61-17,18). Well-balanced diet (OR 0,12; IC
      95%:0,04-0,34) and hours of sleep equal or more than 8 per day (OR 0,20; IC
      95%:0,07-0,58) were protector factors. CONCLUSION: Actions of education,
      screening and treatment of the diseases occurred in the pregnancy are necessary. 
      Facilitating the access of pregnant women to high quality antenatal care,
      promoting a healthy lifestyle as a balanced diet, fighting against the active and
      passive smoking and offering a psychological support to the pregnant woman is
      necessary to reduce the prevalence of LBW and to improve the maternal and child
      health.

AB  - In the United States, roughly half of women are either overweight (24.5%) or
      obese (21.4%) when they become pregnant. Women who are obese before pregnancy are
      at increased risk for a number of pregnancy complications relative to
      normal-weight women. Specifically, obesity is associated with significantly
      increased maternal risks, including gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive
      disorders of pregnancy, and sleep disordered breathing. Maternal obesity is also 
      associated with increased risks of adverse fetal outcomes, including prematurity,
      stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and abnormal fetal growth. In this review, we
      will discuss the implications of obesity with respect to antepartum care.

LID - 10.5812/ircmj.24438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose females to
      develop restless legs syndrome (RLS). Studies evaluating outcomes of RLS symptoms
      in pregnancy are scarce. OBJECTIVES: We examined the risk of preterm birth in
      pregnant women with and without restless legs syndrome (RLS). MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A cohort study included 231 pregnant women attending Ardabil health care
      centers for prenatal care and delivery in the period of 2010, without any risk
      factors for preterm delivery and low birth weight. The instruments used were
      questionnaires about RLS, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), demographic data,
      and hemoglobin values. Data were analyzed via SPSS software using descriptive
      statistics, the t-test, chi2, Fisher's exact test, Pearson's correlation, and the
      Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: RLS complicated 43.7 percent of pregnancies.
      Sleepiness (ESS score > 8) was reported in 36.4% of the subjects with preterm
      birth and 35.9% of the term group. No significant correlation was found between
      the ESS score and the term and preterm groups (P = 0.843). The prevalence of
      preterm birth in the subjects with and without RLS was 69.7% and 30.3%,
      respectively: As a result, it significantly increased in the RLS group (P =
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancies complicated by RLS are at increased risk for
      preterm birth. The improved sleep health of pregnant women could decrease
      pregnancy complications.

TI  - The Swine Plasma Metabolome Chronicles "Many Days" Biological Timing and
      Functions Linked to Growth.
PG  - e0145919
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0145919 [doi]
AB  - The paradigm of chronobiology is based almost wholly upon the daily biological
      clock, or circadian rhythm, which has been the focus of intense molecular,
      cellular, pharmacological, and behavioral, research. However, the circadian
      rhythm does not explain biological timings related to fundamental aspects of life
      history such as rates of tissue/organ/body size development and control of the
      timing of life stages such as gestation length, age at maturity, and lifespan.
      This suggests that another biological timing mechanism is at work. Here we focus 
      on a "many days" (multidien) chronobiological period first observed as enigmatic 
      recurring growth lines in developing mammalian tooth enamel that is strongly
      associate with all adult tissue, organ, and body masses as well as life history
      attributes such as gestation length, age at maturity, weaning, and lifespan,
      particularly among the well studied primates. Yet, knowledge of the biological
      factors regulating the patterning of mammalian life, such as the development of
      body size and life history structure, does not exist. To identify underlying
      molecular mechanisms we performed metabolome and genome analyses from blood
      plasma in domestic pigs. We show that blood plasma metabolites and small
      non-coding RNA (sncRNA) drawn from 33 domestic pigs over a two-week period
      strongly oscillate on a 5-day multidien rhythm, as does the pig enamel rhythm.
      Metabolomics and genomics pathway analyses actually reveal two 5-day rhythms, one
      related to growth in which biological functions include cell proliferation,
      apoptosis, and transcription regulation/protein synthesis, and another 5-day
      rhythm related to degradative pathways that follows three days later. Our results
      provide experimental confirmation of a 5-day multidien rhythm in the domestic pig
      linking the periodic growth of enamel with oscillations of the metabolome and
      genome. This association reveals a new class of chronobiological rhythm and a
      snapshot of the biological bases that regulate mammalian growth, body size, and
      life history.

      Inflammatory Mediators.
PG  - 56-62
LID - 10.1159/000443182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with nocturnal
      intermittent hypoxia, which may be responsible for increased circulating levels
      of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory mediators, such as 
      metalloproteinases (MMPs), and which contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic 
      hypertension. Why some OSA patients remain normotensive is poorly understood.
      Relaxin-2, a pregnancy hormone, may sometimes circulate in men and could increase
      in hypoxic conditions. It exerts a vasodilatory activity and can modulate the
      release of molecules, such as MMPs and VEGF. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this
      study was to explore if circulating relaxin-2 in male OSA subjects may be related
      to OSA severity, to circulating levels of MMPs, of their inhibitors (tissue
      inhibitors of metalloproteinases; TIMPs), and of VEGF, and if it may protect from
      hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty untreated male subjects with suspected 
      OSA were recruited. After nocturnal polysomnography, a morning venous blood
      sample was withdrawn. Then, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was
      performed. RESULTS: The respiratory disturbance index in the sample was 30.4
      [interquartile range (IQR) 15.6-55.2]. Relaxin-2 was detectable in 20 subjects.
      These subjects did not differ in OSA severity or diurnal and nocturnal BP from
      subjects with undetectable relaxin-2, but they showed lower TIMP-1 (126.8 +/-
      29.1 vs. 156.9 +/- 41.7 pg/ml, respectively; p = 0.007) and a marginally higher
      MMP-9/TIMP-1 molar ratio [0.58 (IQR 0.23-1.35) vs. 0.25 (IQR 0.15-0.56); p =
      0.052]. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxin-2 in male subjects was not related to OSA severity, 
      but it was associated with lower TIMP-1. As it was often undetectable, even when 
      BP values were normal, it is unlikely that it plays a role as a major factor
      protecting from hypertension in OSA.

TI  - Sleep Moderates and Mediates the Relationship Between Acculturation and
      Depressive Symptoms in Pregnant Mexican-American Women.
PG  - 422-33
LID - 10.1007/s10995-015-1840-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Greater acculturation is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in
      Mexican-American women, but the mechanisms by which acculturation influences
      perinatal outcomes are unclear. Pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women are 
      more likely to engage in unhealthy prenatal behaviors relative to those less
      acculturated, including poor sleep. As sleep disruptions are associated with
      acculturation and negative perinatal outcomes, particularly maternal depression, 
      alterations in sleep may adversely affect pregnant Mexican-American women.
      METHODS: Sixty pregnant women of Mexican descent completed surveys about sleep,
      acculturation, depressive symptoms and potential protective factor of social
      support. RESULTS: Acculturation, but not social support, significantly predicted 
      increased sleep disruptions as well as overall feeling less refreshed upon waking
      across pregnancy. Moderation analysis indicated that more acculturated women who 
      took longer to fall asleep reported increased depressive symptoms. Feeling
      refreshed upon waking also mediated the relationship between increased
      acculturation and elevated maternal depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:
      Acculturation and altered sleep contribute to greater risk in Mexican-American
      women for maternal depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. These findings
      have implications for prevention and treatment of maternal mental health
      disorders, which may adversely affect perinatal outcomes in the vulnerable
      Mexican-American population.

      Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
PG  - 155-181
LID - 10.1007/7854_2015_419 [doi]
AB  - The environment in which individuals develop and mature is critical for their
      physiological and psychological outcome; in particular, the intrauterine
      environment has reached far more clinical relevance given its potential influence
      on shaping brain function and thus mental health. Gestational stress and/or
      maternal infection during pregnancy has been related with an increased incidence 
      of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. In this
      framework, the use of animal models has allowed a formal and deep investigation
      of causal determinants. Despite disruption of circadian clocks often represents a
      hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders, the relationship between
      disruption of brain development and the circadian system has been scarcely
      investigated. Nowadays, there is an increasing amount of studies suggesting a
      link between circadian system malfunction, early-life insults and the appearance 
      of neuropsychiatric diseases at adulthood. Here, we briefly review evidence from 
      clinical literature and animal models suggesting that the exposure to prenatal
      insults, i.e. severe gestational stress or maternal immune activation, changes
      the foetal hormonal milieu increasing the circulating levels of both
      glucocorticoids and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These two biological events have 
      been reported to affect genes expression in experimental models and critically
      interfere with brain development triggering and/or exacerbating behavioural
      anomalies in the offspring. Herein, we highlight the importance to unravel the
      individual components of the body circadian system that might also be altered by 
      prenatal insults and that may be causally associated with the disruption of
      neural and endocrine developmental programming.

TI  - Pregnancy eating attributes study (PEAS): a cohort study examining behavioral and
      environmental influences on diet and weight change in pregnancy and postpartum.
LID - 45 [pii]
LID - 10.1186/s40795-016-0083-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of maternal overweight/obesity and excessive
      gestational weight gain poses a serious public health concern due to the
      contribution of these factors to increased risk of negative health outcomes for
      both mother and child. Scant intervention research has indicated moderate
      short-term improvement in maternal diet and gestational weight gain, with little 
      evidence of long-term behavior change, in parallel with findings from
      interventions outside of pregnancy. Recent laboratory-based findings from
      neuroscience implicate aberrant reward processing of food at the brain level
      ("food reward sensitivity," the between-individual variation in the response to
      food stimuli) as a contributor to eating beyond energy needs. However, scant
      research has examined the influence of these processes on weight change in
      population-based settings, and the relevance of these processes to
      pregnancy-related weight change has not been explored. The purpose of the
      Pregnancy Eating Attributes Study (PEAS) is to examine the role of food reward
      sensitivity in maternal diet and weight change during pregnancy and postpartum.
      The study examines the interplay of food reward sensitivity with behavioral
      control, home food environment, and related aspects of eating behavior in the
      context of weight-related biomedical, psychosocial, genetic and behavioral
      factors including physical activity, stress, sleep and depression. METHODS: Women
      of varying baseline weight status (n = 450) are enrolled early in pregnancy and
      followed, along with their infants, until 1 year postpartum. Assessments occur
      during each trimester of pregnancy, and postpartum at approximately 2 months, 6
      months, 9 months and 12 months. Maternal food reward, self-control, home food
      environment, eating behaviors, dietary intake, health behaviors, and
      anthropometrics are assessed along with maternal and infant clinical and
      biological data, infant anthropometrics, and feeding practices. Primary exposures
      of interest include food reward sensitivity, behavioral control, and home food
      environment. Primary outcomes include gestational weight gain, postpartum weight 
      retention and maternal diet quality. DISCUSSION: With increasing evidence
      suggesting the relevance of food reward sensitivity for understanding eating
      behavior, PEAS aims to advance understanding of the determinants of eating
      behavior during pregnancy, informing future interventions for improving maternal 
      diet and weight change, and leading to improved maternal and child health and
      weight trajectories. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02217462. Date of

TI  - Homeopathic Treatment for Postpartum Depression: A Case Report.
PG  - 381-384
LID - 10.1177/2156587216682168 [doi]
AB  - Postpartum psychosis has long-lasting consequences for mother and child. Beside
      depression, sleep and eating disturbances, exhaustion, social withdrawal, and
      anxiety, postpartum depression can also interfere with normal maternal-infant
      bonding and adversely affect child development. Recent reports show that most
      affected pregnant women are hesitant about taking antidepressant drugs, with a
      high percentage discontinuing their use. Some authors suggest that the reluctance
      of pregnant women to take antidepressant drugs should encourage clinicians to
      discuss with their patients the use of psychological interventions or alternative
      forms of treatment. In this article, a case of severe postpartum depression,
      treated successfully with homeopathic therapy, is presented. Considering the high
      noncompliance of women suffering from postpartum depression with conventional
      antidepressant medication, research in safe complementary medical methods is
      justified. One of these methods should be homeopathy.

TI  - Design of lifestyle intervention trials to prevent excessive gestational weight
      gain in women with overweight or obesity.
PG  - 305-13
LID - 10.1002/oby.21330 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms (LIFE-Moms) Consortium 
      is designed to determine, in pregnant women with overweight or obesity, whether
      various behavioral and lifestyle interventions reduce excessive gestational
      weight gain (GWG) and subsequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and
      obesity in offspring. The design and planning process of the LIFE-Moms Consortium
      is described. METHODS: The LIFE-Moms Consortium is a collaboration among seven
      clinical centers, a Research Coordinating Unit, and the NIH designed to support
      each clinical center's conduct of a separate trial of a unique intervention.
      Specific common measures, procedures, and eligibility criteria are consistent
      across the seven trials allowing data to be combined in exploratory analyses
      and/or compared readily. RESULTS: Numerous committees and working groups were
      created to define common measures and outcomes during pregnancy and through 1
      year postpartum, develop Consortium policies, and oversee progress of the trials.
      The primary outcome for the Consortium is excessive GWG. Secondary outcomes
      include maternal, neonatal, and infant anthropometric measures, physical
      activity, sleep, and complications of pregnancy and delivery. CONCLUSIONS: A
      multi-center consortium of independent, lifestyle interventions with common
      measures and outcomes may enhance the ability to identify promising interventions
      for improving outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring.

TI  - Quantifying the Interactions between Maternal and Fetal Heart Rates by Transfer
      Entropy.
PG  - e0145672
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0145672 [doi]
AB  - Evidence of the short term relationship between maternal and fetal heart rates
      has been found in previous studies. However there is still limited knowledge
      about underlying mechanisms and patterns of the coupling throughout gestation. In
      this study, Transfer Entropy (TE) was used to quantify directed interactions
      between maternal and fetal heart rates at various time delays and gestational
      ages. Experimental results using maternal and fetal electrocardiograms showed
      significant coupling for 63 out of 65 fetuses, by statistically validating
      against surrogate pairs. Analysis of TE showed a decrease in transfer of
      information from fetus to the mother with gestational age, alongside the
      maturation of the fetus. On the other hand, maternal to fetal TE was
      significantly greater in mid (26-31 weeks) and late (32-41 weeks) gestation
      compared to early (16-25 weeks) gestation (Mann Whitney Wilcoxon (MWW) p<0.05).
      TE further increased from mid to late, for the fetuses with RMSSD of fetal heart 
      rate being larger than 4 msec in the late gestation. This difference was not
      observed for the fetuses with smaller RMSSD, which could be associated with the
      quiet sleep state. Delay in the information transfer from mother to fetus
      significantly decreased (p = 0.03) from mid to late gestation, implying a
      decrease in fetal response time. These changes occur concomitant with the
      maturation of the fetal sensory and autonomic nervous systems with advancing
      gestational age. The effect of maternal respiratory rate derived from maternal
      ECG was also investigated and no significant relationship was found between
      breathing rate and TE at any lag. In conclusion, the application of TE with
      delays revealed detailed information on the fetal-maternal heart rate coupling
      strength and latency throughout gestation, which could provide novel clinical
      markers of fetal development and well-being.

TI  - DYRK1A-Related Intellectual Disability Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: DYRK1A-related intellectual disability syndrome is
      characterized by intellectual disability including impaired speech development,
      autism spectrum disorder including anxious and/or stereotypic behavior problems, 
      and microcephaly. Affected individuals often have a clinically recognizable
      phenotype including a typical facial gestalt, feeding problems, seizures,
      hypertonia, gait disturbances, and foot anomalies. The majority of affected
      individuals function in the moderate to severe range of intellectual disability; 
      however, a few individuals with mild intellectual disability have been reported. 
      About half of affected individuals develop epilepsy including atonic attacks,
      absences, and generalized myoclonic seizures. About half of affected individuals 
      develop scoliosis, kyphosis, and/or pectus excavatum. About one third have short 
      stature. Rarely, endocrine problems and dental, ophthalmologic, and/or cardiac
      anomalies are reported. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of DYRK1A-related
      intellectual disability syndrome is established in a proband by identification of
      a heterozygous pathogenic variant in DYRK1A. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Educational programs to address the specific needs identified;
      speech therapy directed at improving communication skills; occupational therapy
      for feeding problems; physical therapy for hypertonic musculature and gait
      disturbances. Routine treatment of epilepsy under the care of a neurologist.
      Standard treatment for sleep disturbances, and other medical issues (e.g.,
      orthopedic, endocrine, dental, cardiac, and ophthalmologic involvement).
      Surveillance: Monitoring and guidance as needed for educational and behavior
      problems, complications of hypertonic musculature (e.g., scoliosis, gait
      disturbances). Regular lifelong attention to nutritional status, dental hygiene, 
      heart (if a congenital anomaly is present), eyes, and vision. GENETIC COUNSELING:
      DYRK1A-related intellectual disability syndrome is inherited in an autosomal
      dominant manner. To date all affected individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., 
      a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo DYRK1A pathogenic
      variant. When the DYRK1A pathogenic variant found in the proband cannot be
      detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the risk to sibs appears to be
      very low but is presumed to be greater than that of the general population
      because of the possibility of germline mosaicism. Prenatal testing for
      pregnancies presumed to be at increased risk for DYRK1A-related intellectual
      disability syndrome is possible.

TI  - The effect of leptin concentrations and other maternal characteristics on
      gestational weight gain is different according to pre-gestational BMI: results
      from a prospective cohort.
PG  - 1804-13
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13826 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of leptin and other selected variables on
      gestational weight gain (GWG) according to pre-gestational body mass index (BMI).
      DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Public Health Center, Rio de Janeiro,
      Brazil. SAMPLE: Two hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women. METHODS: Women were 
      followed at the 5-13, 20-26 and 30-36th gestational weeks. The effects of
      independent variables on GWG in normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2) ),
      overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m(2) ) and obese (BMI >/= 30.0 kg/m(2) ) women were 
      assessed using longitudinal linear mixed-effects models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:
      Maternal body weight (kg) throughout pregnancy. RESULTS: Leptin concentrations
      were associated with GWG in normal weight (beta = 0.048, P < 0.001) and
      overweight (beta = 0.023, P = 0.048) women, but not in obese ones (beta = 0.011, 
      P = 0.308). Additionally, the number of hours slept per night decreased the
      effect of leptin on GWG in OW women (beta = -0.013, P = 0.002). The effect of
      other maternal characteristics on GWG was different depending on the BMI
      category. CONCLUSIONS: Leptin concentrations were positively associated with GWG 
      in normal weight and overweight women, but not in obese ones. Maternal height was
      associated with GWG in all BMI categories, but other variables such as sleep
      duration, QUICKI values, HDL-c, smoking habit and marital status presented
      differential effects according to BMI. We encourage further studies to
      investigate the association between leptin and gestational weight gain, taking
      into account the pre-pregnancy weight and sleep duration, in order to compare and
      confirm our results. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Leptin is associated with weight gain in
      normal weight and overweight pregnant women, but not in obese ones.

AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the effects of sleep restriction (SR) during
      pregnancy in rats. The following three groups were studied: home cage (HC
      pregnant females remained in their home cage), Sham (females were placed in tanks
      similar to the SR group but with sawdust) and SR (females were submitted to the
      multiple platform method for 20 h per day from gestational days (GD) 14 to 20).
      Plasma corticosterone after 6 days of SR was not different among the groups.
      However, the relative adrenal weight was higher in the SR group compared with the
      HC group, which suggests possible stress impact. SR during pregnancy reduces the 
      body weight of the female but no changes in liver glycogen, cholesterol and
      triglycerides, and muscle glycogen were detected. On GD 20, the fetuses of the
      females submitted to SR exhibited increased brain derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF) in the hippocampus, which indicates that sleep restriction of mothers
      during the final week of gestation may affect neuronal growth factors in a fetal 
      brain structure, in which active neurogenesis occurs during the deprivation
      period. However, no changes in the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the
      cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum of the fetuses were detected. SR females
      showed no major change in the maternal behavior, and the pups' preference for the
      mother's odor on postpartum day (PPD) 7 was not altered. On GD 20, the SR females
      exhibited increased plasma prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin (OT) compared with the HC
      and Sham groups. The negative outcomes of sleep restriction during delivery could
      be related, in part, to this hormonal imbalance. Sleep restriction during
      pregnancy induces different changes compared with the changes described in males 
      and affects both the mother and offspring.

TI  - Sleep Hygiene and Sleep Quality of Third-Trimester Pregnant Women.
PG  - 57-65
LID - 10.1002/nur.21705 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the associations of sleep
      hygiene and actigraphy measures of sleep with self-reported sleep quality in 197 
      pregnant women in northern Taiwan. Third-trimester pregnant women completed the
      Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale (SHPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)
      as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and
      wore an actigraph for 7 consecutive days. Student's t-test was used to compare
      the SHPS scores and means as well as variability of actigraphy sleep variables
      between poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score >5) and good sleepers (i.e., PSQI 
      global score </=5). Compared to good sleepers, poor sleepers reported
      significantly worse sleep hygiene, with higher SHPS scores and higher sleep
      schedule, arousal-related behavior, and sleep environment subscale scores. Poor
      sleepers had significantly greater intra-individual variability of sleep onset
      latency, total nighttime sleep, and wake after sleep onset than good sleepers. In
      stepwise linear regression, older maternal age (p = .01), fewer employment hours 
      per week (p = .01), higher CES-D total score (p < .01), and higher SHPS
      arousal-related behavior subscale scores (p < .01) predicted self-reported global
      sleep quality. Findings support avoiding physically, physiologically,
      emotionally, or cognitively arousing activities before bedtime as a target for
      sleep-hygiene intervention in women during pregnancy.

TI  - How does living with HIV impact on women's mental health? Voices from a global
      survey.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Women living with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of
      mental health issues. To date, global guidelines contain insufficient guidance on
      mental health support, particularly regarding perinatal care. The aim of this
      article is to describe the extent and impact of mental health issues as
      experienced by women living with HIV on their sexual and reproductive health and 
      human rights (SRH&HR). METHODS: A global, mixed-methods, user-led and designed
      survey on SRH&HR of women living with HIV was conducted using snowball sampling, 
      containing an optional section exploring mental health issues. Statistical
      quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation and
      multiple linear regression analysis for the mental health responses. Thematic
      analysis of open free-text responses was performed for qualitative data. RESULTS:
      A total of 832 respondents from 94 countries participated in the online survey
      with 489 responses to the optional mental health section. Of the respondents, 82%
      reported depression symptoms and 78% rejection. One-fifth reported mental health 
      issues before HIV diagnosis. Respondents reported experiencing a 3.5-fold higher 
      number of mental health issues after diagnosis (8.71 vs 2.48, t[488]=23.00,
      p<0.001). Nearly half (n=224; 45.8%) had multiple socially disadvantaged
      identities (SDIs). The number of SDIs was positively correlated with experiencing
      mental health issues (p<0.05). Women described how mental health issues affected 
      their ability to enjoy their right to sexual and reproductive health and to
      access services. These included depression, rejection and social exclusion, sleep
      problems, intersectional stigma, challenges with sexual and intimate
      relationships, substance use and sexual risk, reproductive health barriers and
      human rights (HR) violations. Respondents recommended that policymakers and
      clinicians provide psychological support and counselling, funding for peer
      support and interventions to challenge gender-based violence and to promote HR.
      CONCLUSIONS: Interventions addressing intersecting stigmas and any especial
      impacts of diagnosis during pregnancy are required to ensure women's SRH&HR.
      Global policy guidelines regarding women living with HIV must incorporate mental 
      health considerations.

AB  - This investigation was conducted to examine circadian and seasonal rhythms of
      heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) by means of hour-by-hour recordings
      over 24h in a large population of non-lactating Holstein-Friesian pregnant cows
      [N=56, summer (June-July); N=61, winter (November-December)]. Data were collected
      during a 5-day period from each animal. Besides parameters of cardiac autonomic
      function [the high-frequency (HF) component of HRV and the ratio between the
      low-frequency (LF) and the HF components (LF/HF ratio)], the RR triangular index 
      and Lmax were calculated. A clear circadian profile was observed for every
      parameter in summer. Heart rate elevated gradually with the course of the day
      from 7:00 to 17:00 o'clock and then slightly decreased from 18:00 to 6:00.
      Sympathovagal balance shifted towards sympathetic dominance during the daytime
      (increased LF/HF ratio), whereas parasympathetic activity was predominant during 
      the night (increased HF). Lmax reflected a chaotic behavior of heart rate
      fluctuations during the afternoon in summer. Decreased values of RR triangular
      index indicated a sensitive period for cows between 14:00 and 16:00 o'clock in
      summer. During winter, except for the RR triangular (RRtri) index reflecting a
      high overall variability in R-R intervals between 12:00 and 23:00 o'clock, heart 
      rate and HRV showed no periodicity over the 24-h period. The results suggest an
      impaired cardiac autonomic function during daytime in summer. HF, Lmax and RRtri 
      index showed seasonal differences for both daytime and nighttime. Heart rate was 
      higher in summer than in winter during the daytime, whereas the LF/HF ratio was
      higher in winter during the nighttime. Circadian and seasonal rhythms of
      cardiovascular function are presumably related to the differing temperature, and 
      animal activity associated with summer and winter. As all of the investigated
      parameters are commonly used in bovine HRV research, these findings have
      practical implications for behavioral, physiological and welfare studies on dairy
      cattle.

TI  - Memantine for Prophylactic Treatment of Migraine Without Aura: A Randomized
      Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study.
PG  - 95-103
LID - 10.1111/head.12732 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled studies in human have suggested that memantine might be 
      a suitable option for migraine prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and
      tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis. METHODS: This was a 12-week
      randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients
      with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to
      receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was
      the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12
      between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were
      assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We
      performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT). RESULTS:
      Twenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group 
      completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater
      reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than
      the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 
      95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P < .001). Both CC (MD, 4.9; 95%CI, 2.6-7.2 days), and ITT
      analyses (MD, 5.2; 95%CI, 2.0-8.5) showed significantly higher reduction in the
      mean number of migraine days in the memantine group than the placebo group (P <
      .01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number
      of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the
      placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep,
      depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in 
      the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and
      drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another
      patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo. CONCLUSION:
      Memantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients
      with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, 
      and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other
      antimigraine medications. The study was registered in the Iranian Registry of
      Clinical Trials (Registration number: IRCT2013120115616N1).

AB  - Depression is common in pregnancy and associated with increased risk of adverse
      effects for the neonate. Treatment and prevention options include antidepressant 
      therapy. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on safety of
      mirtazapine during pregnancy and lactation. In 31 papers a total of 390 cases of 
      neonates exposed to mirtazapine during pregnancy or lactation have been
      described. There might be an association between mirtazapine and spontaneous
      abortion, however, this might be attributable to underlying psychiatric disease. 
      An increased risk of major neonatal malformations associated with mirtazapine in 
      pregnancy has not been reported. Although one study showed a nearly significant
      increase in occurrence of respiratory problems and hypoglycaemia, no indication
      of causality could be given. No other significant adverse effects on neonates
      were reported. Limited available data, four papers on 11 exposed neonates,
      suggest that use of mirtazapine during breastfeeding is safe due to a low
      relative infant dose. High plasma levels might be associated with increased body 
      weight and sleep. However, the reported data are too scarce to come to a clear
      assessment of the risk of mirtazapine in lactation. No information is available
      on the use of mirtazapine in pregnancy and Poor Neonatal Adaptation Syndrome
      (PNAS) or neurobehavioral development at an age over one year. In conclusion,
      mirtazapine seems to be safe in pregnancy, especially regarding incidence of
      congenital malformations. There are not enough data available to come to a
      conclusion on the safety of mirtazapine during lactation.

PG  - 350-62
LID - 10.1007/s13679-015-0168-5 [doi]
AB  - A range of important early-life predictors of later obesity have been identified.
      Children of lower socioeconomic position (SEP) have a steeper weight gain
      trajectory from birth with a strong socioeconomic gradient in child and adult
      obesity prevalence. An assessment of the association between SEP and the
      early-life predictors of obesity has been lacking. The review involved a
      two-stage process: Part 1, using previously published systematic reviews, we
      developed a list of the potentially modifiable determinants of obesity observable
      in the pre-natal, peri-natal or post-natal (pre-school) periods; and part 2,
      conducting a literature review of evidence for socioeconomic patterning in the
      determinants identified in part 1. Strong evidence was found for an inverse
      relationship between SEP and (1) pre-natal risk factors (pre-pregnancy maternal
      body mass index (BMI), diabetes and pre-pregnancy diet), (2) antenatal/peri natal
      risk factors (smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight) and (3) early-life
      nutrition (including breastfeeding initiation and duration, early introduction of
      solids, maternal and infant diet quality, and some aspects of the home food
      environment), and television viewing in young children. Less strong evidence
      (because of a lack of studies for some factors) was found for paternal BMI,
      maternal weight gain during pregnancy, child sleep duration, high birth weight
      and lack of physical activity in young children. A strong socioeconomic gradient 
      exists for the majority of the early-life predictors of obesity suggesting that
      the die is cast very early in life (even pre-conception). Lifestyle interventions
      targeting disadvantaged women at or before child-bearing age may therefore be
      particularly important in reducing inequality. Given the likely challenges of
      reaching this target population, it may be that during pregnancy and their
      child's early years are more feasible windows for engagement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disease which is
      estimated to be undiagnosed to a large extent. Hence, the prevalence of OSAS in
      pregnant women is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the symptoms of obstructive sleep
      apnea in pregnant women with chronic diseases. METHODS: In the study, 97 pregnant
      women with chronic diseases and 160 healthy pregnant women were included. A form 
      questioning socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy characteristics,
      Epworth scale and the Berlin questionnaire to evaluate the risk of OSAS were
      applied to participants. RESULTS: It has been determined that 10-12.5% of healthy
      pregnant women, 34-45.4% of pregnants with chronic diseases and 20.6-23.3% of all
      pregnant women had a high risk of OSAS, the pregnants with chronic disease
      compared to healthy pregnant women had statistically significant higher risk of
      OSAS. The risk of OSAS was found to be significantly higher especially in
      pregnant women with hypertension and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: OSAS can lead to the 
      adverse consequences in pregnancy, should be questioned for all pregnants
      especially those with chronic diseases. Pregnant women with OSAS should be
      monitored more carefully in terms of diabetes and hypertension in antenatal care.

TI  - [NIGHT SHIFT WORK AND HEALTH DISORDER RISK IN FEMALE WORKERS].
PG  - 86-91
AB  - There was evaluated the risk to health in females employed in shift work,
      including night shifts. According to the data of periodical medical examinations 
      health indices of 403 females employed in shift work, including night shifts,
      were compared with indices of 205 females--workers of administrative units of the
      same enterprise. Overall relative risk (RR) for the health disorder associated
      with the night shift was 1.2 (95%; confidence interval (CI): 1.09-1.28). A
      statistically significant increase in risk was observed in relation to uterine
      fibroids (OR 1.3; 95% CI: 1.06-1.54), mastopathy (OR 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.6),
      inorganic sleep disorders (OR 8.8; 95% CI 2.6-29.8). At the boundary of the
      statistical significance there was the increase in the risk for obesity (OR 1.2; 
      95% C: 0.97-1.39), hypertension (OR 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5) and endometriosis (OR
      1.5; 95% CI: 0.98-2.16). There was revealed an adverse effect of night shifts on 
      the gestation course: ectopic pregnancy in the experimental group occurred 6.6
      times more frequently than in the control group (95% CI: 0.87-50.2), and
      spontaneous abortion--1.7 times (95% CI: 0.95-3.22). The performed study has once
      again confirmed the negative impact of smoking on women's reproductive health:
      smoking women in the experimental group compared with the control group smokers
      had 2.7 times increased risk of uterine fibroids (within 1.06-7.0), the risk in
      non-smokers was significantly lower--1.2 (0.98-1.4). The findings suggest about a
      wide range of health problems related to employment on shift work, including
      night shifts, which indicates to the need for adoption of regulatory and
      preventive measures aimed to this professional group.

LID - S1808-8694(15)00159-7 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a controversy concerning the terminology and definition of
      rhinitis in pregnancy. Gestational rhinitis is a relatively common condition,
      which has drawn increasing interest in recent years due to a possible association
      with maternal obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and unfavorable fetal
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To review the current knowledge on gestational rhinitis, and
      to assess its evidence. METHODS: Structured literature search. RESULTS:
      Gestational rhinitis and rhinitis "during pregnancy" are somewhat similar
      conditions regarding their physiopathology and treatment, but differ regarding
      definition and prognosis. Hormonal changes have a presumed etiological role, but 
      knowledge about the physiopathology of gestational rhinitis is still lacking.
      Management of rhinitis during pregnancy focuses on the minimal intervention
      required for symptom relief. CONCLUSION: As it has a great impact on maternal
      quality of life, both the otorhinolaryngologist and the obstetrician must be
      careful concerning the early diagnosis and treatment of gestational rhinitis,
      considering the safety of treatment measures and drugs and their current level of
      evidence.

TI  - [Profile dipper/non-dipper in patient with severe preeclampsia, eclampsia and
      HELLP syndrome during pregnancy and puerperium].
PG  - 477-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) has a circadian rhythm, decreases at night and
      increases in the morning (dipper), have been observed in patients with impaired
      in this profile, increased at night and lower in the morning (no dipper) have
      increased cardiovascular risk. Preeclampsia-eclampsia complicates about 7% of
      pregnancies, preeclampsia is known to reverse the normal circadian cycle of the
      BP. OBJECTIVE: To determine the profile dipper/non-dipper in patients with severe
      preeclampsia, eclampsia and HELLP syndrome patients in Intensive Care and
      Obstetrics Hospital Juarez of Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 15 patients were
      reviewed, 10 with severe preeclampsia, 4 with HELLP syndrome and 1 eclampsia,
      systolic, diastolic, mean and pulse PA were analyzed during the day/night and
      pregnancy/postpartum. Using ratios pregnancy day/night pregnancy, puerperium
      day/night postpartum dipper/non-dipper profile is determined RESULTS: Maternal
      age 30 +/- 6.34 years, 7 primiparous (46%) 8 multiparous (54%), pregnancy was
      31.67 +/- 4.59 weeks. In all but two results in the ratio of pulse pressure
      during pregnancy was not the result dipper raiser and did not change during the
      postpartum period. CONCLUSION: in all patients during pregnancy profile was
      observed no dipper no change during the postpartum period. The established
      treatment did not modify this result. So it is appropriate to establish
      strategies to change this behavior and try to get the patient to regain normal
      circadian BP rhythm.

TI  - Predictors of Antenatal Psychosocial Stress in Taiwanese Women.
PG  - 193-200
LID - 10.1097/jnr.0000000000000122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal stress has been associated with adverse outcomes in mothers
      and their children. However, little research has been conducted to identify the
      factors associated with psychosocial stress in pregnant women. PURPOSE: This
      study explored the predictors of psychosocial stress during pregnancy. METHODS: A
      convenience sample of 136 second-trimester and 164 third-trimester pregnant women
      were recruited from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Data were collected
      using a demographic form, Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), Edinburgh
      Prenatal Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Maternal-Fetal
      Attachment Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List. RESULTS: The results
      of this study found positive correlations between PSRS and both Edinburgh
      Prenatal Depression Scale (r = .368, p < .01) and Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale
      (r = .168, p < .01) and negative correlations between PSRS and both gravidity (r 
      = -.137, p < .05) and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (r = -.266, p < .01).
      Higher pregnancy stress was predicted by depression, lower social support,
      maternal-fetal attachment, and primigravid status, which together explained 20%
      of the total variance. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Depression, social 
      support, maternal-fetal attachment, and gravidity are discrete predictive factors
      of psychosocial stress in pregnant women. These findings add to existing
      knowledge of the factors associated with prenatal stress. Future research should 
      include depression in a support model of antenatal stress management.

AB  - REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify, appraise 
      and synthesize the best available studies exploring parents' experiences of
      transition when their infants are discharged from the Neonatal Intensive Care
      Unit (NICU).The review questions are: BACKGROUND: Giving birth to a premature or 
      sick infant is a stressful event for parents. The parents' presence and
      participation in the care of the infant is fundamental to reduce this stress and 
      to provide optimal care for both the premature or sick infant and family. A full 
      term pregnancy is estimated to last between 37 and 40 weeks. Preterm infants born
      before 28 week (5.1%) are defined as extremely preterm, while those who are born 
      between 28 to 31 weeks (10.3%) are defined as very preterm. The majority of the
      preterm (84.1%) are born between 32 to 37 week and may have significant medical
      problems requiring prolonged hospitalization.The prevalence of preterm birth is
      increasing worldwide. More than one in ten babies are born preterm annually. This
      is equal to 15 million preterm infants born globally and the second largest
      direct cause of deaths in children below five. The highest rates of preterm birth
      are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (more than 60%) and the lowest rates are
      in Northern Africa, Western Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The preterm
      birth rates in the developing countries vary widely and follow a different
      pattern than in high income countries.The preterm birth rate has increased
      between 1990 and 2010 with an average of 0.8% annually in almost all countries.
      Morbidity among critically ill newborn and preterm infants vary widely from no
      late effects to severe complications, such as visual or hearing impairment,
      chronic lung disease, growth failure in infancy and specific learning
      impairments, dyslexia and reduced academic achievement. Full term infants may
      also experience significant health problems requiring neonatal intensive care.
      The most common reasons for a full term infant to be admitted to a NICU after
      birth are temperature instability, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress,
      hyperbilirubinemia and neonatal mortality. Admission of a full term newborn
      infant from home within the first four weeks after birth is due to jaundice,
      dehydration, respiratory complications, feeding difficulties, urinary tract
      infection, diarrhea and meningitis.In the last two to three decades,
      technological advances in neonatalogy have improved the survival rates of
      critically ill and preterm infants.Two major issues have influenced the design of
      the NICU wards: i) the increased volume of preterm infants with extremely low
      gestational age who need neonatalogy assistance, and ii) the impact of the
      parents' presence in the NICU to support the infant's development.The health
      status of preterm babies can have a significant impact on the family wellbeing
      and function. The separation between the preterm infant and the parents is a
      threat to the attachment and bonding process. Worldwide, there has been a
      paradigm shift in the NICUs over the last decade, inviting parents to be admitted
      together with the infant or at least to spend most of the day together with their
      critical ill and preterm infant in the NICU. Parental involvement increases the
      performing of Kangaroo Mother Care during the admission in the NICU and increases
      parental preparedness for discharge to home. This change prepares the parents to 
      take over tasks such as nurturing and feeding. The parents are the most important
      caregivers for the infant during the admission in the NICU and their co-admission
      increases the bonding and prepare the parents for the transition discharged to
      home.Family centered care (FCC) based on a partnership between families and
      professionals is described as essential in current research on neonatal care.
      Family centered care is facilitated by parental involvement, communication based 
      on mutuality and respect, and unrestricted parental presence in the NICU.
      According to Mikkelsen and Frederiksen, the central attribute of FCC is
      partnership with the core value of mutuality and common goals.A NICU is a
      high-tech setting where highly specialized professionals care for premature or
      critically ill infants. During the infants' hospitalization, the relationship
      between parents and nurses evolves through an interchange of roles and
      responsibilities. However, this collaboration is challenging due to a discrepancy
      between parents' and nurses' expectations of their roles.To facilitate parents'
      skin-to-skin contact and involvement in their infant's care, NICUs are now
      redesigned to facilitate parents' "24-hour" presence, also called "rooming-in".
      Seporo et al. describes several benefits with "rooming-in" the NICUs. Staying in 
      the same room increases infants' and parents' possibility for "skin-to-skin
      care". This improves the infant's sleep time and temperature regulation,
      decreased crying and need for oxygen, increases parental confidence and positive 
      infant-parent interaction. Parents' experience of "skin-to-skin care" and
      "rooming in" may help parents to be acquainted with their infant and thus prepare
      for the transition to home. However, despite these positive effects of
      rooming-in, some negative effects, e.g. less sleep and lack of privacy, have been
      described by parents who have stayed with their child in a pediatric unit.The
      hospitalization may challenge the normal attachment process and parents'
      confidence as caregivers; parents' preparation for bringing the infant home is
      thus essential. The infant's discharge from the NICU is experienced as a moment
      of mixed feelings. Going home is a happy event, but at the same time it is
      combined with parental anxiety. Parents' pervasive uncertainty, medical concerns 
      and adjustment to the new parental and partner-adjustment role are common
      concerns. To make parents confident and prepared for taking their infant home
      tailored information, guidance and hands-on experience caring for their infant
      before discharge is crucial.During the literature research we became aware of a
      systematic narrative review protocol by Parascandolo et al.'s concerning nurses',
      midwives', doctors' and parents' experiences of the preterm infants' discharge to
      home. The aim of our comprehensive review is to perform a metasynthesis on
      parents' perspectives and their experiences of transition from discharge from
      NICU to home. We will include qualitative primary studies to offer a deeper
      understanding of the parent perspective.

TI  - Do psychosocial sleep interventions improve infant sleep or maternal mood in the 
      postnatal period? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled 
      trials.

AB  - Sleep complaints are common amongst mothers of infants and insufficient,
      inefficient or fragmented sleep is associated with postnatal depression. The aim 
      of this review is to determine whether psychosocial sleep-focused interventions
      offered in the perinatal period improve infant sleep or maternal mood. We
      searched PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE and CINAHL with no date restriction. We
      reviewed 1097 articles, resulting in nine papers (n = 1,656) that fit the
      eligibility criteria for inclusion in the analyses. The primary outcome was
      infant sleep, defined as maternal reports of infant nocturnal total sleep time
      and number of night-time wakes. The secondary outcome was maternal mood. The
      meta-analysis indicated improvements in reported infant nocturnal total sleep
      time (Hedge's g = 0.204, p < 0.01). However, there was no evidence for reducing
      infant night wakes (Hedge's g = 0.103, p = 0.134). There was evidence of maternal
      mood improvements (Hedge's g = 0.152, p = 0.014), however, this could have been
      influenced by publication bias. Psychosocial sleep interventions appear to impact
      the amount of sleep that a mother reports her baby to have, although the infants 
      continue to wake as frequently. More research is needed to confirm whether
      sleep-related improvements can translate into improvements in maternal mood.

TI  - 1q21.1 Recurrent Microdeletion
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The 1q21.1 recurrent microdeletion itself does not
      appear to lead to a clinically recognizable syndrome as some persons with the
      deletion have no obvious clinical findings and others have variable findings that
      most commonly include microcephaly (50%), mild intellectual disability (30%),
      mildly dysmorphic facial features, and eye abnormalities (26%). Other findings
      can include cardiac defects, genitourinary anomalies, skeletal malformations, and
      seizures (~15%). Psychiatric and behavioral abnormalities can include autism
      spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autistic features, 
      and sleep disturbances. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The distal 1.35-Mb 1q21.1 recurrent
      microdeletion can be detected by any number of molecular methods that determine
      the copy number of sequences within the deleted region, including chromosomal
      microarray analysis (CMA) using oligonucleotides or polymorphic DNA markers
      (i.e., SNPs). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis may be used to
      test relatives of a proband known to have this deletion. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Routine treatment of ophthalmologic, cardiac, and neurologic
      findings; speech, occupational, and physical therapies as appropriate;
      specialized learning programs to meet individual needs; antiepileptic drugs or
      antipsychotic medications as needed. Surveillance: Routine pediatric care;
      routine developmental assessments; monitoring of specific identified medical
      issues. GENETIC COUNSELING: The recurrent distal 1.35-Mb 1q21.1 microdeletion is 
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Between 18% and 50% of deletions occur
      de novo. The microdeletion can be inherited from either parent; a parent with the
      microdeletion may show a normal phenotype or an abnormal phenotype that is
      similar to but usually less severe than that of his/her child. Recurrence risk
      for future pregnancies for parents who do not have the microdeletion is low
      (probably <1%) but greater than that of the general population because of the
      possibility of germline mosaicism.

TI  - Mild Depressive Symptoms During the Third Trimester of Pregnancy Are Associated
      with Disruptions in Daily Rhythms but Not Subjective Sleep Quality.
PG  - 594-8
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2015.5404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research in major depressive disorder suggests that
      dysregulation of the circadian system may be a core pathophysiological component.
      In pregnancy, women often experience significant disruptions in their daily
      rhythms, including changes in day-to-day schedule and sleep habits. Current
      evidence suggests that these disruptions in daily rhythms may adversely affect
      underlying circadian rhythmicity. The purpose of our study was to examine whether
      subjectively rated daily rhythm disruptions were associated with a greater
      incidence of depressive symptoms during the third trimester. METHOD: Our study
      was a cross-sectional design, assessing sleep quality, symptoms of depression,
      and daily rhythm disruptions in 51 pregnant women in their third trimester.
      RESULTS: We observed a significant relationship between mild depressive symptoms 
      and disruptions in daily rhythms. While we initially observed a strong
      correlation between subjective sleep quality and depressive symptoms, this was
      attenuated after accounting for daily rhythm disruptions. Disruptions in daily
      social rhythms, eating patterns, and general activity were all significantly
      associated with depressive symptomatology. CONCLUSION: Our findings point to a
      strong correlation between daily rhythm disruptions and prenatal depressive
      symptoms. Given that these daily rhythms are known to act as zeitgebers,
      longitudinal studies examining the directionality of this relationship between
      circadian rhythms and depressive symptoms during pregnancy are warranted.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial to compare sleep and wake in preterm infants less
      than 32weeks of gestation receiving two different modes of non-invasive
      respiratory support.

AB  - AIM: To determine whether respiratory support via heated humidified high flow
      nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) results in infants <32weeks gestation spending a greater 
      proportion of time in sleep compared to those receiving nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (NCPAP). METHODS: A subgroup of infants enrolled in a randomized 
      controlled trial to compare HHHFNC or NCPAP post-extubation had sleep and wake
      activity measured by actigraphy for 72hours post-extubation. Activity diaries
      were completed contemporaneously to record episodes of infant handling.
      Actigraphy data were downloaded with known periods of handling excluded from the 
      analysis. RESULTS: 28 infants with mean gestation of 28.3weeks (SD 2) and birth
      weight 1074g (SD 371) were studied. Infants receiving HHHFNC spent a lesser
      proportion of time in sleep 59.8% (SD 18.5) than those on NCPAP 82.2% (SD 23.8)
      p=0.004. Infants receiving HHHFNC had a lower sleep efficiency and higher mean
      activity score than those on NCPAP (p=0.003, p=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: 
      Infants receiving HHHFNC had a higher mean activity score and spent less time in 
      sleep than those allocated NCPAP. Further study of sleep wake activity in preterm
      infants receiving respiratory support is required as this may impact on
      neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine: (1) the prevalence and characteristics of bed-sharing
      among non-Hispanic Black and White infants in Georgia, and (2) differences in
      bed-sharing and sleep position behaviors prior to and after the American Academy 
      of Pediatrics' 2005 recommendations against bed-sharing. METHODS: Georgia
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were obtained from the
      Georgia Department of Public Health. Analysis was guided by the socioecological
      model levels of: Infant, Maternal, Family, and Community/Society within the
      context of race. Data from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to address the first
      objective and from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2011 to address the second objective.
      Rao-Scott Chi square tests and backward selection unconditional logistic
      regression models for weighted data were built separately by race; odds ratios
      (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of
      6595 (3528 Black and 3067 White) cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2011.
      Significantly more Black mothers (81.9 %) reported "ever" bed-sharing compared to
      White mothers (56 %), p < 0.001. Logistic regression results indicated that the
      most parsimonious model included variables from all socioecological levels. For
      Blacks, the final model included infant age, pregnancy intention, number of
      dependents, and use of Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Services. For Whites, the
      final model included infant age, maternal age, financial stress, partner-related 
      stress, and WIC. When comparing the period 2000-2004 to 2006-2011, a total of
      10,015 (5373 Black and 4642 White cases) were analyzed. A significant decrease in
      bedsharing was found for both Blacks and Whites; rates of non-supine sleep
      position decreased significantly for Blacks but not Whites. CONCLUSIONS FOR
      PRACTICE: Continued high rates of bed-sharing and non-supine sleep position for
      both Blacks and Whites demonstrate an ongoing need for safe infant sleep
      messaging. Risk profiles for Black and White mothers differed, suggesting the
      importance of tailored messaging. Specific research and practice implications are
      identified and described.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The circadian clock plays an important role in several aspects of
      female reproductive biology. Evidence linking circadian clock-related genes to
      pregnancy outcomes has been inconsistent. We sought to examine whether variations
      in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of circadian clock genes are associated
      with PA risk. METHODS: Maternal blood samples were collected from 470 PA case and
      473 controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip
      platform. We examined 119 SNPs in 13 candidate genes known to control circadian
      rhythms (e.g., CRY2, ARNTL, and RORA). Univariate and penalized logistic
      regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs); and the combined effect
      of multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score
      (wGRS). RESULTS: A common SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 
      21% reduced odds of PA (P < 0.05). The odds of PA increased with increasing wGRS 
      (Ptrend < 0.001). The corresponding ORs were 1.00, 1.83, 2.81 and 5.13 across
      wGRS quartiles. Participants in the highest wGRS quartile had a 5.13-fold (95%
      confidence interval: 3.21-8.21) higher odds of PA compared to those in the lowest
      quartile. Although the test for interaction was not significant, the odds of PA
      was substantially elevated for preeclamptics with the highest wGRS quartile (OR =
      14.44, 95%CI: 6.62-31.53) compared to normotensive women in the lowest wGRS
      quartile. DISCUSSION: Genetic variants in circadian rhythm genes may be
      associated with PA risk. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings 
      and to further elucidate the pathogenesis of this important obstetrical
      complication.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test the efficacy and safety of
      intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in pregnant women with restless legs
      syndrome (RLS) and iron deficiency or anemia. The open-label pilot study
      (exploratory) was performed at the University Hospital of Zurich and the
      Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland (Lugano). PATIENT AND METHODS: Nineteen women
      in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-to-severe RLS and serum
      ferritin levels <35 microg/l or hemoglobin (Hb) < 11.0 g/dl were included in the 
      study. RLS was graded according to the International Restless Legs Syndrome
      (IRLS) Study Group rating scale. All participants had a score of >/=20 or had RLS
      >/=3 times/week. Based on the Hb levels, 500 or 700 mg of FCM was administered
      over 20 min. The primary end point was a >/= 50% reduction in the mean IRLS score
      one week after FCM infusion. The secondary end points included periodic limb
      movements (PLMs; assessed using nocturnal foot actigraphy), sleep quality
      (assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and safety. RESULTS: The
      IRLS score decreased from 23 +/- 7 (baseline) to 13 +/- 7 (P <0.01), whereas the 
      PLM index decreased from 35 +/- 26 (baseline) to 25 +/- 20 (P <0.001).
      Significant improvement in sleep quality was also reported (P <0.029), and
      treatment was well tolerated. Three serious adverse events were reported, but
      they were considered unrelated to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide
      promising evidence on the safety and efficacy of FCM for moderate-to-severe RLS
      in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia. Therefore, a future
      placebo-controlled study is warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Controversies exist regarding the impact of co-sleeping on infant
      sleep quality. In this context, the current study examined: (a) the differences
      in objective and subjective sleep patterns between co-sleeping (mostly
      room-sharing) and solitary sleeping mother-infant dyads; (b) the predictive links
      between maternal sleep during pregnancy and postnatal sleeping arrangement; (c)
      the bi-directional prospective associations between sleeping arrangement and
      infant/maternal sleep quality at three and six months postpartum. METHODS: The
      sample included 153 families recruited during pregnancy. Data were obtained in
      home settings during the third trimester of pregnancy and at three and six months
      postpartum. Mothers were asked to monitor their own sleep and their infants'
      sleep for five nights using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Questionnaires were
      used to assess sleeping arrangements, feeding methods, socio-demographic
      characteristics, and maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Mothers
      of co-sleeping infants reported more infant night-wakings than mothers of
      solitary sleeping infants. However, none of the objective sleep measures was
      significantly different between co-sleeping and solitary sleeping infants, after 
      controlling for feeding techniques. Co-sleeping mothers had significantly more
      objective and subjective sleep disturbances than mothers in the solitary sleeping
      group. Moreover, poorer maternal sleep during pregnancy and at three months
      postpartum predicted higher levels of co-sleeping at six months. CONCLUSION:
      Mothers of co-sleeping infants report more infant night-wakings, and experience
      poorer sleep than mothers of solitary sleeping infants. The quality of maternal
      sleep should be taken into clinical consideration when parents consult about
      co-sleeping.

TI  - Maternal anxiety versus depressive disorders: specific relations to infants'
      crying, feeding and sleeping problems.
PG  - 231-45
LID - 10.1111/cch.12292 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal depression has been associated with excessive infant crying,
      feeding and sleeping problems, but the specificity of maternal depression, as
      compared with maternal anxiety remains unclear and manifest disorders prior to
      pregnancy have been widely neglected. In this prospective longitudinal study, the
      specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to,
      during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems
      were investigated in the context of maternal parity. METHODS: In the Maternal
      Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 primiparous and
      multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16
      months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for
      Women (CIDI-V) to assess DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on 
      excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n = 286 
      mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby-DIPS).
      RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed syndrome-specific risk constellations 
      for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy:
      Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety
      disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first-time
      mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and
      comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower
      birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal
      depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Primiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to
      anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an
      escalation of mother-infant interactions. The relation between maternal
      depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission
      of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily
      structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to
      pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice.

PG  - 521-6
AB  - The aim of this study was to observe the influence of interfered circadian rhythm
      on pregnancy of rats and growth of neonatal rats, and to explore the relationship
      between the interfered circadian rhythm and the changes of melatonin and
      progesterone. Continuous light was used to inhibit melatonin secretion and
      therefore the interfered circadian rhythm animal model was obtained. The
      influence of interfered circadian rhythm on delivery of pregnant rats was
      observed. Serum was collected from rats during different stages of pregnancy to
      measure the concentrations of melatonin and progesterone. In order to observe the
      embryo resorption rate, half of pregnant rats were randomly selected to undergo a
      laparotomy, and the remainder was used to observe delivery and assess the growth 
      of neonatal rats after delivery. The results showed that the interfered circadian
      rhythm induced adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes, including an increase of
      embryo resorption rate and a decrease in the number of live births; inhibited the
      secretion of melatonin along with decreased serum progesterone level; prolonged
      the stage of labor, but not the duration of pregnancy; and disturbed the fetal
      intrauterine growth and the growth of neonatal rats. The results suggest that
      interfered circadian rhythm condition made by continuous light could make adverse
      effects on both pregnant rats and neonatal rats. The results of our study may
      provide a way to modulate pregnant women's circadian rhythm and a possibility of 
      application of melatonin on pregnant women.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by unpleasant sensations mainly in 
      the legs. 43% of RLS-associated conditions have also been associated with
      systemic iron deficiency. The objective of this study was to review in the
      literature the relationship between iron metabolism and RLS. With an initial
      search using the keywords combination "Iron Metabolism OR Iron Deficiency AND
      Restless Legs Syndrome," 145 articles were screened, and 20 articles were
      selected. Few studies were found for this review in the period of 2001-2014,
      however, the correlation between RLS and iron was evident.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome and pregnancy: prevalence, possible pathophysiological
      mechanisms and treatment.
PG  - 320-9
LID - 10.1111/ane.12520 [doi]
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder that may be associated
      with pregnancy. Studies have found that the prevalence of RLS among pregnant
      women ranged from 10 to 34%. Typically, there is complete remission of symptoms
      soon after parturition; however, in some patients, they may continue postpartum. 
      RLS has been shown to be associated with a number of complications in pregnancy
      including preeclampsia and increased incidence of Cesarean sections. Although
      multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, each
      individual hypothesis cannot completely explain the whole pathogenesis. Present
      understanding suggests that a strong family history, low serum iron and ferritin 
      level, and high estrogen level during pregnancy might play important roles.
      Vitamin D deficiency and calcium metabolism may also play a role. Medical
      treatment of RLS during pregnancy is difficult and challenging considering the
      risks to mother and fetus. However, in some cases, the disease may be severe
      enough to require treatment.

PG  - 294

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, there is considerable evidence of a relationship
      between the sensorimotor disorder restless legs syndrome (RLS) and pain
      disorders, including migraine and fibromyalgia. An association between multi-site
      pain and RLS has been reported in adult women. In the current study, we explored 
      the association between musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and RLS in a large cohort of
      young adults. METHODS: Twenty two year olds (n = 1072), followed since birth of
      part of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, provided data on
      MSK pain (duration, severity, frequency, number of pain sites). RLS was
      considered present when 4 diagnostic criteria recommended by the International
      Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were met (urge to move, dysaesthesia, relief
      by movement, worsening symptoms during the evening/night) and participants had
      these symptoms at least 5 times per month. Associations between MSK pain and RLS 
      were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression with bias-corrected
      bootstrapped confidence intervals, with final models adjusted for sex,
      psychological distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: The prevalence of RLS was 3.0 
      % and MSK pain was reported by 37.4 % of the participants. In multivariable
      logistic regression models, strong associations were found between RLS-diagnosis 
      and long duration (three months or more) of MSK pain (odds ratio 3.6, 95 %
      confidence interval 1.4-9.2) and reporting three or more pain sites (4.9,
      1.6-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Different dimensions of MSK pain were associated with RLS
      in young adults, suggestive of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Overlap
      between these conditions requires more clinical and research attention.

TI  - Perinatal Risk Factors Associated with the Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in
      School-Aged Children Born Preterm.
PG  - 737-42
LID - 10.5665/sleep.5618 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is more prevalent
      in ex-preterm children compared to the general pediatric population. However, it 
      is unknown whether OSAS in ex-preterm children is associated with specific
      perinatal risk factors. This multicenter cohort study aimed to determine
      perinatal factors associated with OSAS at school age. METHODS: 197 ex-preterm
      (500-1,250 g) children aged 5-12 y who participated as neonates in a
      double-blind, randomized clinical trial of caffeine versus placebo (Caffeine for 
      Apnea of Prematurity) underwent comprehensive ambulatory polysomnography. A
      negative binomial regression model was used to identify perinatal risk factors
      associated with OSAS. RESULTS: 19 children had OSAS (9.6%). Chorioamnionitis and 
      multiple gestation were positively associated with OSAS with P values of 0.014
      and 0.03, respectively. Maternal white race (P = 0.047) and maternal age (P =
      0.002) were negatively associated with OSAS. Other risk factors, such as birth
      weight, Apgar score at 5 min, antenatal corticosteroids, delivery route, and sex 
      were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: OSAS is very frequent, and is associated with 
      chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation in ex-preterm children. Those born to
      older white mothers appear to be protected. We speculate that the former may be
      due to systemic inflammation and the latter to a higher socio-economic status.

TI  - The Psychological and Medical Factors Associated With Untreated Binge Eating
      Disorder.
LID - 10.4088/PCC.14r01732 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although binge eating disorder (BED) is the most prevalent eating
      disorder, the impact of untreated BED is underappreciated. This review describes 
      the relationship of BED to physical and mental health, quality of life, and
      functionality. DATA SOURCES: PubMed searches were conducted on March 21, 2014;
      searches were limited to English-language research articles, meta-analyses, and
      reviews published between January 1, 2003 and March 21, 2014. Search terms
      included (binge eating OR binge-eating OR binge eating disorder) AND
      (cardiovascular OR metabolic OR metabolic syndrome OR gastrointestinal OR health 
      OR rehabilitation OR recovery OR sleep OR pregnancy OR quality of life OR
      functional impairment OR activities of daily living OR QoL OR SF-12 OR ED-5D OR
      SF-36 OR psychosocial OR depressive OR anxiety OR self-esteem OR suicidality OR
      suicide OR productivity OR family). STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Of 326
      identified publications, 43 were relevant to the topic and reported on the
      association of BED with psychiatric and medical comorbidities, quality of life,
      and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Individuals diagnosed with BED have increased
      rates of mental health comorbidities (eg, depression and anxiety) and more
      pronounced medical impairments (eg, cardiovascular disorders) compared with
      individuals without BED. BED is also associated with functional impairment and
      reduced quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Binge eating disorder is associated with
      impairments in physical and mental health, which can decrease quality of life and
      functionality and lead to increased health care utilization and decreased
      productivity. However, some caution is warranted in interpreting these findings
      because it remains unclear whether BED is an antecedent condition, a complication
      associated with a comorbid psychiatric condition, or an unrelated feature that
      occurs concurrently with these comorbidities and impairments. Much of the
      research on BED is based on observational or epidemiologic studies. Controlled
      studies are needed to clearly define the long-term impairments associated with
      BED.

TI  - Family Violence and Maltreatment of Women During the Perinatal Period:
      Associations with Infant Morbidity in Indian Slum Communities.
PG  - 149-57
LID - 10.1007/s10995-015-1814-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of non-violent, gender-based forms of
      maltreatment of women by husbands and in-laws [i.e., gender-based household
      maltreatment (GBHM)] during pregnancy and postpartum; to clarify the role of GBHM
      in compromising infant health, and whether this role extends beyond that
      previously observed for intimate partner violence (IPV). METHODS:
      Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15-35) seeking
      immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health
      centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess
      associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and
      recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and
      vomiting). RESULTS: More than one in four women (28.4%) reported IPV during their
      recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6% reported perinatal
      violence from in-laws, and 49.0% reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In
      adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and
      maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant
      morbidity (AORs 1.4-1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict
      infant morbidity in models including GBHM. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that
      non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation,
      deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more
      strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from
      husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to
      expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent
      forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.

TI  - Self-reported sleep in late pregnancy in relation to birth size and fetal
      distress: the E Moe, Mama prospective cohort study.
PG  - e008910
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008910 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore associations between features of sleep during pregnancy
      and adverse outcomes for the infant. SETTING: E Moe, Mama is a cohort study in
      Aotearoa/New Zealand that investigates self-reported sleep and maternal health in
      late pregnancy and the postpartum period. PARTICIPANTS: Women (N=633; 194 Maori) 
      reported detailed information on their sleep duration, quality, disturbances,
      disorders (snoring, breathing pauses, twitching legs, restless legs) and daytime 
      sleepiness between 35 and 37 weeks gestation. OUTCOME MEASURES: Birthweight and
      fetal distress during labour were extracted from medical records. Associations
      between each sleep variable and small or large for gestational age (SGA/LGA)
      using customised birthweight centile or fetal distress were estimated using
      multinomial/logistic regression, controlling for potential confounders. Secondary
      analyses considered differences in associations between Maori and non-Maori
      women. RESULTS: There was some indication that breathing pauses (a measure of
      sleep apnoea) were associated with both SGA (OR 2.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 9.0, p=0.08)
      and LGA (OR 2.0, 95% CI 0.7 to 5.7, p=0.20), with the association for LGA being
      stronger when only pregnancy-onset breathing pauses were considered (OR 3.5, 95% 
      CI 1.3 to 9.6, p=0.01). There was also some evidence that pregnancy-onset leg
      twitching (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 10.0, p=0.03) and frequent sleep disturbance due
      to feeling too hot or too cold (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.6, p=0.13) were
      associated with higher risk of fetal distress. Other sleep measures, including
      snoring, were not associated with SGA, LGA or fetal distress. Many of the
      associations we observed were considerably stronger in Maori compared with
      non-Maori women. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence of previously reported
      associations between snoring and SGA. Our findings tentatively suggest that
      self-reported breathing pauses and leg twitching in late pregnancy are associated
      with infant outcomes, and highlight ethnic inequalities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Childhood abuse is associated with increased risks of adult
      psychiatric disorders and physical health conditions. Mounting evidence documents
      associations of childhood abuse with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, to
      date, no study has evaluated associations of childhood abuse and sleep
      disturbances among pregnant women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included
      634 pregnant Peruvian women. To collect information regarding socio-demographic
      characteristics, history of childhood abuse, and complaints of sleep
      disturbances, face-to-face interviews were conducted with women in early
      pregnancy. Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST-S) and the Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-S), translated from English to Spanish, were used to
      assess stress-related sleep disturbance and sleep quality, respectively. Logistic
      regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Women who experienced any childhood abuse had a
      1.65-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 1.65; 95% CI:
      1.15-2.38) and 2.11-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality during early
      pregnancy (aOR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.35-3.30) as compared with women who reported no 
      abuse. Women who reported both physical and sexual abuse during childhood were
      more than twice as likely to suffer from stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 
      2.26; 95% CI: 1.44-3.53) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.45-4.09)
      in comparison to women who reported no childhood abuse. CONCLUSIONS: A history of
      childhood abuse is associated with increased odds of stress-related sleep
      disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. These findings, if
      replicated, should be used to inform the development of trauma-informed care for 
      such sleep disturbances induced by childhood trauma.

TI  - Interventions for preventing and treating low-back and pelvic pain during
      pregnancy.
PG  - CD001139
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD001139.pub4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain and
      almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The two conditions may occur separately 
      or together (low-back and pelvic pain) and typically increase with advancing
      pregnancy, interfering with work, daily activities and sleep. OBJECTIVES: To
      update the evidence assessing the effects of any intervention used to prevent and
      treat low-back pain, pelvic pain or both during pregnancy. SEARCH METHODS: We
      searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (to 19 January 2015), and the
      Cochrane Back Review Groups' (to 19 January 2015) Trials Registers, identified
      relevant studies and reviews and checked their reference lists. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment, or combination of
      treatments, to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of low-back pain,
      pelvic pain or both, related functional disability, sick leave and adverse
      effects during pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors
      independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and 
      checked them for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included 34 RCTs examining 5121
      pregnant women, aged 16 to 45 years and, when reported, from 12 to 38 weeks'
      gestation. Fifteen RCTs examined women with low-back pain (participants = 1847); 
      six examined pelvic pain (participants = 889); and 13 examined women with both
      low-back and pelvic pain (participants = 2385). Two studies also investigated
      low-back pain prevention and four, low-back and pelvic pain prevention. Diagnoses
      ranged from self-reported symptoms to clinicians' interpretation of specific
      tests. All interventions were added to usual prenatal care and, unless noted,
      were compared with usual prenatal care. The quality of the evidence ranged from
      moderate to low, raising concerns about the confidence we could put in the
      estimates of effect. For low-back painResults from meta-analyses provided
      low-quality evidence (study design limitations, inconsistency) that any
      land-based exercise significantly reduced pain (standardised mean difference
      (SMD) -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to -0.25; participants = 645;
      studies = seven) and functional disability (SMD -0.56; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23;
      participants = 146; studies = two). Low-quality evidence (study design
      limitations, imprecision) also suggested no significant differences in the number
      of women reporting low-back pain between group exercise, added to information
      about managing pain, versus usual prenatal care (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% CI
      0.80 to 1.17; participants = 374; studies = two). For pelvic painResults from a
      meta-analysis provided low-quality evidence (study design limitations,
      imprecision) of no significant difference in the number of women reporting pelvic
      pain between group exercise, added to information about managing pain, and usual 
      prenatal care (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23; participants = 374; studies = two). 
      For low-back and pelvic painResults from meta-analyses provided moderate-quality 
      evidence (study design limitations) that: an eight- to 12-week exercise program
      reduced the number of women who reported low-back and pelvic pain (RR 0.66; 95%
      CI 0.45 to 0.97; participants = 1176; studies = four); land-based exercise, in a 
      variety of formats, significantly reduced low-back and pelvic pain-related sick
      leave (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.94; participants = 1062; studies = two).The
      results from a number of individual studies, incorporating various other
      interventions, could not be pooled due to clinical heterogeneity. There was
      moderate-quality evidence (study design limitations or imprecision) from
      individual studies suggesting that osteomanipulative therapy significantly
      reduced low-back pain and functional disability, and acupuncture or craniosacral 
      therapy improved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Evidence from
      individual studies was largely of low quality (study design limitations,
      imprecision), and suggested that pain and functional disability, but not sick
      leave, were significantly reduced following a multi-modal intervention (manual
      therapy, exercise and education) for low-back and pelvic pain.When reported,
      adverse effects were minor and transient. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is
      low-quality evidence that exercise (any exercise on land or in water), may reduce
      pregnancy-related low-back pain and moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting 
      that any exercise improves functional disability and reduces sick leave more than
      usual prenatal care. Evidence from single studies suggests that acupuncture or
      craniosacral therapy improves pregnancy-related pelvic pain, and
      osteomanipulative therapy or a multi-modal intervention (manual therapy, exercise
      and education) may also be of benefit.Clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling of
      results in many cases. Statistical heterogeneity was substantial in all but three
      meta-analyses, which did not improve following sensitivity analyses. Publication 
      bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out.Further evidence is very likely 
      to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and
      change the estimates. Studies would benefit from the introduction of an agreed
      classification system that can be used to categorise women according to their
      presenting symptoms, so that treatment can be tailored accordingly.

AB  - Kisspeptin is an essential gatekeeper of reproductive function. During pregnancy 
      high circulating levels of kisspeptin have been described, however the clear role
      of this neuropeptide in pregnancy remains unknown. We tested the existence of
      rhythmic kisspeptin expression in human full-term placenta from healthy pregnant 
      women at six different time points during the day. The data obtained by Western
      blotting were fitted to a mathematical model (Fourier series), demonstrating, for
      the first time, the existence of a circadian rhythm in placental kisspeptin
      expression.

TI  - Health-care utilisation amongst pregnant women who experience sleeping problems
      and/or tiredness or fatigue: secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of
      1835 pregnant women.
PG  - 355-62
LID - 10.1007/s11325-015-1250-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleeping problems and fatigue in pregnancy are often accepted as a 
      normal part of pregnancy; however, these conditions can be linked to serious
      consequences for both the mother and child. Despite established links between
      sleeping disturbance and a wide range of pregnancy complications, little is known
      about the health-care utilisation of women experiencing sleeping problems and
      fatigue. This study addresses the existing gap in the literature by examining
      cross-sectional data to identify health service utilisation patterns of pregnant 
      women experiencing sleeping problems and/or tiredness or fatigue. METHODS: In
      2010, a sub-study of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health was
      conducted as a cross-sectional survey of 2445 women who had recently given birth.
      Associations between reported symptoms of sleeplessness and/or tiredness or
      fatigue and health service utilisation were determined using logistic regression 
      analysis. RESULTS: During their pregnancy, 15.2 % of women experienced sleeping
      problems while 35.4 % experienced tiredness or fatigue. Women most commonly
      consulted with an obstetrician (n = 96) or a general practitioner (GP) (n = 74)
      for their tiredness or fatigue rather than a midwife (n = 56). A substantial
      number of women sought help from a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)
      practitioner for sleeping problems (33 %) or tiredness/fatigue (28 %).
      DISCUSSION: Sleeping problems and/or tiredness or fatigue is reported by a
      reasonable percentage of pregnant women, and women obtain assistance from
      conventional and CAM practitioners for their symptoms, but not all seek help.
      Given the serious implications of untreated sleep- and fatigue-related symptoms
      for mother and baby, this area of research deserves and requires more attention.

TI  - Sleep deprivation in the last trimester of pregnancy and inadequate vitamin D: Is
      there a relationship?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disturbed sleep is a significant health issue for pregnant women.
      Inadequate vitamin D intake is common among pregnant women and can affect many
      bodily systems. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test the
      hypothesis that serum vitamin D levels are low in pregnant women who have poor
      sleep quality in their last trimester. METHODS: We enrolled 92 pregnant women who
      were admitted to the Maternity Clinic of Turgut Ozal University (Ankara, Turkey) 
      in their last trimester. Venous blood sampling was performed to determine serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Questionnaire. The Student t test and Chi-square test were used to evaluate the
      relationships between variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to
      identify independent predictors of the vitamin D level. RESULTS: The median score
      of the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire was 6.2 +/- 3.3 (range, 1-17). We
      determined that 43.5% (40) of participants had poor sleep quality. The mean
      number of sleep hours at night was 8.6 +/- 1 hours (range, 6.30-11 hours), and
      the mean sleep latency was 20.3 +/- 12.7 minutes (range, 5-60 minutes). Vitamin D
      levels were measured for 87 participants; the median serum level of 25 (OH)
      vitamin D was 22.9 +/- 16.2 ng/mL (range, 4.9-99 ng/mL). Among all patients, we
      did not determine any significance between the vitamin D-deficient group and the 
      non-vitamin D-deficient group with regard to the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire
      Inventory (PSQI) total score and subcomponents scores of the questionnaire (p >
      0.05). Among 37 patients with poor sleep quality and for whom the vitamin D level
      was measured, 56.8% (21) women had vitamin D deficiency, and 81% (30) women had
      vitamin D insufficiency. However, we did not find any significance between
      participants with poor sleep and participants with good sleep quality with regard
      to age, occupational status, relationship with her partner, prepregnancy body
      mass index (BMI), weight gain during pregnancy, being primiparus, length of
      labor, and mode of delivery. Our findings further showed that being in a low
      income family was associated with poor sleep quality. CONCLUSION: Inadequate
      vitamin D and poor sleep quality are prevalent in pregnant women, but low levels 
      of vitamin D are not associated with poor sleep quality. Further studies with
      larger sample sizes and studies that include preterm deliveries and special sleep
      disorders should be performed to understand this issue better.

BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia
      and variable findings including a dystonic-rigid syndrome, a parkinsonian
      syndrome, or a combined syndrome of dystonia and peripheral neuropathy.
      Neurologic findings tend to evolve as the disease progresses. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: 
      The diagnosis of SCA3 rests on the use of molecular genetic testing to detect an 
      abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in ATXN3. Affected individuals have
      alleles with 52 to 86 CAG trinucleotide repeats. Such testing detects 100% of
      affected individuals. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Management is
      supportive as no medication slows the course of disease; restless legs syndrome
      and extrapyramidal syndromes resembling parkinsonism may respond to levodopa or
      dopamine agonists; spasticity, drooling, and sleep problems respond variably to
      lioresal, atropine-like drugs, and hypnotic agents; botulinum toxin has been used
      for dystonia and spasticity; daytime fatigue may respond to psychostimulants such
      as modafinil; accompanying depression should be treated. Intensive coordinative
      training or a course of combined physical and occupational therapy focused on
      gait and incoordination can lead to symptom improvement. Affected individuals
      should remain active; canes and walkers help prevent falling; motorized scooters 
      can help maintain independence; speech therapy and communication devices may
      benefit those with dysarthria and dietary modification those with dysphagia;
      weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks help to maintain independence.
      Prevention of secondary complications: Modification of the home for safety;
      vitamin supplements if caloric intake is reduced; weight control to facilitate
      ambulation and mobility; caution with general anesthesia. Regular physical
      activity is recommended to help retain gait and coordination in the setting of a 
      progressive degenerative disease. Surveillance: Annual or biannual assessment of 
      speech, swallowing, and gait function. GENETIC COUNSELING: SCA3 is inherited in
      an autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of affected individuals have a 50% chance
      of inheriting the abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in ATXN3. Prenatal 
      testing is possible for pregnancies at increased risk if the diagnosis has been
      confirmed in an affected family member.

      trimester of pregnancy. As part of a prospective study examining depressive
      symptoms in men over the first postnatal year, 622 men (mean age = 34.3 years,
      +/-5.0 years) completed standardized online self-report questionnaires measuring 
      depressed mood, physical activity, sleep quality, social support, marital
      adjustment, life events, financial stress, and demographics during their
      partner's third trimester of pregnancy. The Edinburgh Depression Scale was used
      to assess depressed mood. Partners also completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale 
      in the third trimester. The results revealed that 13.3% of expectant fathers
      exhibited elevated levels of depressive symptoms during their partner's third
      trimester of pregnancy. Significant independent factors associated with antenatal
      depressive symptoms in men were poorer sleep quality, family history of
      psychological difficulties, lower perceived social support, poorer marital
      satisfaction, more stressful life events in the preceding 6 months, greater
      number of financial stressors, and elevated maternal antenatal depressive
      symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of including fathers in the
      screening and early prevention efforts targeting depression during the transition
      to parenthood, which to date have largely focused only on women. Strategies to
      promote better sleep, manage stress, and mobilize social support may be important
      areas to address in interventions tailored to new fathers at risk for depression 
      during the transition to parenthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heartburn is one of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in
      pregnant women. It can occur in all trimesters of pregnancy. The symptoms of
      heartburn in pregnancy may be frequent, severe and distressing, but serious
      complications are rare. Many interventions have been used for the treatment of
      heartburn in pregnancy. These interventions include advice on diet, lifestyle
      modification and medications. However, there has been no evidence-based
      recommendation for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To assess
      the effects of interventions for relieving heartburn in pregnancy. SEARCH
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials
      Register (30 June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (2 March 2015), Asian & Oceanic
      Congress of Obstetrics & Gynaecology (AOCOG) conference proceedings (20-23
      October 2013, Centara Grand & Bangkok Convention Centre, Bangkok, Thailand), and 
      reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled
      trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTS of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy compared
      with another intervention, or placebo, or no intervention. Cluster-RCTs would
      have been eligible for inclusion but none were identified. We excluded studies
      available as abstracts only and those using a cross-over design.Interventions
      could include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications (such as
      antacids, sucralfate, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs and
      proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors 
      independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and 
      checked them for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs involving 725
      women. However, five trials did not contribute data. Four trials involving 358
      women contributed data. Trials were generally at mixed risk of bias.We only
      identified data for three comparisons: pharmaceutical treatment versus placebo or
      no treatment; acupuncture versus no treatment and pharmacological intervention
      versus advice on dietary and lifestyle changes. Pharmaceutical treatment compared
      with placebo or no treatmentTwo trials evaluated any pharmaceutical treatment
      compared with placebo or no treatment. One trial examined a treatment rarely used
      nowadays (intramuscular prostigmine 0.5 mg versus placebo). One trial evaluated
      the effect of magnesium and aluminium hydroxide plus simethicone liquid and
      tablet compared with placebo. For the primary outcome of this review (relief of
      heartburn), women who received pharmaceutical treatment reported complete
      heartburn relief more often than women receiving no treatment or placebo (risk
      ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.50 in two RCTs of 256
      women, I(2) = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Data on partial relief of heartburn
      were heterogenous and showed no clear difference (average RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.38 to
      4.76 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence). In terms of secondary 
      outcomes, there was no clear difference in the rate of side effects between the
      pharmaceutical treatment group and the placebo/no treatment group (RR 0.63, 95%
      CI 0.21 to 1.89 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence).
      Pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle choicesOne
      study compared 1 g of sucralfate with advice on dietary and lifestyle choices in 
      treating heartburn. More women in the sucralfate group experienced complete
      relief of heartburn compared to women who received advice on diet and lifestyle
      choices (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.07; participants = 65; studies = one). The
      only secondary outcome of interest addressed by this trial was side effects. The 
      evidence was not clear on intervention side effects rate between the two groups
      (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.07 to 41.21; participants = 66; studies = one). There was only
      one instance of side effects in the pharmacological group. Acupuncture compared
      with no treatmentOne trial evaluated acupuncture compared with no treatment but
      did not report data relating to this review's primary outcome (relief of
      heartburn). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no difference in the rate
      of side effects between women who had acupuncture and women who had no treatment 
      (RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.11 to 55.89 in one RCT of 36 women). With regard to quality of
      life, women who had acupuncture reported improved ability to sleep (RR 2.80, 95% 
      CI 1.14 to 6.86) and eat (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18 in one RCT of 36
      women).The following secondary outcomes were not reported upon in any of the
      trials included in the review: miscarriage, preterm labour, maternal
      satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight. 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no large-scale RCTs to assess heartburn relief in
      pregnancy. This review of nine small studies (which involved data from only four 
      small studies) indicates that there are limited data suggesting that heartburn in
      pregnancy could be completely relieved by pharmaceutical treatment. Three
      outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods.
      Evidence from two trials for the outcome of complete relief of heartburn was
      assessed as of moderate quality. Evidence for the outcomes of partial heartburn
      relief and side effects was graded to be of very low quality. Downgrading
      decisions were based in part on the small size of the trials and on heterogenous 
      and imprecise results.There are insufficient data to assess acupuncture versus no
      treatment and no data to assess other comparisons (miscarriage, preterm labour,
      maternal satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low
      birthweight).Further RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of
      interventions for heartburn in pregnancy. Future research should also address
      other medications such as histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs,
      proton pump inhibitors, and a raft-forming alginate reflux suppressant in
      treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. More research is needed on acupuncture and
      other complimentary therapies as treatments for heartburn in pregnancy. Future
      research should also evaluate any adverse outcomes, maternal satisfaction with
      treatment and measure pregnant women's quality of life in relation to the
      intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to identify the physical and mental state of
      women after delivery, to investigate the factors that influence those, and to
      examine the effects of postpartum care performance, which is traditionally
      believed to be appropriate care in Korea, on women's physical and mental status. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 148 women who visited our hospital for
      postpartum check-up on the 2(nd) week or 6(th) week after delivery were selected.
      We researched postpartum care methods using a questionnaire and had the women
      self-evaluate their postpartum symptoms. Depression was evaluated using the Beck 
      Depression Inventory. RESULTS: The average points of the 27 postpartum symptoms
      was 2.70 points (from 1 = very good to 5 = very bad). Seventy-two women had
      depression. Factors related to postpartum symptoms and depression were smoking
      before pregnancy, low marital satisfaction, bad mood during and after pregnancy, 
      lack of support from husbands, and bad quality of sleep during puerperium.
      Treating the joints of hands carefully when milking breasts, and avoiding
      squatting down, demonstrated a negative correlation with the average points of
      postpartum symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that mood
      during puerperium and Beck Depression Inventory points were significant factors
      related to the average points of postpartum symptoms and that the degree of
      support from husbands and mood during pregnancy were statistically related with
      depression. CONCLUSION: Many women complained of postpartum discomfort. Although,
      while some postpartum care methods which are traditionally believed to be
      appropriate care in Korea can be helpful to women's recovery, most of them are
      not. We confirmed that physical symptoms and depression are closely related to
      each other.

TI  - The relationship between sleep disturbance in pregnancy and persistent common
      mental disorder in the perinatal period (sleep disturbance and persistent CMD).
PG  - 375-8
LID - 10.3109/09638237.2015.1036969 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Common mental disorder (CMD) and sleep disturbance are two common
      conditions among women in late pregnancy, affecting up to 20% and 63% of women,
      respectively, and may adversely affect their quality of life. AIM: The aim of
      this study is to examine the relationship between sleep disturbance in pregnancy 
      and persistent CMD among low-income pregnant women living in Brazil. METHODS:
      This was a prospective cohort study conducted with pregnant women recruited from 
      public primary care clinics in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We performed a longitudinal
      analysis of 219 women who had CMD from the Self-Report Questionnaire during the
      20-30 weeks of pregnancy. Two groups were examined: (1) those who had CMD
      remission in the postpartum and (2) those who had persistent CMD in the
      postpartum (measured once in the postpartum period). Poisson regression was used 
      to estimate the degree of association between sleep disturbance in pregnancy and 
      the risk for persistent CMD postpartum. RESULTS: After adjusting for
      sociodemographic and clinical factors, sleep disturbance during pregnancy is
      associated with persistent CMD (RR = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.84).
      CONCLUSION: In this sample of low-income pregnant women living in Brazil, the
      presence of sleep disturbance during pregnancy was associated with persistent
      common mental disorder in the postpartum period. Identification of sleep
      disturbance in pregnant women with CMD will be important in order to recognize
      those women at higher risk of persistent CMD in the postpartum period.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One
      important but often overlooked change is the increased risk for sleep
      disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or
      postpartum, there is emerging evidence to suggest that women with significant
      sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, 
      are more likely to report an increase in depressive symptomatology or develop
      postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result
      including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant and 
      behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the
      relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the 
      postpartum may increase the risk for PPD. RECENT FINDINGS: Symptoms of insomnia
      and poor sleep quality are independently associated with greater depressive
      symptoms across pregnancy and throughout postpartum. Likewise, both can
      negatively impact the ability to mother effectively. SUMMARY: The presence of
      insomnia or sleep disturbance during the perinatal period is a risk factor for
      depressive symptoms. Women with depression are at an increased risk of developing
      sleep disturbance thereby increasing depressive symptomatology. This
      bidirectional and additive relationship needs more clinical attention as both
      sleep disturbance and depression are noted risk factors for adverse pregnancy
      outcomes.

      female Wistar rats were assigned to one of two groups: control (n=12) or sleep
      restriction (n=11) during the entire pregnancy. At the fifth postpartum day, the 
      animals were subjected to the resident-intruder paradigm and to the pup retrieval
      test. RESULTS: Sleep restriction during pregnancy had no direct effects on
      maternal care. Regarding aggressive behavior, defensive aggression was increased 
      by sleep loss, with a lower responsiveness threshold to hostile environmental
      stimuli. Sleep deprivation during gestation also reduced self-grooming behavior. 
      CONCLUSION: Taking increased self-grooming as a behavioral correlate of anxiety
      in rodents, this study provides evidence that lactating dams were in a condition 
      of reduced anxiety. From an adaptive perspective, this pattern of stress response
      may function to ensure proper maternal behavior, thereby guaranteeing the
      survival and viability of the litter. Under a translational perspective, the
      present article confronts the importance of biological and adaptive features to
      rodent maternal behavior with the relevance of sociocultural factors to the human
      mother-infant relationship and to the onset of postpartum depression.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Maternal antenatal depression is associated with an increased risk 
      of emotional and behavioural problems in children. More recently antenatal
      depression has been associated with shorter sleep duration, higher number of
      awakenings and sleep problems in infants. Examining the effect of treatment of
      depression on child development is the next step in unravelling the complex
      association between antenatal depression and offspring development. METHODS: We
      used data from a pilot RCT of women with antenatal depression who received either
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), to examine
      infant sleep duration and temperament two months postpartum. Data was available
      for n=14 in the CBT group and n=11 in the TAU group. RESULTS: No differences by
      treatment arm were evident. Improvement in depression scores during pregnancy was
      associated with easier temperament (beta=-.45, p=.024) and shorter nocturnal
      sleep duration (beta=-.58, p=.003). The findings were more pronounced in the CBT 
      group compared to the TAU group. LIMITATIONS: This was a pilot RCT and as such
      the sample size was small and there was some loss to follow up between the
      baseline and postnatal assessment. CONCLUSION: Improvement in antenatal
      depressive symptoms may have beneficial effects for the infant; whether these are
      directly through effects on foetal development or indirectly through changes in
      the postnatal mother-infant relationship remains to be determined.

AB  - Levodopa and dopamine agonists have been the main treatment for restless legs
      syndrome during the past decades. Although their efficacy has been well
      documented over the short term, long-term dopaminergic treatment is often
      complicated by augmentation, loss of efficacy, and other side effects. Recent
      large randomized controlled trials provide new evidence for the efficacy of
      high-potency opioids and alpha2delta ligands, and several post hoc analyses,
      meta-analyses, algorithms, and guidelines have been published, often with a
      specific focus, for example, on augmentation, or on management of restless legs
      syndrome during pregnancy. Several new contributions to understanding the
      pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome have been published, but at this time, 
      whether they will have an impact on treatment possibilities in the future cannot 
      be estimated.

TI  - Markers of Oxidative Stress in Pregnant Women with Sleep Disturbances.
PG  - 264-9
LID - 10.5001/omj.2015.53 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The quality and duration of sleep is impaired during pregnancy. Our
      study aimed to determine whether maternal sleep deprivation occurring during the 
      second and third trimester of pregnancy could alter fetal well-being with respect
      to birth weight and APGAR score by altering the inflammatory status and oxidative
      stress in the mothers. . METHODS: Sleep adequacy was assessed using the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We investigated the inflammatory status
      and oxidative stress at term in the blood of pregnant subjects with and without
      sleep deprivation by measuring the levels of protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA),
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein
      carbonyl (PCO). Homocysteine (Hcy) and its vitamin determinants were also
      measured. Fetal outcome with respect to birth weight and APGAR score were
      compared between study subjects. . RESULTS: A significant increase was observed
      in the levels of hsCRP, PBSA, Hcy, MDA, and PCO, in the sleep-deprived group when
      compared to the control group. Fetal outcome at birth showed a significant
      difference between the cases with high sleep deprivation and those with low sleep
      deprivation. . CONCLUSION: Sleep deprivation in pregnancy leads to an increase in
      the inflammatory parameters, oxidative stress, and Hcy levels. Fetal outcome at
      birth was affected more in mothers with high sleep deprivation than those with
      low sleep deprivation. Follow-up in these babies are needed to reveal any
      differences in their growth and development.

      sleep-disturbed pregnant women.

LID - 10.1080/03630242.2015.1088116 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal sleep disturbance has been associated with undesirable birthing
      outcomes. To determine the effectiveness of listening to music at home in
      improving sleep quality, 121 Taiwanese pregnant women with poor sleep quality
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] score > 5) were systematically assigned,
      with a random start to music listening (n = 61) or control (n = 60) group.
      Participants in the music listening group self-regulated listening to music in
      addition to receiving general prenatal care similar to that in the control group 
      for 2 weeks. The PSQI and State-Anxiety Inventory were used to assess outcomes.
      ANCOVA analyses were used with the pretest scores as covariates and showed
      significant improvement in sleep quality, stress, and anxiety in the music
      listening group compared with the control group. The most frequently used music
      genre by participants in the experimental group was lullabies, followed by
      classical music and crystal baby music. This study supported the theory that
      2-week music listening interventions may reduce stress, anxiety, and yield better
      sleep quality for sleep-disturbed pregnant women. The analysis of participants'
      journals also implied that the expectant mothers' choices of musical genres may
      correlate more with perceived prenatal benefits or the desire to interact with
      their unborn child.

AB  - The secretion of the stress hormone cortisol follows a diurnal circadian rhythm. 
      There are indications that this rhythm is affected by stress early in life. This 
      paper addresses the development of the cortisol circadian rhythm between 1 and 6 
      years of age, and the role of maternal stress and anxiety early in the child's
      life on this (developing) rhythm. Participants were 193 healthy mother-child
      dyads from a community sample. Self-reported maternal stress and anxiety and
      physiological stress (saliva cortisol), were assessed prenatally (gestational
      week 37). Postnatally, self-reported maternal stress and anxiety were measured at
      3, 6, 12, 30, and 72 months. Saliva cortisol samples from the children were
      collected on two days (four times each day) at 12, 30, and 72 months of age. The 
      total amount of cortisol during the day and the cortisol decline over the day
      were determined to indicate children's cortisol circadian rhythm. Multilevel
      analyses showed that the total amount of cortisol decreased between 1 and 6
      years. Furthermore, more maternal pregnancy-specific stress was related to higher
      total amounts of cortisol in the child. Higher levels of early postnatal maternal
      anxiety were associated with flatter cortisol declines in children. Higher levels
      of early postnatal maternal daily hassles were associated with steeper child
      cortisol declines over the day. These results indicated developmental change in
      children's cortisol secretion from 1 to 6 years and associations between maternal
      stress and anxiety early in children's lives and children's cortisol circadian
      rhythm in early childhood.

      sociodemographic, pregnancy, obstetric, and postnatal variables and postpartum
      depression, anxiety and stress levels in new mothers. METHOD:
      One-hundred-thirty-nine women completed the baseline questionnaire and 105
      completed the follow-up questionnaire at 4-6 months postpartum. Sociodemographic 
      and pregnancy factors were assessed at baseline, birth and postnatal factors were
      assessed at time 2, and depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed at both
      time points. RESULTS: Caesarean delivery was associated with high postpartum
      depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Child sleep problems was related to
      depression, child health problems were related to anxiety, more SLE related to
      high stress, and maternal sleep problems were related to PPD. However, the
      results became non-significant after controlling for antenatal distress levels.
      Finally, women who underwent caesarean delivery had higher antenatal stress,
      anxiety, and depression levels, relative to women who did not undergo the
      procedure. CONCLUSION: Psychological stress and distress tended to persist in the
      women from the third-trimester of pregnancy to 4-6 months postpartum. It tended
      to occur in the context of caesarean delivery, maternal sleep problems, child's
      health and sleep problems, and stressful life-events.

AB  - Sleep deprivation occurs when inadequate sleep leads to decreased performance,
      inadequate alertness, and deterioration in health. It is incompletely understood 
      why humans need sleep, although some theories include energy conservation,
      restoration, and information processing. Sleep deprivation has many deleterious
      health effects. Residency programs have enacted strict work restrictions because 
      of medically related errors due to sleep deprivation. Because obstetrics is an
      unpredictable specialty with long irregular hours, enacting a hospitalist program
      enhances patient safety, decreases malpractice risk, and improves the physician's
      quality of life by allowing obstetricians to get sufficient rest.

TI  - Impairment of Central Chemoreception in Neonatal Rats Induced by Maternal
      Cigarette Smoke Exposure during Pregnancy.
PG  - e0137362
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0137362 [doi]
AB  - It has been postulated that prenatal cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) increases the
      risk for sudden infant death syndrome. The victims of infant death syndrome
      suffer from respiratory abnormalities, such as central apnea, diminished
      chemoreflex and alteration in respiratory pattern during sleep. However, no
      experimental evidence on CSE model exists to confirm whether prenatal CSE gives
      rise to reduction of neonatal central chemoreception in in vitro preparations in 
      absence of peripheral sensory feedback. The aim of the present study was to test 
      the hypothesis that maternal CSE during pregnancy depresses central
      chemoreception of the neonatal rats. The pregnant rats were divided into two
      groups, control (n = 8) and CSE (n = 8). Experiments were performed on neonatal
      (0-3days) rat pups. Fictive respiratory activity was monitored by recording the
      rhythmic discharge from the hypoglossal rootlets of the medullary slices obtained
      from the neonatal rats. The burst frequency (BF) and integrated amplitude (IA) of
      the discharge were analyzed. Their responses to acidified artificial
      cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) were tested to indicate the change of the central
      chemosensitivity. Under condition of perfusing with standard aCSF (pH 7.4), no
      significant difference was detected between the two groups in either BF or IA
      (P>0.05). Under condition of perfusing with acidified aCSF (pH 7.0), BF was
      increased and IA was decreased in both groups (P<0.01). However, their change
      rates in the CSE group were obviously smaller than that in the control group,
      66.98 +/- 10.11% vs. 143.75 +/- 15.41% for BF and -22.38 +/- 2.51% vs. -44.90 +/-
      3.92% for IA (P<0.01). In conclusion, these observations, in a prenatal CSE
      model, provide important evidence that maternal smoking during pregnancy exerts
      adverse effects on central chemoreception of neonates.

TI  - High risk for obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders among overweight 
      and obese pregnant women.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.1186/s12884-015-0633-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common and serious disorder in which
      breathing repeatedly stops during sleep, is associated with excess weight and
      obesity. Little is known about the co-occurrence of OSA among pregnant women from
      low and middle-income countries. METHODS: We examined the extent to which
      maternal pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity status are associated with high risk
      for OSA, poor sleep quality, and excessive daytime sleepiness in 1032 pregnant
      women in Lima, Peru. The Berlin questionnaire was used to identify women at high 
      risk for OSA. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS) were used to examine sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness, 
      respectively. Multinomial logistic regression procedures were employed to
      estimate odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for
      putative confounding factors. RESULTS: Compared with lean women (<25 kg/m(2)),
      overweight women (25-29.9 kg/m(2)) had 3.69-fold higher odds of high risk for OSA
      (95% CI 1.82-7.50). The corresponding aOR for obese women (>/=30 kg/m(2)) was
      13.23 (95% CI: 6.25-28.01). Obese women, as compared with their lean counterparts
      had a 1.61-fold higher odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.00-2.63).
      CONCLUSION: Overweight or obese pregnant women have increased odds of sleep
      disorders, particularly OSA. OSA screening and risk management may be indicated
      among pregnant women in low and middle income countries, particularly those
      undergoing rapid epidemiologic transitions characterized by increased prevalence 
      of excessive adult weight gain.

AB  - Various medications and behavioral treatments for sleep-related leg cramps have
      been tried, but the quality of the evidence is low. Quinine seems to be
      effective, but dangerous. beta-Agonists may be one of the more common causes of
      secondary leg cramps. Statins may not be implicated in leg cramps as much as has 
      been believed. Potassium-sparing diuretics may have a higher incidence of
      sleep-related leg cramps than potassium-depleting diuretics. Plantar flexion of
      the feet may elicit most sleep-related leg cramps. More research into behavioral 
      treatments is needed. A standardized sleep-related leg cramp questionnaire would 
      be useful to expand research.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease is 3-fold more prevalent in
      pregnant than in non-pregnant women. Symptoms are particularly strong and
      frequent during the third trimester of pregnancy and disappear around delivery. A
      pre-existing form of RLS tends to worsen during pregnancy. Women who experience
      RLS during pregnancy have a higher risk of symptoms in further pregnancies and of
      developing a primary form of RLS later in life, than women free of symptoms
      during pregnancy. This article reviews the literature for pregnancy-related RLS, 
      with particular attention to its epidemiology, course, possible mechanisms,
      management, and the impact of symptoms.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135471 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The biology of peripartum depression remains unclear, with altered
      stress and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis response having been
      implicated in its pathophysiology. METHODS: The current study was undertaken as a
      part of the BASIC project (Biology, Affect, Stress, Imaging, Cognition), a
      population-based longitudinal study of psychological wellbeing during pregnancy
      and the postpartum period in Uppsala County, Sweden, in order to assess the
      association between evening salivary cortisol levels and depressive symptoms in
      the peripartum period. Three hundred and sixty-five pregnant women from the BASIC
      cohort were recruited at pregnancy week 18 and instructed to complete a Swedish
      validated version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at the 36th week of
      pregnancy as well as the sixth week after delivery. At both times, they were also
      asked to provide evening salivary samples for cortisol analysis. A comprehensive 
      review of the relevant literature is also provided. RESULTS: Women with
      postpartum EPDS score >/= 10 had higher salivary evening cortisol at six weeks
      postpartum compared to healthy controls (median cortisol 1.19 vs 0.89 nmol/L). A 
      logistic regression model showed a positive association between cortisol levels
      and depressive symptoms postpartum (OR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.7-9.7). This association
      remained significant even after controlling for history of depression, use of
      tobacco, partner support, breastfeeding, stressful life events, and sleep
      problems, as possible confounders (aOR = 4.5; 95% CI 1.5-14.1). Additionally,
      women with postpartum depressive symptoms had higher postpartum cortisol levels
      compared to both women with depressive symptoms antenatally and controls (p =
      0.019 and p = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Women with depressive symptoms
      postpartum had higher postpartum cortisol levels, indicating an altered response 
      of the HPA-axis in postpartum depression.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: recent studies suggest that women with gestational diabetes are
      more likely to suffer sleep disorders compared to pregnant women without
      diabetes. The objectives of this study were to analyze the risk factors
      associated with gestational diabetes and to verify if exist an association
      between the presence or abscense of gestational diabetes and the quality of the
      sleep and/or daytime sleepiness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: case-controls study with a
      sample of 130 pregnant women, 46 of them with gestational diabetes and 84
      controls. Anthropometric parameters such as weight, stature, body mass index
      (BMI) and abdominal perimeter were evaluated. Socio-demographic variables,
      including age and family situation were assessed, and a gynecological study was
      performed, evaluating the number of simple or multiple births, number of
      miscarriages and gynecological pathology during the past 3 years. The O'Sullivan 
      test was conducted for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The quality of
      sleep and daytime sleepiness were also measured. RESULTS: 46 women were diagnosed
      of gestational diabetes. There are significant differences (p < 0.001) in BMI
      scores among women with gestational diabetes and controls, being the highest
      values in the diabetic group. There is a significant association (p = 0.002)
      between the existence of family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the
      presence or abscense of gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes
      present a significant worse quality of sleep (p < 0.001), and values of daytime
      sleepiness higher than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: high values of BMI or
      family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be factors associated to the 
      risk of suffer gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes have a
      poorer quality of sleep and a higher degree of daytime sleepiness than the
      general population, reducing the well-being of the mother and the fetus.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare sleep quality of overweight versus normal weight women in the
      second and third trimesters of pregnancy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study
      involving 223 women with 14 or more weeks of pregnancy, 105 of them overweight
      (pre-pregnancy body mass index - BMI - >/=25.0 kg/m2) and 118 of normal weight
      (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), attending the prenatal care clinic. The Brazilian version 
      of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-BR) questionnaire was used to
      evaluate sleep quality. The Student t-test and the chi-square test were used to
      compare differences between groups and a p value <0.05 was considered
      statistically significant. RESULTS: Most of the participants (67.7%) were poor
      sleepers (total score >5); this proportion was significantly higher among
      overweight (80/105) versus normal weight (67/118) women (76.2 versus 56.8%,
      p=0,004). During the second trimester, this difference did not reach statistical 
      significance (72.5 versus 53.7%, respectively, p=0.06) but mean total PSQI-BR
      scores were significantly higher among overweight participants (7.0+/-3.8 versus 
      5.5+/-3.2, p=0.02). In the 2nd trimester, overweight women also had higher scores
      for sleep latency (1.4+/-1.0 versus 1.0+/-0.9, p=0.02) and subjective sleep
      quality (1.3+/-0.8 versus 0.8+/-0.8, p=0.02). In the third trimester, the
      proportion of women with poor sleep quality was significantly higher in the
      overweight group, but did not reach statistical significance (79.6 versus 60.8%, 
      p=0.06). During this period, total mean scores were similar for women with and
      without excess weight (9.4+/-4.2 versus 8.3+/-4.6, p=0.2). However, overweight
      women had higher mean scores for sleep disturbance (2.3+/-0.7 versus 2.0+/-0.8,
      p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Overweight women had a poorer sleep quality than normal
      weight women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Willis-Ekbom disease/restless legs syndrome (WED/RLS) is the most
      common sleep-related movement disorder in pregnancy. We designed a prospective
      longitudinal study to investigate the correlates of WED/RLS during and after
      pregnancy. DESIGN: A total of 138 pregnant women with WED/RLS and a control group
      of 251 age-matched pregnant women were enrolled prospectively. A questionnaire
      was administered during a face-to-face interview at first evaluation during
      pregnancy and three months after delivery. RESULTS: Among all women in the first 
      trimester, 15.6% were diagnosed with WED/RLS, whereas 32.8% of those in the
      second trimester and 38.8% of those in the third trimester were diagnosed with
      WED/RLS (p = 0.032). In regression analysis, later gestational age [p < 0.001;
      odds ratio (OR) 1.054] and previous history of WED/RLS (p = 0.001; OR 2.795) were
      positively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS, while ferritin levels (p =
      0.001; OR 0.956) were negatively correlated with the presence of WED/RLS.
      Ferritin levels were also negatively correlated with the International RLS Study 
      Group severity index (p = 0.041). Forty-eight patients (34.8%) experienced
      WED/RLS symptomatology after delivery. The ferritin levels were lower, and the
      mean number of pregnancies was higher, in women with residual WED/RLS (p =
      0.008). CONCLUSION: Our survey showed that WED/RLS was more common in the second 
      and third trimesters. Emergence of WED/RLS during the second trimester was
      strongly associated with residual WED/RLS. Lower ferritin levels were associated 
      with both WED/RLS in pregnancy and residual WED/RLS after delivery. A higher
      number of pregnancies were also associated with a greater likelihood of having
      residual WED/RLS after delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome
      (OSAHS) and related factors at the end of pregnancy using the Berlin
      questionnaire. METHODS: A total of 367 women at the end of pregnancy (median
      gestational age 39 weeks) were interviewed with the Berlin questionnaire and a
      general survey containing maternal socio-demographic and anthropometric
      information. Neonatal outcome data were also assessed. RESULTS: Median age for
      the whole sample was 31 years. According to the Berlin questionnaire, 39.8% were 
      positive for high risk of OSAHS. Upon bivariate analysis, higher risk of OSAHS
      was significantly related to church attendance, and higher pre-pregnancy body
      mass index (BMI), current BMI, weight, neck and arm circumference and systolic
      blood pressure at survey. Logistic regression analysis found that higher maternal
      pre-pregnancy BMI (OR 2.71 95% CI 1.84-4.00, p < 0.0001) and higher maternal
      weight at survey (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.78-5.17, p < 0.0001) were significantly
      related to a higher risk of OSAHS. CONCLUSION: The risk of OSAHS is relatively
      high at the end of pregnancy and related to a higher pre-pregnancy BMI and higher

TI  - An international internet survey of the experiences of 1,714 mothers with a late 
      stillbirth: the STARS cohort study.
PG  - 172
LID - 10.1186/s12884-015-0602-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stillbirth occurring after 28 weeks gestation affects between 1.5-4.5
      per 1,000 births in high-income countries. The majority of stillbirths in this
      setting occur in women without risk factors. In addition, many established risk
      factors such as nulliparity and maternal age are not amenable to modification
      during pregnancy. Identification of other risk factors which could be amenable to
      change in pregnancy should be a priority in stillbirth prevention research.
      Therefore, this study aimed to utilise an online survey asking women who had a
      stillbirth about their pregnancy in order to identify any common symptoms and
      experiences. METHODS: A web-based survey. RESULTS: A total of 1,714 women who had
      experienced a stillbirth >3 weeks prior to enrolment completed the survey. Common
      experiences identified were: perception of changes in fetal movement (63% of
      respondents), reports of a "gut instinct" that something was wrong (68%), and
      perceived time of death occurring overnight (56%). A quarter of participants
      believed that their baby's death was due to a cord issue and another 18%
      indicated that they did not know the reason why their baby died. In many cases
      (55%) the mother believed the cause of death was different to that told by
      clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association between altered
      fetal movements and stillbirth and highlights novel associations that merit
      closer scrutiny including a maternal gut instinct that something was wrong. The
      potential importance of maternal sleep is highlighted by the finding of more than
      half the mothers believing their baby died during the night. This study supports 
      the importance of listening to mothers' concerns and symptoms during pregnancy
      and highlights the need for thorough investigation of stillbirth and appropriate 
      explanation being given to parents.

TI  - Impact of mass media on the utilization of antenatal care services among women of
      rural community in Nepal.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1186/s13104-015-1312-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal care has several benefits for expecting mothers and birth
      outcomes; yet many mothers do not utilise this service in Nepal. Mass media may
      play an important role in increasing the use of antenatal care and other maternal
      health services. However, the effect of mass media on increasing health service
      utilisation has remained an under studied area in Nepal. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the impact of mass media on the utilisation of antenatal care 
      services in rural Nepal. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was
      conducted in Sinurjoda Village Development Committee of Dhanusha District, Nepal.
      A total of 205 mothers of children aged under 1 year were selected using
      systematic random sampling. Logistic regression was employed to examine the
      association between selected antenatal care services and mass media exposure
      after adjusting for other independent variables. RESULTS: A majority of mothers
      were exposed to mass media. Radio was accessible to most (60.0%) of the
      participants followed by television (43.41%). Mothers exposed to mass media were 
      more likely to attending antenatal visits [Odds ratio (OR) 6.28; 95% CI
      (1.01-38.99)], taking rest and sleep during pregnancy [OR 2.65; 95% CI
      (1.13-6.26)], and receiving TT immunization [OR 5.12; 95% CI (1.23-21.24)] than
      their non-exposed counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The study reported a positive
      influence of mass media on the utilisation of antenatal care services in Nepal.
      Therefore, further emphasis should be given to increase awareness of women of
      rural Nepal through mass media to improve utilisation of antenatal care services 
      in Nepal.

TI  - Heightened cold pain and pressure pain sensitivity in young female adults with
      moderate-to-severe menstrual pain.
PG  - 2468-78
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000317 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the association between menstrual pain severity and
      psychophysical measures of cold and pressure pain sensitivity. A cross-sectional 
      design was used with young women (n = 432) from the Western Australian Pregnancy 
      Cohort (Raine) Study. Menstrual pain severity and oral contraception use was
      obtained from questionnaires at 20 and 22-year follow-ups. A visual analog scale 
      (VAS; range from 0 [none] to 10 [unbearable]) was used to measure menstrual pain 
      severity at both 20 and 22 years over the 3-year period, with 3 groups created:
      (1) no pain or mild pain (VAS 0-3), (2) at least moderate pain at a minimum of 1 
      of the 2 time points (hereafter named "mixed)", and (3) severe pain (VAS 8-10).
      Cold pain sensitivity (dorsal wrist) and pressure pain sensitivity (lumbar spine,
      upper trapezius, dorsal wrist, and tibialis anterior) were assessed using
      standardised quantitative sensory testing protocols. Confounding variables
      included number of musculoskeletal pain sites, oral contraceptive use, smoking,
      physical activity, body mass index, psychological distress, and sleep. Severe
      menstrual pain and mixed menstrual pain were positively associated with
      heightened cold pain sensitivity (distant from menstrual pain referral site) and 
      pressure pain sensitivity (local to menstrual pain referral site). These
      associations remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding
      variables including multisite musculoskeletal pain. Our findings suggest
      peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms contributing to heightened
      pain sensitivity in young women with moderate and severe menstrual pain. These
      data highlight the need for innovative management approaches to attenuate the
      negative impact of severe menstrual pain in young women.

TI  - Objective and subjective sleep during pregnancy: links with depressive and
      anxiety symptoms.
PG  - 173-81
LID - 10.1007/s00737-015-0554-8 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this paper are to study the associations between objective and
      subjective sleep in pregnant women, to examine which specific aspects of women's 
      sleep are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and to test the
      moderating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the relations between
      objective and subjective sleep. The sample included 148 pregnant women. Objective
      sleep was measured by actigraphy for five nights at the participants' home, and
      subjective sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Depressive
      symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale and anxiety 
      symptoms with the Beck anxiety inventory. Significant associations were found
      between the subjective sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores, but 
      there were no significant associations between actigraphic sleep measures and the
      depressive and anxiety scores. Depressive and anxiety scores emerged as
      significant moderators of the links between objective and subjective sleep. The
      findings suggest that emotional distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms
      severity) during pregnancy is associated with subjective sleep disturbances but
      not with objective sleep disturbances. Importantly, only among women with higher 
      levels of emotional distress was subjective sleep quality associated with
      objective sleep quality. These findings may suggest that women with higher levels
      of emotional distress are not necessarily biased in their perception of sleep
      quality. However, they may perceive fragmented sleep as more detrimental to their
      wellbeing.

TI  - Effect of insecticide-treated bed net usage on under-five mortality in northern
      Ghana.
PG  - 309
LID - 10.1186/s12936-015-0827-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although under-five mortality rate seems to be declining in Ghana,
      the northern part of the country has higher levels of under-five mortality
      vis-a-vis the national rates. This research examines the correlates of the high
      under-five mortality among children in the northern part of Ghana, with emphasis 
      on the usage of insecticide-treated bed net (ITN), as recommended by the World
      Health Organization. METHODS: A total of 3,839 under-five children sourced from
      the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey--was used for this study. Univariate
      descriptive statistics was employed to describe the variables used for the
      empirical estimation. The maximum likelihood estimation technique was used to
      estimate a logit model in other to determine the effect of insecticide treated
      bed net usage on under-five mortality. RESULTS: Insecticide-treated bed net usage
      among children enhances their survival rates. Thus, under-five mortality among
      children who sleep under treated bed nets is about 18.8% lower than among
      children who do not sleep under treated bed nets. While health facility delivery 
      was found to reduce to reduce under-five mortality, child bearing among older
      women is detrimental to the survival of the child. CONCLUSIONS: The study,
      therefore, recommends that policies targeting reduction in under-five mortality
      in northern Ghana should consider not mere availability of ITNs in the household,
      but advocate the usage of these treated nets. The study recommends to the
      Ministry of Health to extend their services to unreached rural communities to
      encourage health facility delivery to reduce under-five mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the prevalence of home care
      practices in very to moderately preterm (VPT), late preterm (LPT) and term
      infants born in Massachusetts. STUDY DESIGN: Using 2007 to 2010 Massachusetts
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System data, births were categorized by
      gestational age (VPT: 23 to 33 weeks; LPT: 34 to 36 weeks; term: 37 to 42 weeks).
      Home care practices included breastfeeding initiation and continuation, and
      infant sleep practices (supine sleep position, sleeping in a crib, cosleeping in 
      an adult bed). We developed multivariate models to examine the association of
      infant sleep practices and breastfeeding with preterm status, controlling for
      maternal sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Supine sleep position was
      more prevalent among term infants compared with VPT and LPT infants (77.1%,
      71.5%, 64.4%; P=0.02). In the adjusted model, LPT infants were less likely to be 
      placed in supine sleep position compared with term infants (adjusted prevalence
      ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.75 to 0.97). Breastfeeding initiation and 
      continuation did not differ among preterm and term groups. Nearly 16% of VPT and 
      18% of LPT and term infants were not sleeping in cribs and 14% of LPT and term
      infants were cosleeping on an adult bed. CONCLUSION: Compared with term infants, 
      LPT infants were less likely to be placed in supine sleep position after hospital
      discharge. A significant percent of preterm and term infants were cosleeping on
      an adult bed. Hospitals may consider improving their safe sleep education,
      particularly to mothers of LPT infants.

      Mellitus.
PG  - 326-31
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000959 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between objectively assessed sleep and
      blood glucose in a prospective cohort of women recently diagnosed with
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Women with GDM were enrolled
      immediately after attending a GDM education class. All patients were recruited
      during their first week of attempted dietary management of GDM. They were
      instructed on the use of a glucometer and on the principles of a GDM diet. Women 
      wore an actigraph and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Glucose
      records were compared against the objective sleep data. Linear mixed model
      analysis was used to estimate the association of sleep duration on morning
      fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations. RESULTS:
      Thirty-seven participants provided data for 213 sleep intervals that corresponded
      to at least one glucose reading. Sleep duration was negatively associated with
      fasting and 1-hour postprandial blood glucose concentrations In analyses adjusted
      for age, gestational age, and body mass index, a 1-hour increase in sleep time
      was associated with statistically significant reductions in fasting glucose
      (-2.09 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.98 to -0.20) as well as
      postprandial glucose concentrations (lunch -4.62 mg/dL, 95% CI -8.75 to -0.50;
      dinner -6.07 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.40 to -2.73). CONCLUSION: Short sleep durations are
      associated with worsened glucose control in women with gestational diabetes.
      Educating women on healthy sleep and screening for and treating sleep disorders
      during pregnancy may have a role in optimizing blood glucose control in
      gestational diabetes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

PG  - 93-102
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000848 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the predictive ability of current obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA) screening tools and the individual questions in these tools at identifying 
      pregnant women who have OSA. METHODS: A total of 293 third-trimester patients
      were enrolled between 2010 and 2012, and 248 patients had sleep monitor results. 
      Recruited participants completed a questionnaire consisting of six OSA screening 
      tools and overnight portable sleep monitoring. Predictive ability of the
      screening tools for OSA compared with results of the diagnosis from overnight
      sleep monitoring was estimated using the area under receiver operating
      characteristic curves. RESULTS: Two hundred eighteen (88%) of the patients were
      OSA-negative, and 30 patients (12%) were OSA-positive based on sleep monitoring
      results. Compared with OSA-negative patients, OSA-positive patients had greater
      body mass indices and neck circumferences as well as significantly higher rates
      of hypertension (chronic and gestational), pregestational diabetes mellitus,
      asthma, and preeclampsia. The overall predictive ability of the screening tools
      for OSA was modest (area under receiver operating characteristic curves
      0.62-0.695). However, individual components of the questionnaire were strongly
      associated with OSA. CONCLUSION: We found that none of the studied OSA screening 
      tools accurately detected OSA in pregnant women in the third trimester. We have
      identified proposed elements of a new screening tool based on promising
      components from several tools that may more accurately detect patients with OSA.

TI  - PREPP: postpartum depression prevention through the mother-infant dyad.
PG  - 229-42
LID - 10.1007/s00737-015-0549-5 [doi]
AB  - Most interventions to prevent postpartum depression (PPD) focus on the mother
      rather than the mother-infant dyad. As strong relationships between infant sleep 
      and cry behavior and maternal postpartum mood have been demonstrated by previous 
      research, interventions targeted at the dyad may reduce symptoms of PPD. The goal
      of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of Practical Resources for 
      Effective Postpartum Parenting (PREPP). PREPP is a new PPD prevention protocol
      that aims to treat women at risk for PPD by promoting maternally mediated
      behavioral changes in their infants, while also including mother-focused skills. 
      Results of this randomized control trial (RCT) (n = 54) indicate that this novel,
      brief intervention was well tolerated and effective in reducing maternal symptoms
      of anxiety and depression, particularly at 6 weeks postpartum. Additionally, this
      study found that infants of mothers enrolled in PREPP had fewer bouts of fussing 
      and crying at 6 weeks postpartum than those infants whose mothers were in the
      Enhanced TAU group. These preliminary results indicate that PREPP has the
      potential to reduce the incidence of PPD in women at risk and to directly impact 
      the developing mother-child relationship, the mother's view of her child, and
      child outcomes.

TI  - Infant sleep and feeding patterns are associated with maternal sleep, stress, and

PG  - 209-18

AB  - Our goal was to examine associations of infant sleep and feeding patterns with
      maternal sleep and mood among women at risk for postpartum depression.
      Participants were 30 women (age +/- SD = 28.3 +/- 5.1 years) with a history of
      MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) who completed daily sleep diaries, 
      wore wrist actigraphs to estimate sleep, and had their mood assessed with the
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) during four separate weeks of the
      perinatal period (33 weeks pregnancy and weeks 2, 6, and 16 postpartum). They
      logged their infants' sleep and feeding behaviors daily and reported postnatal
      stress on the Childcare Stress Inventory (CSI) at week 16. Mothers'
      actigraphically estimated sleep showed associations with infant sleep and feeding
      patterns only at postpartum week 2. Shorter duration of the longest infant-sleep 
      bout was associated with shorter maternal sleep duration (p = .02) and lower
      sleep efficiency (p = .04), and maternal sleep efficiency was negatively
      associated with the number of infant-sleep bouts (p = .008) and duration of
      infant feeding (p = .008). Neither infant sleep nor feeding was associated with
      maternal sleep at 6 or 16 weeks, but more disturbed infant sleep and more
      frequent feeding at 6 weeks were associated with higher HAM-D scores at 6 and 16 
      weeks and higher CSI scores. Sleep in the mother-infant dyad is most tightly
      linked in the early postpartum weeks, but mothers continue to experience
      disturbed sleep and infant sleep and feeding behaviors continue to be associated 
      with mothers' depressive symptoms and stress ratings as long as 16 weeks
      postpartum. These data imply that interventions designed to improve maternal
      sleep and postpartum mood should include both mothers and infants because
      improving infant sleep alone is not likely to improve maternal sleep, and poor
      infant sleep is linked to postpartum depression and stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bryophyllum pinnatum has been introduced in anthroposophic medicine
      in Europe and is nowadays also widely used in conventional medicine. The aim of
      this study was to assess the prescriptions in the field of gynaecology and
      obstetrics in Switzerland and to document potential effects and possible adverse 
      events of B. pinnatum. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Private practices and clinics for
      obstetrics and gynaecology were asked to document each prescription of B.
      pinnatum for their female patients during 31 months with an online questionnaire.
      RESULTS: At the University Hospital Zurich, at the Cantonal Hospital Winterthur
      as well as at 2 private practices, a total of 174 women and 208 prescriptions of 
      B. pinnatum were recorded (several prescriptions per patient were possible). Most
      of the patients were pregnant (87%). B. pinnatum was prescribed as a tocolytic
      agent to 83% of all patients and to 95% of all pregnant patients and showed a
      good or a very good effectiveness. Further, 14% of the patients received B.
      pinnatum for sedation against their restlessness during the day and 5% for
      sedation against sleep problems. A decrease of the restlessness was achieved for 
      these 2 indications. 13% of the patients suffered from a hyperactive bladder and 
      in two-thirds of them the effectiveness of the treatment with B. pinnatum was
      classified as very good. In 92% of the cases, Bryophyllum 50% chewable tablets
      were prescribed. CONCLUSIONS: In conventional gynaecology and obstetrics, B.
      pinnatum is predominantly prescribed for pregnant women in case of prematurel
      abour, against restlessness and for hyperactive bladder. B. pinnatum showed a
      good effectiveness with a high benefit in the treatment of
      hyperactivity-associated health problems.

TI  - Health coaching to prevent excessive gestational weight gain: A
      randomized-controlled trial.
PG  - 31-51
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12154 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a
      health coaching (HC) intervention designed to prevent excessive gestational
      weight gain (GWG), and promote positive psychosocial and motivational outcomes in
      comparison with an Education Alone (EA) group. DESIGN: Randomized-controlled
      trial. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-one women who were <18 weeks pregnant
      consented to take part. Those allocated to the HC group received a tailored HC
      intervention delivered by a Health Coach, whilst those in the EA group attended
      two education sessions. Women completed measures, including motivation,
      psychosocial variables, sleep quality, and knowledge, beliefs and expectations
      concerning GWG, at 15 weeks of gestation (Time 1) and 33 weeks of gestation (Time
      2). Post-birth data were also collected at 2 months post-partum (Time 3).
      RESULTS: There was no intervention effect in relation to weight gained during
      pregnancy, rate of excessive GWG or birth outcomes. The only differences between 
      HC and EA women were higher readiness (b = 0.29, 95% CIs = 0.03-0.55, p < .05)
      and the importance to achieve a healthy GWG (b = 0.27, 95% CIs = 0.02-0.52, p <
      .05), improved sleep quality (b = -0.22, 95% CIs = -0.44 to -0.03, p < .05), and 
      increased knowledge for an appropriate amount of GWG that would be best for their
      baby's health (b = -1.75, 95% CI = -3.26 to -0.24, p < .05) reported by the HC at
      Time 2. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the HC intervention was not successful in preventing 
      excessive GWG, several implications for the design of future GWG interventions
      were identified, including the burden of the intervention commitment and the use 
      of weight monitoring. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on the
      subject? Designing interventions to address gestational weight gain (GWG)
      continues to be a challenge. To date, health behaviour change factors have not
      been the focus of GWG interventions. What does this study add? Our health
      coaching (HC) intervention did not reduce GWG more so than education alone (EA). 
      There was an intervention effect on readiness and importance to achieve healthy
      GWG. Yet there were no group differences regarding confidence to achieve healthy 
      GWG post-intervention.

TI  - Mode of birth and early postnatal psychological morbidity.
PG  - 578-83
LID - 10.1111/ajo.12387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression affects the well-being of women and families.
      While several studies have shown an association between mode of birth and
      symptoms of postnatal depression, others have found no relationship. AIMS: To
      determine whether women who have instrumental or caesarean births report higher
      levels of poor coping, sleep or appetite disturbance, or relationship
      difficulties, than women who have vaginal births, at the time of Universal
      Postnatal Contact (7-10 days post-discharge). MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Retrospective cohort study of term, singleton births from 1st January 2013 to
      31st December 2013 at a tertiary obstetric facility. Outcomes were compared for
      1816 women having vaginal births versus 1205 women having instrumental or
      caesarean births. RESULTS: When adjusted for confounders, no association could be
      demonstrated between mode of birth and reporting of any postnatal symptom of
      psychological morbidity. However, the model did demonstrate an association
      between reporting of symptoms and nulliparity (aOR 1.69 (1.08-2.63); P = 0.02),
      as well as having an unplanned pregnancy with a supportive partner (aOR 0.54
      (0.29-0.97); P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Mode of birth does not appear to be
      associated with the reporting of symptoms of psychological morbidity in the early
      postnatal period. However, these symptoms may be associated with nulliparity and 
      in the context of an unplanned pregnancy, a lack of partner support. These
      findings highlight the ongoing need for antenatal screening with respect to
      pregnancy intention and the presence of a social support system, to facilitate
      the implementation of interventions for women at risk of postnatal depression.

TI  - The relationship between early life modifiable risk factors for childhood
      obesity, ethnicity and body mass index at age 3 years: findings from the Born in 
      Bradford birth cohort study.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/s40608-015-0037-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many modifiable risk factors in early infancy have been shown to be
      associated with childhood overweight and obesity. These risk factors have not
      been studied within children of South Asian origin in the UK. The aims of this
      paper are to describe differences in the prevalence of modifiable risk factors
      for childhood obesity between children of White British and Pakistani origin and 
      investigate the association between these risk factors and childhood BMI measured
      at age 3 years. We used data from a sub-study of the Born in Bradford birth
      cohort with detailed follow-up visits throughout early childhood. 987
      participants with a BMI measurement at age 3 were included; 39% were White
      British, 48% were of Pakistani origin and 13% were of other ethnicities. Linear
      and Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between risk
      factors and two outcomes at age 3; BMI z-scores and child overweight. RESULTS:
      Compared to Pakistani mothers, White British mothers were more likely to smoke
      during pregnancy, have higher BMI, breastfeed for a shorter duration and wean
      earlier, while Pakistani mothers had higher rates of gestational diabetes and
      were less active. There was no strong evidence that the relationship between risk
      factors and BMI z-score differed by ethnicity. There were associations between
      BMI z-score and maternal smoking (mean difference in BMI z-score 0.33 (95% CI
      0.13, 0.53)), maternal obesity (0.37 (0.19, 0.55)), indulgent feeding style (0.15
      (-0.06, 0.36)), lower parental warmth scores (0.21 (0.05, 0.36)) and higher
      parental hostility scores (0.17 (0.01, 0.33)). Consistent associations between
      these risk factors and child overweight were found. Mean BMI and the relative
      risk of being overweight were lower in children of mothers with lower parental
      self-efficacy scores and who watched more hours of TV. Other risk factors
      (gestational diabetes, child diet, child sleep, child TV viewing and maternal
      physical activity) were not associated with BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the
      prevalence of risk factors that have been associated with childhood greater BMI
      differ between White British and Pakistani the magnitude of their associations
      with BMI are similar in the two groups.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome-current therapies and management of augmentation.
PG  - 434-45
LID - 10.1038/nrneurol.2015.122 [doi]
AB  - Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) can severely affect quality of life and
      disturb sleep, so that pharmacological treatment is necessary, especially for
      elderly patients. Treatment guidelines recommend initiation of therapy with
      dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole or the rotigotine transdermal patch,
      all approved in most countries) or alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil,
      approved in the USA and Japan), depending on the country and availability. Where 
      approved, opioids (prolonged release oxycodone-naloxone, approved in Europe) are 
      also recommended as a second-line therapy for severe RLS. Several iron
      formulations can be effective but are not yet approved for RLS therapy, whereas
      benzodiazepines and other anticonvulsants are not recommended or approved. Less
      is known about effective management of RLS that is associated with other
      conditions, such as uraemia or pregnancy. Furthermore, very little data are
      available on the management of RLS when first-line treatment fails or patients
      experience augmentation. In this Review, we summarize state-of-the-art therapies 
      for RLS in the context of the diagnostic criteria and available guidelines, based
      on knowledge ranging from Class I evidence for the treatment of idiopathic RLS to
      Class IV evidence for the treatment of complications such as augmentation. We
      consider therapies, including combination therapies, that are used in clinical
      practice for long-term management of RLS, despite a lack of trials and approval, 
      and highlight the need for practical long-term evaluation of current trials.

AB  - This study examined the incidence of adverse prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal
      experiences amongst children with anxiety disorders, and the relationship to
      clinical symptomology and functional impairment in treatment-seeking children (N 
      = 107) with a primary anxiety disorder. Anxious children had higher rates of
      reported maternal prescription medication use during pregnancy, maternal smoking 
      and illness during pregnancy and neonatal complications (including neonatal
      intensive care and feeding issues) compared with population base rates and
      non-affected children. Almost one-third had early problems with sleep.
      Developmental problems were common with more than half having at least one area
      of delay. More than three quarters of anxious children had a first-degree family 
      member with a psychiatric history. There were several associations between
      neonatal complications and subsequent clinical symptomology, including attention 
      deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive comorbidity, anxiety severity and
      functional impairment. Findings suggest higher rates of perinatal complications
      in anxious children.

AB  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Estradiol and cognition". Subjective
      changes in concentration and memory are commonly reported by women during the
      second or third trimesters of pregnancy, but the nature of the problem is poorly 
      understood. We hypothesized that these self-reports might reflect difficulties in
      working memory (WM). It was further hypothesized that antepartum depression
      (depression arising during pregnancy) may play an etiological role, either on its
      own or due to secondary changes in endocrine function or sleep. Using WM tasks
      that emphasized executive control processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) we compared pregnant women tested at 34-36 weeks of gestation (n = 28) with
      age- and education-matched non-pregnant controls (n = 26). All pregnant women
      were screened for depression. Evidence of a WM disturbance was found, and was
      evident only among pregnant women showing depressive symptoms. In contrast,
      pregnant women who were not depressed showed WM performance that equalled, or
      even significantly exceeded, non-pregnant controls. No significant differences
      were observed on control tests of other cognitive functions. Multiple regression 
      revealed that serum estradiol concentrations, along with severity of depressive
      affect but not sleep disruption, significantly predicted variation in the WM
      scores. In agreement with studies of estradiol and WM in other contexts, higher
      estradiol was associated with better WM, while higher levels of depressive
      symptoms predicted poorer WM. We conclude that memory disturbance during
      gestation might not be as widespread as commonly believed, but can be seen among 
      women experiencing antepartum depression. The high level of WM performance found 
      in healthy, non-depressed, pregnant women is discussed from an adaptationist
      perspective.

AB  - Fever has been recognized as an important symptom of disease since ancient times.
      For many years, fever was treated as a putative life-threatening phenomenon. More
      recently, it has been recognized as an important part of the body's defense
      mechanisms; indeed at times it has even been used as a therapeutic agent. The
      knowledge of the functional role of the central nervous system in the genesis of 
      fever has greatly improved over the last decade. It is clear that the febrile
      process, which develops in the sick individual, is just one of many
      brain-controlled sickness symptoms. Not only will the sick individual appear
      "feverish" but they may also display a range of behavioral changes, such as
      anorexia, fatigue, loss of interest in usual daily activities, social withdrawal,
      listlessness or malaise, hyperalgesia, sleep disturbances and cognitive
      dysfunction, collectively termed "sickness behavior". In this review we consider 
      the issue of whether fever and sickness behaviors are friend or foe during: a
      critical illness, the common cold or influenza, in pregnancy and in the newborn. 
      Deciding whether these sickness responses are beneficial or harmful will very
      much shape our approach to the use of antipyretics during illness.

TI  - Evidence of Placental Hypoxia in Maternal Sleep Disordered Breathing.
PG  - 380-6
LID - 10.2350/15-06-1647-OA.1 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) represents a spectrum of disorders, including
      habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Sleep disordered breathing is
      characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia, airflow limitation, and recurrent 
      arousals, which may lead to tissue hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and inflammation. In
      this study, we aimed to examine whether SDB during pregnancy was associated with 
      histopathologic evidence of chronic placental hypoxia and/or uteroplacental
      underperfusion. The placentas of women with OSA (n = 23) and habitual snoring (n 
      = 78) as well as nonsnorer controls (n = 47) were assessed for histopathologic
      and immunohistochemical markers of chronic hypoxia and uteroplacental
      underperfusion. Fetal normoblastemia was significantly more prevalent in SDB
      placentas than in those of nonsnorer controls (34.6% and 56.5% in snorers and
      OSA, respectively, versus 6.4% in controls). Expression of the tissue hypoxia
      marker carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) was more common in OSA placentas than
      controls (81.5% and 91.3% in snorers and OSA, respectively, versus 57.5% in
      controls). Adjusting for confounders such as body mass index, diabetes mellitus, 
      or chronic hypertension did not alter the results. The uteroplacental
      underperfusion scores were similar among the 3 groups. Our findings suggest that 
      SDB during pregnancy is associated with fetoplacental hypoxia, as manifested by
      fetal normoblastemia and increased placental carbonic anhydrase IX
      immunoreactivity. The clinical implications and underlying mechanisms remain to
      be determined.

TI  - The study of women, infant feeding and type 2 diabetes after GDM pregnancy and
      growth of their offspring (SWIFT Offspring study): prospective design,
      methodology and baseline characteristics.
PG  - 150
LID - 10.1186/s12884-015-0587-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of becoming overweight 
      or obese later in life. Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than
      formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose
      intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable.
      Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces 
      the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address
      this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after
      GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring
      Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from
      the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether
      breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related 
      to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article
      details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and
      methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM
      mother-infant pairs. METHODS: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among
      GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three
      in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for
      infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal
      circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body 
      weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed
      questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep
      and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several
      sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams)
      from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal
      and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records.
      Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies. DISCUSSION:
      This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable
      evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy
      independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk
      factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of
      breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life.

TI  - Directed preconception health programs and interventions for improving pregnancy 
      outcomes for women who are overweight or obese.
PG  - CD010932
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010932.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity (body mass index (BMI) >/= 25.0 to 29.9
      kg/m(2) and BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2,) respectively are increasingly common among women 
      of reproductive age. Overweight and obesity are known to be associated with many 
      adverse health conditions in the preconception period, during pregnancy and
      during the labour and postpartum period. There are no current guidelines to
      suggest which preconception health programs and interventions are of benefit to
      these women and their infants. It is important to evaluate the available evidence
      to establish which preconception interventions are of value to this population of
      women. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of preconception health programs
      and interventions for improving pregnancy outcomes in overweight and obese women.
      SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials 
      Register (31 December 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (including those using a
      cluster-randomised design), comparing health programs and interventions with
      routine care in women of reproductive age and a BMI greater then or equal to 25
      kg/m(2). Studies published in abstract form only, were not eligible for
      inclusion. Quasi-randomised trials or randomised trials using a cross-over design
      were not eligible for inclusion in this review. The intervention in such studies 
      would involve an assessment of preconception health and lead to an individualised
      preconception program addressing any areas of concern for that particular
      woman.Preconception interventions could involve any or all of: provision of
      specific information, screening for and treating obesity-related health problems,
      customised or general dietary and exercise advice, medical or surgical
      interventions. Medical interventions may include treatment of pre-existing
      hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance or sleep apnoea. Surgical interventions 
      may include interventions such as bariatric surgery. The comparator was
      prespecified to be standard preconception advice or no advice/interventions. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria
      for this review. The search identified one study (published in four trial
      reports) which was independently assessed by two review authors and subsequently 
      excluded. MAIN RESULTS: There are no included trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We
      found no randomised controlled trials that assessed the effect of preconception
      health programs and interventions in overweight and obese women with the aim of
      improving pregnancy outcomes. Until the effectiveness of preconception health
      programs and interventions can be established, no practice recommendations can be
      made. Further research is required in this area.

      Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young adulthood is a critical life period for health and health
      behaviours. Related measurements collected before and after birth, and during
      childhood and adolescence can provide a life-course analysis of important factors
      that contribute to health and behaviour in young adulthood. The Western
      Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study has collected a large number of such
      measurements during the fetal, perinatal, infancy, childhood and adolescence
      periods and plans to relate them to common health issues and behaviours in young 
      adults, including spinal pain, asthma, sleep disorders, physical activity and
      sedentary behaviour and, work absenteeism and presenteeism. The aim of this paper
      is to describe the rationale, design and methods of the 22 year follow-up of the 
      Raine Study cohort. METHODS/DESIGN: The Raine Study is a prospective cohort
      study. Participants still active in the cohort (n = 2,086) were contacted around 
      the time of their 22nd birthday and invited to participate in the 22 year
      follow-up. Each was asked to complete a questionnaire, attend a research facility
      for physical assessment and an overnight sleep study, wear activity monitors for 
      a week, and to maintain a sleep and activity diary over this week. The
      questionnaire was broad and included questions related to sociodemographics,
      medical history, quality of life, psychological factors, lifestyle factors,
      spinal pain, respiratory, sleep, activity and work factors. Physical assessments 
      included anthropometry, blood pressure, back muscle endurance, tissue
      sensitivity, lung function, airway reactivity, allergic status, 3D facial
      photographs, cognitive function, and overnight polysomnography. DISCUSSION:
      Describing the prevalence of these health issues and behaviours in young
      adulthood will enable better recognition of the issues and planning of health
      care resources. Providing a detailed description of the phenotype of these issues
      will provide valuable information to help educate health professionals of the
      needs of young adults. Understanding the life-course risk factors of health
      issues and behaviours in young adulthood will have important health planning
      implications, supporting the development of targeted interventions to improve
      current health status and reduce the onset and development of further ill-health 
      across adulthood.

TI  - The Association of Restless Legs Syndrome to History of Gestational Diabetes in
      an Appalachian Primary Care Population.
PG  - 1121-30
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.5084 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a burdensome sensorimotor disorder
      that has been linked to diabetes and obesity. However, the relationship of RLS to
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common pregnancy complication strongly
      associated with obesity and a harbinger of diabetes, remains unknown. In this
      study, we examined the association of RLS to history of GDM in a sample of older 
      female primary care patients. METHODS: Participants were community-dwelling women
      aged >/= 40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia adult
      primary care patients. Data gathered included detailed information on
      demographics, lifestyle factors, reproductive history, sleep patterns, and
      medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women 
      who were pregnant or had missing data on key variables were excluded from the
      analyses. RESULTS: Of the 498 participants included in the final analytic sample,
      24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms at least once/week).
      After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, body mass index,
      diabetes and other comorbid conditions, parity, and other factors, those
      reporting history of GDM were almost three times as likely to meet criteria for
      RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3, 5.3). This
      association increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR
      for RLS symptoms >/= 3x/week = 4.8, CI 2.1, 11.2, p for trend = 0.004).
      CONCLUSIONS: History of GDM was strongly and positively related to RLS in this
      study of older female primary care patients, offering further support for a
      possible role of metabolic dysregulation in RLS development.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing occurs in 0.6-15% of reproductive age women. This
      condition is associated with an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular
      disease, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. A substantial body of
      evidence demonstrated increased perinatal morbidity among pregnancies affected by
      SDB including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia.
      These same conditions are predictive of later cardiovascular disease. Treatment
      of SDB has been demonstrated to decrease future cardiovascular events and
      mortality. Screening at-risk individuals in the perinatal period can identify
      women with SDB, who can benefit from treatment. Continuous positive airway
      pressure and lifestyle interventions can decrease subsequent adverse
      cardiovascular health outcomes.

TI  - Effects of intrauterine growth restriction on sleep and the cardiovascular
      system: The use of melatonin as a potential therapy?

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) complicates 5-10% of pregnancies and is
      associated with increased risk of preterm birth, mortality and neurodevelopmental
      delay. The development of sleep and cardiovascular control are closely coupled
      and IUGR is known to alter this development. In the long-term, IUGR is associated
      with altered sleep and an increased risk of hypertension in adulthood. Melatonin 
      plays an important role in the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental animal studies have
      shown that melatonin therapy has neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in 
      the IUGR fetus. Consequently, clinical trials are currently underway to assess
      the short and long term effects of antenatal melatonin therapy in IUGR
      pregnancies. Given melatonin's role in sleep regulation, this hormone could
      affect the developing infants' sleep-wake cycle and cardiovascular function after
      birth. In this review, we will 1) examine the role of melatonin as a therapy for 
      IUGR pregnancies and the potential implications on sleep and the cardiovascular
      system; 2) examine the development of sleep-wake cycle in fetal and neonatal
      life; 3) discuss the development of cardiovascular control during sleep; 4)
      discuss the effect of IUGR on sleep and the cardiovascular system and 5) discuss 
      the future implications of melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies.

TI  - Sepiapterin Reductase Deficiency
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: The phenotypic spectrum of sepiapterin reductase
      deficiency (SRD), which ranges from significant motor and cognitive deficits to
      only minimal findings, has not been completely elucidated. Clinical features in
      the majority of affected individuals include motor and speech delay, axial
      hypotonia, dystonia, weakness, and oculogyric crises; symptoms show diurnal
      fluctuation and sleep benefit. Other common features include parkinsonian signs
      (tremor, bradykinesia, masked facies, rigidity), limb hypertonia, hyperreflexia, 
      intellectual disability, psychiatric and/or behavioral abnormalities, autonomic
      dysfunction, and sleep disturbances (hypersomnolence, difficulty initiating or
      maintaining sleep, and drowsiness). Most affected individuals have nonspecific
      features in infancy including developmental delays and axial hypotonia; other
      features develop over time. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of sepiapterin
      reductase deficiency is established in a proband by detection of biallelic
      pathogenic variants in SPR on molecular genetic testing or characteristic
      abnormalities of CSF neurotransmitters and pterins. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: L-dopa in combination with carbidopa (or another peripheral
      decarboxylase inhibitor) is the main therapy used to correct CNS dopamine
      deficiency; 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), also in combination with carbidopa, has 
      shown additional clinical benefit in some. When L-dopa/5HTP/carbidopa are not
      tolerated or sufficiently effective some individuals may benefit from use of
      other agents such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
      melatonin, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, and methylphenidate. These
      medications most consistently correct motor abnormalities; however, in some
      individuals cognitive manifestations remain more refractory. Prevention of
      secondary complications: Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may improve
      or maintain motor function. Surveillance: Data are insufficient to determine how 
      frequently CSF levels of dopamine and serotonin metabolites should be evaluated
      and whether these levels should be used to adjust medication doses.
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although adverse events with specific agents have 
      not been reported in persons with SRD, the following should be avoided on a
      theoretic basis: sulfa drugs, methotrexate, nitrous oxide, neuroleptics, and
      other dopamine antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide). Evaluation of relatives at
      risk: Although no data on outcomes are available, it is appropriate to use
      molecular genetic testing for the SPR pathogenic variants identified in the
      proband and/or analysis of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins to
      clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of
      an affected individual in order to identify as soon as possible those who would
      benefit from early initiation of treatment to correct CNS dopamine and serotonin 
      deficiency. GENETIC COUNSELING: SRD is inherited in an autosomal recessive
      manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of
      being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance
      of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and 
      prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the SPR
      pathogenic variants in the family are known.

TI  - [Relationship between the Psychiatric Symptoms in Expecting Parents and
      Postpartum Depression and Infantile Colic: A Multicenter Follow up Study].
PG  - 87-98
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between
      postpartum depression (PPD), infantile colic (IC) and different psychosocial
      variables, psychiatric symptoms, attachment style and perceived social support in
      expecting parents. METHOD: Two hundred forty five expecting mothers and 150
      expecting fathers were first interviewed between the 22-34 weeks of pregnancy.
      Sociodemografic data form, Adult Attachment Style Scale (AASS), State Anxiety
      Inventory (SAI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Multidimensional
      Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) were 
      filled out by each expecting parent. Second interview was conducted between the
      postpartum 4-24 weeks. Data form consisting health, nutrition, sleep and crying
      problems of the infant and EPDS and SAI were filled out by mothers and SAI by
      fathers. RESULTS: One in every four mothers had PPD symptoms above the threshold 
      on EPDS. Maternal and paternal insecure attachment style, maternal psychiatric
      symptoms and postpartum anxiety level were found to be the predictors of PPD. One
      in every five infants had IC and maternal education level, hostility score and
      PPD symptoms along with paternal insecure attachment style and psychiatric
      symptoms were the main predictors of IC. CONCLUSION: Results about PPD and IC
      regarding maternal variables are consistent with the literature. In addition,
      paternal insecure attachment style is found to be an important risk factor for
      both PPD and IC. Fathers should also be included in further studies exploring PPD
      or IC.

TI  - Automated Software Analysis of Fetal Movement Recorded during a Pregnant Woman's 
      Sleep at Home.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0130503 [doi]
AB  - Fetal movement is an important biological index of fetal well-being. Since 2008, 
      we have been developing an original capacitive acceleration sensor and device
      that a pregnant woman can easily use to record fetal movement by herself at home 
      during sleep. In this study, we report a newly developed automated software
      system for analyzing recorded fetal movement. This study will introduce the
      system and compare its results to those of a manual analysis of the same fetal
      movement signals (Experiment I). We will also demonstrate an appropriate way to
      use the system (Experiment II). In Experiment I, fetal movement data reported
      previously for six pregnant women at 28-38 gestational weeks were used. We
      evaluated the agreement of the manual and automated analyses for the same 10-sec 
      epochs using prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) including
      quantitative indicators for prevalence and bias. The mean PABAK value was 0.83,
      which can be considered almost perfect. In Experiment II, twelve pregnant women
      at 24-36 gestational weeks recorded fetal movement at night once every four
      weeks. Overall, mean fetal movement counts per hour during maternal sleep
      significantly decreased along with gestational weeks, though individual
      differences in fetal development were noted. This newly developed automated
      analysis system can provide important data throughout late pregnancy.

TI  - Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficiency has been
      categorized in the past as either neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick disease type A
      [NPD-A]), with death in early childhood, or non-neuronopathic (Niemann-Pick
      disease type B [NPD-B]). While forms intermediate to these two extremes occur,
      all ASM deficiency that is not NPD-A is designated in this review as NPD-B,
      despite its wide range of manifestations and severity. The first symptom in NPD-A
      is hepatosplenomegaly, usually noted by age three months; over time the liver and
      spleen become massive. Psychomotor development progresses no further than the
      12-month level, after which neurologic deterioration is relentless. A classic
      cherry-red spot of the macula of the retina, which may not be present in the
      first few months, is eventually present in all affected children. Interstitial
      lung disease caused by storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages results 
      in frequent respiratory infections and often respiratory failure. Most children
      succumb before the third year. NPD type B, later in onset and milder in
      manifestations than NPD type A, is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly with
      progressive hypersplenism and stable liver dysfunction, gradual deterioration in 
      pulmonary function, osteopenia, and atherogenic lipid profile. Progressive and/or
      clinically significant neurologic manifestations occur infrequently. Survival to 
      adulthood can occur. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ASM deficiency is
      established by detection of either biallelic pathogenic variants in SMPD1 or
      residual ASM enzyme activity that is less than 10% of controls (in peripheral
      blood lymphocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: NPD-A. Physical and occupational therapy; feeding tube for
      nutrition and sedatives for irritability and sleep disturbance as indicated.
      NPD-B. Transfusion of blood products for life-threatening bleeding; supplemental 
      oxygen for symptomatic pulmonary disease; treatment of hyperlipidemia in adults; 
      adequate calorie intake. Surveillance: NPD-A. Periodic assessments of nutritional
      status and gross and fine motor skills. NPD-B. Annual (or more frequent)
      assessments: growth in children and weight in all ages; changes in activity
      level; bleeding; shortness of breath; abdominal pain; neurologic function; liver 
      enzymes, platelet count, and fasting lipid profile; pulmonary function and chest 
      radiograph; dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as indicated in those with
      osteoporosis. Circumstances to avoid: NPD-B: Contact sports in those who have
      splenomegaly. GENETIC COUNSELING: ASM deficiency is inherited in an autosomal
      recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25%
      chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk
      relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible
      if both SMPD1 pathogenic variants in the family are known. Prenatal diagnosis for
      pregnancies at 25% risk is also possible by testing of ASM enzyme activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for urinary incontinence (UI) and assess the 
      quality of life (QoL) of affected women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was
      conducted of all women with UI who attended the urology and gynecology services
      of four hospitals in central Portugal between March and December 2012.
      Information was obtained from participants using questionnaires assessing
      sociodemographic, obstetric, gynecologic, and lifestyle variables. RESULTS: Among
      505 participants, 351 (69.5%) had urgency UI, 107 (21.2%) stress UI, and 47
      (9.3%) mixed UI. Stress UI was associated with smoking, alcohol consumption,
      constipation, gravidity, parity, and vaginal infections (P</=0.02 for all).
      Urgency UI was associated with age above 50 years, employment, smoking, and
      sitting for 2 hours or less per day (P</=0.02 for all). Mixed UI was associated
      with age 50 years or younger, smoking, sitting for 2 hours or less per day, and
      frequently carrying more than 3 kg in weight (P<0.001 for all). A negative impact
      on QoL was reported by 501 (99.2%) women. Compared with younger participants,
      women older than 50 years presented with more sleep/energy disturbances and
      performance limitations (P</=0.04 for both). CONCLUSION: UI is associated with
      several risk factors and has a negative impact on QoL. Appropriate investigation 
      regarding the factors associated with the types of UI should be performed to
      diminish its impact on QoL.

TI  - Does Infant Reactivity Moderate the Association Between Antenatal Maternal
      Depression and Infant Sleep?
PG  - 440-9
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000181 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A number of studies have established an association between antenatal 
      maternal depression and infant sleep. One key question is whether all infants are
      equally susceptible to environmental influences, including the intrauterine
      environment. Reactive temperament has been examined as a plasticity factor, with 
      accumulating evidence suggesting that infants with reactive temperament may be
      more susceptible to both positive and negative environmental influences. This
      study examines whether infant reactivity moderates any association between
      antenatal depression and infant sleep in 2 longitudinal studies: the Avon
      Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and Generation R cohorts.
      METHODS: Maternal depression scores were assessed during pregnancy using
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Brief Symptom Inventory. Infant sleep
      duration and awakenings, in ALSPAC (N = 8318) and Generation R (N = 2241), were
      assessed at 18 and 24 months of age, respectively. Infant reactivity was assessed
      by temperament questionnaire at 6 months of age. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear
      regression models indicated a 3-way interaction between reactivity and gender
      moderating the effect of antenatal depression on infant sleep, on sleep duration 
      in Generation R at 24 months (beta = .085, p < .001) in the whole sample and when
      limited to the Dutch/European group (beta = .055, p = .030), and on night
      awakenings at 18 months in ALSPAC (beta = -.085, p = .013). Boys with more
      reactive temperament exhibited shorter sleep duration and a higher number of
      awakenings when previously exposed to maternal symptoms of antenatal depression. 
      CONCLUSION: For the first time, these findings highlight, in 2 large cohorts,
      that children with temperamental reactivity may be more vulnerable to antenatal
      depression, raising the possibility of targeted interventions to improve infant
      outcomes.

TI  - Comparing Self-Reported Infant Safe Sleep From Community- and Health Care-Based
      Settings.
PG  - 205-10
LID - 10.1177/2150131914567967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare self-reported safe sleep data from a community social
      service agency and primary care centers. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS:
      Cross-sectional Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)-based survey 
      data from a community social service agency and survey data from primary care
      centers were compared using descriptive statistics. There were 166 community
      survey respondents, average age of 25 years (SD = 5.4 years), and 79 primary care
      center respondents, average age of 24 years (SD = 5.4 years). Two binary logistic
      regressions were performed to examine the association between demographic
      differences and safe sleep position/bed sharing. RESULTS: Safe sleep position
      responses did not differ significantly between the community-based (n = 126, 85%)
      and primary care center-based (n = 62, 79%) samples, chi(2)(1) = 0.79, P = .372. 
      Reported bed sharing was significantly higher in the community sample (n = 54,
      36%) than the health care center sample (n = 4, 5%), Fisher's exact test, P<
      .001. Black race was determined to be significantly associated with increased
      unsafe sleep positioning (OR = 2.86, P = .022). The community center cohort was
      the only significant predictor of bed sharing (OR = 25.40, P = .002). CONCLUSION:
      Differences in reported safe sleep environments may be due to knowledge variances
      of safe sleep guidelines, or clinic-based respondents may have been more likely
      to provide socially desirable responses. The comparison data further highlight
      the need for continued targeted effort to improve safe sleep behaviors to improve
      infant health outcomes.

TI  - Sleep Trajectories of Women Undergoing Elective Cesarean Section: Effects on Body
      Weight and Psychological Well-Being.
PG  - e0129094
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0129094 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After cesarean section (CS), women may be at great risk for sleep
      disturbance, but little is known about temporal changes in their sleep patterns
      and characteristics. We had two aims: 1) to identify distinct classes of
      sleep-disturbance trajectories in women considering elective CS from
      third-trimester pregnancy to 6 months post-CS and 2) to examine associations of
      sleep trajectories with body mass index (BMI), depressive symptoms, and fatigue
      scores. METHODS: We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study of 139
      Taiwanese pregnant women who elected CS. Sleep components were assessed using the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in third-trimester pregnancy, 1 day, 1 week, 1
      month, and 6 months post-CS. Data were collected on depressive symptoms, fatigue 
      symptoms, and BMI. Sleep-quality trajectories were identified by group-based
      trajectory modeling. RESULTS: We identified three distinct trajectories: stable
      poor sleep (50 women, 36.0%), progressively worse sleep (67 women, 48.2%), and
      persistently poor sleep (22 women, 15.8%). Poor sleep was significantly
      associated with pre-pregnancy BMI and more baseline (third-trimester pregnancy)
      depressive and fatigue symptoms. At 6 months post-CS, women classified as
      progressively worse or persistently poor sleepers showed a trend toward higher
      BMI (p<0.03), more depressive symptoms (p<0.001), and higher fatigue scores
      (p<0.001) than those with stable poor sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Women had three
      distinct sleep-disturbance trajectories before and after elective CS. These
      poor-sleep courses were associated with BMI and psychological well-being. Our
      findings suggest a need to continuously assess sleep quality among women
      considering elective CS and up to 6 months post-CS.

AB  - UNLABELLED: This article is part of a Special Issue "Parental Care". Jay
      Rosenblatt effectively promoted research on rabbit maternal behavior through his 
      interaction with colleagues in Mexico. Here we review the activities of pregnant 
      and lactating rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), their neuro-hormonal regulation,
      and the synchronization of behavior between mother and kits. Changing
      concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin throughout gestation
      regulate nest-building (digging, straw-carrying, fur-pulling) and prime the
      mother's brain to respond to the newborn. Nursing is the only mother-young
      contact throughout lactation. It happens once/day, inside the nest, with ca. 24h 
      periodicity, and lasts around 3min. Periodicity and duration of nursing depend on
      a threshold of suckling as procedures reducing the amount of nipple stimulation
      interfere with the temporal aspects of nursing, though not with the doe's
      maternal motivation. Synchronization between mother and kits, critical for
      nursing, relies on: a) the production of pheromonal cues which guide the young to
      the mother's nipples for suckling; b) an endogenous circadian rhythm of
      anticipatory activity in the young, present since birth. Milk intake entrains the
      kits' locomotor behavior, corticosterone secretion, and the activity of several
      brain structures. Sibling interactions within the huddle, largely determined by
      body mass at birth, are important for: a) maintaining body temperature; b)
      ensuring normal neuromotor and social development. Suckling maintains nursing
      behavior past the period of abundant milk production but abrupt and efficient
      weaning occurs in concurrently pregnant-lactating does by unknown factors.
      CONCLUSION: female rabbits have evolved a reproductive strategy largely
      dissociating maternal care from maternal presence, whose multifactorial
      regulation warrants future investigations.

AB  - During the perinatal period, compromises in sleep duration and quality are
      commonly reported by women and confirmed by objective measurements of sleep.
      Self-reported poor sleep has been associated with concurrent mood disturbance and
      with increased risk for future mood problems during pregnancy and the postpartum 
      period. Findings on the relationship between objectively measured sleep and mood 
      in perinatal women have been mixed. This article reviews the literature on the
      nature of and contributing factors to perinatal sleep disturbance, the
      relationship between sleep and mood, and intervention studies that aim to improve
      maternal sleep.

TI  - Static Postural Stability in Women during and after Pregnancy: A Prospective
      Longitudinal Study.
PG  - e0124207
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0124207 [doi]
AB  - This longitudinal study aimed to compare static postural stability in women
      between early pregnancy, advanced pregnancy, and at 2 and 6 months postpartum.
      Forty-five pregnant women were enrolled and 31 completed the protocol. Data were 
      collected at 7-16 and 34-39 weeks gestation, and at 6-10 and 26-30 weeks
      postpartum. For each subject, the center of foot pressure path length and mean
      velocity (with directional subcomponents) were computed from 30-s long
      quiet-standing trials on a stationary force plate with eyes open or closed. The
      body mass, stance width, and sleep duration within 24 h before testing were also 
      recorded. Static postural stability was not different between pregnancy and
      postpartum, except for the anterior posterior sway tested in the eyes-closed
      condition, which was significantly increased in late pregnancy compared to that
      at 2 and 6 months postpartum. Pregnant/postpartum women's body mass weakly
      positively correlated with anterior-posterior sway in the eyes-closed condition
      and their stance width weakly positively correlated with the anterior-posterior
      sway in the eyes-open condition. No effect of sleep duration on postural sway was
      found. Our findings indicate that under visual deprivation conditions women in
      advanced pregnancy may have decreased static stability compared to their
      non-pregnant state.

TI  - Being Born Small for Gestational Age Influences Amplitude-Integrated
      Electroencephalography and Later Outcome in Preterm Infants.
PG  - 81-7
LID - 10.1159/000382013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of growth restriction on perinatal morbidity is well
      known, but electroencephalographic (EEG) data on its influence are still scarce. 
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze the influence of being born small for gestational
      age (SGA; defined as a birth weight <10th percentile) on the amplitude-integrated
      EEG (aEEG) score in the first 2 weeks of life in preterm infants born before 30
      weeks of gestation, and its impact on later outcome. METHODS: aEEG data obtained 
      within the first 2 weeks of life on preterm infants born SGA and before 30 weeks 
      of gestational age (GA) were analyzed retrospectively using a combined score
      [including background activity, occurrence of sleep-wake cycles (SWC) and
      suspected seizure activity]. Neurodevelopmental outcome was evaluated at 24
      months by means of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and a standardized 
      neurological examination. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-six patients were
      included (47 SGA and 89 controls). Infants with SGA had abnormal aEEG scores
      significantly more often (57 vs. 24%, p = 0.002) than infants born appropriate
      for gestational age (AGA). They also displayed SWC less frequently (65 vs. 96%, p
      = 0.001), were more likely to develop seizure activity (15 vs. 4%, p = 0.013) and
      had a normal neurodevelopmental outcome at the age of 2 years less frequently
      (36.2 vs. 59.6%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Preterm infants born SGA and before 30
      weeks of GA had less optimal scores on early aEEG and a poorer neurodevelopmental
      outcome at 24 months than the AGA controls.
