AB  - Pregnancy-related low back pain is a common problem during pregnancy. More than half of all pregnant women experience low back pain at some time during pregnancy. The pain can vary from a mild discomfort to being severe and disabling. In one-third of these women, pain is a severe problem compromising activities of daily living, work and sleep. The awareness of the possible impact of low back pain on the quality of life and the associated costs to society has increased medical attention over the last decade. Pain usually develops between the fifth and seventh month of pregnancy but may appear as early as the first trimester. Moreover, some women who experience back pain during pregnancy experience persistent back pain in the postpartum period or have an increased risk of back pain in subsequent pregnancies, and many women with chronic back pain link its onset to a pregnancy. Despite its high frequency, there are some ambiguities inherent in the terminology, diagnosis and classification. The etiology and pathogenesis are not yet clearly understood. The etiology of pain is probably related to a combination of mechanical, hormonal and vascular contributing factors. Low back pain in pregnancy is most commonly subdivided into lumbar pain and posterior pelvic pain. This subdivision is important in terms of both management and prognosis. Characteristic findings and treatment may differ between the two categories. Accurate assessment and effective treatment are important for managing the low back pain of pregnancy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate the effect of socioeconomic status on measures of sleep quality, continuity, and quantity in a large cohort of pregnant women. Design Prospective, longitudinal study. Participants One hundred seventy (170) pregnant women at 10-20 weeks gestation. Methods Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Sleep duration and continuity (sleep fragmentation index [SFI]) were assessed with actigraphy at 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation. Because sleep did not significantly differ across time, averages across all three time points were used in analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) was defined by self-reported annual household income. Linear regression analyses were used to model the independent associations of SES on sleep after adjusting for age, race, parity, marital status, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial strain. Results On average, women reported modestly poor sleep quality ( M = 5.4, SD = 2.7), short sleep duration (391 [55.6] min) and fragmented sleep (SFI M = 33.9, SD = 10.4. A household income < $50,000/year was associated with poorer sleep quality (β = -.18, p < 0.05) and greater sleep fragmentation (β = -.18, p < 0.05) following covariate adjustment. Conclusions Low SES was associated with poorer sleep quality and fragmented sleep, even after statistical adjustments. Perceived stress and financial strain attenuated SES-sleep associations indicating that psychosocial situations preceding pregnancy are also important to consider.

AB  - Background: Lead is a pervasive neurotoxicant that has been associated with poorer cognitive, behavioral, and motor outcomes in children. The effects of lead on sensory function have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant sensory function, as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and grating visual acuity (VA).Methods: Lead was measured in maternal blood in mid- and late-pregnancy (mean gestational age = 15.5 and 39.0 weeks, respectively) and umbilical cord blood in a cohort of full-term infants in rural northeastern China. ABR latencies (peaks I, III, V) were measured in newborns during unsedated sleep (n = 315). The ABR central-to-peripheral (C-P) ratio was calculated as the ratio between the III-V and I-III interpeak intervals. VA was measured in 6-week-olds using Teller Acuity Cards (n = 1019) and assigned as the narrowest grid the infant fixated on. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between tertiles of mid-pregnancy, late-pregnancy, or cord lead and newborn ABR or 6-week VA.Results: Higher late-pregnancy lead levels were associated with higher ABR C-P ratios and lower VA. In covariate-adjusted analyses, mean C-P ratios were 4.6 and 3.2 % higher in infants whose mothers had lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, than for infants whose mothers had lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.002). In adjusted analyses for VA, mean scores were 8.5 and 7.2 % lower for maternal lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, compared to lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.009).Conclusion: Auditory and visual systems maturation appears delayed in infants with higher prenatal lead exposure during late-pregnancy, even at relatively low levels. Both systems start myelinating in late gestation and mature rapidly in infancy. Higher ABR C-P ratio and lower grating VA scores suggest effects of low-level lead exposure on sensory system myelination.

AB  - Unlabelled: Amplitude integrated electroencephalogaphy (aEEG) is becoming an important tool for the assessment of cerebral activity in preterm newborns. Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological lesion/death. Preterm newborns with a birth weight ≤1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and bandwidth (BW). Key outcomes were severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV III/IHP, a low-voltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological lesion/death. Absent SWCs during the first 72 h were also related to death.Conclusion: Early aEEG patterns can be predictive of neurological outcome in the preterm newborn. Low-voltage tracing and absence of SWCs are associated with severe neurological lesions/death.

AB  - Background: Previous research has established a number of risk factors that are associated with the onset of PTSD following childbirth. However, little is known about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms.Methods: This study is part of the Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum.Results: We found several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further, insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum.Limitations: Limitations of the study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia from PTSD symptoms.Conclusions: Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD treatments.

AB  - Background: Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes. Methods: Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have been used for comparison. Findings: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone-rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed. Interpretation: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.

AB  - Background Average annual fertility rates in industrialised countries have been below two children per woman for the past 3 decades. The reasons behind women's childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of awareness regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome the 'biological clock' may be contributory factors. Objective A narrative review guided by the research question: What do women need to know about the consequences of delayed childbearing in order to make informed decisions about their fertility? Discussion There are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing and; some women's ideas about their fertility don't match the 'the scientific facts'. General practitioners are well placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research is needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse model. DESIGN: Case-control comparison in a murine model. SETTING: University research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice. INTERVENTIONS: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5% O2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1) by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P < 0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 ± 6.4% in normoxia to 12.8 ± 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 ± 0.10 and 2.45 ± 0.73, respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 ± 0.16 and 5.80 ± 1.24, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate prospectively the association between male sleep duration and fecundability.Design: Pregnancy Online Study (PRESTO), a Web-based prospective cohort study of North American couples enrolled during the preconception period (2013-2017).Setting: Not applicable.Patient(s): Male participants were aged ≥21 years; female participants were aged 21-45 years.Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): At enrollment, men reported their average nightly sleep duration in the previous month. Pregnancy status was updated on female follow-up questionnaires every 8 weeks for up to 12 months or until conception. Analyses were restricted to 1,176 couples who had been attempting to conceive for up to six cycles at enrollment. Proportional probabilities regression models were used to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders.Result(s): Relative to 8 hours per night of sleep, multivariable-adjusted FRs for <6, 6, 7, and ≥9 hours per night of sleep were 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.87), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87-1.30), 0.97 (95% CI 0.81-1.17), and 0.73 (95% CI 0.46-1.15), respectively. The association between short sleep duration (<6 hours per night) and fecundability was similar among men not working nights or rotating shifts (FR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88) and among men without a history of infertility (FR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87) and was stronger among fathers (FR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76).Conclusion(s): Short sleep duration in men was associated with reduced fecundability. Because male factor accounts for 50% of couple infertility, identifying modifiable determinants of infertility could provide alternatives to expensive fertility workups and treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness. METHOD: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. RESULTS: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

AB  - Maternal pregravid obesity is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes during pregnancy. In early pregnancy there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. In later gestation maternal metabolic manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, become clinically recognized because of the increased insulin resistance in obese compared with nonobese women. In women with pregestational glucose intolerance, hypertension, central obesity, and lipid disorders, the physiologic changes in pregnancy increase the risk of problems previously not routinely encountered during pregnancy. These include chronic cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. At parturition the obese patient is at an increased risk of cesarean delivery and associated complications of anesthesia, wound disruption, infection, and deep venous thrombophlebitis. For the fetus there are short-term risks of fetal macrosomia, more specifically obesity, and long-term risks of adolescent components of the metabolic syndrome. Although preliminary results of bariatric surgery are encouraging, the procedure is expensive and not for all obese women, and we recognize that long-term follow-up data on offspring of obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery before pregnancy are lacking. In the interim, we need to encourage obese women to lose weight before conception, using lifestyle changes if possible. During pregnancy, weight gain should be limited to Institute of Medicine guidelines (currently under review) and encouragement given for physical activity.

AB  - PURPOSE: Mandibular retrognathia may cause upper airway obstruction in the pediatric patient due to tongue collapse and physical obstruction in the hypopharyngeal region. Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO) may be a useful treatment option to avoid tracheostomy. This study reviews 35 patients who underwent DO as treatment for concomitant jaw discrepancy and corrective airway management. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients, 20 male and 15 female, with airway obstruction were evaluated retrospectively using clinic and hospital records. The mean age was 3.5 months (range, 36 weeks' gestation to 4 years). The group consisted of patients with Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Opitz's syndrome, Down syndrome with obstructive sleep apnea, Goldenhar's syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and mandibular retrognathia. All patients had obstruction limited to the upper airway related to severe retrognathia and posterior tongue-base displacement confirmed with direct laryngoscopy. All patients underwent mandibular DO to avoid or remove a tracheostomy and allow development of speech and normal feeding. Each patient underwent bilateral mandibular corticotomies and placement of 2 percutaneous Kirchner wires and extraoral distraction devices. Following a 0-day latency, DO was performed at 3 to 5 mm per day (mean: 4 mm per day) for a mean total of 22.5 mm (range, 15-32 mm). The mean consolidation period was 28 days (range, 20-42 days). Preoperative radiographs (lateral cephalometric radiograph and/or CT scan) were obtained in all cases preoperatively and at least 3 months postoperatively for analysis. RESULTS: All patients experienced resolution of obstructive upper airway symptoms during the DO process. No patient required tracheostomy, and pre-existing tracheostomy devices were decannulated before DO completion. Apnea monitors failed to trigger in any patient postdistraction, and sleep studies were normal. The mean follow-up period was 9 months (range, 4-18 months). Radiographic analysis revealed the mean increase in posterior airway space was 12 mm. The mean decrease in overjet was 12 mm. Mandibular length increased a mean of 15 mm, and the sella-nasion-B point angle increased a mean of 16 degrees. DO complications included premature consolidation requiring manual refracture, hypertrophic scarring, device replacement, apertognathia with resolution within 8 to 12 weeks following device removal, and intraoral pin exposure. There were no cases of pin site infections or development of temporomandibular ankylosis. CONCLUSION: Mandibular distraction osteogenesis is a viable option for the pediatric patient with upper airway obstruction due to mandibular deficiency to avoid a tracheostomy or other surgical intervention. Mandibular DO treats the etiology of the disease process and may allow for future growth.

AB  - Background: Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses following childbirth (i.e. "postpartum psychosis", PP) and there is a need to identify which factors underlie this increased risk. Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD).Methods: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss.Results: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47-2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526).Limitations: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes.Conclusions: In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.

AB  - Aim: To describe the prevalence of paediatric sleep disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms in extremely low gestational age infants and identify neonatal risk factors, including early exposure to hypoxia and hyperoxia.Methods: Patients <28 weeks gestation were monitored with high-resolution pulse oximetry. Hypoxia/hyperoxia variables were defined as percentage time of first 4 weeks of life that SaO(2) < 80% or SaO(2) > 98%, respectively. Parents completed part of the OSA-18 questionnaire for symptoms of SDB at 18-22 months. Logistic regression was used to test the association between risk factors and sleep symptoms.Results: Of 182 patients recruited, 138 (76%) completed the questionnaire. The mean gestation was 26 weeks, and mean birth weight 887 grams. Loud snoring (21%) and restless sleep (24%) were the most prevalent symptoms. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of loud snoring (OR, 2.7; CI, 1.13-6.5). Prolonged mechanical ventilation, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged caffeine use, however, were inversely correlated with loud snoring. Neither neonatal hypoxia nor hyperoxia were associated with sleep symptoms.Conclusions: While the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing symptoms is similar to reported rates, we found a sex difference not previously reported. Interestingly, markers for severity of illness show a pattern of being protective against loud snoring.

AB  - Objective: The quality and duration of sleep is impaired during pregnancy. Our study aimed to determine whether maternal sleep deprivation occurring during the second and third trimester of pregnancy could alter fetal well-being with respect to birth weight and APGAR score by altering the inflammatory status and oxidative stress in the mothers. Method: Sleep adequacy was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We investigated the inflammatory status and oxidative stress at term in the blood of pregnant subjects with and without sleep deprivation by measuring the levels of protein-bound sialic acid (PBSA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO). Homocysteine (Hcy) and its vitamin determinants were also measured. Fetal outcome with respect to birth weight and APGAR score were compared between study subjects. Results: A significant increase was observed in the levels of hsCRP, PBSA, Hcy, MDA, and PCO, in the sleep-deprived group when compared to the control group. Fetal outcome at birth showed a significant difference between the cases with high sleep deprivation and those with low sleep deprivation. Conclusion: Sleep deprivation in pregnancy leads to an increase in the inflammatory parameters, oxidative stress, and Hcy levels. Fetal outcome at birth was affected more in mothers with high sleep deprivation than those with low sleep deprivation.

AB  - Objective: To identify factors predictive of either lateral or prone infant sleep positioning.Study Design: We used data for 11340 mother-infant pairs from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State, 1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning.Results: Factors associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth, maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity. Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were predictive only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary insurance, receipt of government benefits, low infant gestational age, and low birth weight were predictive only of lateral sleep positioning.Conclusions: Factors predictive of either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to estimate the maternal and neonatal morbidities associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Women delivering between 2000-2008 with confirmed OSA in an academic center were included. Normal-weight and obese controls were randomly selected at a 2:1 ratio. Maternal and neonatal morbidities were compared between the groups. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate maternal morbidity and preterm birth (PTB). RESULTS: The analysis included 57 pregnancies complicated by OSA. Compared with normal-weight (n = 114) controls, OSA patients had more preeclampsia (PET) (19.3% vs 7.0%; P = .02) and PTB (29.8% vs 12.3%; P = .007). Controlling for comorbid conditions, OSA was associated with an increased risk of PTB (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-6.6), mostly secondary to PET (63%). Cesarean delivery (OR, 8.1; 95% CI, 2.9-22.1) and OSA were associated with maternal morbidity (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-13.7). CONCLUSION: Pregnancies complicated by OSA are at increased risk for preeclampsia, medical complications, and indicated PTB.

AB  - Objective: Public Health initiatives, such as the “Safe to Sleep” campaign, have traditionally targeted infants’ risk factors for the prevention of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). However, controversy remains regarding maternal and obstetrical risk factors for SIDS. In our study, we sought out to determine both modifiable and non-modifiable obstetrical and maternal risk factors associated with SIDS. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study using the CDC’s Linked Birth–Infant Death data from the United States for the year 2010. The impact of several obstetrical and maternal risk factors on the risk of overall infant mortality and SIDS was estimated using unconditional regression analysis, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results: Our cohort consisted of 4,007,105 deliveries and 24,174 infant deaths during the first year of life, of which 1991 (8.2%) were due to SIDS. Prominent risk factors for SIDS included (OR [95% CI]): black race, 1.89 [1.68–2.13]; maternal smoking, 3.56 [3.18–3.99]; maternal chronic hypertension, 1.73 [1.21–2.48]; gestational hypertension, 1.51 [1.23–1.87]; premature birth <37 weeks, 2.16 [1.82–2.55]; IUGR, 2.46 [2.14–2.82]; and being a twin, 1.81 [1.43–2.29],p < 0.0001. Relative to a cohort of infants who died of other causes, risk factors with a predilection for SIDS were maternal smoking, 2.48 [2.16–2.83] and being a twin, 1.52 [1.21–1.91],p < 0.0001. Conclusions for practice: While certain socio-demographic and gestational characteristics are important risk factors, maternal smoking remains the strongest prenatal modifiable risk factor for SIDS. We recommend the continuation of Public Health initiatives that promote safe infant sleeping practices and smoking cessation during and after pregnancy.

AB  - Study Objectives: Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress.Methods: The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night.Results: We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8% vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5% vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6-5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8-5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men.Conclusions: The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.

AB  - Background Maternal depression has been associated with excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems, but the specificity of maternal depression, as compared with maternal anxiety remains unclear and manifest disorders prior to pregnancy have been widely neglected. In this prospective longitudinal study, the specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to, during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems were investigated in the context of maternal parity. Methods In the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 primiparous and multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16 months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V) to assess DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n = 286 mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby-DIPS). Results Findings from this study revealed syndrome-specific risk constellations for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy: Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first-time mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity. Conclusions Primiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an escalation of mother-infant interactions. The relation between maternal depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice.

AB  - The two studies presented here describe neonatal breastfeeding as a measure of neonatal processing. The first paper describes the theoretical framework which guides both studies, the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing. The first paper also reviews the state of the science for the measurement of neonatal processing, neonatal neurobehavioral organization (NNBO). The second paper is the first study to describe breastfeeding behaviors, a measure of NNBO, of children later diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).The first study describes the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing theoretical framework, reviews the science of NNBO biobehavioral measures, and provides a short summary of a descriptive study using breastfeeding as an NNBO measure. The Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing uses three concepts, a neonate, the environment (maternal factors) and the neonatal mental system. Neonatal processing occurs within the neonatal mental system. The mental system may be assessed by NNBO biobehaviors, specifically breastfeeding. Breastfeeding and other NNBO biobehavioral measures of sleep/wake states, vagal tone and heart rate variability, neurophysiological measures of eventrelated potential of brain activity, and nutritive sucking and sucking patterns of bottle feeding literature is reviewed. NNBO biobehavioral measures have been found to be predictive of developmental outcomes. Breastfeeding, however, as an NNBO biobehavioral measure, has limited research as a predictive measure for cognitive and social outcomes. A short summary describes maternal breastfeeding experiences of mothers of children later diagnosed with ASD using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing as a guide. Mothers described their breastfeeding experiences and their neonate's breastfeeding behaviors. Many of the neonates' breastfeeding behaviors were described as demonstrating an atypical breastfeeding pattern, 'insatiable feeding', which may reflect early alteration in processing.The second paper applies the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing in a retrospective study. The study describes the maternal breastfeeding experiences during the first month after delivery of mothers who breastfed children later diagnosed with ASD. Mothers were interviewed in their homes, offices, libraries, at local shopping malls and restaurants. The interview used three measures created from the three major concepts within the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing: a maternal socio-environmental questionnaire, a semi-structured interview, and a post-interview summary.Participants were a convenience sample of 20 mothers (13 primiparas, 7 multiparas). Maternal age range was 28--60 years of age (M = 43.3, SD = 9.6). Two mothers had more than one son diagnosed with ASD. One mother had two sons and the second mother had three sons diagnosed with ASD for a total sample of 23 breastfed neonates. All 23 children had been full term neonates (38--42 weeks gestation) with birth weight > 2500 grams, diagnosed with ASD between ages of 18 months to 11 years of age (M = 4.3, SD = 2.4) and age range at the time of the maternal interview was 5--35 years of age (M = 11.5, SD = 7.6).Mothers described three types of breastfeeding experiences affected by the maternal environmental factor of professional support. One mother's experience overlapped between the first and second group. The first group (n=4) recalled breastfeeding success with no or limited professional support. The second group (n = 11) breastfed successfully after receiving positive professional support (one mother overlapped with group one), and the third group (n = 6) had variable success with breastfeeding after receiving unfavorable professional support. Support provided to the second and third groups was given for inexperience, anatomical barriers and neonates that demonstrated an 'insatiable feeding', i.e., frequent vigorous feeding without ceasing after satiation.The mothers of neonates later diagnosed with ASD described having similar breastfeeding experiences and challenges compared to the typically developing population. The mothers of neonates also described a triad of neonatal breastfeeding behaviors that merit future research, 'insatiable feeding', a vigorous suck that did not stop with satiation, diminished social interaction, and > 70th percentile for weight for many of the infants during the first year.Taken together, these findings support using the Biobehavioral Conception of Neonatal Processing to guide future studies using NNBO biobehavioral measures. The findings also support future research to quantify the breastfeeding behavior of 'insatiable feeding' for a potential screening tool for neonates at-risk for ASD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coffee and other caffeinated beverages are commonly consumed in pregnancy. In adults, caffeine may interfere with sleep onset and have a dose-response effect similar to those seen during insomnia. In infancy, nighttime waking is a common event. With this study, we aimed to investigate if maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and lactation leads to frequent nocturnal awakening among infants at 3 months of age. METHODS: All children born in the city of Pelotas, Brazil, during 2004 were enrolled on a cohort study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and after 3 months to obtain information on caffeine drinking consumption, sociodemographic, reproductive, and behavioral characteristics. Infant sleeping pattern in the previous 15 days was obtained from a subsample. Night waking was defined as an episode of infant arousal that woke the parents during nighttime. Multivariable analysis was performed by using Poisson regression. RESULTS: The subsample included 885 of the 4231 infants born in 2004. All but 1 mother consumed caffeine in pregnancy. Nearly 20% were heavy consumers (≥300 mg/day) during pregnancy and 14.3% at 3 months postpartum. Prevalence of frequent nighttime awakeners (>3 episodes per night) was 13.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.5%- 16.0%). The highest prevalence ratio was observed among breastfed infants from mothers consuming ≥300 mg/day during the whole pregnancy and in the postpartum period (1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-3.17) but at a nonsignificant level. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine consumption during pregnancy and by nursing mothers seems not to have consequences on sleep of infants at the age of 3 months.

AB  - Little is known about factors associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Of 60 435 pregnant women in a population-based cohort, 3480 (5.8%) reported having migraine during the first 5 months of pregnancy. Of these, 2525 (72.6%) reported using migraine pharmacotherapy, mostly non-narcotic analgesics (54.1%) and triptans (25.4%). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and comorbidities in logistic regression analysis, high pregestational body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.4], sleep < 5 h (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3, 1.9), being on sick-leave (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) and acute back/shoulder/neck pain (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6, 0.7) were associated with migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy. Many women need drug treatment for migraine during pregnancy, and the choice of pharmacotherapy during this period may be influenced by maternal sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.

AB  - Background: Low maternal choline intake and blood concentration may be risk factors for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD); however, the data are inconsistent. This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved by folic acid. Objective: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionally could reduce NTD rates. Design: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first prenatal visit. Results: Mean (±SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the AP (2.8 ± 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.

AB  - Background: Synchronizing eating schedules to daily circadian rhythms may improve metabolic health, but its association with gestational glycemia is unknown.Objective: This study examined the association of maternal night-fasting intervals and eating episodes with blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study within a prospective cohort in Singapore. Maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose, and 2-h glucose concentrations were ascertained at 26-28 wk gestation for 1061 women (aged 30.7 ± 5.1 y). Night-fasting intervals were based on the longest fasting duration during the night (1900-0659). Eating episodes were defined as events that provided >50 kcal, with a time interval between eating episodes of ≥15 min. Multiple linear regressions with adjustment for confounders were conducted.Results: Mean ± SD night-fasting intervals and eating episodes per day were 9.9 ± 1.6 h and 4.2 ± 1.3 times/d, respectively; fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations were 4.4 ± 0.5 and 6.6 ± 1.5 mmol/L, respectively. In adjusted models, each hourly increase in night-fasting intervals was associated with a 0.03 mmol/L decrease in fasting glucose (95% CI: -0.06, -0.01 mmol/L), whereas each additional daily eating episode was associated with a 0.15 mmol/L increase in 2-h glucose (95% CI: 0.03, 0.28 mmol/L). Conversely, night-fasting intervals and daily eating episodes were not associated with 2-h and fasting glucose, respectively.Conclusions: Increased maternal night-fasting intervals and reduced eating episodes per day were associated with decreased fasting glucose and 2-h glucose, respectively, in the late-second trimester of pregnancy. This points to potential alternative strategies to improve glycemic control in pregnant women. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

AB  - Abstract: Objective: To identify biological and socioeconomic factors associated with the neurological development of Mexican infants born at term, as measured by brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEPs). Subjects and methods: We conducted a cohort study among 76 women with low risk pregnancies recruited in their third trimester of pregnancy and followed their infants until 12 months of age. BAEP tests were conducted on the infants before 3 months of age during physiologic sleep, using 100 msec bipolar clicks. Maternal dietary intake was evaluated by food frequency questionnaire. Two BAEP groups (short latency, long latency) were identified by cluster analysis. The association between BAEP group and maternal PUFAs was estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for socioeconomic and biological factors. Results: Short latency BAEPs were associated with a maternal diet rich in arachidonic acid (OR=3.63, 95% CI 1.23–10.67) after adjusting for age (in days) sex, head circumference and gestational age but was not significantly associated to a maternal diet rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Conclusions: Our results suggest the importance of arachidonic acid intake during pregnancy for short latency BAEPs and adequate fetal myelination.

AB  - Aims: To assess the implications of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on long-term respiratory related hospitalizations of the offspring.Methods: A population-based cohort analysis including singleton pregnancies delivered between the years 1991 to 2014 in a tertiary referral hospital was conducted. Incidence of hospitalizations (up to age 18 years) due to various respiratory diseases was compared between offspring of GDM-complicated pregnancies and normoglycemic pregnancies. Kaplan-Meyer curves were used to assess cumulative hospitalization incidence. Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for baseline selected confounders.Results: During the study period 216,197 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 4.7% (n = 10,184) were complicated by GDM. In most of the investigated respiratory diseases, no significant differences were found between offspring of both groups. Nonetheless, obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalization rate was higher among the GDM group, an association which proved to be independent of potential confounders with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% CI 1.02-1.55; p = 0.036).Conclusion: Gestational diabetes mellitus does not appear to be associated with long-term respiratory hospitalizations of the offspring other than obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalizations.

AB  - Few studies have examined relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring beyond very early childhood. Eighty-five women classified as high risk for major depressive disorder during pregnancy completed measures of mood and their child's sleep 4-7 years postpartum. Mothers with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores ≥20 reported more sleep problems in their child, and child sleep disruption was a reasonable predictor of maternal BDI-II. More research is needed to determine causal relationships between perinatal depression and sleep in offspring.

AB  - Background: Synchrony between daily feeding-fasting signals and circadian rhythms has been shown to improve metabolic health in animals and adult humans, but the potential programming effect on fetal growth is unknown.Objective: We examined the associations of the maternal night-fasting interval during pregnancy with offspring birth size and adiposity.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of mother-offspring dyads within the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. For 384 mothers aged 30.8 ± 4.8 y (mean ± SD), the night-fasting interval at 26-28 wk of gestation was determined from a 3-d food diary based on the average of the fasting duration at night (1900-0659). Offspring birth weight, length, and head circumference were measured and converted to weight-for-gestational age (GA), length-for-GA, and head circumference-for-GA z scores, respectively, by using local customized percentile charts. The percentage of neonatal total body fat (TBF) was derived by using a validated prediction equation. Multivariable general linear models, stratified by child sex, were performed.Results: The mean ± SD maternal night-fasting interval was 9.9 ± 1.3 h. In infant girls, each 1-h increase in the maternal night-fasting interval was associated with a 0.22-SD (95% CI: 0.05-, 0.40-SD; P = 0.013) increase in birth head circumference-for-GA and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.19%, 1.49%; P = 0.012) increase in TBF at birth, after adjustment for confounders. In infant boys, no associations were observed between the maternal night-fasting interval and birth size or TBF.Conclusions: An increased maternal night-fasting interval in the late second trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased birth head circumference and TBF in girls but not boys. Our findings are in accordance with previous observations that suggest that there are sex-specific responses in fetal brain growth and adiposity, and raise the possibility of the maternal night-fasting interval as an underlying influence. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

AB  - Aim: Several studies have examined the links between maternal obesity and the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in children, with inconsistent results. The aim of our study was to investigate whether maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of CP in offspring by using meta-analysis.Method: PubMed and Web of Science were searched until August 2017. Observational studies relevant to the maternal obesity and risk of CP in children were extracted and compiled. Meta-analyses were performed for different obesity levels and pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.Results: A total of five cohort studies involving 12 324 cases and 7 919 288 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled crude and adjusted ORs (95% CIs) were 1.65 (1.38-1.98) and 1.51 (1.24-1.84) respectively. Additionally, the pooled OR (95% CI) for CP in offspring in relation to maternal obesity class I (body mass index [BMI] 30.0-34.9), class II (BMI 35.0-39.9), and class III (BMI≥40.0) compared with normal weight during prepregnancy or pregnancy was 1.31 (1.15-1.50), 1.65 (1.34-2.02), and 2.37 (1.91-2.94) respectively.Interpretation: This meta-analysis demonstrated that increasing grades of maternal obesity are associated with a higher risk of CP in offspring.What This Paper Adds: Meta-analysis demonstrates a significant positive association between maternal obesity and the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in children. Subgroup analysis indicates that higher grades of maternal obesity are associated with increasing risk of CP.

AB  - Background: Maternal obesity increases offspring propensity to metabolic dysfunctions and to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer. The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in offspring with programmed NAFLD.Methods: Mice were fed a standard or an obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation. Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 12:12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor activity were investigated at 6 months.Results: We show that maternal obesity interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1) and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators.Conclusions: These data implicate disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic liver disease in adulthood.

AB  - Objective:The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum.Background:The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence.Methods:A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament.Results:Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby.Conclusion:The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This is a prospective study of the effects of maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy on newborn neurobehavioral integrity, including systematic measures of behavioral state, sleep organization, motor activity, heart rate variability (HRV), tremulousness, and startles. METHODS: The sample included 17 SSRI-exposed and 17 nonexposed, full-birth-weight newborn infants who had no obvious medical problems and were matched on maternal cigarette use, social class, and maternal age. SSRI exposure was determined by medical records and maternal self-report during a standard interview. Behavioral state, startles, and tremulousness were evaluated for 1 hour between feedings. Automated recordings of motor activity and HRV were also assessed during a 15-minute subset sleep period. HRV was subjected to spectral analysis to detect rhythms in autonomic regulation. Exposed and nonexposed infant groups were compared on measures of neurobehavioral development both before and after adjustment for gestational age as a covariate. RESULTS: SSRI-exposed infants had a shorter mean gestational age; were more motorically active and tremulous; and showed fewer rhythms in HRV, fewer changes in behavioral state, fewer different behavioral states, and a lower peak behavioral state. SSRI-exposed infants also had significantly more rapid eye movement sleep, which was characterized by longer continuous bouts in that state and higher numbers of spontaneous startles or sudden arousals. After effects of gestational age were covaried, significant differences continued to be found in tremulousness and all measures of state and sleep organization, but effects on startles, motor activity, and rhythms in HRV were no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide the first systematic evidence that women who use SSRIs during pregnancy have healthy, full-birth-weight newborn infants who show disruptions in a wide range of neurobehavioral outcomes. Effects on motor activity, startles, and HRV may be mediated through the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age. Future research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of SSRI use during pregnancy and an improved public health outcome.

AB  - Objective: Sleep disorders are associated with cardiovascular complications and preterm delivery (PTD). Insufficient sleep results in metabolic alterations and increased inflammation, both known to contribute to placental abruption (abruption), a determinant of PTD. We examined associations of abruption with sleep duration and complaints of vital exhaustion.Methods: The study included 164 abruption cases and 160 controls in a multicenter study in Peru. Data on habitual sleep duration and vital exhaustion during the first 6 months of pregnancy were elicited during interviews conducted following delivery. Women were categorized according to short, normal and long sleep duration (≤6, 7-8 and ≥9 h); and frequency of feeling exhausted. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.Results: Short and long sleep durations were associated with increased odds of abruption. The ORs of abruption in relation to short (≤6 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep duration were 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-4.1), compared with normal sleep duration (7-8 h). Complaints of vital exhaustion were also associated with abruption (OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.46-3.85), and were independent of sleep duration.Conclusion: We extend the existing literature and support the thesis that maternal sleep habits and disorders should be assessed among pregnant women.

AB  - There is a wealth of evidence to say that sleep impacts maternal health during pregnancy, however, little has been published on fetal health and maternal sleep. This scoping review summarises current literature on maternal sleep including sleep disordered breathing, sleep quality, sleep duration and supine sleep position, as these relate to fetal outcomes specifically birth weight, growth, preterm birth and stillbirth. An overall interpretation of the studies evaluated shows that events occurring during maternal sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea, sleep disruption and sleep position may have a negative effect on the fetus resulting in altered growth, gestational length and even death. These effects are biologically and physically plausible. In conclusion, there is limited and often conflicting information on maternal sleep and fetal outcomes. However, existing evidence suggests that this is an important area for future research. This area is ripe for investigation if there is to be reduction in the physical, emotional, and financial burden of poor fetal outcomes related to maternal sleep.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are increased in pregnancy compared to the nongravid state. Maternal SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this is still under investigation. We performed a systematic literature review, and where feasible, a metaanalysis, to evaluate whether women with SDB in pregnancy have a higher risk of specific adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women without SDB. STUDY DESIGN: Original studies published until June 2012 evaluating the association between gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight infants, and maternal SDB, defined either by symptoms or the reference standard polysomnography, were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data were extracted on study design and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect estimates from each study were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Of the 4386 studies identified, 31 met the defined criteria. Twenty-one studies, all observational in design, reported dichotomous outcomes; 9 of these adjusted for potential confounders. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-3.09; 5 studies), and gestational diabetes (pooled aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; 5 studies). CONCLUSION: Based on published observational studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. However, large-scale, prospective cohort, and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the relationship between maternal SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Emerging literature suggests that sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) worsens over the course of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Earlier studies, using mainly snoring as a surrogate marker for SDB, have shown an increase in the prevalence of SDB during pregnancy compared with that in the pregravid state. More recently, prospective observational studies in which the investigators ascertained SDB by using complete polysomnography have shown a prevalence ranging from approximately 17% to 45% in the third trimester. Pregnancy itself can be associated with daytime hypersomnolence, so complaints of increasing fatigue and sleepiness during pregnancy are not specific for SDB. Moreover, snoring in isolation also has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for diagnosing maternal SDB. The indications for screening for SDB during routine obstetric prenatal visits are still unclear, but observational studies indicate that maternal SDB is linked with the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus. Some studies also have identified a relationship between maternal SDB and the delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. Aside from a few small interventional studies of CPAP in pregnant patients with gestational hypertension, little currently is known about whether treatment of SDB during pregnancy improves clinical outcomes for the mother and/or baby. Additional current knowledge gaps include elucidating underlying mechanisms of maternal SDB, determining optimal treatment strategies, and understanding the trajectory of SDB after delivery.

AB  - The current study explored the relationship between maternal subjective sleep quality and two factors that have been independently linked to maternal sleep: infant caretaking at night and maternal depressive symptom severity. Participants were a follow-up cohort of 94 women (mean age 33.3, SD=4.4), who were depressed during pregnancy and part of a larger randomised controlled trial. Participants were evaluated 10 weeks after delivery, using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and daily sleep logs for one week. On average, women woke to attend to the infant 2.2 times (SD=1.1) and spent 47.3 min (SD=33.0) awake to attend to the infant. Regression analysis revealed that the number of times a woman's sleep was disrupted by attending to her infant was a significant predictor of her perceived subjective sleep quality; however, the total amount of time she spent attending to her infant and her depressive symptom severity were not predictors. The findings of this study suggest that during the third postpartum month, sleep fragmentation appears more detrimental to maternal subjective sleep quality than amount of time awake during the night. This finding is relevant to the implementation of clinical interventions for improving maternal subjective sleep quality during the early postpartum period.

AB  - At a specialized care hospital transferred, pregnant, high risk patients were asked to describe their perceptions, concerns/fears, and needs. The contents of these interviews were analyzed and compared with medical caregivers' assessments of the transferred patient's experiences. This study was designed to further understand (1) the impact of transfer on the high risk pregnant patients and (2) the medical caregivers' observation of the impact. Twenty maternal transports were interviewed and audiotaped soon after the transport was completed in an open-interview format. A content analysis of the interviews identified the problems and events of the maternal transport experience during preparation, travel and arrival. Thirty one medical caregivers were asked similar questions which determined their cognizance of the patients perceptions and problems. The study results demonstrated patient concern for enroute delivery as well as for their fetal and pregnancy outcome. Patient focus away from the pregnancy and toward their abnormal bodily changes, physical discomforts, and medication side effects attested to the difficult adaptation of a complicated pregnancy. Support from family and friends was important but also more difficult when separated by distance. Patients described the nurse's helpfulness more often as giving information, support and guiding them through unfamiliar events than by providing physical care, while the nurses stated the opposite. Nurses were perceived as the person who helped the most. Arriving at the final specialized hospital destination was described as a relief and signaled increased confidence and increased hope for the pregnancy. It was discovered that sending hospitals positively prepared the patient for these feelings. Patient responses were aligned with Rubin's developmental stages of pregnancy but not with the usual changes observed in a high risk pregnancy. Coping responses of maternal transports included sensations of self-detachment and the use of diversion and sleep. Responses toward the transport experience included fear of the unknown, lack of understanding of both anticipated and current events, disbelief of the pregnancy events and concern for family separation. Caregivers underestimated the patient's level of concern and fear as well as her specific concerns for the unborn baby including enroute delivery.

AB  - Background: Naphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). It is easily emitted into the atmosphere, posing a significant risk to human health. However, limited studies have described the impact of naphthalene exposure on birth outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between the maternal urinary metabolites of naphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-OH NAP), and birth outcomes.Method: In the present study, four urinary PAH metabolites were measured in 263 pregnant women during late pregnancy. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the concentrations of 2-OH NAP and birth outcomes, and restricted cubic spline models were further used to examine the shapes of the dose-response association.Result: General linear models showed that prenatal urinary 2-OH NAP was associated with lower birth weight (BW) (- 4.38% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.049) and higher cephalization index (CI) (4.30% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend = 0.038). These associations were linear and significant when 2-OH NAP was modeled as a continuous variable in restricted cubic spline models (P linear = 0.0293 for 2-OH NAP and BW; P linear = 0.0326 for 2-OH NAP and CI). Multiple linear regression data indicated that each 1 ln-unit increase in 2-OH NAP was significantly associated with a 2.09 g/cm increase in the CI. The associations among 2-OH NAP, BW, and CI were also observed in a subset of participants residing close to arterial traffic.Conclusion: Our data indicated that prenatal exposure to naphthalene had an adverse effect on fetal birth outcomes, especially the brain development index. Reduced exposure to naphthalene may improve newborn health outcomes. In Taiyuan, naphthalene may result from traffic pollution.

AB  - Aim: To identify and describe infant deaths presenting suddenly and unexpectedly in whom there was a history of maternal methadone consumption or misuse of drugs during pregnancy.Methods: Retrospective review of neonatal postmortem examinations between 2004 and 2011.Results: A total of 138 autopsies were performed in infants up to 28 days. Thirty-two cases (23%) presented suddenly and unexpectedly. In 12 of 32 (37.5%), in whom the cause of death remained unexplained after a thorough postmortem, there was a history of methadone use and/or other drugs of abuse during pregnancy. Their mean age at death was 11 days (range 1-28 days). Multiple risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome were present in these 12 cases: smoking (10), prematurity (7), and inappropriate sleeping place (8). Five mothers were positive for hepatitis C. The history was inconsistent with the findings in only one case.Conclusion: An unexpectedly high proportion of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly in the first month had a history of maternal substance misuse. All had multiple risk factors, for sudden infant death syndrome many avoidable. We would stress the need to emphasise the 'Safe Sleep' message with these families at every contact with health professionals.

AB  - Few studies exist that identify a useful self-report measure of physical activity for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 years. The women wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring, the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r = 49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day.

AB  - Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11β-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus.

AB  - Objective/background: The objective of this study was to evaluate medical comorbidity patterns in patients with a narcolepsy diagnosis in the United States.Patients/methods: This was a retrospective medical claims data analysis. Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Research Databases were accessed to identify individuals ≥18 years of age with ≥1 diagnosis code for narcolepsy (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 347.0, 347.00, 347.01, 347.1, 347.10, or 347.11) continuously insured between 2006 and 2010, and controls without narcolepsy matched 5:1 on age, gender, region, and payer. Narcolepsy and control subjects were compared for frequency of comorbid conditions, identified by the appearance of >1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on specific subcategories, including recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and depression.Results: The final study group included 9312 subjects with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59% female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a statistically significant excess prevalence in all the CCS multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9).Conclusions: In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at significantly higher rates than matched controls.

AB  - Purpose: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity.Method: We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions.Results: Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome.Conclusions: BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

AB  - Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

AB  - Background Uncontrolled studies in human have suggested that memantine might be a suitable option for migraine prophylaxis. Objective To assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis. Methods This was a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12 between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT). Results Twenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P < .001). Both CC (MD, 4.9; 95%CI, 2.6-7.2 days), and ITT analyses (MD, 5.2; 95%CI, 2.0-8.5) showed significantly higher reduction in the mean number of migraine days in the memantine group than the placebo group ( P < .01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo. Conclusion Memantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other antimigraine medications. The study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Registration number: IRCT2013120115616N1).
