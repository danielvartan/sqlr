TI  - Maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use during pregnancy and newborn 
      neurobehavior.
PG  - 368-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This is a prospective study of the effects of maternal use of
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy on newborn
      neurobehavioral integrity, including systematic measures of behavioral state,
      sleep organization, motor activity, heart rate variability (HRV), tremulousness, 
      and startles. METHODS: The sample included 17 SSRI-exposed and 17 nonexposed,
      full-birth-weight newborn infants who had no obvious medical problems and were
      matched on maternal cigarette use, social class, and maternal age. SSRI exposure 
      was determined by medical records and maternal self-report during a standard
      interview. Behavioral state, startles, and tremulousness were evaluated for 1
      hour between feedings. Automated recordings of motor activity and HRV were also
      assessed during a 15-minute subset sleep period. HRV was subjected to spectral
      analysis to detect rhythms in autonomic regulation. Exposed and nonexposed infant
      groups were compared on measures of neurobehavioral development both before and
      after adjustment for gestational age as a covariate. RESULTS: SSRI-exposed
      infants had a shorter mean gestational age; were more motorically active and
      tremulous; and showed fewer rhythms in HRV, fewer changes in behavioral state,
      fewer different behavioral states, and a lower peak behavioral state.
      SSRI-exposed infants also had significantly more rapid eye movement sleep, which 
      was characterized by longer continuous bouts in that state and higher numbers of 
      spontaneous startles or sudden arousals. After effects of gestational age were
      covaried, significant differences continued to be found in tremulousness and all 
      measures of state and sleep organization, but effects on startles, motor
      activity, and rhythms in HRV were no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Results
      provide the first systematic evidence that women who use SSRIs during pregnancy
      have healthy, full-birth-weight newborn infants who show disruptions in a wide
      range of neurobehavioral outcomes. Effects on motor activity, startles, and HRV
      may be mediated through the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age. Future
      research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of SSRI use during
      pregnancy and an improved public health outcome.

      positive airway pressure.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tolerance, compliance and problems associated with 
      usage of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by pregnant women with 
      sleep disordered breathing (SDB). PATIENTS AND METHOD: Twelve pregnant women
      diagnosed with SDB received polysomnography (PSG) at entry, CPAP titration,
      repeat PSG at 6 months gestation (GA) and home monitoring of cardio-respiratory
      variables at 8 months GA. Compliance was verified by the pressure at the mask.
      Results from the Epworth sleepiness scale, fatigue scale and visual analogue
      scales (VAS) for sleepiness, fatigue, and snoring were compared over time.
      RESULTS: All of the subjects had full term pregnancies and healthy infants.
      Nightly compliance was at least 4 h initially and 6.5 h at 6 months GA. Nasal
      CPAP significantly improved all scales compared to entry. VAS scores remained
      lower at 6 months GA compared to entry. Re-adjustment of CPAP pressure was needed
      in six subjects at 6 months GA. CONCLUSION: Nasal CPAP is a safe and effective
      treatment of SDB during pregnancy.

      Shanghai].
PG  - 435-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand prevalence of sleep problems and presence of improper
      sleep habit of children aged one to 23 months in Shanghai, and to identify their 
      related factors. METHODS: Totally, 1 252 normal children, without severe illness 
      and abnormal delivery history, aged one to 23 months were randomly selected from 
      five districts of Shanghai. Under strict quality control system, their parents
      were interviewed with questionnaire to look into their familial and social
      environment, as well as sleep-related factors. RESULTS: Fully-completed
      information was obtained in 1 129 of 1 252 children, with a response rate of
      90.18%. Prevalence of sleep problems in children was 65.90% in Shanghai,
      remarkably higher than in the other areas. Prevalence of nightmare, level of
      fright at night, snore and sleep apnea in boys were significantly higher than
      those in girls. Prevalence of improper sleep habit in children was also higher,
      including sleeping with their parents, parental presence at sleep onset and
      irregular sleep time. Main risk factors related to children's sleep problems were
      maternal anxiety, children's irregular sleep time, parental presence at sleep
      onset, difficulty-type temperament and maternal poor sleep during pregnancy.
      CONCLUSIONS: In Shanghai, prevalence of sleep problems in children aged one to 23
      months was relatively higher and main risk factors for them were social, cultural
      and familial environment, especially negligence of cultivating proper sleep habit
      and parental improper response to children's poor sleep behavior.

TI  - Factors relating to the infant's last sleep environment in sudden infant death
      syndrome in the Republic of Ireland.
PG  - 1058-64
AB  - AIM: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the
      sleeping environment of Irish infants. METHODS: A five year population based
      case-control study with parental interviews conducted for each case and three
      controls matched for age, place of birth, and last sleep period. A total of 203
      SIDS cases and 622 control infants born 1994-98 were studied. RESULTS: In a
      multivariate analysis, co-sleeping significantly increased the risk of SIDS both 
      as a usual practice (adjusted OR 4.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 17.37) and during the last 
      sleep period (adjusted OR 16.47; 95% CI 3.73 to 72.75). The associated risk was
      dependent on maternal smoking (OR 21.84; 95% CI 2.27 to 209.89), and was not
      significant for infants who were > or =20 weeks of age (OR 2.63; 95% CI 0.49 to
      70.10) or placed back in their own cot/bed to sleep (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.21 to
      5.41). The use of pillows, duvets, and bedding with tog value > or =10 were not
      significant risk factors when adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, 
      including maternal smoking and social disadvantage. However, the prone sleeping
      position remains a significant SIDS risk factor, and among infants using
      soothers, the absence of soother use during the last sleep period also
      significantly increased the SIDS risk (OR 5.83; CI 2.37 to 14.36). CONCLUSION:
      Co-sleeping should be avoided in infants who are <20 weeks of age, or whose
      mothers smoked during pregnancy. The prone position remains a factor in some SIDS
      deaths, and the relation between soother use and SIDS is a complex variable
      requiring further study.

TI  - Differential effects of progestins on the brain.
PG  - S71-5
AB  - Interactions exist between progestins and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
      receptor subtype A where C(21)-steroids function as activators. Other
      interactions between progesterone and neurotransmitter systems include
      stimulation of dopamine release in striatal tissue, stimulation of GnRH release
      from hypothalamic neurons and inhibition of opioid receptor binding and
      activation. Cyproterone acetate increases dopaminergic responses and binds to
      opiate receptors independently of its classical effect on the androgen receptor. 
      Progesterone substitution in perimenopausal women promotes length and quality of 
      sleep. This effect seems most prominent for progesterone administered vaginally. 
      Progestins also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Migraine symptoms
      occur predominantly during the perimenstrual stage. Women who suffer from
      menstrual migraine triggered by premenstrual progesterone loss often benefit from
      cyclic progesterone administration. This may be because progesterone and
      allopregnenolone reduce meningeal release of substance P and inhibit the
      development of neurogenic oedema. Women whose migraine symptoms subside during
      pregnancy, however, benefit from intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate.
      Progesterone, generated from pregnenolone by Schwann cells, also enhances myelin 
      synthesis. Myelination of axons is promoted when progesterone is added to
      cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. No reliable data exist with respect to the
      effects of other progestins on demyelinating disease. Progestins promote the
      growth of meningioma as progesterone receptors predominate in meningioma tissue. 
      Progesterone and synthetic progestins should therefore not be prescribed in these
      patients.

TI  - Serotonergic brainstem abnormalities in Northern Plains Indians with the sudden
      infant death syndrome.
PG  - 1178-91
AB  - The rate of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among American Indian infants
      in the Northern Plains is almost 6 times higher than in U.S. white infants. In a 
      study of infant mortality among Northern Plains Indians, we tested the hypothesis
      that receptor binding abnormalities to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) in
      SIDS cases, compared with autopsied controls, occur in regions of the medulla
      oblongata that contain 5-HT neurons and that are critical for the regulation of
      cardiorespiration and central chemosensitivity during sleep, i.e. the medullary
      5-HT system. Tritiated-lysergic acid diethylamide binding to 5-HT(1A-D) and 5-HT2
      receptors was measured in 19 brainstem nuclei in 23 SIDS and 6 control infants
      using tissue receptor autoradiography. Binding in the arcuate nucleus, a part of 
      the medullary 5-HT system along the ventral surface, in the SIDS infants (mean
      age-adjusted binding 7.1 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg tissue, n = 23) was significantly lower 
      than in controls (mean age-adjusted binding 13.1 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg tissue, n = 5)
      (p = 0.003). Binding also demonstrated significant diagnosis x age interactions
      (p < 0.04) in 4 other nuclei that are components of the 5-HT system. These data
      suggest that medullary 5-HT dysfunction can lead to sleep-related, sudden death
      in affected SIDS infants, and confirm the same binding abnormalities reported by 
      us in a larger dataset of non-American Indian SIDS and control infants. This
      study also links 5-HT abnormalities in the arcuate nucleus with exposure to
      adverse prenatal exposures, i.e. cigarette smoking (p = 0.011) and alcohol (p =
      0.075), during the periconceptional period or throughout pregnancy. Prenatal
      exposure to cigarette smoke and/or alcohol may contribute to abnormal fetal
      medullary 5-HT development in SIDS infants.

TI  - [Respiratory disorders during sleep in the pregnant woman].
PG  - 6S91-4
AB  - Sleep disordered breathing can occur during pregnancy due to the development of
      hormonal changes and respiratory function abnormalities that perturb patency of
      the upper airways. Habitual snoring has been described in 25 p. 100 of the women 
      during the third trimester of pregnancy. The incidence of sleep apnea hypopnea
      syndrome is unknown due to the lack of longitudinal epidemiological data, and
      results of the main studies are in favor of upper airway resistance syndrome.
      However, these sleep-related breathing disorders are more frequently associated
      with maternal and fetal complications such as maternal hypertension, pre
      eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. This article points out the
      importance of such associations because of the efficacy of continuous positive
      airway pressure on the regression of these nocturnal respiratory and vascular
      complications.

TI  - [Path-analysis model of lifestyle factors and subjective health: the Healthy
      Japan 21 questionnaire survey in Obihiro].
PG  - 1006-16
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine health problems of citizens
      of the city of Obihiro with reference to the Healthy Japan 21 plan. METHOD: The
      subjects were a total of 2,000 men and women (6-74 years old) who were selected
      at random from the resident ledger of Obihiro. The questionnaire included the 6
      fields (nutrient intake/dietary habits, physical activity/exercise, rest/mental
      health, tobacco, alcohol, dental health) of Healthy Japan 21. The path-analysis
      model was used by sex, in order to examine the relationship between lifestyle
      factors (dietary habits, restful sleep, stress, smoking habits, alcohol intake)
      and subjective health. RESULTS: A total of 979 subjects (49.0%) responded. The
      items that showed a higher proportion than for all Japan were as follows: the
      proportions of persons who felt stress, required a drug or alcohol to sleep,
      drank heavily, and were female smokers. In questions about the harm caused to
      health by smoking, the following items showed lower awareness than deserved:
      bronchitis, gastric ulcer, problems with regard to pregnancy, and periodontitis. 
      The following characteristics were found in the path-analysis: 1) If sleep rest
      is sufficient, subjective health is unaffected by stress in men and women; 2)
      Smoking affects dietary habits in men and women, especially in the latter; 3)
      Heavy smoking affects subjective health in men and women independent of whether
      dietary habits are good; 4) There is a positive relation between drinking and
      subjective health in women. CONCLUSION: This study showed that stress and smoking
      are problems for the health of citizens of the city of Obihiro, and suggested
      that the best measure to counter stress is sufficient sleep, while to counter
      smoking spread of knowledge about the harm to health caused by smoking is best.

TI  - Effects from prenatal exposure to alprazolam on the social behavior of mice
      offspring.
PG  - 1452-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct, in a randomized
      placebo-controlled manner, social behavior testing on mice offspring that were
      exposed prenatally to alprazolam. STUDY DESIGN: A previously described,
      clinically relevant dose of 0.32 mg/kg of alprazolam (n=8 mice) or a placebo (n=9
      mice) was given to gravid C57BL/6 mice by gavage on gestational day 18. Social
      play, sleep/wake patterns, and male aggression of the exposed offspring were
      assessed during prejuvenile, juvenile, and adult periods. RESULTS: Alprazolam did
      not produce treatment differences in pregnancy outcomes or in dam-pup
      interactions. Compared with the placebo group, alprazolam-exposed offspring
      demonstrated less desire to escape (P<.01), more desire to remain alone (P<.02), 
      and shorter periods of being awake (P<.03) on PND 17. Alprazolam-exposed male
      offspring exhibited more aggression on food restriction (P<.01) and on cage
      changing (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to
      alprazolam demonstrated more individual rather than group activities, avoidance
      of open areas, and aggression in males. Correlation of these findings in humans
      is encouraged.

TI  - [Treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. How long is ambulatory treatment
      enough?].
PG  - 37-41
AB  - Hypertension in pregnancy is diagnosed when pressures in excess of 140/90 mmHg
      are repeatedly measured. A differentiation is made between pregnancy-independent 
      hypertension, i.e. pre-existing hypertension and gestational hypertension
      occurring for the first time after the 20th week of the pregnancy. If
      hypertension is accompanied by proteinuria, the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is
      made. Feared complications are eclampsia and the HELLP syndrome. For blood
      pressure measurement, a number of peculiarities must be noted: thus, for example,
      in severe pre-eclampsia the circadian rhythm may reverse, with pressure increases
      in particular in the evening and at night. Ambulatory management may be
      permissible only in the case of pre-pregnancy and gestational hypertension,
      provided the blood pressure can be kept below 160/100. Restricting physical
      activity, and regular monitoring of weight, blood pressure and laboratory
      investigations usually suffice. If pre-eclampsia or the HELLP syndrome is
      suspected, the patient should be hospitalized without delay. A hypertensive
      crisis must prompt immediate measures to lower the blood pressure--but not too
      quickly, in order to avoid severe consequences for the fetus caused by inadequate
      uteroplacental perfusion.

TI  - Arousal responses and risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - S61-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Failure to arouse from sleep has been postulated as a mechanism to
      explain the final pathway of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). METHODS: We
      have reviewed the effects of the major risk factors for SIDS, prone sleep
      position, maternal smoking, prematurity and recent infection on arousability from
      sleep. In human infants it has been consistently demonstrated that arousal from
      sleep in response to a variety of stimuli is more difficult to induce from quiet 
      sleep (QS) compared to active sleep (AS) over the first 6 months of life.
      RESULTS: In the prone position both stimulus-induced and spontaneous arousability
      from both QS and AS were impaired at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months, but not at 5-6
      months of age in both term and preterm infants. In term infants exposed to
      maternal smoking during pregnancy both stimulus-induced and spontaneous
      arousability were impaired when infants slept supine in QS at 2-3 months of age. 
      Healthy preterm infants showed no impairment in arousability compared with term
      infants at matched postconceptional ages. However, preterm infants with a history
      of apnoea and bradycardia of prematurity showed decreased arousal responses in
      both QS and AS and this impairment was positively correlated to their 'perinatal 
      risk score'. Infants who had recently suffered an infection requiring
      hospitalization showed decreased arousability in QS on the day of discharge when 
      compared to 2 weeks later when they were completely well. CONCLUSIONS: In summary
      it has been found that the major risk factors for SIDS identified from
      epidemiological studies also decrease arousability from sleep in infants. We
      propose that this decreased arousability from sleep may be involved in the final 
      pathway of SIDS.

TI  - Effects of pregnancy on mothers' sleep.
PG  - 37-42
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To survey the effects of pregnancy on mothers' sleep. METHODS:
      Mothers were interviewed during and after pregnancy with a series of five
      questionnaires to assess alterations in their sleep. The first questionnaire
      covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of
      pregnancy and the last the 3 months after delivery. The study was carried out in 
      a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community.
      Altogether, 325 pregnant women completed all five questionnaires. RESULTS: The
      total amounts of reported sleep and of nocturnal sleep increased significantly
      during the first trimester of pregnancy, began to decrease thereafter and were
      shortest during the 3 months after pregnancy. During late pregnancy expectant
      mothers over 30 years of age reported less sleep than those under 30. During the 
      whole pregnancy, but increasingly toward the end of pregnancy, sleep became more 
      restless and fragmentary and its subjective quality worsened, due at least partly
      to increased restless legs and nightly awakenings increasing with advancing
      pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as 
      the first trimester of pregnancy, although total sleeping time increases. The
      amount of reported sleep begins to decrease in the second trimester. The
      frequency of reported sleep disturbances, such as restless legs syndrome and
      nocturnal awakenings, is maximum in the third trimester but is about normal
      within 3 months after delivery.

TI  - Pregnancy in a persistent vegetative state: case report, comparison to brain
      death, and review of the literature.
PG  - 738-48
AB  - UNLABELLED: Severe maternal neurologic injury during pregnancy has the potential 
      for fetal demise without advanced critical care support to the mother. Brain
      death is the unequivocal and irreversible loss of total brain function, whereas
      patients in a vegetative state, by contrast, have preserved brain stem function
      but lack cerebral function. They can appear to be awake, have sleep-wake cycles, 
      be capable of swallowing, and have normal respiratory control, but there are no
      purposeful interactions. These conditions have different maternal prognoses, but 
      both have resulted in near-normal neonatal outcomes with long latencies from
      maternal injury to delivery in previously published cases. This article compares 
      and contrasts the 11 cases of brain death with 15 cases of persistent vegetative 
      state in pregnancy. We found that the mean latency between maternal brain injury 
      and delivery was significantly shorter in the brain-dead patients as compared
      with those in a vegetative state (46 days vs. 124 days, P </=.001).
      Correspondingly, the gestational ages at delivery (29.7 weeks vs. 33.2 weeks, P
      </=.01) and the birth weights (1380 g vs. 2145 g, P </=.01) were shorter in
      duration and smaller in size in the brain-dead group. We also present a case of
      persistent vegetative state in pregnancy at our institution with both maternal
      and neonatal death in the context of previously published literature with a focus
      on obstetric and ethical management. We hope this information will help elucidate
      the issues for providers confronted with these unique and challenging cases.
      TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING
      OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to state 
      the difference between coma, persistent vegetative state and brain death, to
      describe the neurologic aspects of a patient in a persistent vegetative state,
      and to list the fetal effects of maternal brain injury.

TI  - The prevalence of restless legs syndrome among pregnant women in Japan and the
      relationship between restless legs syndrome and sleep problems.
PG  - 673-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To clarify the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in
      pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the relationship between sleep
      problems and RLS, in order to discuss ways for pregnant women to obtain
      comfortable sleep and to improve the health of both the mother and child. DESIGN:
      A cross-sectional questionnaire survey. SETTING: 500 clinical institutions with
      maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of organizations identified 
      in a survey by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these
      500 institutions, 260 participated in the survey. PARTICIPANTS: 16,528 pregnant
      women living in Japan. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In this
      survey of pregnant women, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%. An
      analysis was conducted on the relationship between RLS and other factors such as 
      subjective evaluation of sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty
      maintaining sleep, early morning awaking, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The
      result of this analysis suggested that women with these sleep-related problems
      were more likely to have RLS than those without. In addition, RLS was more
      prevalent in the later stages of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: In the pregnant women in 
      our survey, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%, which is higher than the
      prevalence of RLS that has been found in the general public in a previous study. 
      This suggests that RLS-related sleep problems may be an important public health
      issue among pregnant women in Japan. This finding may have implications for
      attempts to improve sleep hygiene in this group.

TI  - Sleep disorders in pregnancy.
PG  - 477-83
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy. The spectrum
      of association between pregnancy and sleep disturbances ranges from an increased 
      incidence of insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, and parasomnias (especially restless
      legs syndrome) to snoring and excessive sleepiness. These disturbances occur as a
      result of physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes associated with pregnancy. 
      Although the timing and occurrence of different sleep disorders varies, they are 
      most prevalent during the third trimester. Despite reports of the various sleep
      problems, the exact nature and incidence of sleep disorders in pregnancy is not
      known. Given that limitation, we are presenting an up-to-date review of the
      current understanding of the relation between sleep and pregnancy. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Studies suggest that pregnancy affects sleep in multiple ways. There
      are hormonal changes, physiologic changes, physical factors, and behavioral
      changes in a pregnant woman-all of which may affect her sleep. They may affect
      the duration and quality of sleep and lead to a variety of sleep disorders.
      Pregnancy may also affect an existing sleep disorder. Particular attention may be
      given to obese pregnant women who would gain more weight during pregnancy or
      those who develop hypertensive conditions (eg, preeclampsia). Snoring may be more
      common in women with preeclampsia and the pressor responses to obstructive
      respiratory events during sleep may be enhanced in preeclamptic women when
      compared with those with obstructive sleep apnea alone. Several investigators
      have suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be common in pregnant women
      despite the presence of intrinsic mechanisms that seem to be geared towards
      preventing sleep apnea. However, the exact incidence and prevalence of sleep
      apnea in pregnant women is uncertain. In addition, it is unclear if criteria that
      are used to define sleep apnea in the general population should be applied to
      pregnant women. Further investigations are needed to determine if lower
      thresholds for management of OSA should be used in pregnant women to prevent harm
      to the fetus. SUMMARY: In conclusion, sleep disturbances are common during
      pregnancy though the full extent of this relation remains undefined. Large,
      multi-center, prospective studies are needed for better understanding.

TI  - The role of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein in a mouse model of fetal 
      alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 790-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of
      mental retardation. Peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), related to
      activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), prevent alcohol-induced damage
      in a mouse model of FAS. Our objective was to characterize ADNP in this model to 
      relate this protein to the mechanisms of damage and peptide neuroprotection.
      STUDY DESIGN: Timed, pregnant C57Bl6/J mice were treated on day 8. Groups were
      control, alcohol, peptide pretreatment, or peptide alone. Embryo and decidua were
      harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days. To evaluate ADNP expression, real-time
      polymerase chain reaction was performed with results presented as the ratio of
      ADNP-to-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) concentration. Analysis 
      of variance was performed for overall comparisons with P<.05 considered
      significant. RESULTS: At 6 hours, there was no difference in ADNP between
      alcohol-exposed embryos compared with control embryos. At 24 hours, there was an 
      increase in ADNP in alcohol-exposed embryos compared with controls (P<.001);
      these findings persisted at 10 days (P<.001). In the decidua at 6 hours, there
      was no difference between alcohol and control. At 24 hours, there was greater
      ADNP in alcohol-exposed decidua compared with controls (P<.001), which did not
      persist at 10 days (P=.97). Peptide pretreatment did not prevent the
      alcohol-induced increase in ADNP in embryo or decidua. CONCLUSION: Alcohol
      increased embryonic and decidual ADNP expression at 24 hours and it persisted in 
      the embryo for 10 days. Because ADNP is a known neuroprotectant, these findings
      suggest that it may be released as a protective mechanism in FAS. Changes in the 
      embryo were persistent suggesting that the embryo is more vulnerable to
      alcohol-induced damage than the mother.

TI  - Order and disorder in the brain function.
PG  - 151-60
AB  - The interest in studying the brain electrical activity as a function of the
      development of intelligence has been spurred by the need to understand how the
      brain responds to environmental information. The description of sleep in mentally
      retarded children reveals deviant patterns of the EEG-spindles and of the eye
      movement activity (REM sleep) when compared to normal children. The patterns may 
      be considered as a valuable index of mental function. According to experimental
      evidence, the distribution of the eye movements of sleep appears either as random
      or ordered. The latter are altered in the mentally handicapped in whom the
      appearance out of chaos, of the order which is needed for intelligence and memory
      to function, is altered. The sleep signs are redundant as from birth. Their
      pattern is also related to the psychomotor development of the infant. If their
      distribution remains random, or appears in long uninterrupted sequences of waves 
      as in epilepsy, intelligence does not develop. A similar strategy appears to
      function in the foetus when nature organizes the structures that will lead to the
      development of intelligence. The eye movement patterns of sleep change in the
      pregnant women as a function of term and resemble those of premature babies of a 
      similar gestational age. They also change as a function of the menstrual cycle
      and more generally as a function of age. The hypothesis that attention is the
      diurnal equivalent of REM sleep is discussed. Attempts at modelling the eye
      movement patterns of REM sleep as a function of near zero gravity environments
      have been made. 1) By means of a Montecarlo simulation using the semi Markov
      model during the Spacelab 1 flight. 2) With the method of the single and multiple
      g-phase transition analysis of the strange attractor dimension (d) during
      parabolic flights. The implication of the latter for the neural processes
      involved in learning is that the central nervous system can preserve intact, from
      input to output, over a period of several days, all the information it receives
      3) The relation between spindles and eye movements has also been viewed by a
      quantum approach which is another medium between the information and the way of
      describing it.

TI  - Development of fetal and neonatal sleep and circadian rhythms.
PG  - 321-34
AB  - The origin of sleep and circadian rhythms development is found during the fetal
      period. Both quiet (NREM) and active (REM) sleep are distinguishable during the
      last 10 weeks of gestation. Comparable to fetuses, low risk preterm infants
      recorded at 30-40 weeks postconceptional age, had a similar development of sleep 
      i.e. an increase in quiet sleep and a decrease in indeterminate sleep. A further 
      development in sleep organization characterized by increased slow wave and
      spindle activity during quiet sleep and coupling with circadian rhythm takes
      place during the first 6 months of life in both term and preterm
      infants.Circadian rhythm of fetal heart rate synchronized with maternal
      rest-activity, heart rate, cortisol, melatonin, and body temperature rhythms is
      present during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Although maternally influenced,
      circadian rhythm antenatally becomes ultradian at birth. Both preterm and term
      infants show a significant increase in circadian body temperature rhythm
      amplitude during the first 3 months of life.

TI  - Seasonal reproductive endocrine profile of the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes
      procyonoides)-effects of melatonin and food deprivation.
PG  - 180-7
AB  - The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides, Canidae, Carnivora) is a middle-sized 
      omnivore with excessive autumnal fattening and winter sleep. We studied
      adaptations of the species to boreal climate and photoperiod by following the
      plasma reproductive and thyroid hormone concentrations of farm-bred raccoon dogs 
      (n=32) for 12 months. On August 16, 2000, and February 8, 2001, half of the
      raccoon dogs received continuous-release melatonin implants (the MEL group). The 
      other half was sham-operated (the SHAM group). Between November 27, 2000, and
      January 25, 2001, half of the animals of both groups were fasted. The plasma
      testosterone concentrations of the MEL males peaked in February, a month earlier 
      than in the SHAM males. Autumnal melatonin treatment also advanced the gestation 
      period reflected by the plasma progesterone concentrations by seven weeks. Food
      deprivation in winter seems to accentuate the sex steroid response during the
      mating as the fasted males had higher testosterone concentrations than the fed
      males in February and March.

TI  - Medications in pregnancy and lactation.
PG  - 585-613
AB  - Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers 
      to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not
      adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use.
      Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on
      concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by
      expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are
      treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising
      discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that
      breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should
      therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following
      approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the
      breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest
      drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants,
      has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, 
      has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is
      less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4.
      Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant 
      or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility
      that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of
      serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the
      daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including
      patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs
      to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or
      breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks
      and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications
      should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases,
      treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency
      physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that
      breastfeeding may safely continue.

TI  - First-time parents' prenatal to postpartum changes in health, and the relation of
      postpartum health to work and partner characteristics.
PG  - 304-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate prenatal to postnatal
      changes in first-time parents' physical and mental health, and to describe social
      and health predictors of parents' postpartum health. METHODS: This prospective
      study surveyed 261 expectant fathers and mothers during pregnancy and again at 6 
      months' postpartum regarding their health, partner, and work characteristics.
      Postpartum changes in health were evaluated by paired t tests, and predictors of 
      postpartum health were determined using multiple regression analyses. RESULTS:
      Both fathers and mothers experienced significant postpartum declines in perceived
      quality of life. In addition, fathers reported an increase in the number of days 
      ill and a decrease in general health and vitality after childbirth. Mothers
      perceived an increase in vitality despite their diminishing sleep. Parents'
      postpartum health was associated with mothers' partner satisfaction, fewer
      illness days, and certain work characteristics, such as total work time and the
      balance of work between mothers and fathers. CONCLUSIONS: Both mothers and
      fathers experienced declines in health that persisted at least 6 months after the
      birth of their first child. Notably, postpartum health was associated with
      partner satisfaction and work characteristics. This information might be used to 
      develop interventions for improving parents' health during this vulnerable time.

AB  - Investigations on using of index possibilities of L-arginin/NO system in
      evaluation of sanatorium-resort treatment effectiveness of pregnant with
      cardiovascular disorders were conducted. It was analyzed the dynamics of twenty
      four hour cycle rhythm of L-arginin and total nitrites and nitrates constance in 
      saliva of 58 pregnant, 20 of which were suffering from metabolic cardiomyopathy, 
      23-from neurocirculatory dystonia and 15 were healthy pregnant. As the result of 
      examination there were found out considerable changes of parameter values of
      biological rhythms: duration of rhythm, average twenty four hour cycle range of
      activity, amount of difference between max index per twenty hour cycle and
      average index per twenty hour cycle, period of max and min activity. Analysis of 
      tendencies of twenty four hour cycles rhythms concerning dynamics of
      sanatorium-resort treatment will give possibility to define characteristic
      features of recovering values of this parameter.

TI  - Fetal behaviour does not differ between boys and girls.
PG  - 17-26
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about sex differences in human fetal heart and
      behaviour. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-three nulliparous healthy
      women carrying a male (n=56) or female (n=67) fetus participated in this study.
      All pregnancies remained uncomplicated and delivery was uneventful. Ultrasound
      observation of fetal general movements (GM) was performed for 1 h at 15-17 (T1)
      and 27-28 (T2) weeks of gestation and for 2 h at 37-39 weeks (T3). Fetal heart
      rate (FHR) monitoring occurred simultaneously with fetal ultrasound observations 
      at T2 and T3. The incidence of GM (percentage of time), FHR and its variability, 
      and the incidences of fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) A-D and behavioural states 
      1F-4F were compared between boys and girls. RESULTS: There were no significant
      differences between males and females in the distribution of HRP A-D, overall
      behavioural state distribution, and basal FHR, FHR variability or the presence of
      GM during quiet and active sleep (or during HRP A and HRP B, respectively). A
      TimeXSex interaction effect for GM assessed for total record length and a higher 
      %GM in male fetuses at term age were the only significant findings. However,
      these observations lost statistical significance after adjustment for the effects
      of fetal wakefulness, which occurred to a higher extent in male than in female
      fetuses. CONCLUSION: Our data do not provide evidence for a difference in fetal
      functional development or maturation between the two sexes.

TI  - Steroid-sensitive GABAA receptors in the fetal sheep brain.
PG  - 461-72
AB  - Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5
      alpha-pregnan-20-one) influence central nervous system (CNS) excitability by
      increasing GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) inhibitory activity. Allopregnanolone
      concentrations are higher in the fetal compared to the adult ovine brain,
      suggesting that this neurosteroid may have a role in regulating fetal CNS
      activity during gestation. We examined the localisation of
      allopregnanolone-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in the fetal brain to determine if
      their sensitivity to allopregnanolone changed during late gestation. The binding 
      of [(35)S] tert-butylbicyclophosothionate (TBPS) was used to identify the
      GABA-chloride ion receptor complex in fetal sheep brains at 90-95, 115-120 and
      140-145 days gestational age (GA; term approximately 147 days), by
      autoradiography. Allopregnanolone (200 nM) reduced [(35)S]TBPS binding by 70-100%
      throughout the brain at all fetal ages examined. The levels of [(35)S]TBPS
      binding increased with advancing gestation in all regions examined except some
      areas of the medulla. Functionally related nuclei and brain areas associated with
      regulating somato/viscerosensory functions displayed high levels of [(35)S]TBPS
      binding from mid-gestation. These results indicate that allopregnanolone may
      interact with GABA(A) receptors to inhibit fetal CNS activity from mid-gestation.
      This inhibition may contribute to maintaining the sleep-like behaviour and low
      incidence of arousal-type activity typical of fetal life, and may be
      neuroprotective by limiting excitatory neurotransmission.

TI  - Use of a maternity support binder for relief of pregnancy-related back pain.
PG  - 495-502
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a
      support binder for low back pain in pregnancy. DESIGN: Pilot study, using a
      prospective, two-group design with repeated measures. SETTING: Ambulatory
      maternity clinic in a tertiary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Women of at 
      least 20 weeks gestation with low back pain, but no preexisting back or disc
      disease. Thirty women assigned to the intervention group and 10 to a comparison
      group. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a pain assessment at pretest.
      Intervention participants received a maternity support binder to wear while awake
      for 2 weeks. At an appointment 2 weeks later, a posttest questionnaire and a
      taped interview were administered. The comparison group participants received the
      support binder after the second appointment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Back pain
      intensity, duration, and effect on daily activities were assessed using a pain in
      pregnancy questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group had significant
      reduction in mean pain scores and effect of pain on daily activities, including
      family, house and yard, recreational, exercise, and sleep. Interaction of group
      by time was significant for change in pain and effect on family, house and yard, 
      and exercise activities. CONCLUSION: The use of a support binder for
      pregnancy-related low back pain is a promising intervention and was well-accepted
      by the participants.

TI  - Co-bedding versus traditional bedding of multiple-gestation infants in the NICU.
PG  - 5-10; quiz 10-1
AB  - This study was part of a large departmental performance improvement initiative to
      implement and evaluate developmental and family-centered care as "best practice" 
      in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The goal was to evaluate the safety, 
      effect on infant clinical and developmental outcomes, and maternal satisfaction
      of co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants compared to traditionally bedded
      infants/mothers. A secondary purpose was to evaluate co-bedding and American
      Academy of Pediatrics-recommended "back to sleep" behaviors in the same
      infants/mothers after discharge. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive design
      was used. Chart reviews and mailed written surveys were used to collect study
      data. Findings showed no significant differences in demographic variables or
      clinical and developmental outcomes between the total traditionally bedded and
      co-bedded groups. All mothers reported positive experiences with the NICU.
      Co-bedding may promote maternal bonding and has no negative clinical or
      developmental outcomes. Once policies and education are in place, parents should 
      be offered the option to co-bed multiple-gestation infants in the NICU. There is 
      a performance improvement opportunity regarding the education provided to parents
      of multiple-gestation infants before discharge on the "back to sleep"
      recommendations.

TI  - [An epidemiological study of sleep problems among the Japanese pregnant women].
PG  - 526-39
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify: 1) what kinds of sleep
      problems that pregnant women experience in Japan; and 2) the relationships
      between sleep problems and month of pregnancy, sleep problems and the number of
      pregnancies, and sleeping hours, by means of a questionnaire given to pregnant
      women in Japan. Conditions to assure good quality sleep were studied. METHODS: Of
      500 obstetric facilities which were randomly selected from areas surveyed by the 
      Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 260 finally agreed to
      participate in this study. Women who had their pregnancy confirmed and were on a 
      revisit to the 260 obstetric facilities were enrolled. These pregnant women
      completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires during the waiting time for 
      treatment and submitted them to the obstetric facilities in sealed envelopes. The
      questionnaire covered personal attributes such as age and highest level of
      education, pregnancy status, working status, and patterns of smoking and alcohol 
      drinking. Sleep-related items such as 1) subjective sleep quality, 2) difficulty 
      in getting to sleep, 3) frequent awakenings, 4) waking up too early, 5) sleeping 
      hours and 6) daytime drowsiness were also included. RESULTS: The month of
      pregnancy was significantly related to four sleep-related items, including
      difficulty in getting to sleep and waking up too early. With respect to the
      relationship between the number of pregnancies and sleep problems, significance
      was found for five sleep-related items, including subjective sleep quality and
      waking up too early. Poor subjective sleep quality was significantly related to
      sleeping less than seven hours and whether or not pregnant women had a regular
      job. It was also suggested that the greater the number of pregnancies, the
      shorter the sleeping hours. When responses to each sleep-related item were
      compared between pregnant women and the general population, the former were more 
      likely to have sleep problems. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that as well as
      the number of pregnancies and month of pregnancy with sleeping hours may be
      factor intimately related to sleep problems during pregnancy. A good quality
      sleep during pregnancy is vital for normal maternal health and fetal growth and
      sufficient sleeping hours are therefore needed. Attention should therefore be
      paid to the finding that pregnant women were more likely to have sleep problems
      than the general population.

TI  - Normal pregnancy and oxygenation during sleep.
PG  - 128-32
AB  - Pregnancy is associated with significant alterations in respiratory function.
      Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and
      residual volume (RV), increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen
      (A-alphaPO2) and in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction
      with sleep-related apneas or hypopneas, these could lead to maternal oxygen
      desaturation during sleep. Because of the conflicting data from sleep studies in 
      late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 11 pregnant women at 36 
      weeks of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the PaO2, every 2h. The
      frequency of apneas and hypopneas was significantly lower during pregnancy
      compared with that on the postpartum control night. PaO2 levels in the supine
      position, during sleep, were also significantly lower during pregnancy compared
      to the postpartum period. No correlation was observed between PaO2 levels and
      apneas or hypopneas or percent of REM sleep.

TI  - Premature labor and birth: influence of rank and perception of fatigue in active 
      duty military women.
PG  - 385-90
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether stress, sleep disturbance, or 
      fatigue at 22 to 26 weeks of gestation is related to the incidence of preterm
      labor and birth in military women. Data were collected prospectively by
      questionnaires measuring factors contributing to preterm labor and birth. Hours
      worked per week were ascertained by telephone until the participants delivered.
      Postpartum medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. There was a
      trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity,
      low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events. Officer rank was related to
      both preterm labor and delivery. Findings indicate that the perception of fatigue
      may be protective against preterm birth and that military officer rank is a risk 
      factor for preterm labor and birth.

TI  - Co-bedding versus single-bedding premature multiple-gestation infants in
      incubators.
PG  - 340-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the physiological stability and behavioral effects of
      co-bedding with those of single-bedding premature multiple-gestation infants in
      incubators as well as the psychological effects on their parents. DESIGN:
      Prospective, randomized, repeated measure. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 16
      infants and 8 parents in the co-bedded group, and 21 infants and 11 parents in
      the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Infants in the study group were co-bedded in
      incubators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline and posttesting for parental state
      anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction measures; infant
      sleep-wake synchronicity; physiological measures; and stress cue measures during 
      baseline and activity. MAIN RESULTS: Repeated measures 5 (time) x 2 (group)
      analysis of variance found significant differences in infant daily weight,
      feeding amount, and high-activity heart rate. There was no difference in parental
      state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction scores by group,
      except for higher baseline parental satisfaction scores in the co-bedded group.
      CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the safety of co-bedding
      multiple-gestation infants in incubators but did not find any significant
      clinical improvement in infant or parental outcomes with co-bedding. Neonatal
      intensive-care unit providers should educate staff and parents about the
      potential benefits of co-bedding and consider developing policies and procedures 
      for co-bedding in both incubators and cribs. Co-bedding of multiple-gestation
      infants may be provided as an adjunctive developmental care strategy if parents
      desire this intervention.

TI  - Corneal endothelial morphology results in the Menicon Z 30-day continuous-wear
      contact lens clinical trial.
PG  - 14-6
AB  - PURPOSE: This evaluation was conducted as part of a protocol entitled Evaluation 
      of the Menicon Z Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lens for up to 30 Days Extended
      Wear. The purpose of the protocol was to compare corneal endothelial morphology
      changes after wearing rigid gas-permeable (RGP) Menicon Z contact lenses,
      continuously for up to 30 days, with ACUVUE (Johnson & Johnson Vision Care)
      hydrogel contact lenses, worn for up to 6 nights of extended wear. METHODS: Sixty
      patients, who were adapted to RGP daily wear and soft contact lens daily wear,
      were recruited at two study sites. The thirty subjects who wore RGP daily wear
      lenses were fitted with the Menicon Z (tisilfocon A, oxygen permeablility [Dk] = 
      163) RGP contact lens comprised the test group. The control group subjects (n =
      30 former users of daily wear soft contact lenses) were fitted with ACUVUE
      (etafilcon A, Dk = 28) hydrogel contact lenses. After a 2-week adaptation period 
      of daily wear, subjects began extended wear. Endothelial imaging was performed at
      the two study sites in this multicenter study (University Hospitals of
      Cleveland/Case Western Reserve University Department of Ophthalmology [CWRU] and 
      The Ohio State University [OSU]). The hydrogel lens group was instructed to wear 
      their lenses for 7 days and 6 nights before discarding the lenses and to sleep
      with no lenses on the seventh night. The RGP group was permitted to wear the
      lenses for up to 30 days and 29 consecutive nights before removing the lenses for
      cleaning and overnight soaking. RESULTS: CWRU had 24 patients (12 soft contact
      lens and 12 rigid contact lens) and OSU had 21 patients (12 soft contact lens and
      9 rigid contact lens) who completed the study and were included in the analyses. 
      Patients who were withdrawn from the study at CWRU included one RGP patient
      dropped out because of pregnancy; one RGP patient developed vascularized limbal
      keratitis and discomfort; one could not be fitted with a bitoric RGP; two soft
      lens patients moved from the area, and one dropped out because of dry eyes. At
      OSU, four patients dropped out due to discomfort (two in each lens type);one
      moved from the study area; one decided not to participate soon after the consent 
      visit; one had worries of reduced vision at 6 months; one subject's attitude
      changed prior to the 6 month visit; and one subject was withdrawn for reasons of 
      poor study schedule compliance. CONCLUSION: The Menicon Z lens wearers in this
      study did not show significant endothelial cell morphology changes after 1 year
      of nearly continuous contact lens wear. This finding is particularly important
      considering the RGP wearers in this study were older by a average of 10 years
      (mean age approximately 40) and had worn their contact lenses an average of
      almost 10 years longer than the soft contact lens wearers.

TI  - Pregnancy anxiety and comorbid depression and anger: effects on the fetus and
      neonate.
PG  - 140-51
AB  - One hundred sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anxiety
      during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high anxiety women also had high
      scores on depression and anger scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the
      fetuses of the high anxiety women were noted to be more active and to experience 
      growth delays. The high anxiety mothers' high prenatal norepinephrine and low
      dopamine levels were followed by their neonates having low dopamine and serotonin
      levels. The high anxiety mothers' newborns also had greater relative right
      frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high
      anxiety mothers spent more time in deep sleep and less time in quiet and active
      alert states and showed more state changes and less optimal performance on the
      Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (motor maturity, autonomic stability
      and withdrawal). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for
      elevated anxiety symptoms during pregnancy.

TI  - Respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia in small for gestational age infants
      influenced by maternal smoking.
PG  - F217-22
AB  - AIM: To determine any variation in the respiratory responses to
      hypoxia/hypercapnia of infants born small for gestational age (SGA) to smoking
      and to non-smoking mothers. METHODS: A total of 70 average for gestational age
      (AGA) infants (>36 weeks gestation, >2500 g, >25th centile for gestational age,
      and no maternal smoking), and 47 SGA infants (<10th centile for gestational age) 
      were studied at 1 and 3 months of age, in quiet and active sleep. Respiratory
      test gases were delivered through a Perspex hood to simulate face down
      rebreathing by slowly allowing the inspired air to be altered to a CO(2) maximum 
      of 5% and O(2) minimum of 13.5%. The change in ventilation with inspired CO(2)
      was measured over 5-6 minutes of the test. The slope of a linear curve fit
      relating inspired CO(2) to the logarithm of ventilation was taken as a
      quantitative measure of ventilatory asphyxial sensitivity (VAS). RESULTS: There
      was no significant difference in VAS between the AGA and SGA infants (0.25 v
      0.24). However within the SGA group, VAS was significantly higher (p = 0.048) in 
      the infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (0.26 (0.01); n = 24) than in
      those that did not (0.23 (0.01); n = 23). The change in minute ventilation was
      significantly higher in the smokers than the non-smokers group (141% v 119%; p = 
      0.03) as the result of a significantly larger change in respiratory rate (8 v 4
      breaths/min; p = 0.047) but not tidal volume. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking
      appears to be the key factor in enhancing infants' respiratory responses to
      hypoxia/hypercapnia, irrespective of gestational age.

TI  - [Sudden infant death syndrome].
PG  - 524-5
AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a disease of unknown cause. The occurrence
      of SIDS is rare during the first month of life, increases to a peak between 2 and
      4 months old, and then declines. The following have been consistently identified 
      across studies as independent risk factors for SIDS: prone sleep position,
      sleeping on a soft surface, maternal smoking during pregnancy, young maternal
      age, bedsharing, prematurity and/or low birth weight, and male sex. Although the 
      cause of the sudden infant death syndrome is multifactorial, contemporary
      hypotheses include defects in arousal or cardiorespiratory control. The
      interesting is hypothesis that prolongation of the QT interval may have a role in
      the pathogenesis of SIDS.

TI  - Effects of sleep position, sleep state and age on heart rate responses following 
      provoked arousal in term infants.
PG  - 157-69
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction may be involved in
      Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The major risk factors for SIDS are the
      prone sleeping position and maternal smoking. Our aim was to examine the effects 
      of sleeping position and maternal smoking on the postnatal maturation of
      autonomic function by examining heart rate responses following arousal in healthy
      term infants. Twenty-four infants (11 born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy
      and 13 to mother who did not smoke) were studied using daytime polysomnography
      and multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cm H(2)O) in response to air-jet 
      stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) 
      and quiet sleep (QS). We demonstrated no difference between smoking and
      non-smoking groups of infants in any of our measurements, and thus combined data 
      from the groups. Baseline (BHR) was elevated in the prone compared to the supine 
      position in quiet sleep (QS) at 2-3 weeks (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.001), and
      in active sleep (AS) at 2-3 and 5-6 months (p<0.05). BHR was significantly
      elevated in AS compared to QS in the supine position at all ages (p<0.01) and in 
      the prone position at 2-3 (p<0.001) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). Increases in heart
      rate (deltaHR%) following arousal were significantly greater in the supine
      compared to the prone position in QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and in AS at both 2-3 
      (p<0.01) and 5-6 months (p<0.05). DeltaHR% was significantly greater in AS
      compared to QS in both supine (p<0.05) and prone (p<0.001) positions at 2-3 weeks
      and in the supine position at 2-3 months (p<0.001). We conclude that sleep state,
      sleep position and postnatal age affect the cardiac responses following arousal
      from sleep in healthy term infants. Impairment of heart rate control in the prone
      position may be important in understanding the increased risk for SIDS in this
      position.

TI  - Circadian expression of Mel1a and PL-II genes in placenta: effects of melatonin
      on the PL-II gene expression in the rat placenta.
PG  - 57-66
AB  - In the mammal, melatonin regulates the seasonal and/or circadian rhythm of PRL
      levels. Since several members of the PRL gene family are expressed during late
      pregnancy, we investigated the relationship between the expression of placental
      lactogen (PL)-II-one member of the PRL family- and melatonin, as well as the
      placental expression of one of the receptors for melatonin, melatonin receptor 1a
      (Mel(1a())). Herein we provide the first demonstration that Mel(1a) is not only
      expressed in the rat placenta, but that it is spatially and temporally regulated 
      throughout late pregnancy. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses show 
      that Mel(1a) mRNA is localized in the rat placenta on gestational day 19, and is 
      mainly restricted to the spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cells.
      Interestingly, the junctional zone of the placenta at this time showed the
      strongest gene expression when the tissue was obtained at 16:00 h (daytime) and
      showed the least expression when it was obtained at 04:00 h (night-time). In
      contrast, the labyrinth zone showed the strongest expression in tissue obtained
      at night and showed the least expression in tissue obtained during the day. PL-II
      gene expression also exhibited a circadian rhythm but the direction of the
      fluctuation was exactly opposite to that of the Mel(1a) gene, such that at night 
      the junctional zone had the strongest expression, while the labyrinth zone had
      the weakest. In vitro treatment of placental tissue with an melatonin agonist,
      chloromelatonin, greatly decreased PL-II mRNA levels. That Mel(1a) plays a
      regulatory role in the expression of PL-II in the late-pregnancy rat placenta is 
      strongly suggested by the pattern of its own spatial and temporal expression.

TI  - Circadian rhythm of blood pressure challenges office values as the "gold
      standard" in the diagnosis of gestational hypertension.
PG  - 135-56
AB  - Despite poor sensitivity and specificity, office blood pressure (BP)
      determinations are still the "gold standard" for diagnosing gestational
      hypertension. This prospective blind study evaluates the prognostic value of
      office values as compared with ambulatory monitoring in pregnancy. We analyzed
      2175 BP series systematically sampled from 355 non-preeclamptic pregnant women
      for 48 h every 4 wks from the first hospital visit until delivery. Women were
      divided for comparative purposes into three groups: "detected" gestational
      hypertension, defined on the basis of casual clinical BP> 140/90 mmHg after 20
      wks of gestation and hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of
      a time-specified tolerance interval adjusted for the circadian pattern of the
      reference population) consistently above the threshold for diagnosing
      hypertension in pregnancy; "undetected" gestational hypertension, women with
      office BP < 140/90 mmHg but hyperbaric index consistently above the threshold for
      diagnosis; and normotension, women with both office values and hyperbaric index
      below the respective thresholds for diagnosis. Small and insignificant
      differences in the 24h mean BP between "detected" and "undetected" gestational
      hypertension is observed in all trimesters, in contrast with highly significant
      differences between these two groups and normotensive pregnancies. Normotensive
      women are characterized by highly significant lesser incidence by 60% in preterm 
      delivery, 70% in intrauterine growth retardation, and 50% in delivery by cesarean
      section (p < 0.001) compared with women with "detected" and "undetected"
      gestational hypertension (p > 0.715). In pregnancy, the hyperbaric index is
      markedly superior to office BP measurements for diagnosis of what should be truly
      considered gestational hypertension, and for prediction of the outcome of
      pregnancy.

PG  - 103-8
AB  - The effects of shift work on physiological function through disruption of
      circadian rhythms are well described. However, shift work can also be associated 
      with specific pathological disorders. This article reviews the evidence for a
      relationship between specific medical disorders and working at night or on shift 
      systems. The strongest evidence exists for an association with peptic ulcer
      disease, coronary heart disease and compromised pregnancy outcome.

      deficiency and SIDS due to various forms of magnesium depletion: possible
      importance of the chronopathological form.
PG  - 269-78
AB  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) might be due to the fetal consequences of a
      Mg maternal deficiency, which might be prevented by simple atoxic nutritional Mg 
      intake by the mother. Various stresses in the pregnant women or in the infant may
      transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion which may not be cured by
      nutritional Mg supplement, but requires a correction of its causal dysregulation.
      Beside the well established risk factors in baby care and in the environment, it 
      is important to stress the possible role of a primary hypofunction of the
      biological clock. This may be treated by darkness therapy: total light
      deprivation at night for the infant and atoxic nutritional Mg supplement for the 
      pregnant women. The place in the prevention of SIDS of Mg therapy for the infant 
      and of the use of melatonin, L-tryptophan and taurine is now uncertain yet.

TI  - [Intrauterine hypoxia and sudden infant death syndrome].
PG  - 109-18
AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the
      sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has 
      been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or
      recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development
      of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia,
      although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the
      fetal life. The mechanisms underlying SIDS include neurologically compromised
      infants who are deprived of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a
      hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions 
      involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain
      result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the
      pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei,
      defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and
      hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included
      passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs,
      alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation,
      perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in
      pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20
      years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in
      pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking 
      has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which result in
      fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence 
      of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell
      count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal
      cerebral blood flow, and increases maternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially
      neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal
      hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine,
      endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy 
      smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and
      intensive antenatal monitoring.

TI  - Sleep in women across the life cycle from adulthood through menopause.
PG  - 155-77
AB  - Studies of sleep across the life cycle in women have utilized both survey and
      polysomnographic techniques, but have tended to be of small sample size with
      diverse methodology. As a result, definitive conclusions about the impact of the 
      menstrual cycle and use of oral contraceptives on sleep parameters cannot yet be 
      made. Sleep disruption during pregnancy and postpartum is nearly universal, but
      effective and practical countermeasures are still needed. Longitudinal studies of
      sleep in the postpartum period are also lacking. Menopause is associated with
      insomnia due to several factors including hot flashes, mood disorders and
      increased sleep-disordered breathing. The use of hormone replacement therapy to
      treat sleep and other variables is an active area of investigation. In summary,
      much research is required to fully elucidate the impact of the life cycle on
      sleep parameters in women.

TI  - Respiratory effects of gestational intermittent hypoxia in the developing rat.
PG  - 1540-7
AB  - Intermittent hypoxia (IH), one of the hallmarks of obstructive sleep apnea,
      occurs more frequently during pregnancy. We hypothesized that IH may lead to
      persistent postnatal changes in respiratory responses to acute hypoxia and may
      also lead to adverse effects on spatial function learning as revealed by the
      Morris water maze. To examine this issue, time-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      exposed to IH and room air (IHRA; 21 and 10% O2 alternations every 90 seconds) or
      to normoxia (RARA) until delivery. Ventilatory and metabolic responses to a
      20-minute acute hypoxic challenge (10% O2) were conducted at postnatal ages 5,
      10, 15, and 30 days. In addition, spatial task learning was assessed in the water
      maze at 1 and 4 months of age. Normoxic ventilation was higher at all time points
      in IHRA rats than in RARA rats (p < 0.01). Peak hypoxic ventilatory responses
      were attenuated in IHRA rats at 5 days of age and hypoxic ventilatory depression 
      was accentuated at this age as well. However, ventilatory equivalents (minute
      ventilation/oxygen consumption) revealed significant reductions in peak hypoxic
      ventilatory responses of IHRA rats and hypoxic ventilatory depression at all
      postnatal ages (p < 0.01). Acquisition and retention of a spatial task were
      similar in the IHRA and RARA groups at both 1 and 4 months of age. We conclude
      that gestational intermittent hypoxia elicits long-lasting alterations in the
      control of breathing. We postulate that such IH-induced respiratory plasticity
      may create selective vulnerability to hypoxia during development.

TI  - Apoptosis in the human ovary.
PG  - 24-35
AB  - Programmed cell death or apoptosis is an essential component of human ovarian
      function and development. During early fetal life approximately 7 x 10(6) oocytes
      are formed in the human ovary. However, the number of oocytes is dramatically
      reduced already before birth through apoptotic cell death. In reproductive life, 
      a number of primordial follicles start growing during each menstrual cycle.
      Usually only one will ovulate and the fate of the rest of the follicles is
      atresia through the mechanism of apoptosis. Ultimately, only around 400 follicles
      will ovulate during a woman's reproductive life. After ovulation, the dominant
      follicle forms the corpus luteum, a novel endocrine gland that is responsible for
      the production of progesterone and maintenance of endometrium during early
      pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, corpus luteum action must cease so that
      new follicles can resume growing during the next menstrual cycle. Apoptosis is
      also responsible for corpus luteum regression in the human ovary. In recent
      years, new knowledge of the role and regulation of apoptosis in the ovary has
      been acquired through the use of knockout and transgenic animals. Apoptosis seems
      to be the mechanism that makes the female biological clock tick. The following
      review will discuss the role of apoptosis and its regulation of human ovarian
      function.

TI  - Muscular cramps: proposals for a new classification.
PG  - 176-86
AB  - Muscle cramps are involuntary, painful, sudden contractions of the skeletal
      muscles. They are present in normal subjects under certain conditions (during a
      strong voluntary contraction, sleep, sports, pregnancy) and in several
      pathologies such as myopathies, neuropathies, motoneuron diseases, metabolic
      disorders, hydroelectrolyte imbalances or endocrine pathologies. There has been
      considerable uncertainty in the literature regarding the classification and
      nomenclature of muscle cramps, both because the term "cramp" is used to indicate 
      a variety of clinical features of muscles, leading to its use as an imprecise
      "umbrella" term that includes stiffness, contractures and local pain, and because
      the spectrum of the diseases in which it appears is wide. The purpose of the
      present study is to propose a simple classification to provide a framework to
      better recognize the full spectrum of phenomenology of muscle cramps.

TI  - [Obstructive sleep apnea of gestational period].
PG  - 295-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on
      the pregnant women. METHOD: 465 women in pregnancy were studied by random. The
      snoring rate, the relation with hyper blood pressure and preeclamptism, and the
      influence on infant were observed. RESULT: The magnificent statistics shows total
      snoring rate is 24.7%(115/465). 21.3%(92/442) is after pregnancy, of them, 28.7% 
      meet the standard of OSAS, 12.17% with hyper blood pressure, 7.8% with
      preeclamptism, 5.2% infant with aplasia. CONCLUSION: Diseases incidence with OSAS
      is more oboious than that with normal pregnant women. OSAS has a marked1
      influence on pregnancy. Pregnant women with obvious OSAS can be regard as an
      independent factor of high risk pregnancy. We should pay more attentions to them 
      in their early stage.

TI  - Women and sleep.
PG  - 707-18
AB  - Naturally fluctuating hormones (menstrual cycle, through pregnancy or menopausal 
      transition) are not related to marked sleep disturbances in women. It is likely, 
      however, that subsets of women will display a central nervous system
      vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations so that sleep disturbances manifest as a
      part of a complex of discomforting symptoms. Sleep is impacted directly through
      the circadian system or brain sleep regulation or through the development of
      concurrent functional changes and symptoms. Women are susceptible to
      sleep-related disorders that are also common in men, such as primary insomnia and
      SBD although the contributing factors and manifestations may not be the same.

TI  - Neonatal monitoring after maternal fentanyl analgesia in labor.
PG  - 597-608
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize different methods of monitoring neonatal effects
      associated with maternal opioid analgesia. Special focus was on the
      static-charge-sensitive bed (SCSB), which could potentially serve as a
      non-invasive neonatal monitor. METHODS: 12 healthy, term newborns from normal
      pregnancies were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled study.
      Maternal labor analgesia was either intravenous fentanyl (n = 5) or paracervical 
      bupivacaine blockade (n = 7). Neonatal recording from delivery to the age of 12
      hours included continuous SCSB monitoring with ECG and oximeter for sleep states,
      respiration, oxygenation, heart rate, and body movements. In addition, umbilical 
      blood pH, Apgar, Amiel-Tison's Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scoring (NACS),
      skin cyanosis scoring, blood pressure, rectal and skin temperatures, and skin
      blood flow measurements were performed. RESULTS: The study was interrupted,
      because one baby in the fentanyl group had a significant decrease in
      oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) to 59%. This was considcred to be residual effect
      of fentanyl and was treated with naloxone. SpO2 was generally lower in the
      fentanyl group. Epochs with SpO2 < 90% were more frequent in the fentanyl group, 
      especially during active sleep (mean +/- SD 11.9 +/- 10.7% vs. 2.0 +/- 1.7% of
      epochs, p = 0.034). Mean heart rate values were lower in the fentanyl group
      (121.1 +/- 6.4 vs. 132.6 +/- 6.8 beats per minute, p = 0.02), and this difference
      was seen during wake and all sleep states. Maximum heart rate values were lower
      in the fentanyl group, too. The opiate group had less quiet sleep than controls
      (9.6 +/- 2.8% vs. 18.3 +/- 8.3%, p = 0.05). NACS after birth was lower in the
      fentanyl group (median [range] 15 [13-26] vs. 22 [20-25], p = 0.004).
      CONCLUSIONS: Several differences were seen between the fentanyl and the control
      group babies. The SCSB method proved sensitive enough to find neonatal effects of
      maternal analgesia. Together with ECG and SpO2 monitoring, SCSB gives plentiful
      information on neonatal well-being in a non-invasive way. Results of this study
      emphasize the importance of neonatal monitoring after maternal opiate use in
      labor.

TI  - Quality of life experienced by adults with congenital heart disease.
PG  - 42-53
AB  - Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a growing population of
      patients. Medical and surgical advances have increased the number of CHD adult
      survivors, which may create quality-of-life (QOL) issues not previously
      considered. Quality-of-life issues pertinent to this patient population involve
      health and life insurance acquisition, birth control, genetic counseling,
      pregnancy concerns, employment, and independent living arrangements. The purpose 
      of this study was to describe the QOL of adults with CHD. The study used a
      prospective cross-sectional case-control design to examine QOL using the Sickness
      Impact Profile (SIP). The study participants were a sample of 124 adults with CHD
      from an outpatient cardiology clinic in a metropolitan university-affiliated
      teaching hospital in the Northeast and 124 matched healthy control subjects.
      Between the participants and the matched control subjects, there was a
      significant difference in the total mean SIP score, the physical and psychosocial
      dimension scores, and all the category scores (P < 0.05). The areas of life the
      adults with CHD reported as lacking in quality involved the categories of work
      (SIP of 11.1, moderate disability) and sleep and rest (SIP of 9.03, mild
      disability). The results of this study indicate that the SIP can be used for
      quantitative and subjective QOL assessment of adults with CHD. It is suggested
      that cardiac advanced practice nurses use the results of this study to develop
      appropriate information, counseling, and anticipatory guidance for this patient
      population.

TI  - Pregnancy rhinitis and rhinitis medicamentosa.
PG  - 527-30
AB  - PURPOSE: To present guidelines for the recognition, management, and referral of
      pregnancy rhinitis with a goal of improving the quality of the pregnancy
      experience for women afflicted with this condition. DATA SOURCES: A case study
      illustrating the presentation of a severe case of pregnancy rhinitis is followed 
      a literature review of etiology, diagnosis, and management strategies.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy rhinitis is a condition of clinical importance that is
      frequently exacerbated by use of intranasal decongestant sprays. The resulting
      rhinitis medicamentosa exacerbates the nasal obstruction, with resulting sleep
      disruptions that negatively impact the experience of pregnancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      PRACTICE: Nurse practitioners may miss opportunities to provide support,
      anticipatory guidance, and symptom relief. Anticipatory guidance that stresses
      the critical necessity of avoiding nasal spray decongestants, environmental
      modification, use of intranasal saline, moderate exercise, and nasal strips for
      subjective relief may have the potential to markedly decrease escalation of the
      condition to a serious disorder.

PG  - 175-8
AB  - Development of neurotensin (NT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP),
      vasopressin (AVP) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) expressing neurons was investigated in
      the human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus of nine subjects ranging from 20-40 weeks
      of gestation using immunocytochemistry and morphometry. Results obtained showed
      that NT expressing neurons developed earlier than VIP, AVP and NPY expressing
      neurons. Consistent with results obtained from animal studies, we also found VIP 
      expressing neurons were born earlier than AVP expressing neurons. Whether the NT 
      expressing neurons play a role in generating circadian rhythms in the early life 
      of humans needs to be further investigated.

TI  - Changes in comorbidities and improvements in quality of life after LAP-BAND
      placement.
PG  - 51S-54S
AB  - Possibly the most important outcomes of bariatric surgery involve changes in
      obesity-related illness, quality of life (QOL), and psychologic well-being.
      Dramatic improvement or resolution of serious medical comorbidity accompanies the
      weight loss following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with the LAP-BAND
      (INAMED Health, Santa Barbara, CA). There are major improvements in the
      conditions of the metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by impaired glucose 
      tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Improvement in insulin sensitivity and
      pancreatic beta-cell function associated with weight loss induces remission in
      the majority of type 2 diabetics and reduces the risk of others developing type 2
      diabetes. Improvement in dyslipidemia is characterized by raised high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride concentrations. Together with
      lower blood pressure, these changes provide a substantial reduction in
      cardiovascular risk. Other medical conditions caused or aggravated by obesity are
      also significantly improved, including sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness, asthma,
      and gastroesophageal reflux. Weight loss is associated with improved fertility
      and more favorable pregnancy outcomes. All aspects of QOL improve substantially, 
      especially physical disability, and post-weight-loss QOL measures approximate
      those of the general population. There are also major improvements in body image 
      and reduction in depressive illness. These changes provide perhaps the most
      compelling data regarding the value of LAP-BAND surgery and underlie the great
      satisfaction experienced by patients.

TI  - Fractal and periodic heart rate dynamics in fetal sheep: comparison of
      conventional and new measures based on fractal analysis.
PG  - H1858-64
AB  - The physiological significance of spectral and fractal components of spontaneous 
      heart rate (HR) variability in the fetus remains unclear. To examine the
      relationship between circadian rhythms in different measures of HR variability,
      R-R interval time series obtained by fetal ECGs were recorded continuously over
      24 h in five pregnant sheep at 116-125 days gestation. Conventional measures of
      short-term (STV) and long-term variability (LTV), low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15
      cycles/beat) and high-frequency (HF; 0.2-0.5 cycles/beat) spectral powers, the
      LF-to-HF ratio, and fractal dimension values were calculated from 24-h ECG
      recordings and quantified every 60 min. STV, LTV, and LF and HF spectral powers
      were minimal during the day but increased significantly to their highest values
      at night. We found a significant positive correlation between these measures,
      whereas the cosinor method showed significant similarity between their circadian 
      rhythm patterns. Fetal R-R intervals also exhibited fractal structures. Fetal HR 
      variability had a fractal structure, which was similar between day and night.
      These results suggested that the circadian rhythms exhibited by STV and LTV
      during the day were mainly due to changes in frequency components rather than to 
      fractal components of fetal HR fluctuation.

TI  - Prenatal anger effects on the fetus and neonate.
PG  - 260-6
AB  - One hundred and sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anger
      during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high-anger women also had high
      scores on depression and anxiety scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the
      fetuses of the high-anger women were noted to be more active and to experience
      growth delays. The high-anger mothers' high prenatal cortisol and adrenaline and 
      low dopamine and serotonin levels were mimicked by their neonates' high cortisol 
      and low dopamine levels. The high-anger mothers and infants were also similar on 
      their relative right frontal EEG activation and their low vagal tone. Finally,
      the newborns of high-anger mothers had disorganised sleep patterns (greater
      indeterminate sleep and more state changes) and less optimal performance on the
      Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (orientation, motor maturity and
      depression). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated
      angry mood during pregnancy.

TI  - Prenatal nicotine exposure blunts the cardiorespiratory response to hypoxia in
      lambs.
PG  - 1544-9
AB  - Because smoking during pregnancy is a major risk factor for late fetal death and 
      the sudden infant death syndrome, we investigated cardiorespiratory defense
      mechanisms to hypoxia in 7 prenatally nicotine-exposed (N) lambs (approximate
      maternal dose: 0.5 mg/kg/day) and 11 control (C) lambs all at an average age of 5
      days. The ventilatory response to 10% oxygen (hyperpnea) was significantly
      attenuated during quiet sleep in N lambs compared with C lambs and in N lambs
      aroused from sleep later compared with C lambs (161 +/- 90 versus 75 +/- 66
      seconds, p < 0.05). The ventilatory response to hypoxia was similar in the two
      groups during wakefulness (W), whereas the heart rate response (tachycardia) was 
      significantly lower in N lambs compared with C lambs during both activity states.
      The ventilatory response to hyperoxia was significantly lower in N lambs compared
      with C lambs during both activity states. Transition from W to quiet sleep was
      associated with a significant decrease in ventilation in C lambs but not in N
      lambs. In conclusion, prenatal nicotine exposure, at a dose comparable with
      moderate smoking, blunts major elements of the cardiorespiratory defense to
      hypoxia, i.e., the heart rate and ventilatory and arousal responses, and
      abolishes the normal decrease in ventilation during sleep compared with W.

TI  - Manifold decreased protein levels of matrin 3, reduced motor protein HMP and
      hlark in fetal Down's syndrome brain.
PG  - 1752-7
AB  - Down's syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation and
      although known for more than a hundred years, the underlying pathomechanisms for 
      the phenotype and abnormal brain functions remain elusive. Performing protein
      hunting in fetal Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) brain we detected aberrant
      expression of several proteins. Fetal brain cortex from controls and Down's
      syndrome at the early second trimester of gestation was used for expressional
      analysis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis with subsequent in-gel digestion of
      spots and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization spectroscopical
      identification followed by quantification of spots with specific software was
      applied. The nuclear matrix protein matrin 3, cytoskeletal motor protein HMP, and
      the circadian clock protein hlark were significantly decreased in fetal DS brain.
      C8ORF2 protein was reduced but did not reach statistical significance. Prox1 and 
      predicted protein Dj149A16.6 were comparable between groups. Reduction of brain
      proteins may represent or cause deficient cytoskeletal structure, transcription
      machinery and exocytosis, functions already known to be deteriorated in DS brain.
      Some of the described proteins were only predicted and we here show the existence
      of the corresponding proteins in fetal human brain.

TI  - [Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy].
PG  - 1706-13
AB  - UNLABELLED: The rare association of Cushing's syndrome and pregnancy is explained
      by the amenorrhea and sterility inherent to the syndrome. In the literature, 125 
      cases have been reported: 30 cases of early diagnosis and 95 others diagnosed in 
      the second half of pregnancy. AT THE START OF PREGNANCY: When hypercorticism
      exists before pregnancy it is hardly secretory. Its diagnosis, at an early stage,
      is not hindered by the hormone modifications of pregnancy. Its aetiological
      treatment raises the problem of the compatibility in pursuing the latter. IN THE 
      SECOND HALF OF PREGNANCY: The positive and aetiological diagnoses of Cushing's
      syndrome are difficult and its prevalence may therefore be underestimated. The
      evocative clinical signs are unspecific: excessive weight gain, hypertension of
      pregnancy and gestational diabetes. The 24-hour free hypercortisoluria and the
      absence of dexamethasone inhibition are of little diagnostic value after the 14th
      week of amenorrhea. The positive diagnosis therefore relies essentially on the
      abolition of the circadian rhythm of cortisol. The biological hyperandrogenia
      commonly observed is not discriminating. Adrenal aetiologies are frequent.
      Imaging must be performed to eliminate an adrenocortical tumor. PROGNOSIS: The
      maternal prognosis depends on the hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes and the
      complications of Cushing's syndrome. It depends on the activity of the
      hypercorticism and its early aetiological treatment, which must not be delayed
      after pregnancy. The foetal prognosis depends on the maternal prognosis. It is
      represented by preterm delivery, hypotrophy and death of the foetus in utero. The
      therapeutic management must be symptomatic and aetiologic, maternal and
      obstetrical.

TI  - Risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome among northern plains Indians.
PG  - 2717-23
AB  - CONTEXT: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal
      mortality among American Indians, a group whose infant death rate is consistently
      above the US national average. OBJECTIVE: To determine prenatal and postnatal
      risk factors for SIDS among American Indians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living
      controls among American Indians in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa
      enrolled from December 1992 to November 1996 and investigated using standardized 
      parental interview, medical record abstraction, autopsy protocol, and infant
      death review. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of SIDS with maternal
      socioeconomic and behavioral factors, health care utilization, and infant care
      practices. RESULTS: The proportions of case and control infants who were usually 
      placed prone to sleep (15.2% and 13.6%, respectively), who shared a bed with
      parents (59.4% and 55.4%), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7% and
      54.6%) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7% of case infants and 45.5% of
      control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic 
      regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of
      clothing on the infant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.2; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.4-26.5), any visits by a public health nurse (aOR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8),
      periconceptional maternal alcohol use (aOR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.6-23.3), and maternal 
      first-trimester binge drinking (aOR, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.9-35.3). CONCLUSIONS: Public 
      health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and 
      first trimester, and layers of clothing are important risk factors for SIDS among
      Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and 
      programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could
      potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.

TI  - Incidence of cranial asymmetry in healthy newborns.
PG  - e72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: During recent years, coincident with the recommendation to position
      infants supine, the incidence of posterior deformational plagiocephaly has
      increased dramatically. The purpose of our study was to determine whether early
      signs of cranial flattening could be detected in healthy neonates and to document
      incidence and potential risk factors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was
      performed in healthy newborns. Physical findings, anthropometric cranial
      measurements, and data on pregnancy and birth were recorded. RESULTS: The
      incidence of localized cranial flattening in singletons was 13%; other anomalous 
      head shapes were found in 11% of single-born neonates. In twins, localized flat
      areas were much more frequent with an incidence of 56%. The following risk
      factors for cranial deformation were identified: assisted vaginal delivery,
      prolonged labor, unusual birth position, primiparity, and male gender.
      CONCLUSION: We propose that localized lateral or occipital cranial flattening at 
      birth is a precursor to posterior deformational plagiocephaly. The infant lies
      supine, with the head turned to the flattened area, and is unable to roll.
      Intrauterine risk factors for localized cranial flattening are the same as for
      deformational plagiocephaly. To avoid postnatal progression from a localized
      cranial flattening to posterior-lateral deformational plagiocephaly, we suggest
      amending the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics on sleep
      position: Alternate the head position and allow sleeping on the side and, when
      awake, supervise prone time.

TI  - Effects of shiftwork on sleep and menstrual function in nurses.
PG  - 703-14
AB  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities,
      reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep
      disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of
      shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working
      shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function.
      Sixty-eight nurses < 40 years old completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual 
      function, and pregnancy outcome. Fifty-three percent of the women noted menstrual
      changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more
      physiological symptoms (p < 0.003), slept approximately one hour less when
      working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep (p < 0.01) when
      working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual
      irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork
      intolerance.

TI  - The upper airway in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia.
PG  - 137-40
AB  - Snoring is common in pregnancy, and snoring pregnant women have increased rates
      of pre-eclampsia. Patients with pre-eclampsia show upper airway narrowing during 
      sleep. The present study aimed to compare upper airway dimensions in pregnant and
      nonpregnant women and in patients with pre-eclampsia. A total of 50 women in the 
      third trimester of pregnancy and 37 women with pre-eclampsia were recruited
      consecutively from the antenatal service and matched with 50 nonpregnant women.
      Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Comparisons were
      made by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Snoring was reported
      by 14% of nonpregnant women, 28% of pregnant women, and 75% of pre-eclamptic
      women (p < 0.001). When seated, pregnant women had wider upper airways than
      nonpregnant women (p < 0.02), but there was no difference when supine.
      Oropharyngeal junction area in the seated position was less (p < 0.01) in the
      women with pre-eclampsia (mean +/- SD: 0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2) than either nonpregnant
      (1.1 +/- 0.1 cm2) or pregnant women (1.3 +/- 0.1 cm2). Supine oropharyngeal
      junction area was less in the women with pre-eclampsia than in the nonpregnant
      women (0.8 +/- 0.1 versus 1.0 +/- 0.1 cm2; p = 0.01) but similar in women with
      pre-eclampsia and pregnant women (0.9 +/- 0.1 cm2; p > 0.3). The study showed
      that women with pre-eclampsia have upper airway narrowing in both upright and
      supine postures. These changes could contribute to the upper airway resistance
      episodes during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may further increase 
      their blood pressure.

TI  - Position of the abomasum in dairy cows during the first six weeks after calving.
PG  - 446-9
AB  - The position of the abomasum in six cows was examined by ultrasonography at
      regular intervals for six weeks after they had calved. Its position was
      established by determining the distance between the margin of the left side of
      the abomasum and the ventral midline at two sites. During the last weeks of
      pregnancy, the abomasum was positioned in a small region of the left ventral side
      of the abdominal cavity. At parturition it was positioned high on the left side
      and then descended. The abomasum was furthest from the midline immediately after 
      parturition. Its position was related to the interval after calving, the cow's
      feed intake, and the pH and osmotic pressure of the rumen fluid. There was
      considerable variation between the cows in the position of the abomasum, which
      was in part due to analytical variation, and in individual cows it had a
      circadian rhythm.

TI  - Biologic and molecular mechanisms for sex differences in pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics: Part II.
PG  - 617-29
AB  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology,
      including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies
      have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual
      cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the
      response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can
      bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the 
      cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the
      brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as
      related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur
      during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes 
      during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone,
      increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop
      in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of
      chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions.
      Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, 
      menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics
      is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of
      medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to 
      applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were
      addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to
      drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.

TI  - [Emergence of circadian rhythms in infants before and after birth: evidence for
      variations by parental influence].
PG  - 166-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Organisms have developed endogenous mechanisms for keeping track of
      time which allow them to adjust to environmental changes. Entrainment of
      endogenous rhythms to the day-night cycle is of elementary importance for the
      regulation of physiological processes. How environmental changes influence the
      manifestation of circadian rhythms during intrauterine and extrauterine growth
      depend on complex networking of molecular, physiological and sensory mechanisms. 
      This work reports on development of circadian rhythms in the infant, with
      particular emphasis on the roles of times cues to which the infant is exposed.
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Activity data of 12 families were continuously recorded
      during the first 4 months after birth using non-invasive actigraphs. Recordings
      of parental activity started at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Time series
      analysis was used to investigate the periodic structure of the data. In addition,
      we review the literature on the ontogenesis of circadian rhythms in humans.
      RESULTS: During the 3rd trimester, daily variation of physiological functions in 
      the fetus showed a high degree of correspondence with maternal circadian rhythms.
      Early behaviour of most infants was highly variable between individuals but could
      be assigned to different entrainment patterns. Good correspondence of
      mother-infant activity patterns during the early postnatal period, when the
      infant was not yet entrained to the day-night-cycle, was correlated with the
      rapid development of an entrained daily pattern in the infant a few weeks later. 
      CONCLUSION: Understanding the emergence of periodic structures at physiological
      and behavioural level during human ontogenesis will be an asset in the successful
      intervention and treatment during neonatal care.

TI  - S100B protein cord blood levels and development of fetal behavioral states: a
      study in normal and small-for-dates fetuses.
PG  - 378-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether S100B protein levels in cord blood and
      the development of fetal behavioral states were altered and interrelated in
      small-for-dates (SFD) fetuses. METHODS: Umbilical cord blood samples were
      collected from 12 SFD fetuses with normal umbilical artery (UA) Doppler findings,
      from six SFD fetuses with abnormal Doppler waveform patterns and from 36 controls
      matched for gestational age. S100B protein levels were measured by means of a
      specific radioimmunoassay. Fetal behavioral state recordings were made before
      delivery by Cesarean section and data were expressed as percentage of quiet sleep
      coincidence (C1F), of activity state coincidence (C2-4F) and of no coincidence
      (NOC). Flow velocimetry waveforms were recorded from the uterine artery, UA and
      fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA). RESULTS: Mean S100B protein levels in
      umbilical plasma were significantly higher in the six SFD infants with abnormal
      prenatal Doppler findings (3.31 +/- 0.65 microg/l) than in SFD infants with
      normal Doppler findings (1.56 +/- 0.35 microg/l) and in controls (1.23 +/- 0.43
      microg/l). Similarly in these fetuses NOC was higher and C2F significantly lower 
      (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in C1F. S100B concentrations 
      were correlated with the UA pulsatility index (PI) (r = 0.78, p < 0.01), with the
      MCA PI (r = -0.78, p < 0.01) and with the UA PI/MCA PI ratio (r = 0.80, p <
      0.01). Also, NOC and C2F percentages were correlated with the UA PI (r = 0.61, p 
      < 0.01 and r = -0.61, p < 0.01, respectively), with the MCAPI (r = -0.72, p <
      0.001 and r = 0.66, p < 0.01, respectively), and with the UA PI/MCA PI ratio (r =
      0.60, p < 0.01 and r = -0.54, p < 0.05, respectively). NOC was also correlated
      with S100B protein (r = 0.48, p < 0.05); the correlation of S100B protein and C2F
      almost reached significance (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      provides evidence of a relationship between a biochemical marker of brain
      development and/or integrity and the development of fetal behavioral states,
      offering additional information on brain maturation in normal and high-risk
      pregnancies.

TI  - Programming of the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus and subsequent adult
      rhythmicity.
PG  - 398-402
AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the generation and entrainment
      of circadian rhythms. Similar to other structures, it develops throughout
      gestation but is still immature for some time after. This suggests that the SCN
      could be vulnerable to maternal influences, such as poor nutrition, stress and
      drugs, all of which can affect neuronal development. Evidence is accumulating
      that suggests that this is the case, with body size at birth influencing
      melatonin production in adult humans and maternal malnutrition, and stress
      affecting sleep in rodents. Interestingly, the maternal environment affects the
      phase of rhythms and the response of the circadian timing system to light pulses.
      The nature of these changes in adult rhythmicity is similar to those commonly
      associated with depression in humans. Thus, abnormal fetal programming might
      predispose adults to depressive illness.

TI  - Effects of prone and supine positions on sleep state and stress responses in
      mechanically ventilated preterm infants during the first postnatal week.
PG  - 161-9
AB  - BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Preterm infants in mechanical ventilation are vulnerable
      and may manifest physiological instability and a disorganized behavioural state
      when responding to external stimuli. Adequate positioning strategies may play an 
      important role in protecting infants from environmental stressor and assisting
      quality of sleep. However, no study has examined effects of prone and supine
      positions on behavioural state and stress signs including startle, tremor, and
      twitch responses for ventilated preterm infants during the critical first week
      postbirth. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to compare effects of 
      prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress responses in
      mechanically ventilated preterm infants. DESIGN/METHODS: The infants were aged
      25-36 weeks of gestation, < or = 7 days of age, and without sedation or
      congenital abnormalities. Using a crossover design, 28 infants were randomly
      assigned to supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed
      in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before
      observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures
      were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. Behavioural state
      and frequencies of stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch were
      systemically recorded and analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance.
      FINDINGS: Infants when prone compared with supine had (a) less crying, less
      active sleep, and more quiet sleep states, and (b) fewer stress responses of
      startle, tremor, and twitch. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that prone positioning 
      improves the quality of sleep and decreases stress for ventilated preterm infants
      during the first week postbirth. These may conserve energy and assist infants'
      extrauterine adaptation.

TI  - Sudden infant deaths: from epidemiology to physiology.
PG  - S8-20
AB  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has dropped significantly in
      most countries following the development of education campaigns on the avoidance 
      of risk factors for SIDS. However, questions have been raised about the
      physiological mechanism responsible for the effects of these environmental risk
      factors. Since 1985, a series of prospective, multicentric studies have been
      developed to address these questions; over 20,000 infants were recorded during
      one night in a sleep laboratory and among these, 40 infants eventually died of
      SIDS. In this review, the following methods were employed: sleep recordings and
      analysis, monitoring procedure, data analysis of sleep stages, cardiorespiratory 
      and oxygen saturation, scoring of arousals, spectral analysis of the heart rate
      and the determination of arousal thresholds, and statistical analysis and the
      results including sleep apneas, arousals and heart rate and autonomic controls in
      both future SIDS victims and normal infants were introduced separately. In
      addition, the physiological effect of prenatal risk factors (maternal smoking
      during gestation) and postnatal risk factors (administration of sedative drugs,
      prone sleeping position, ambient temperature, sleeping with the face covered by a
      bed sheet, pacifiers and breastfeeding) in normal infants were analyzed. In
      conclusion, the physiological studies undertaken on the basis of epidemiological 
      findings provide some clues about the physiological mechanisms linked with SIDS. 
      Although the description of the mechanisms responsible for SIDS is still far from
      complete, it appears to involve both arousal responses and cardiac autonomic
      controls during sleep-wake processes.

TI  - Sidestream end-tidal capnometry as related to infant's position and maturation.
PG  - 869-73
AB  - UNLABELLED: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of body
      position on sidestream, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) wave measurements in
      maturing infants. Sidestream EtCO2 wave patterns were analysed longitudinally in 
      20 preterm infants (born at > or = 32 wk) at 32-37 wk gestation, and in 39
      full-term controls. Capnography measurements included maximal EtCO2, inspired CO2
      and frequency of apnoea events (>3 s) in the supine, supine with inclination,
      side and prone positions. Apnoea frequency decreased during maturation, and was
      less prevalent in the prone than in the supine and side positions in preterm as
      well as in term infants (p < 0.05). No clinically significant apnoea episodes
      were found in our cohort. EtCO2 in term infants was lower than that in preterm
      infants (p < 0.05) and was not affected by sleep position in the most premature
      (<33 wk) and in term infants (>36 wk). EtCO2 was higher in the prone position
      than in supine or side positions in infants between 33 and 35 wk gestation (p <
      0.01). CONCLUSION: Short apnoeic episodes decrease during maturation, and are
      less prevalent in the prone position in maturing infants (32-37 wk). Only modest 
      changes in EtCO2 were recorded in the different positions during maturation.

TI  - Relative right versus left frontal EEG in neonates.
PG  - 147-55
AB  - Although infants have been noted to have greater relative right or left frontal
      EEG as early as the neonatal period, other ways in which these newborns differ
      have not been reported. In this study, 48 newborns were divided on the basis of
      greater relative right versus greater relative left frontal EEG to determine
      whether these groups differed in other ways at the neonatal period including
      behavior, physiology, and biochemistry. We also were interested in whether these 
      EEG patterns were related to any prenatal maternal variables including mood
      states (depression, anxiety, anger) and biochemistry as well as fetal activity.
      The greater relative right frontal EEG newborns had mothers with lower prenatal
      and postnatal serotonin and higher postnatal cortisol levels. The mothers of the 
      greater relative right frontal EEG newborns also had greater relative right
      frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. The greater relative right frontal
      EEG newborns themselves had elevated cortisol levels, showed a greater number of 
      state changes during sleep/wake behavior observations, and performed less
      optimally on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment (T. B. Brazelton, 1973)
      including the habituation, motor, range of state, excitability, and depressive
      symptoms scales. These data suggest that greater relative right frontal EEG
      newborns may be at greater risk for developmental problems than those with
      greater relative left frontal EEG activation. In addition, a discriminant
      function analysis correctly classified 67% of the newborns' EEGs by prenatal
      maternal variables, suggesting that these might be used to target pregnant women 
      for prenatal intervention.

TI  - Higher maternal plasma docosahexaenoic acid during pregnancy is associated with
      more mature neonatal sleep-state patterning.
PG  - 608-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the developing fetal
      central nervous system (CNS) and related functional outcomes in infancy remain
      unexplored. Sleep and wake states of newborns provide a tool for assessing the
      functional integrity of the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether CNS integrity
      in newborns, measured with sleep recordings, was associated with maternal
      concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA. DESIGN:
      Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured in 17 women at
      parturition. On postpartum day 1 (P1) and day 2 (P2), a pressure-sensitive pad
      under the infants' bedding recorded body movements and respiratory patterns to
      measure sleep and wake states. RESULTS: Maternal plasma phospholipid DHA ranged
      from 1.91% to 4.5% by wt of total fatty acids. On the basis of previously
      published data and the median DHA concentration, the women were divided into 2
      groups: high DHA (> 3.0% by wt of total fatty acids) and low DHA (</= 3.0% by wt 
      of total fatty acids). Infants of high-DHA mothers had a significantly lower
      ratio of active sleep (AS) to quiet sleep (QS) and less AS than did infants of
      low-DHA mothers. Furthermore, the former infants had less sleep-wake transition
      and more wakefulness on P2. Correlations of maternal DHA status with infant sleep
      states were consistent with these data. Also, the ratio of maternal n-6 to n-3
      fatty acids on P1 was inversely associated with QS and positively associated with
      arousals in QS. On P2, maternal n-6:n-3 was positively associated with AS,
      sleep-wake transition, and AS:QS. CONCLUSION: The sleep patterns of infants born 
      to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity.

TI  - Effects of maternal tobacco smoking, sleeping position, and sleep state on
      arousal in healthy term infants.
PG  - F100-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a history of maternal tobacco smoking affected
      the maturation of arousal responses and whether sleeping position and infant age 
      alters these relations. DESIGN: Healthy term infants (13 born to mothers who did 
      not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy) were studied using
      daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) two to three weeks after birth,
      (b) two to three months after birth, and (c) five to six months after birth.
      Multiple measurements of arousal threshold in response to air jet stimulation
      were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both 
      prone and supine. RESULTS: Maternal smoking significantly elevated arousal
      threshold in QS when infants slept supine at 2-3 months of age (p<0.05). Infants 
      of smoking mothers also had fewer spontaneous arousals from QS at 2-3 months in
      both prone (p<0.05) and supine (p<0.001) sleeping positions. In infants of
      non-smoking mothers, arousal thresholds were elevated in the prone position in AS
      at 2-3 months (p<0.01) and QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and 2-3 months (p<0.001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Maternal tobacco smoking significantly impairs both stimulus induced
      and spontaneous arousal from QS when infants sleep in the supine position, at the
      age when the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome is highest.

TI  - Predictors of fatigue in healthy young adults: moderating effects of cigarette
      smoking and gender.
PG  - 222-33
AB  - Fatigue is a common complaint of patients seen in primary care. Factors that
      contribute to fatigue in a patient population include poor health status,
      psychological stress, poor nutrition, and pregnancy. Less well understood are
      factors that contribute to fatigue among healthy, nonpregnant individuals. Within
      the framework of the theory of unpleasant symptoms, 40 healthy young smoking and 
      nonsmoking adults between the ages of 18 and 35 were evaluated to determine
      self-report level of fatigue and contributing physiological, psychological, and
      situational factors. Results indicate that while self-report of fatigue did not
      vary in this population based on gender, subjects who were moderate to heavy
      cigarette smokers were significantly more fatigued than were nonsmokers (F =
      10.24, df = 1, 38, P < 0.01), with the effect being specific to male smokers.
      Self-report of fatigue did not correlate with body mass index, baseline
      inflammatory or immune status, or blood pressure. Positive psychological and
      situational predictors of fatigue included depression (r = 0.556, P < 0.001),
      state anxiety (r = 0.569, P < 0.001), sleep quality (r = -0.399, P < 0.05), and
      sleep quantity (r = -0.411, P < 0.05). These results suggest that psychological
      and situational factors are key contributors to fatigue in young adults and that 
      smoking is a risk factor for fatigue in men.

TI  - Prenatal hypoxia impairs circadian synchronisation and response of the biological
      clock to light in adult rats.
PG  - 387-95
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that prenatal hypoxia in rats
      might lead to consistent changes in the entrainment of the circadian clock by
      light. Pregnant female rats were placed in a chamber provided with hypoxic gas
      (10 % O2--90 % N2) at gestational day 5 and returned to normoxia before delivery.
      Once adult, rats born to hypoxic mothers had significant alterations in their
      circadian rhythm of locomotor activity (recorded in freely accessible running
      wheels). Under a regular 12/12 light/dark (LD) cycle, they showed a phase advance
      of their rhythm of activity (mean phase advance of 87 min) and were less active
      than control rats. After an abrupt 6 h phase delay in the LD cycle, rats from the
      prenatal hypoxic group (PNH) took significantly more time to resynchronise to the
      new LD cycle compared to controls (+53 %; 6.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 0.5 days
      respectively). Under constant darkness, PNH and control rats had a similar period
      of activity (24.27 +/- 0.20 vs. 24.40 +/- 0.13) but the response of PNH rats to a
      light pulse in the early subjective night was less marked than that of control
      rats (101 +/- 9 vs. 158 +/- 13 min). When submitted to acute restraint stress,
      PNH rats had a prolonged secretion of corticosterone compared to controls. These 
      results indicate that prenatal hypoxia is a factor that has long lasting
      consequences for the functional output of the biological clock and the hormonal
      response to stress.

TI  - Outcome correlates of parent-child bedsharing: an eighteen-year longitudinal
      study.
PG  - 244-53
AB  - We report results of the first longitudinal study of outcome correlates of
      parent-child bedsharing. Two hundred five families in nonconventional and
      conventional family lifestyles have been followed since 1975. A target child in
      each family was followed from the third trimester of mother's pregnancy through
      age 18 years. Bedsharing in early childhood was found to be significantly
      associated with increased cognitive competence measured at age 6 years, but the
      effect size was small. At age 6 years, bedsharing in infancy and early childhood 
      was not associated with sleep problems, sexual pathology, or any other
      problematic consequences. At age 18 years, bedsharing in infancy and childhood
      was unrelated to pathology or problematic consequences, nor was it related to
      beneficial consequences. We discuss these results in light of widespread fears of
      harm caused by parent-child bedsharing. We suggest that such fears are without
      warrant if bedsharing is practiced safely as part of a complex of valued and
      related family practices.

TI  - The impact of cobedding on sleep patterns in preterm twins.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - Interest in cobedding multiple-gestation infants has grown as focus has increased
      on the developmental approach to the care of the neonate. Little data, however,
      exist on the infants' response to cobedding. It is important to evaluate the
      safety, efficacy, and physiologic impact of this practice. Cobedding was offered 
      to parents of twin infants < 37 weeks gestation, without arterial lines or
      ventilator requirements, by the health care team according to standard practice
      in our nursery. After parental informed consent, infants were placed on an
      event-recording cardiorespiratory monitor for 12 hours before cobedding and for
      the first 12 hours of cobedding. Recordings were evaluated by an investigator
      blinded to the bedding status of the infant. Apnea (a pause of respiration > 10
      seconds, central apnea), bradycardia (a decline in heart rate to < 80 beats per
      minute), periodic breathing (a respiratory pattern in which there are > or = 3
      pauses in respiration of > or = 3 seconds with < 20 seconds of breathing between 
      pauses), adverse events (changes in medication, changes in oxygen requirements,
      temperature instability, the need for sepsis evaluation, or death) were
      evaluated. Other physiologic parameters were obtained through the use of standard
      bedside monitoring. Eleven sets of preterm infants, n = 22, with a mean gestation
      of 31.8+/-2.9 weeks and a mean birth weight of 1,698.7+/-552.0 grams were
      studied. Infants were evaluated at a corrected gestational age of 33.5+/-1.9
      weeks and a mean weight of 1,713.2+/-484.0 grams. The number of events of central
      apnea before cobedding (57) was greater than those recorded during cobedding
      (18), p<0.05. There was no difference found in any of the other parameters
      compared. The numbers of events recorded before and during cobedding were
      compared by Student's t-test and significance was determined by p < 0.05. No
      adverse events (AE) were noted, and all infants remained cobedded throughout the 
      study. This preliminary study suggests that cobedding of healthy preterm twins
      showed no increase in adverse events. Of the physiologic parameters studied, only
      the occurrence of central apnea changed with cobedding. This decrease in central 
      apnea may reflect a change in sleep pattern due to more frequent arousal by the
      twin. Alternatively, a more regular breathing pattern may reflect a positive
      physiological response to contact between twins.

TI  - Physician beliefs and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - The AAP has alerted pediatricians to the importance of safe sleep environment for
      infants. The elements of a safe sleep environment include supine sleep position, 
      safe crib, and avoidance of smoke exposure, soft bedding, and overheating. With
      the Back to Sleep campaign, prone sleeping among all U.S. infants has decreased
      to less than 20%, and the incidence of SIDS has decreased 40%. However, the
      decline in SIDS and prone sleeping has leveled off in recent years. Further
      declines may be possible with decreasing other modifiable risk factors, such as
      prenatal and postnatal exposure to cigarette smoking. Prior studies have
      demonstrated that health care professional advice is influential in determining
      infant care practices. It is important that physicians caring for infants be
      aware of the importance of a safe sleep environment and understand other
      modifiable risk factors for SIDS. We surveyed a random sample of 3,717 physicians
      in North Carolina and the metropolitan Washington, DC, area to determine
      knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction among
      physicians caring for pregnant women and infants. Twenty-three percent (835)
      responded. Most physicians are aware of prone sleeping and cigarette smoke
      exposure as risk factors for SIDS. Almost all physicians agree that there are
      measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS, and they consider it
      important to discuss SIDS and SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents of
      young infants. In spite of this belief, only 56% of family/general practitioners,
      18% of obstetrician-gynecologists, and 79% of pediatricians discuss SIDS
      routinely. Only 35% of pediatricians, 15% of family/general practitioners, and
      16% of obstetrician-gynecologists provide written information. In addition, only 
      38% of physicians recommend supine, while 50% recommend side or back, 6% side,
      and 7% prone. Only two thirds of pediatricians and one third of family/general
      practitioners are aware that the AAP recommends supine as the preferred sleep
      position for infants. Pediatricians are more likely to be aware of the AAP
      recommendation (p<0.0001) and to discuss SIDS risk reduction strategies with
      parents (p=0.03). We conclude that many physicians who care for infants are
      unaware of the AAP's most current recommendation for sleep position and are
      incorrectly recommending the side position. Physicians may also be unaware of
      other sleep environment hazards. Further educational efforts must continue for
      physicians who provide care to pregnant women and children to ensure a continued 
      decline in the incidence of SIDS.

TI  - Prostaglandin D2 and reproduction.
PG  - 295-302
AB  - This review highlights recent studies investigating the role of prostaglandin
      (PG)D2 in reproduction. PGD2 induces sleep, allergic responses, inhibition of
      platelet aggregation, and relaxation of vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle, 
      and has some roles in reproduction. Two types of PGD2 synthase are known.
      Lipocalin-type PGD synthase is present in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma and
      may play an important role in male reproduction. Another PGD synthase,
      hematopoietic PGD synthase is present in the spleen, fallopian tube, endometrial 
      gland cells, extravillous trophoblasts and villous trophoblasts, and perhaps
      plays an important role in female reproduction. Recent studies demonstrate that
      PGD2 is probably involved in multiple aspects of inflammation through its dual
      receptor systems, DP and CRTH2. CRTH2 but not DP is a chemo-attractant receptor
      for PGD2. Interestingly, CRTH2 is a most reliable marker for the detection of
      human T helper type 2 (Th2) and T cytotoxic type 2 (Tc2) cells, and the
      percentages of CRTH expressing CD4+-T cells and CD8+-T cells were significantly
      higher in the decidua especially at the implantation site, suggesting that Th2
      and Tc2 cells recruit into the materno-fetal interface, in a PGD2-mediated
      manner. PGD2 has a very unique effect to inhibit antigen presentation by
      inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) migration through DP but not CRTH2. PGD2 might 
      appear to contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy by controlling the Th1/Th2
      balance and antigen presentation by DCs through its dual receptor systems, CRTH2 
      and DP.

TI  - Behaviors of very preterm neonates as documented using NIDCAP observations.
PG  - 15-24
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the range and frequency of
      behaviors in neonates 24-30 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) using the Newborn
      Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP). DESIGN: A
      prospective design with convenience sampling was used. SAMPLE: Starting 24-72
      hours postnatally and continuing through 30 weeks PCA, 8,144 two-minute
      observations of 85 NIDCAP behaviors were collected and analyzed from 42 neonates 
      born at 24-29 weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The main outcome variables 
      were the frequencies of the 85 neonatal behaviors measured by the NIDCAP.
      Frequencies were organized first by subsystem (autonomic, motor, or state) and
      were categorized further based on week of PCA. Comparisons of behavioral
      frequencies by number of weeks PCA were completed using correlation and
      regression analyses. RESULTS: The most frequently observed behaviors were
      irregular respirations, pink color, postured flexion of the extremities, immature
      light sleep, and drowsiness. Least frequently observed behaviors consisted of
      burps, bowel movement, grunting, smooth motor movements, cooing, and speech
      movement. Regression analysis illustrated that the pattern of behavior was
      significantly similar week to week.

TI  - Alternative treatments for depression: empirical support and relevance to women.
PG  - 628-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: This article is a critical review of the efficacy of selected
      alternative treatments for unipolar depression including exercise, stress
      management techniques, acupuncture, St. John's wort, bright light, and sleep
      deprivation. Issues related to women across the life span, including pregnancy
      and lactation, are highlighted. DATA SOURCES: Evidence of efficacy is based on
      randomized controlled trials. A distinction is made between studies that address 
      depressive symptoms and studies that address depressive disorders. The review
      emphasizes issues related to effectiveness, such as treatment availability,
      acceptability, safety, and cost and issues relevant to women. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Exercise, stress reduction methods, bright light exposure, and sleep deprivation 
      hold greater promise as adjuncts to conventional treatment than as monotherapies 
      for major depression. The evidence to date is not sufficiently compelling to
      suggest the use of St. John's wort in favor of or as an alternative to existing
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration-regulated compounds. Initial evidence suggests 
      that acupuncture might be an effective alternative monotherapy for major
      depression, single episode. CONCLUSION: This review indicates that some
      unconventional treatments hold promise as alternative or complementary treatments
      for unipolar depression in women and have the potential to contribute to its
      long-term management. Additional research is needed before further
      recommendations can be made, and there is an urgent need to carefully document
      and report the frequency of minor and major side effects.

TI  - Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants.
PG  - CD002059
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may
      result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities,
      feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate
      symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological 
      treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an
      opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of
      NAS due to withdrawal from opiates. The evidence for use of different opiates was
      assessed in subgroup analyses. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of
      the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group including searches (up to March 2002) of the
      Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The
      Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (1966-March 2002), previous reviews
      including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings,
      expert informants, journal handsearching mainly in the English language.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an
      opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random
      allocation to opiate or control. Control could include an opiate, sedative or
      non-pharmacological treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed
      study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included control
      of symptoms, seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect
      was expressed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference
      (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a
      fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies enrolling a total of 511 infants
      met inclusion criteria (Carin 1983, Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986, Kandall 1983,
      Khoo 1995, Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986) may be
      sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled
      infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during
      pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than
      random patient allocation methods in three studies, and sizeable, largely
      unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four
      studies. Opiate (morphine) vs supportive care only: One study (Khoo 1995) found
      no significant effect on treatment failure (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a
      significant increase in hospital stay (MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and
      significant reductions in time to regain birthweight (MD -2.8 days, 95% -5.3,
      -0.3) and duration of supportive care (MD -197.2 minutes/day, 95% CI -274.2,
      -120.3). Opiate vs phenobarbital: Meta-analysis of three studies found no
      significant difference in treatment failure (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46, 1.32).
      One of these studies (Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a
      significant reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used 
      only opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be
      interpreted with caution. One study (Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in
      seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate. Opiate 
      vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in
      treatment failure (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of opiate. No study
      reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS:
      Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain
      birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the
      duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure.
      When compared to phenobarbital, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but,
      overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to
      diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis 
      generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the
      population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other 
      drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In
      view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of
      this review should be treated with caution. Further research is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may
      result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities,
      feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate
      symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological 
      treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using a
      sedative compared to a non-opiate control for NAS due to withdrawal from opiates,
      and to determine which type of sedative is most effective and safe. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used.
      This included searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane
      Library, Issue 1, 2002) and MEDLINE 1966-2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials
      enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% 
      follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to sedative or control.
      Control could include another sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data
      independently. Primary outcomes included treatment failure (failure to achieve
      symptom control or use of additional drug treatment), seizure occurrence,
      mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using (RR), risk
      difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD).
      Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Five
      studies enrolling a total of 285 patients met inclusion criteria (Finnegan 1984, 
      Kahn 1969, Kaltenbach 1986, Khoo 1995, Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984,
      Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. 
      Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random
      patient allocation methods in three studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained
      differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in three studies.
      Phenobarbital compared to supportive care alone has not been shown to reduce
      treatment failure or time to regain birthweight (one study). However, the
      duration of supportive care required to be given to infants each day was
      significantly reduced (MD -162.1 minutes/day, 95% CI -249.2, -75.1). Comparing
      phenobarbital to diazepam, meta-analysis of two studies found that phenobarbital 
      produced a significant reduction in treatment failure (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI
      0.24, 0.62). There was no significant difference in duration of treatment or
      duration of hospital stay. Comparing phenobarbital with chlorpromazine, one study
      found no significant difference in treatment failure rate. No data for
      neurodevelopment were available, reported by treatment group as allocated. No
      trials were eligible that assessed clonidine for NAS. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: In 
      newborn infants with NAS, there is no evidence that phenobarbital, compared with 
      supportive care alone, reduces treatment failure; however, phenobarbital may
      reduce the daily duration of supportive care needed. Phenobarbital, compared to
      diazepam, reduces treatment failure. There is insufficient evidence to support
      the use of chlorpromazine or clonidine in newborn infants with NAS. Clonidine and
      chlorpromazine should only be used in the context of a randomised clinical trial.
      The results of this review, taken in conjunction with the related review, Opiate 
      treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants (Osborn 2002), indicate that
      treatment with opiates is the preferred initial therapy for NAS. It is
      hypothesised that this is particularly true for infants whose mothers have used
      only opiates during pregnancy. If a sedative is used, phenobarbital is preferred 
      to diazepam. The results of an ongoing trial of the addition of phenobarbital to 
      an opiate are awaited.

TI  - Prostaglandin D synthase in the prenatal ovine brain and effects of its
      inhibition with selenium chloride on fetal sleep/wake activity in utero.
PG  - 5679-86
AB  - It has been proposed that prostaglandin (PG) D(2) induces physiological sleep in 
      mammals by acting on sleep centers located in the anterior hypothalamus. In fetal
      sheep, definitive rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep states
      appear at approximately 125 d gestation (term is approximately 147 d). In adult
      animals, PGD synthase (PGDS) (functionally and structurally homologous to
      beta-trace protein) is secreted into CSF with a circadian pattern, with the
      highest concentrations present during sleep. In this study we show that
      PGDS/beta-trace protein is present in fetal sheep CSF at 125 and 135 d gestation 
      but not at 90 d gestation. SeCl(4), a specific inhibitor of PGDS, was given to
      unanesthetized fetal sheep (130-140 d gestation) by intracerebroventricular
      infusion at a dose of 25, 100, 500, or 1000 pmol/min for 4 hr. Artificial CSF was
      infused in control experiments. Arousal behavior, defined as the presence of
      nuchal muscle electromyogram activity, electro-ocular activity, and breathing
      movements during low-amplitude electrocortical activity, increased from 3.8 +/- 1
      min/hr to 6.6 +/- 0.5 and 7.0 +/- 0.3 min/hr at doses of 100 and 500 pmol/min,
      respectively (p < 0.05). SeCl(4) at 25 and 1000 pmol/min had no significant
      effect on arousal activity. Infusion of PGD(2) at 500 pmol/min
      intracerebroventricularly for 4 hr decreased the incidence of arousal from 3.8
      +/- 0.5 min/hr to 0.7 +/- 0.3 min/hr (p < 0.05). When 500 pmol/min PGD(2) was
      infused immediately after a 4 hr infusion of SeCl(4) (500 pmol/min), the
      SeCl(4)-induced increase in arousal behavior was abolished. Together, the
      presence of PGDS/beta-trace protein in fetal CSF in late gestation and the
      effects of SeCl(4) in increasing the incidence of arousal-like behavior suggest
      that PGD(2) has a role in the induction and maintenance of prenatal sleep.

TI  - [Gastroesophageal reflux during pregnancy: 24-hour esophageal ph monitoring].
PG  - 740-5
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs in 30-50% of all pregnancies. The
      progressive rise in plasma progesterone has been suggested as a possible mediator
      of GER during pregnancy. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to
      detect GER through monitoring of esophageal pH for prolonged periods, including
      sleep. 24-hour pH monitoring is the proper method for diagnosing GER in pregnant 
      women. If 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is to be a useful diagnostic tool, it 
      must reliably discriminate GER patients despite daily variations in distal
      esophageal acid exposure. To address this issue, we studied 62 women (30 healthy 
      non-pregnant women without GER symptoms and 32 pregnant women with GER
      symptoms-heartburn, acid regurgitation) with 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring.
      Intrasubject reproducibility of three pH parameters to discriminate the presence 
      of abnormal acid reflux was determined (DeMeester score, Kaye score, circadian
      one hour diagram for pH < 4). Each patient was interviewed, using a reliable
      questionnaire detailing individual habits, life style characteristics and
      symptoms, at four time points during the first, second, third trimesters of
      pregnancy and post-partum period. Symptoms of GER are common in pregnancy and
      although GER rarely endangers maternal or fetal health, it can significantly
      affect patient comfort and quality of life. We conclude: 1. GER is almost
      constantly present during pregnancy, increasing with gestational age. 2. The most
      important pH--parameter is DeMcester score. 3. Heartburn disappear after
      delivery. 4. 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is the gold standard for measuring 
      acid exposure and is a reproducible test for the diagnosis of GER in pregnancy.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 588-92
AB  - End-organ damage associated with hypertension is more closely related to
      ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) than clinic or casual blood pressure
      measurements. ABP measurements give better prediction of clinical outcome than
      clinic or casual blood pressure measurements. The technique of ABP monitoring
      (ABPM) is specialised; validated monitors and appropriate quality control
      measures should be used. Interpretation of ABP profile should include mean
      daytime, night-time (sleep) and 24-hour measurements, and consideration of diary 
      information and time of drug treatment. Reports may also include ABP "loads"
      (percentage area under the blood pressure curve above set limits) for daytime and
      night-time periods. Normal blood pressure values for adults are < 135/85 mmHg for
      daytime, < 120/75 mmHg for night-time, and < 130/80 mmHg for 24 hours. ABPM is
      indicated to exclude "white coat" hypertension and has a role in assessing
      apparent drug-resistant hypertension, symptomatic hypotension or hypertension, in
      the elderly, in hypertension in pregnancy, and to assess adequacy of control in
      patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. White coat hypertension requires
      continued surveillance; patients who display this phenomenon may, in time,
      develop established hypertension. Appropriate use of ABPM may result in cost
      savings. Randomised controlled trials comparing management based on clinic or
      casual versus ABP measurements are needed.

      pregnancy-enhanced sleep.
PG  - 337-8
AB  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a crucial cytokine
      for establishing pregnancy. It has been demonstrated previously in rats that
      sleep increases during early pregnancy and that centrally administered GM-CSF
      promotes both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Therefore, whether
      GM-CSF is involved in pregnancy-enhanced sleep was investigated using the
      anti-GM-CSF antibody. Female rats received an intracerebroventricular infusion of
      either anti-GM-CSF or control IgG (10 microg each) for four nights from the first
      day of pregnancy (PD1-PD4). Although sleep amounts on PD1 were not affected,
      anti-GM-CSF decreased non-REM and REM sleep significantly during PD2-PD4 compared
      with the control baseline of the IgG group. The results demonstrated that
      anti-GM-CSF treatment suppresses pregnancy-enhanced sleep, suggesting that GM-CSF
      contributes to sleep regulation during pregnancy.

AB  - To understand the sleep-wake behaviours from the fifth pre-partum week to the

      evaluated in 10 women. It was found that total sleep time shortened, sleep
      efficiency decreased, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) increased in the weeks
      immediately after delivery. Compared with late pregnancy, total sleep time and
      sleep efficiency deteriorated significantly from the delivery week to the 12th
      post-partum week and there was a longer period of WASO until the 11th postpartum 
      week. The after-delivery sleep parameters estimated by the actigraph were worse
      than those estimated from sleep logs.

      and postpartum women.
PG  - 25-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the acceptability of an ambulatory blood pressure (ABP)
      monitor (SpaceLabs 90207) and a self-initiated blood pressure monitor (Omron
      HEM-705CP) to pregnant women. METHODS: Acceptability of the SpaceLabs 90207 and
      Omron HEM- 705CP monitors was evaluated, using a modified British Hypertension
      Device assessment form, by () healthy, pregnant women at <15 weeks (n = 120),
      35-37 weeks (n = 81), and 5-9 weeks postpartum (n = 86); and () women with
      preeclampsia (n = 52). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A monitor was acceptable if a woman
      graded the overall impression as "good" or "very good." RESULTS: Healthy women at
      <15 and 35-37 weeks' gestation and preeclamptic women reported the SpaceLabs
      90207 monitor caused discomfort in 54%, 52%, and 60%, interfered with activities 
      in 38%, 40%, and 23%, and disturbed sleep in 62%, 52% and 31%, respectively.
      Fewer than 12% in any group reported these problems with the Omron HEM-705CP
      monitor. In the 78 women who evaluated both monitors at 35-37 weeks, the
      SpaceLabs 90207 and Omron HEM-705CP were acceptable to 78% and 95% of healthy
      women, respectively (p = 0.005). Women with preeclampsia rated the Space-Labs
      90207 as "bad" or "fair" (14%), "good" (58%), and "very good" (28%) compared with
      "bad" or "fair" (8%), "good" (28%), and "very good" (64%) for the Omron HEM-705CP
      monitor (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women found the less intensive blood
      pressure monitoring with the Omron HEM-705CP more acceptable than the 24-h ABP
      monitoring with the SpaceLabs 90207. If accurate self-initiated blood pressure
      devices become available, pregnant women would prefer this method of home blood
      pressure monitoring.

TI  - Sleep disordered breathing and pregnancy.
PG  - 555-8
AB  - Many changes in the respiratory system occur during pregnancy, particularly
      during the third trimester, which can alter respiratory function during sleep,
      increasing the incidence and severity of sleep disordered breathing. These
      changes include increased ventilatory drive and metabolic rate, reduced
      functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial
      oxygen gradients, and changes in upper airway patency. The clinical importance of
      these changes is indicated by the increased incidence of snoring during
      pregnancy, which is likely also to reflect an increased incidence of obstructive 
      sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. For the respiratory physician asked to review a 
      pregnant patient, the possibility of sleep disordered breathing should always be 
      considered. This review first examines the normal physiological changes of
      pregnancy and their relationship to sleep disordered breathing, and then
      summarises the current knowledge of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy.

TI  - Mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic uses of thalidomide.
PG  - 274-85
AB  - Thalidomide was first introduced to the market in Germany under the brand name of
      Contergan in 1956, as a non-barbiturate hypnotic, advocated to ensure a good
      nights sleep and to prevent morning sickness in pregnancy. It was advertised for 
      its prompt action, lack of hangover, and apparent safety. It has been banned from
      the market since 1963 after it caused the worldwide teratogenic disaster: babies 
      exposed to thalidomide in utero during the first 34-50 days of pregnancy were
      born with severe life-threatening birth defects. Despite its unfortunate history,
      thalidomide has attracted scientific interest again because of its recently
      discovered action against inflammatory diseases and cancer. Its broad range of
      biological activities stems from its ability to moderate cytokine action in
      cancer and inflammatory diseases. Early studies examined its anxiolytic, mild
      hypnotic, antiemetic, and adjuvant analgesic properties. Subsequently,
      thalidomide was found to be highly effective in managing the cutaneous
      manifestations of leprosy, being superior to Aspirin in controlling
      leprosy-associated fever. Recent research has shown promising results with
      thalidomide in patients with myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, a variety of
      infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and progressive body weight
      loss related to advanced cancer and AIDS. Here we review the history of its
      development, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, biologic effects, and the results of
      clinical trials conducted thus far. Further research in this field should be
      directed towards better understanding of thalidomide metabolism, its mechanism of
      action, and the development of less toxic and more active analogs.

      abstinence syndrome].
PG  - 317-9
AB  - UNLABELLED: New finding: transient horizontal pendular nystagmus as a sequella to
      post-natal withdrawal syndrome. BACKGROUND: Children born of mothers who abused
      illegal substances during pregnancy can present with signs and symptoms of a
      withdrawal syndrome, including irritability, jitteriness, diarrhoea. Usually
      these symptoms appear from a few hours up to a few days after birth. It is
      frequently followed by a post-withdrawal period of several weeks duration with
      crying, excitability, sleep irregularities and feeding difficulties. The purpose 
      is to report the presence of nystagmus in infants born from drug-addicted
      mothers. METHODS: Five children born from drug-addicted mothers were examined.
      RESULTS: Three children (case 1 - 3) presented with congenital horizontal
      pendular nystagmus. Two other children (case 4 - 5) presented with a peculiar
      transient horizontal nystagmus, lasting 6 months and 7 months respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, transient horizontal pendular nystagmus has never 
      been reported in the literature. It was detected in two children who suffered
      from a post-natal withdrawal syndrome necessitating substitution therapy,
      including morphine. This may represent a form of morphine midbrain toxicity.

TI  - The association between fetal and maternal sleep patterns in third-trimester
      pregnancies.
PG  - 924-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the association between fetal heart rate and 
      maternal electroencephalogram patterns during overnight sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Data
      were collected prospectively between December 1, 1999, and June 30, 2001.
      Initially, the participating patients were asked to complete a 66-question survey
      for the assessment of maternal perception of sleep quality that was referred to
      as the sleep disturbance score: a continuous score from 0 (no evidence of sleep
      disturbance) to 110 (extreme sleep disturbance). Second, a subgroup of patients
      was monitored overnight by concomitant fetal heart rate and maternal
      electroencephalogram tracings. Statistical analysis included the Student t test, 
      chi2 test, logistic regression, and Cramer's V contingency correlation. RESULTS: 
      One hundred two singleton pregnancies formed the study population. The mean sleep
      disturbance score was 26.7 +/- 9.9. Maternal age was the only variable that
      correlated with sleep disturbance score. A subgroup of 11 patients was studied
      overnight. A significant correlation between active fetal sleep and maternal
      wakefulness was demonstrated in 6 patients. The mean sleep disturbance score for 
      these patients was significantly higher than for patients without such
      correlation (P =.04). CONCLUSION: This study establishes an association between
      fetal activity and maternal wakefulness, which explains many of the maternal
      awakenings during sleep in the third trimester.

TI  - Prevalence of selected maternal behaviors and experiences, Pregnancy Risk
      Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), 1999.
PG  - 1-27
AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Various maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and
      after pregnancy (e.g., unintended pregnancy, late entry into prenatal care,
      cigarette smoking, not breast-feeding) are associated with adverse health
      outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Information regarding maternal
      behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends, to enhance the
      understanding of the relations between behaviors and health outcomes, to plan and
      evaluate programs, to direct policy decisions, and to monitor progress toward
      Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This report
      covers data from 1993 through 1999. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk
      Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based
      surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors
      and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who
      deliver a live-born infant. PRAMS employs a mixed-mode data collection
      methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of
      mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with a telephone interview.
      Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and
      weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS
      analysis data sets. PRAMS generates statewide estimates of various perinatal
      health topics among women delivering a live infant. Data for 1999 from 17 states 
      are examined. In addition, trend data are examined for 12 states that had at
      least 3 years of data during 1993-1999. RESULTS: In 1999, the prevalence of
      unintended pregnancy resulting in a live birth ranged from 33.7% to 52% across
      the 17 states. During 1993-1999, only one state reported a decreasing trend in
      the prevalence of unintended pregnancy. Women aged <20 years, black women, women 
      with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid 
      were more likely to report unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of late or no
      entry into prenatal care ranged from 16.1% to 29.9%. The prevalence of late or no
      entry into prenatal care significantly decreased over time in seven of the 12
      states with trend data. In general, women aged <20 years, black women, women with
      less than a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely 
      to report late or no entry into prenatal care. The prevalence of smoking during
      the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 6.2% to 27.2%, and the prevalence
      decreased in five states from 1993 to 1999. Overall, smoking during the last 3
      months of pregnancy was associated with younger age (<25 years), non-Hispanic
      ethnicity, having less than or equal to a high school education, receiving
      Medicaid, and delivering a low birthweight infant. The prevalence of physical
      abuse by a husband or partner during pregnancy ranged from 2.1% to 6.3%. No
      trends were observed for physical abuse from 1996 to 1999, the only years for
      which these data were available. Across the 17 states, only Medicaid status was
      consistently associated with experiencing physical abuse during pregnancy. The
      prevalence of breast-feeding initiation ranged from 48% to 89%. Ten of 12 states 
      with trend data reported increases in the prevalence of breast-feeding
      initiation. Overall, women aged <20 years, women with less than or equal to a
      high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were less likely to
      breast-feed. The prevalence of breast-feeding duration for at least 4 weeks
      ranged from 34.9% to 78.1%. From 1993 to 1999, increases in levels of
      breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks were observed in eight states. Women aged <25
      years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and
      women receiving Medicaid were generally less likely to breast-feed for at least 4
      weeks. The prevalence of back sleep position for infants ranged from 35.1% to
      74.6%. Increases in the use of the back sleep position were observed in all 12
      states with trend data from 1996 to 1999. Black race and having less than or
      equal to a high school education were consistently associated with not using the 
      back sleep position. INTERPRETATION: For surveillance during 1993-1999, the
      majority or all states observed increases in breast-feeding initiation,
      breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks, and back sleep position. Approximately one
      half of the states observed decreases for late or no entry into prenatal care and
      smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Little or no progress was observed
      in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy or physical abuse during pregnancy.
      With few exceptions, the 17 states failed to meet the Healthy People 2000
      objectives for the seven reported behaviors in 1999. Certain de

TI  - The identification and treatment of depression by general practitioners.
PG  - 827-32
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of recognition and knowledge about treatment of
      depression by General Practitioners (GPs). METHOD: Analysis of questionnaires
      completed by participants commencing a series of workshops aimed at improving
      their knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of depression. Of the 3289 GPs
      involved in the program 2500 (76% respondent rate) completed the questionnaires
      in a group situation. There was no difference between respondents and
      nonrespondents in terms of age, gender and year of graduation. RESULTS: The
      majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition
      and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis
      predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge
      and skills in counselling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in
      dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms
      used to identify 'depression' were sleep disorders and only 54% listed depressed 
      mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient
      symptoms to meet criteria for DSM-IV major depressive disorder, which supports
      views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. Fifty-seven
      percent of doctors used medicine together with nonpharmacological treatment in
      the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range 
      recommended in the product information. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to improve
      GPs knowledge in diagnosing depression, in child psychiatry and in dealing with
      pregnant and suicidal patients.

PG  - 35-47
AB  - Fifty-two pregnant women recruited during their second trimester were given EEGs 
      and divided into greater relative right and left frontal EEG activation groups.
      The greater relative right frontal EEG women had lower dopamine levels during
      their second trimester and lower dopamine and higher cortisol levels during the
      neonatal period. The newborns of the right frontal EEG mothers also showed
      greater relative right frontal EEG, had lower dopamine and serotonin levels,
      spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had inferior Brazelton scores. A
      discriminant function analysis based on the mothers' prenatal depression scores
      and biochemical measures correctly classified 74% of the women as greater
      relative right or left frontal EEG group members.

TI  - Depression of hypoxic arousal response in adolescent mice following antenatal
      vasoactive intestinal polypeptide blockade.
PG  - 691-9
AB  - Late-gestation blockade of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) activity in
      pregnant mice produces discrete morphological abnormalities in the somatosensory 
      cortex of offspring. We investigated the functional implications of this lesion
      on the behavioural arousal response to moderate hypoxia. Pregnant mice received
      twice-daily injections of 200 microl saline (control), or saline + 50 microg VIP 
      antagonist (anti-VIP) on embryonic days 17 and 18. Offspring were studied
      unrestrained at 6-7 weeks after birth, in a bias-flow whole-body plethysmograph
      during behavioural quiet sleep. Arousal was defined by movement (MVT) lasting >
      or =1 s. Hypoxic ventilatory (HVR) and arousal responses were measured during a 5
      min exposure to 10 % O(2)-3 % CO(2) (hypoxia); peripheral chemoreflex drive was
      estimated by transient hyperoxia administered at rest and end-hypoxia
      (Dejours-type test). MVTs increased in all mice during hypoxia, but in anti-VIP
      mice: (a) MVT onset was delayed (174 +/- 90 vs. 108 +/- 59 s from the start of
      hypoxia, anti-VIP vs. control; P = 0.008); and (b) MVTs were less frequent, and
      total MVT time in hypoxia was less (8 +/- 7 vs. 15 +/- 9 %; P = 0.03). The HVR,
      and peripheral drive at rest and end-hypoxia were comparable in control and
      anti-VIP mice. In conclusion, a significant arousal deficit was evident in
      anti-VIP mice. This was not associated with obviously deranged peripheral or
      brainstem-mediated responses to hypoxia during sleep. This may signal a general
      deficit in the way hypoxic distress is monitored and processed, and arousal
      initiated and sustained in these mice.

TI  - Melatonin deficiencies in women.
PG  - S85-104
AB  - The pineal hormone melatonin is the mediator of external light to physiologic
      adaptation to day and night rhythms, it regulates reproduction in animals but
      attempts to utilize melatonin in women for contraception have failed. Melatonin
      seems to be the natural hormone to facilitate sleep in insomniac patients and
      causes no hang over. When applied together with benzodiazepine it allows
      reduction of benzodiazepine without withdrawal effects. It should be applied 2 h 
      before sleeping time in doses between 3 and 5 mg. Melatonin acts via the
      gamma-aminobutyric acid- and benzodiazepine receptor explaining its success in
      treatment of seizures in children and in adults. Constant application of
      benzodiazepine reduced the production of natural melatonin in rats, supporting
      the evidence that long-term application of benzodiazepine in humans does not
      restore sleeping habits but reduces natural sleeping habits even more. Low
      melatonin levels were seen in bulimia or neuralgia and in women with
      fibromyalgia; replacement reduced pain, sleeping disorders, and depression in
      fibromyalgia and bulimia. Melatonin profiles are a diagnostic tool to distinguish
      between several forms of depression, like major depression, winter depression
      (SAD), unipolar depression, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). In patients with
      a major depression success with antidepressants correlated with an increase in
      their melatonin profiles but only patients suffering from DSPS can be
      successfully treated with melatonin. In perimenopausal women melatonin
      administration did produce a change in LH, FSH and thyroid hormones. Some
      oncostatic properties are supported by cell culture work and studies in animals. 
      In Nordic countries indigenous people suffer less from breast and prostate
      cancer, winter darkness seems to protect. The supposedly increased melatonin
      levels created the 'melatonin hypothesis'. Epidemiological studies did show that 
      blind people indeed have half the rate of breast cancers, supporting the
      hypothesis. Controversial results concerning melatonin and insulin resistance and
      glucose tolerance have been published. In postmenopausal women application of
      melatonin reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Pregnant women
      should avoid melatonin, since its teratogenic effect is not known. Patients
      suffering from non-hormone dependent tumors, like leukemia, should avoid melanin,
      since tumor growth was promoted in animal experiments. It can be expected that
      melatonin will receive wide consideration for treatment of sleeping disturbances,
      jet lag, and fibromyalgia once an oral formulation becomes available in Europe.

TI  - Locus of control in relation to smoking cessation during pregnancy.
PG  - 30-5
AB  - AIMS: This study was carried out to investigate how the locus of control (LOC)
      varies between those who stop smoking in connection with pregnancy and those who 
      do not. The LOC reflects the extent to which a person is in control of her or his
      life events. METHODS: One hundred and two women who were regular smokers at the
      time of conception and paid their first visits to the antenatal clinic (ANC) on
      account of the current pregnancy participated. The study was quantitative and
      questionnaire based, covering background factors, smoking habits, and the LOC.
      One hundred of the women were met a second time after the delivery. Smoking
      habits were monitored by the content of carbon monoxide in expired air. The LOC
      was recorded on a VAS scale (0-10). A lower index was consistent with a more
      internal LOC and a higher with a more external LOC. RESULTS: The median LOC found
      was 4.0 (range 1.1-7.9). The LOC was not correlated to the CO in expired air.
      Younger age was linked to a more internal LOC, while worse sleep was correlated
      to a more external LOC (p<0.05). No differences were found between those who
      stopped smoking and those who did not. This was the case in both light and heavy 
      smokers. CONCLUSION: The LOC does not seem to influence the ability to stop
      smoking during pregnancy.

TI  - Infant sleep placement after the back to sleep campaign.
PG  - 608-14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Back to Sleep campaign has been credited with recent declines in 
      the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome. Using survey data for the
      1996-1998 birth cohorts, this epidemiologic study examines infant sleep position 
      in a large, population-based sample. DATA AND METHODS: Data concerning infant
      sleep position are drawn from the 1996-1998 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring 
      System for 15 states. Weighted multiple logistic regression analysis is used to
      examine correlates of infant sleep position. RESULTS: The prevalence of prone
      infant sleeping significantly declined between 1996 and 1998 (adjusted odds ratio
      [AOR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.63, 0.78]). African Americans
      were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone, (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI =
      1.33,1.59), and were less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.48,
      0.57). Hispanic/Latinos were less likely overall than non-Hispanic whites to
      sleep prone (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.95), but were also less likely to sleep
      supine (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.87). Adherence to sleep position recommended
      by the American Academy of Pediatrics increased sharply among Hispanic/Latino
      infants. Very low birth weight infants and infants in larger families were less
      likely to sleep in the recommended supine position. Infants born between 1001 and
      1500 g (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.79), and extremely low birth weight infants 
      between 500 and 1000 g (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.72) were especially unlikely
      to sleep supine. Infants in households with more than 3 other children (AOR =
      1.72; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.74) were more likely to sleep prone. CONCLUSIONS: The
      prevalence of supine infant sleep increased between 1996 and 1998. Low adherence 
      to sleep position recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics among
      African Americans, very low birth weight infants, and infants in large families
      remain public health concerns.

TI  - Adverse effects of the antimalaria drug, mefloquine: due to primary liver damage 
      with secondary thyroid involvement?
PG  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mefloquine is a clinically important antimalaria drug, which is often
      not well tolerated. We critically reviewed 516 published case reports of
      mefloquine adverse effects, to clarify the phenomenology of the harms associated 
      with mefloquine, and to make recommendations for safer prescribing. PRESENTATION:
      We postulate that many of the adverse effects of mefloquine are a post-hepatic
      syndrome caused by primary liver damage. In some users we believe that
      symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs, either independently or as a secondary
      consequence of the hepatocellular injury. The mefloquine syndrome presents in a
      variety of ways including headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness,
      fatigue, disorders of sleep, mood, memory and concentration, and occasionally
      frank psychosis. Previous liver or thyroid disease, and concurrent insults to the
      liver (such as from alcohol, dehydration, an oral contraceptive pill,
      recreational drugs, and other liver-damaging drugs) may be related to the
      development of severe or prolonged adverse reactions to mefloquine. IMPLICATIONS:
      We believe that people with active liver or thyroid disease should not take
      mefloquine, whereas those with fully resolved neuropsychiatric illness may do so 
      safely. Mefloquine users should avoid alcohol, recreational drugs, hormonal
      contraception and co-medications known to cause liver damage or thyroid damage.
      With these caveats, we believe that mefloquine may be safely prescribed in
      pregnancy, and also to occupational groups who carry out safety-critical tasks.
      TESTING: Mefloquine's adverse effects need to be investigated through a
      multicentre cohort study, with small controlled studies testing specific elements
      of the hypothesis.

TI  - Sexual behavior in lesbian and heterosexual women: relations with menstrual cycle
      phase and partner availability.
PG  - 489-503
AB  - Using a prospective design over three complete menstrual cycles, 147 heterosexual
      and 89 lesbian women made daily recordings of their basal body temperature (BBT),
      cervical mucus status, menses, and completed a daily checklist of various sexual 
      behaviors (including sexual self-stimulation and sexual activity with a partner).
      They also gave their age, height, weight, age at menarche, number of pregnancies,
      duration of sleep, tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol use, and whether they had a
      live-in sexual partner. Using BBT, cervical mucus status, and menses information,
      cycle days were grouped into five discrete phases: menses, follicular, ovulatory,
      early luteal, and premenstrual. Daily frequencies of sexual behavior with a
      partner and autosexual behavior were computed for each phase. Mixed ANOVAs on the
      resultant proportional data revealed similar patterns for autosexual behavior
      across the phases for both heterosexuals and lesbians who did not have a live-in 
      partner, in which autosexual behavior was highest during the follicular and
      ovulatory phases. For those with live-in partners, autosexual behavior did not
      vary across the phases. Lesbians engaged in more autosexual behavior overall.
      Allosexual behavior peaked during the follicular phase for both heterosexuals and
      lesbians, and the phasic pattern was unrelated to live-in partner status.
      Additional analyses suggest that the observed patterns were unrelated to
      anticipated changes in sexual activity due to menses. Results are discussed in
      terms of social variables and hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual
      cycle.

TI  - Perinatal neuroendocrine regulation. Development of the circadian time-keeping
      system.
PG  - 169-73
AB  - During gestation, the perinatal neuroendocrine axis keeps clock time. In
      primates, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (biological clock in mammals), shows
      oscillatory function by midgestation. There is evidence in rodents that the
      mother, during pregnancy, entrains the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and
      newborn circadian rhythms. We are investigating the role of maternal melatonin as
      an entraining signal for the newborn circadian time-keeping system in the Cebus
      apella (New World non-human primate). Twenty-four hour rhythms of temperature and
      cortisol are present in the 4 days old C. apella newborn. Preliminary data
      suggests that inhibition of maternal melatonin by exposing pregnant females to
      constant light alters these rhythms. We have found binding sites for melatonin
      and expression of mRNA for Mel 1A receptor in hypothalamus, kidney and testis.
      These preliminary results suggest that maternal melatonin may play a role in
      relating the perinatal circadian time-keeping system to environmental signals.

TI  - Parasomnias decline during pregnancy.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A survey of the effects of pregnancy on parasomnias. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: In an area of a central hospital and the maternity care units in the
      nearby rural community, women were interviewed during and after their pregnancy
      with a series of five questionnaires to assess the frequency of their
      parasomnias. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming
      pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last one the 3
      months after delivery. Altogether 325 mothers filled all the five questionnaires 
      and constitute the study group. RESULTS: The total number of parasomnias declined
      (P < 0.001) during pregnancy and even more among the primiparas than among the
      multiparas (difference until third trimester, P=0.02). Among various parasomnias 
      reported, sleep talking and sleepwalking decreased from the prepregnant period to
      the second trimester (22.8 vs 12.6%, change P=0.003), and the reported sleep
      starts also diminished from the prepregnant time to the first trimester (78.5 vs 
      63.1%, P < 0.001), but these phenomena did not change further during the
      follow-up. Altogether 55.7% of the women reported having nightmares 3 months
      before the pregnancy, and 47.7, 49.5, 41.2 and 40.3% (change from the prepregnant
      period, P < 0.001), respectively, at first, second and third trimester and after 
      the delivery. Reported hypnagogic hallucinations decreased from the prepregnant
      time to the first trimester (9.8 vs 6.5%, P=0.027), but returned thereafter to
      the previous level. During the prepregnant period, 25.8% of the women reported
      bruxism and only 19.9% during the first trimester (P=0.009). Though the
      prevalence of sleep paralysis decreased during the first trimester of pregnancy, 
      it was the only parasomnia that increased during later pregnancy (from 5.7 to
      13.3% in the second trimester, P < 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The reported frequency of
      most parasomnias decreases during pregnancy and even more in primiparas than
      multiparas.

TI  - Maternal awareness of sudden infant death syndrome in North Queensland,
      Australia: an analysis of infant care practices.
PG  - 441-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess awareness of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and risk
      reducing recommendations in a sample of mothers in North Queensland, Australia,
      and to examine their infant care practices. METHOD: Interviews conducted with 195
      women using a standardized questionnaire between October 1997 and January 1998.
      RESULTS: 191 questionnaires analyzed; 134 (70.2%) Caucasian and 57 (29.8%)
      indigenous women. Four women with previous SIDS experience were excluded from the
      analysis. Eight (4.2%) had never heard of SIDS. Twenty-nine (15.2%) had heard of 
      SIDS and 154 (80.6%) had heard of SIDS and could list risk recommendations to
      reduce its incidence. Multivariate analysis identified ethnicity as the only
      significant predictor of maternal knowledge. Indigenous mothers knew less about
      SIDS: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 5.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [2.1-14.0]. 
      Avoidance of prone sleeping was the most frequently identified recommendation (n 
      = 132), with no smoking in pregnancy (n = 48) and breastfeeding (n = 40)
      identified least frequently. There were 80.2% of mothers who put their infant in 
      non-prone positions to sleep. Only 48 (25%) women identified smoking in
      pregnancy, and 93 (48.6%) smoking in the infant's environment as risk factors.
      Indigenous women were more likely to smoke in their pregnancy (P = 0.004), bed
      share with their infant (P = 0.0001), and have smokers in the home. CONCLUSION:
      There is a high level of awareness of SIDS and the main associated risk factor of
      infant prone sleeping, but the link between SIDS and smoking requires further
      emphasis. Future campaigns should ensure the SIDS message is delivered more
      effectively to the indigenous communities.

TI  - [Nocturnal fall of blood pressure in the first half of pregnancy].
PG  - 1582-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Arterial blood pressure (BP) shows circadian variation. The most
      important feature of the circadian variation of BP is it fall during sleep.
      Nocturnal fall of BP achieves at least 10% ("dip"). Very scanty literature is
      available on the diurnal BP pattern in healthy gravidae with uncomplicated
      pregnancy. DESIGN: The aim of the study was to evaluate of the
      day-time/night-time mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) fall in pregnant woman in 
      the first half of pregnancy in comparison with healthy non-pregnant women.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty seven healthy woman were included into the study,
      and divided into two groups: 23 pregnant woman in 7-20 weeks of first gestation
      and 34 non-pregnant woman. All the subjects were included into the 24-hours
      non-invasive automated blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
      Nocturnal fall of BP appeared to be the most pronounced element of the circadian 
      BP pattern in the studied women. Women in the first half of pregnancy exhibit
      reduction of BP in the night-time similar to that observed in the non-pregnant
      subjects. In average, 2/3 of pregnant women below 20 weeks of gestation belong to
      "dippers" in the MAP range. Women with higher mean diurnal BP value have less
      pronounced nocturnal BP "dip".

TI  - Urinary cortisol as an additional tool to assess the welfare of pregnant sows
      kept in two types of housing.
PG  - 13-22
AB  - The use of urinary cortisol (UC) as an additional tool to evaluate sows welfare
      was assessed in two experiments. In a preliminary methodological experiment, the 
      kinetics of cortisol excretion in urine was studied during an Adreno Cortico
      Trophic Hormone (ACTH) challenge test in 10 pregnant sows. In a second
      experiment, 96 primiparous sows of an experimental unit were assigned to two
      different housing systems: 48 animals were housed in individual pens (IP) and 48 
      animals in collective pens (CP) with 6 animals per pen. UC was measured at the
      beginning and at the end of pregnancy and compared with other welfare indicators 
      such as behaviour or skin damage. In both experiments, UC was measured using a
      high pressure liquid chromatography assay. In experiment 1, UC was constant on
      the day before injection of ACTH, with no variations related to circadian rhythm.
      It began to rise 2 h after the injection, peaked between 2 to 5 h after then
      returned to the basal concentration on the day after the injection. In experiment
      2, UC concentrations were not different between CP- and IP-housed sows but they
      were higher in sows exhibiting the less stereotypies in comparison with sows
      exhibiting the most stereotypies. The results of this study suggest that UC is a 
      good indicator of acute stress, more convenient than plasma cortisol measurement 
      since it is a non-invasive method avoiding restraint or catheterisation of sows. 
      They also suggest that UC could also give additional information on the
      assessment of chronic stress and improve the evaluation of animal welfare if used
      in conjunction with other welfare indicators.

TI  - Interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy.
PG  - CD001139
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than a third of women experience back pain during pregnancy. The
      pain can interfere with work, daily activities and sleep. OBJECTIVES: The
      objective of the review was to assess the effects of preventive interventions and
      treatments for pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched
      the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (October 2001) and
      the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2001).
      SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of any treatment to reduce the incidence or
      severity of pelvic/back pain in pregnancy, or to prevent pelvic/back pain arising
      in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data
      were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials are
      included in this review involving 376 women. One randomized trial compared water 
      gymnastics from 20 weeks with no treatment. The authors report less pain in the
      treatment group but the data are hard to interpret; there was a difference in
      rates of absence from work after 32 weeks of pregnancy (odds ratio 0.38, 95%
      confidence intervals 0.16-0.88). In another trial, acupuncture was rated as
      giving 'good' or 'excellent' help more frequently than physiotherapy (odds ratio 
      6.58, 95% confidence intervals 1.0-43.16) but this may reflect the benefit of
      individual compared with group therapy. One trial of 109 women compared the use
      of a special shaped pillow to fit under the woman's abdomen (Ozzlo pillow) with a
      standard pillow. Fewer women rated the Ozzlo pillow of 'little help' compared
      with the standard pillow (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.58).
      REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Water gymnastics appear to reduce back pain in pregnancy.
      More women are able to continue at work. Specially shaped pillows help reduce
      back pain in late pregnancy and improve sleep. It is a pity that the Ozzlo pillow
      seems no longer to be available. Both physiotherapy and acupuncture may reduce
      back and pelvic pain. Individual acupuncture sessions were rated as more help
      than group physiotherapy sessions.

TI  - Sleep deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation during opiate withdrawal in 
      newborns.
PG  - 66-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine specific sleep characteristics in neonatal opiate
      withdrawal, referred to as the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), by measuring
      sleep efficiency, deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation in three groups:
      (i) healthy term neonates; (ii) opiate-exposed neonates who were treated for
      opiate withdrawal; and (iii) a group of opiate-exposed neonates who did not
      require treatment. METHODS: A cohort study recording sleep patterns of neonates
      at 2-10 days of age (after 36 or more weeks of gestation) was carried out.
      Twenty-one neonates were exposed to opiates during pregnancy and 15 neonates were
      healthy controls. Sleep characteristics were predefined, and treated newborns
      were divided into early and stabilized treatment groups. Polygraphic recordings
      of sleep, movement and breathing were made continuously after a daytime feed.
      RESULTS: Sleep deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation were found in
      newborns with NAS and were associated with the severity of the withdrawal.
      Neonates treated for NAS displayed increased wakefulness during early treatment
      (deprivation), but were similar to controls once stabilized. Both treated and
      non-treated groups had reduced amounts of quiet sleep (deprivation). Treated
      newborns showed an increase in indeterminate sleep (disorganization) and
      arousals-to-wakefulness (fragmentation). CONCLUSION: This study determined the
      exact nature and degree of sleep disturbances in newborns during acute opiate
      withdrawal. The findings contribute to a further understanding of the physiology 
      underlying neonatal opiate withdrawal and suggest that some changes in sleep are 
      due to opiate withdrawal but others may reflect opiate dependency in utero.

TI  - Prenatal and intrapartum events and sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - 82-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific pregnancy and labour and
      delivery events that may increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome
      (SIDS). A matched case-control study was conducted in five counties in southern
      California, using California death certificate records. The sample consisted of
      239 Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic and Asian mothers of SIDS infants and
      239 mothers of control infants matched on sex, race, birth hospital and date of
      birth. Mothers participated in a detailed telephone interview and provided access
      to obstetric and paediatric records. More case than control mothers reported a
      family history of anaemia (OR=2.12, P < 0.001). Placental abruptions were
      strongly associated with SIDS (unadjusted OR=7.94, [95% CI 1.34,47.12]). There
      was an increased risk of SIDS death associated with maternal anaemia during
      pregnancy (OR=2.51, [95% CI 1.25,5.03]), while simultaneously adjusting for
      maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal years of education and age, parity,
      infant birthweight, gestational age, medical conditions at birth, infant sleep
      position and post-natal smoking. Interactions of anaemia and prenatal smoking as 
      well as anaemia and post-natal smoking were not statistically significant. There 
      were no other statistically significant differences between case and control
      mothers for pregnancy conditions, labour and delivery events (e.g. caesarean
      sections, anaesthesia, forceps) or newborn complications (e.g. nuchal cord,
      meconium aspiration). Anaemia and placental abruptions were significantly
      associated with an increased risk of SIDS; both are circumstances in which a
      fetus may become hypoxic, thereby compromising the subsequent growth, development
      and ultimate survival of the infant.

TI  - Rapid-eye-movement sleep in jittery infants.
PG  - 25-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of neonatal jitteriness (JT) remains unknown.
      Neonatal JT could be one of the symptoms associated with drug withdrawal syndrome
      due to maternal medication. To study the influence of chemicals and environment
      on brain development in the fetal period, Swaab and Mirmiran proposed "behavioral
      teratology". JT could be one of the targets for this concept. Swaab and Mirmiran 
      postulated that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM sleep) is useful for studying
      behavioral teratology. AIM: We aimed to determine the neurophysiological
      alterations in infants with JT by investigating REM sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Sleep
      records were obtained three times for each of six jittery infants. The mothers of
      three infants had been on medication (either alpha-methyl dopa, reserpine or
      haloperidol) during pregnancy, whereas the mothers of the other three infants
      took no medication during pregnancy. REM sleep parameters (the amount of REM
      sleep against the total sleep time, newly designated indices-tonic inhibition
      index (TII) and phasic inhibition index--, and the incidences of gross movements,
      phasic chin muscle activity (PCMA), and bursts of rapid eye movements) in the six
      jittery infants were compared with those in age-matched controls. RESULTS:
      Regardless of maternal medication, TIIs, which represent the shortening of PCMA
      during REM sleep, were higher in the jittery infants than in the controls. No
      other REM sleep parameters showed constant differences between the patients and
      controls. CONCLUSION: Release of the blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the
      fetal brain is considered to be critical for the occurrence of neonatal JT with
      elevation of TII. Since the abnormal elevation of TII continued after 6 months of
      age when our patients did not show JT anymore, we have to keep monitoring jittery
      infants from the standpoint of "behavioral teratology".

TI  - Alcohol's effect on lactation.
PG  - 230-4
AB  - Although pregnant women are discouraged from drinking alcohol because of
      alcohol's detrimental effect on fetal development, the lore of many cultures
      encourages lactating women to drink alcohol to optimize breast milk production
      and infant nutrition. In contrast to this folklore, however, studies demonstrate 
      that maternal alcohol consumption may slightly reduce milk production.
      Furthermore, some of the alcohol consumed by a lactating woman is transferred to 
      her milk and thus consumed by the infant. This alcohol consumption may adversely 
      affect the infant's sleep and gross motor development and influence early
      learning about alcohol. Based on this science, it would seem that the
      recommendation for a nursing mother to drink a glass of beer or wine shortly
      before nursing may actually be counterproductive.

TI  - Dominant maternal sleep position influences site of placental implantation.
PG  - 67-9
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if maternal sleeping position around
      the time of implantation influences eventual placental implantation site. Between
      November 1997 and April 1999, women with singleton pregnancies between
      gestational ages of 15 and 20 weeks presenting for ultrasound examinations were
      prospectively queried regarding their usual position of sleep during early
      gestation. Dominant position of sleep was noted as prone, supine, right side, or 
      left side. At ultrasound examination, placental location was categorized as (1)
      fundal, (2) left high, (3) right high, (4) anterior high, (5) posterior high, (6)
      anterior low, (7) posterior low, (8) right low, (9) left low, or (10) central
      low. During the 18 months of this study, data were obtained from 1,500 patients. 
      At the time of conception, front or prone sleeping was the most common (497 of
      1,500, 33.1%), followed by right side (439 of 1,500, 29.3%) and left side (360 of
      1,500, 24%), with the back being the least frequent position of sleep (204 of
      1,500, 13.6%). Women who usually slept supine at the time of conception and
      implantation were significantly more likely to have a high or fundal placental
      location compared with those who usually slept in the prone position (p = 0.041).
      In addition, women who slept exclusively on their right side early in pregnancy
      were significantly more likely to have a right-sided placental location compared 
      with women who slept exclusively on their left side (p = 0.025). The data from
      this investigation indicate that sleeping position early in gestation may
      influence the ultimate placental implantation site.

TI  - Genetic factors involved in the effects of developmental low-level alcohol
      induced behavioral alterations in rats.
PG  - 191-203
AB  - Behavioral and neurochemical effects of perinatal alcohol exposure (3% v/v
      solution from Day 15 of gestation to Day 7 after parturition) have been
      investigated in Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and alcohol-nonpreferring (sNP)
      rat lines, selectively bred for opposite alcohol preference and consumption. In
      an elevated zero-maze model of anxiety, sucrose-exposed sP rats (sP-S): (i) spent
      significantly less time on the open arms (TO); (ii) exhibited a significantly
      lower number of head dips (HDIPS); and (iii) showed a higher number of stretched 
      attend-postures (SAP) than sucrose-exposed sNP rats (sNP-S) at 90 and 180 days of
      age. The two rat lines displayed different emotional reactivity in response to
      alcohol exposure. Subtle differences in sexual behavior and ultrasonic emission
      (latency to the first intromission and to the first 50 kHz call) were observed
      between sP-S and sNP-S rats. sP-alcohol exposed (sP-A) offspring exhibited a
      higher latency to the first intromission than sNP-alcohol (sNP-A) treated rats.
      Moreover, a lower number of sP-A rats exhibited both intromission and ejaculation
      with respect to sNP-A animals. sP-S rats were significantly slower in recover of 
      the righting reflex than sNP-S animals after a challenge dose of alcohol (3 g/kg,
      i.p.). Perinatal alcohol did not affect either onset or duration of sleep time in
      either line. Neurochemical experiments have shown that perinatal alcohol did not 
      influence basal dopamine levels or amphetamine-induced dopamine increase in the
      prefrontal cortex of either sP or sNP offspring. These results, showing an
      endpoint-specific differential sensitivity of sP and sNP lines to perinatal low
      alcohol exposure, indicate that genetic factors could be responsible for
      selective susceptibility to behavioral alterations induced by developmental
      treatment with this drug of abuse.

TI  - The development of circadian rhythms in the fetus and neonate.
PG  - 363-70
AB  - The circadian time-keeping system is the neural system that allows predictive
      adaptation of individuals to the reproducible 24-hour day/night alternations of
      our planet. A biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, receives
      environmental information and imposes a circadian pattern to physiological
      functions. Since the suprachiasmatic nucleus develops early in gestation and
      circadian rhythms are present in the fetus and newborn, the circadian system
      seems to be functional in fetal life and can receive circadian inputs through the
      mother. The neonate moves to an environment in which the main time giving signal 
      is the light:dark cycle. Teleologically, a term newborn should be fit to face
      this challenge. But this may be quite different for a preterm infant that trades 
      the circadian environment to which it was previously exposed for the timeless
      environment of the Neonatal Intensive Care Nursery. Scientists and physicians
      should seek new experimental and clinical approaches to answer the challenging
      questions of perinatal chronomedicine.

TI  - The effects of fetal breathing movements on the utero-fetal-placental
      circulation.
PG  - 51-2
AB  - Important factors which may affect the fetal circulation are the fetal breathing 
      movements (FBMs) and other movements adn the features of fetal circulation.
      Recent studies have demonstrated that FBMs are a normal phenomenon of
      intrauterine development and that there are two patterns of FBMs: (1) A
      predominant pattern of rapid, irregular (in rate and amplitude) episodic
      movements, with interspersed episodes of apnea that is present more than 50
      percent of the time and accounts for more than 90 percent of the breathing
      activity. Interestingly, periodic sighs are often seen during these FBMs; (2)
      There is also a less frequent pattern of sporadic, slow (1 to 4 movements/min),
      deep inspiratory movements, like sighs or gasps, or espiratory efforts which
      resemble grunting, coughing, or panting. The first pattern, which represents
      normal fetal respiratory activity, only occurs during rapid eye movements (REM)
      sleep, and it is unrelated to changes in blood gases and pH values and to
      afferent impulses from aortic and carotid bodies; FBMs may produce intrathoracic 
      pressure swings of 35 Torr or more and are independent of Hering-Breuer reflexes.
      This pattern is usually accompanied by increased FHR beat-to-beat variability and
      increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and flow (BF). Therefore, they
      may influence the velocimetry of B.F. in humans, e.g., RED and ARED in the
      umbilical artery blood flow (UABF), which do not necessarily indicate impending
      fetal demise. The second pattern is unrelated to the fetal behavioral state and
      blood gas tensions. Concerning the effects of drugs on FBMs, we have analysed the
      effects aminophylline (A)(bolus of 240 mg followed by 0.2 mg/kg/min) given to
      women not in labor; A caused a prompt and sustained FBMs that started as vorteces
      and then as regular inspiratory and expiratory movements, which increased in
      frequency (up to 88/min) and depth. Hexoprenaline given to pregnant women with
      threatened preterm labor were able to elicit FBMs and NFFV; the infusion of 0.3
      microg/min increased UABF. Conjugated estrogens administered to the mother as a
      10 mg bolus enhanced FBMs, as documented by TM and nasal flow velocity waveforms 
      (NFFV); this was associated with an increased UABF; betamethasone (4 mg bolus to 
      the mother) was shown to induce FBMs and an increased UABF. In a twin pregnancy
      betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) was administered IV into the umbilical vein in one
      fetus and IM to the other; in both cases bradycardia and increase in UABF
      occurred, immediately after IV infusion, and after 30 min following IM injection 
      FBMs were induced or enhanced in frequency and depth. The flow in MCA was
      unchanged. In conclusion, the fetal circulation is influenced by fetal
      behavioural states, particularly by FBMs that affect the fetal cardiovascular
      function, including blood pressure and FHR thereby conditioning the velocimetric 
      response of its major vessels, i.e., UA and MCA BF, whose alterations do not
      necessarily reflect impending fetal demise.

TI  - Neuroactive steroids: molecular mechanisms of action and implications for
      neuropsychopharmacology.
PG  - 59-67
AB  - Besides their binding to cognate intracellular receptors gonadal steroids may
      also act as functional antagonists at the 5-HT3 receptor. A structure-activity
      relationship for the actions of a variety of steroids at the 5-HT3 receptor was
      elaborated that differed considerably from that known for GABA(A) receptors.
      Steroids appear to interact allosterically with ligand-gated ion channels at the 
      receptor membrane interface. The functional antagonism of gonadal steroids at the
      5-HT3 receptor may play a role for the development and course of nausea during
      pregnancy and of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we could demonstrate that
      3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids concurrently modulate the GABA(A) receptor
      and regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular
      oxidation. Animal studies showed that progesterone is converted rapidly into
      GABAergic neuroactive steroids in vivo. Progesterone reduces locomotor activity
      in a dose dependent fashion in male Wister rats. Moreover, progesterone and
      3alpha,5alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone produce a benzodiazepine-like sleep EEG
      profile in rats and humans. In addition, there is a dysequilibrium of such
      3alpha-reduced neuroactive steroids during major depression which is corrected by
      successful treatment with antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids may further be
      involved in the treatment of depression and anxiety with antidepressants in
      patients during ethanol withdrawal. First studies in patients with panic disorder
      suggest that neuroactive steroids may also play a pivotal role in human anxiety. 
      The genomic and non-genomic effects of steroids in the brain contribute to the
      pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and the mechanisms of action of
      antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids affect a broad spectrum of behavioral
      functions through their unique molecular properties and may constitute a yet
      unexploited class of drugs.

TI  - Hemodynamic responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep are
      augmented in women with preeclampsia.
PG  - 1090-5
AB  - Preeclampsia is the most common disease of pregnancy, occurring in up to 10% of
      the pregnant population. The cause of the disease is as yet undetermined;
      however, most of the clinical effects are commonly attributed to damage to the
      endothelial layer, leading to increased pressor activity of all the maternal
      blood vessels. Therefore, we suspected that if obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      coexisted with preeclampsia in pregnancy, the hemodynamic effects of the OSA
      would be markedly potentiated. To test this hypothesis, we performed full sleep
      studies and overnight beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The control
      patient group included 10 pregnant women with OSA and no evidence of hypertensive
      disease either before or during their current pregnancy. The test group included 
      10 women with preeclampsia and coexisting OSA. The pressor responses to
      obstructive respiratory events during sleep were enhanced in preeclamptic
      patients compared with control OSA patients (21+/-2/12+/-1 mm Hg and
      38+/-5/25+/-4 mm Hg above baseline in control OSA and preeclamptic OSA patients, 
      respectively, P = .005/.005). In contrast, there was no difference in heart rate 
      responses between the two groups of subjects (34+/-5 beats/min and 49+/-13
      beats/min above baseline in control and preeclamptic patient groups,
      respectively, P = .326). We suggest that the augmented pressor responses in
      preeclamptic women occur as a result of maternal endothelial damage induced by
      the preeclampsia disease process. These findings may have important implications 
      in the management of preeclamptic patients.

TI  - The influence of grandmothers and other senior caregivers on sleep position used 
      by African American infants.
PG  - 1231-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe beliefs about infant sleep position among African
      American grandmothers and other older caregivers (senior caregivers [SCGs]) and
      to measure the incremental effect on the rates of prone sleep after educating a
      group of African American SCGs. DESIGN: Survey of sleep practices and beliefs.
      Randomized, controlled trial of a teaching intervention. SETTING: Managed care
      prenatal clinic for normal risk obstetrics patients. PARTICIPANTS: Low-income
      pregnant women, self-identified as African American. An SCG is an older family
      member or friend to whom they would go for advice about routine child care.
      Pregnant women randomly assigned to the control group (educated about safe sleep 
      practices) or the experimental group (education for both pregnant women and their
      SCG). INTERVENTION: During the third trimester, 2 teaching sessions for pregnant 
      women (both control and experimental groups) and for the experimental group's
      SCGs. One-on-one teaching emphasizing that infants should sleep supine. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: During the third trimester, description of rate of preference
      for prone sleep for infants among pregnant women and SCGs. Effects of teaching
      SCGs on (1) SCGs' postnatal beliefs about sleep position as a means to reduce the
      risk of sudden infant death syndrome, and (2) the eventual rate of prone sleeping
      among study infants. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five women were in the control
      group; 98 pregnant women and SCG pairs were in the experimental group. Senior
      caregivers were 47.1 +/- 12.4 years old (mean +/- SD). Most were grandmothers
      (either maternal, 72.5%, or paternal, 14.3%) or aunts or sisters (10.2%). No
      differences were noted in the prenatal rates of the prone preference (controls,
      36.3%; experimental group, 35.7%; and SCGs, 34.7%). Teaching SCGs did not
      increase the rate of the usual prone sleep in the experimental vs the control
      group (13.3% vs 17.3%, chi(2) = 0.59, P =.44, 95% confidence interval for
      difference from -5.8% to +13.8%). After the teaching and during the pregnancy,
      the SCGs became less worried that the infant was susceptible to sudden infant
      death syndrome (chi(2) = 16.6, P =.003) or likely to die of sudden infant death
      syndrome (chi(2) = 24.7, P<.001). Their concerns about sudden infant death
      syndrome were significantly less postnatally, in particular when the infant was
      placed supine (chi(2) = 19.4, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most African American women
      and SCGs endorsed the supine sleeping position for infants. Among a group of
      African American infants, prenatal teaching of their grandmothers and other SCGs 
      did not have a statistically significant incremental effect on the rates of the
      usual prone sleeping position. Contrary to our starting hypothesis, the SCGs of
      pregnant women who receive prenatal care seemed responsive to messages about
      supine sleeping. The Back-to-Sleep message should be delivered prenatally, but
      special prenatal interventions should attempt to reach women who do not receive
      prenatal care and SCGs who persist in their opposition to the supine sleeping
      position.

TI  - Fetal behavioural state changes following maternal fluoxetine infusion in sheep.
PG  - 47-56
AB  - Clinical depression is diagnosed in 5-15% of women during pregnancy, increasing
      the risk of negative outcomes. Fluoxetine (FX), a selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor, is prescribed during pregnancy. In adults, FX alters sleep patterns
      with single doses decreasing total sleep time and rapid eye movement sleep. The
      effects of FX on sleep in the fetus are unknown. However, 5-hydroxytryptophan,
      the precursor of serotonin, has been reported to prolong high-voltage (HV)
      electrocortical (ECoG) activity and increase the incidence of fetal breathing
      movements (FBM) in the sheep fetus. We hypothesize that FX exposure will decrease
      the incidence of LV ECoG in the fetus. Twenty-one pregnant sheep were surgically 
      prepared for chronic study of blood gases, ECoG activity, eye movements and FBM. 
      After 3 days of recovery, ewes received a 70-mg bolus i.v. infusion of FX or
      sterile water followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.036 mg/min for 8
      days. The incidence of low-voltage (LV) ECoG decreased from 54+/-4% on the
      preinfusion day to 45+/-5% on infusion day 1 in the FX group and remained
      decreased throughout the infusion period. In addition, the incidence of both eye 
      movements and FBM was decreased on infusion day 1 compared to preinfusion day in 
      the FX group. HV ECoG increased from 39+/-3% on preinfusion day to 68+/-14% on FX
      infusion day 1 and remained elevated throughout the infusion period. These data
      show that maternal FX administration alters fetal behavioural state.

TI  - Inspiratory flow limitation during sleep in pre-eclampsia: comparison with normal
      pregnant and nonpregnant women.
PG  - 672-6
AB  - Self-reported snoring is common in pregnancy, particularly in females with
      pre-eclampsia. The prevalence of inspiratory flow limitation during sleep in
      preeclamptic females was objectively assessed and compared with normal pregnant
      and nonpregnant females. Fifteen females with pre-eclampsia were compared to 15
      females from each of the three trimesters of pregnancy, as well as to 15 matched 
      nonpregnant control females (total study population, 75 subjects). All subjects
      had overnight monitoring of respiration, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure
      (BP). No group had evidence of a clinically significant sleep apnoea syndrome,
      but patients with pre-eclampsia spent substantially more time (31+/-8.4% of sleep
      period time, mean+/-SD) with evidence of inspiratory flow limitation compared to 
      15.5+/-2.3% in third trimester subjects and <5% in the other three groups
      (p=0.001). In the majority of preeclamptics, the pattern of flow limitation was
      of prolonged episodes lasting several minutes without associated oxygen
      desaturation. As expected, systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly higher
      in the pre-eclamptic group (p<0.001), but all groups showed a significant fall
      (p< or =0.05) in BP during sleep. Inspiratory flow limitation is common during
      sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may have implications for the
      pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder.

TI  - Sleep-related disordered breathing during pregnancy in obese women.
PG  - 1448-54
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate sleep-related disordered
      breathing in obese women during pregnancy. Obesity is known to predispose to
      sleep-related breathing disorders. During pregnancy, obese mothers gain
      additional weight, but other mechanisms may counteract this effect. DESIGN: A
      case-control study to compare sleep-related breathing in obese pregnant women
      (mean prepregnancy body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m(2)) with pregnant women of
      normal weight (mean BMI, 20 to 25 kg/m(2)). SETTING: University teaching hospital
      with a sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 11 obese women (BMI, 34
      kg/m(2); mean age 31 years) and 11 control women (BMI, 23 kg/m(2); mean age 32
      years). INTERVENTIONS: Overnight polysomnography was performed during early
      (after 12 weeks) and late (after 30 weeks) pregnancy. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      During pregnancy, obese mothers gained 13 kg and control women gained 16 kg.
      Sleep characteristics did not differ between the groups. During late pregnancy,
      the women in both groups slept more poorly and slept in supine position less.
      During early pregnancy, their apnea-hypopnea indexes (1.7 events per hour vs 0.2 
      events per hour; p < 0.05), 4% oxygen desaturations (5.3 events per hour vs 0.3
      events per hour; p < 0.005), and snoring times (32% vs 1%, p < 0.001) differed
      significantly. These differences between the groups persisted in the second
      polysomnography, with snoring time further increasing in the obese. Preeclampsia 
      and mild obstructive sleep apnea were diagnosed in one obese mother. One obese
      mother delivered a baby showing growth retardation (weight - 3 SD). CONCLUSIONS: 
      We have shown significantly more sleep-related disordered breathing occurring in 
      obese mothers than in subjects of normal weight, despite similar sleeping
      characteristics.

TI  - The premature infant and painful procedures.
PG  - 58-65
AB  - Pain management for premature infants raises challenging questions for nurses.
      This group of infants is often physiologically fragile and they may undergo
      frequent painful procedures on a daily basis. Contrary to ideas from the past,
      premature infants are able to feel pain, and nervous system elements required for
      the transmission of painful stimuli are functional by 24 weeks gestation. Painful
      procedures are harmful to the infant's physiological stability and the ability to
      self-regulate, which includes maintenance of motor control and stable sleep/wake 
      cycles. Assessment of pain in the premature infant is complex. Major indicators
      of pain include facial grimaces and physiological parameters such as heart rate
      and oxygen saturation. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is one tool
      designed specifically for preterm infants. Nonpharmacological nursing measures
      such as swaddling or nesting and offering a pacifier are useful strategies to
      help infants cope with painful procedures. The nurse may also maintain a
      therapeutic environment to assist the infant in self-regulation. Pharmacological 
      agents such as morphine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen are effective in relieving
      procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose before and during painful procedures
      offers new possibilities for pain relief. Recent research shows that oral sucrose
      is a safe and effective analgesic for short-term procedures. Research studies to 
      determine the most effective doses and modes of oral sucrose administration are
      ongoing. It is thought that the relief of pain is owing to the sweet taste of the
      sucrose that activates endogenous pain-modulating systems.

TI  - Alterations induced by gestational stress in brain morphology and behaviour of
      the offspring.
PG  - 427-51
AB  - Retrospective studies in humans suggest that chronic maternal stress during
      pregnancy, associated with raised plasma levels of CRH, ACTH and cortisol may
      increase the likelihood of preterm birth, developmental delays and behavioural
      abnormalities in the children. In adulthood, it may contribute to the significant
      association between the incidence of schizophrenia, increased left or mixed
      handedness, reduction in cerebral asymmetry and anomalies in brain morphology.
      Our studies and others have shown that prenatal stress in rats can mimic these
      developmental and behavioural alterations. These rats show a reduced propensity
      for social interaction, increased anxiety in intimidating or novel situations and
      a reduction in cerebral asymmetry and dopamine turnover, consistent with those in
      schizophrenic humans. Prenatally-stressed (PS) rats also show behaviour
      consistent with depression, including a phase-shift in their circadian rhythm for
      corticosterone, sleep abnormalities, a hedonic deficit and greater acquisition of
      learned helplessness under appropriate conditions. These behavioural
      abnormalities are associated with impaired regulation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and increased CRH
      activity. PS males may show demasculinisation and feminisation of their sexual
      behaviour. The developmental and behavioural abnormalities in PS offspring could 
      occur through sensitisation of the foetal brain by maternal stress hormones to
      the action of glucocorticoid and CRH and to neurotransmitters affected by them.
      This may have long-lasting consequences and could explain the precipitation of
      depressive symptoms or schizophrenia by psychosocial stress in later life. The
      character of the behavioural abnormalities probably depends on the timing of the 
      maternal stress in relation to development of the particular neuronal systems.

TI  - Chronobiological basis of female-specific mood disorders.
PG  - S102-8
AB  - Women have twice the incidence of major depression compared with men. They are
      prone to develop episodes of depression during times of reproductive hormonal
      change at puberty, with use of oral contraceptives, during the premenstrual phase
      of the menstrual cycle, postpartum and during the perimenopause (see review: ).
      describes the variety of disturbances in biological rhythms observed in mood
      disorders. In this report, we describe the chronobiological disturbances observed
      in female-specific mood disorders, namely, premenstrual dysphoric disorder,
      pregnancy and postpartum depression and menopause. We hypothesize that changing
      reproductive hormones, by affecting the synchrony or coherence between components
      of the circadian system, may alter amplitude or phase (timing) relationships and 
      thereby contribute to the development of mood disorders in predisposed
      individuals.

TI  - Inconsistency in the expression of locomotor and ERG circadian rhythms in the
      German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.).
PG  - 155-66
AB  - ERG recordings from German cockroaches showed that the amplitude of light-evoked 
      responses have a circadian rhythmicity in adult males that coincided with the
      locomotor circadian rhythm. The peak of the response occurred during the
      subjective night, and the circadian period was less than 24 h under DD condition.
      In contrast, although the locomotor circadian rhythm was masked by the
      development of ovaries and pregnancy in females, their visual responses displayed
      circadian rhythmicity. This inconsistency in expression of locomotor and visual
      sensitivity circadian rhythms in females implied separate pacemakers for these
      two overt rhythms. After severing the optic nerves, changes in ERG amplitude of
      the operated cockroaches still displayed a circadian rhythm under DD condition,
      demonstrating that the visual sensitive pacemaker was located in the eye and
      independent from the locomotor pacemaker.

TI  - Circadian temperature rhythms in rabbit pups and in their does.
PG  - 364-73
AB  - Circadian rhythms of mammals are generated endogenously, the master oscillator
      system residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Previous experiments have
      indicated that the rabbit has a feeding entrainable circadian oscillator (FEO)
      which is supposed to be of greatest importance during the early infancy of the
      rabbit. Here we report the course of telemetrically monitored core body
      temperature of rabbit pups and of their does. Temperature increased from
      37.6+/-0.3 degrees C on day 2 to 39.5+/-0.1 degrees C on day 28 of life. The pups
      showed a 24 h temperature rhythm even during their first days of life.
      Temperature increased 2 1/2-3 h prior to nursing for 0.4-0.8 degrees C and rose
      for an additional 0.4-0.6 degrees C immediately after milk ingestion. The
      anticipatory, but not the postprandial component persisted when nursing was
      skipped twice. The persistence of a rhythm in the absence of any entraining agent
      is crucial for its endogenous generation. In the doe, the core body temperature
      gradually decreased during the last 2/3 of pregnancy. During parturition it
      steeply rose for 1.5-1.7 degrees C and attained a plateau of 39.7+/-0.2 degrees C
      during lactation. The circadian rhythm persisted during the whole course of
      pregnancy and lactation. Thus, in the rabbit an endogenous, feeding entrainable
      circadian oscillator appears to operate from the first days of life. It is of
      functional significance in that it alerts the pup in time so that it is able to
      utilize the singular short presence of the doe for maximal milk intake.

TI  - Ultradian and circadian activity-rest rhythms of preterm neonates compared to
      full-term neonates using actigraphic monitoring.
PG  - 697-708
AB  - During the first weeks of life, preterm neonates show fewer circadian rhythms in 
      their physiological parameters than full-term neonates. To determine whether
      preterm neonates differ in their temporal adaptation to the day-night cycle from 
      full-term neonates at the early age of 1 week, we compared activity-rest behavior
      of both groups. Activity-rest behavior of 10 neurologically healthy preterm
      neonates (born in 34th to 36th week of gestation) and 10 neurologically healthy
      full-term neonates (born in 37th to 42nd week of gestation) was monitored
      longitudinally for 8 successive days in the first 2 weeks of life. Actigraphy was
      used to register and display time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by
      using small actometers, which resemble a wristwatch. Nursing/feeding was recorded
      using the actometer's integrated event marker button. Recordings for preterm
      neonates were conducted in the hospital, recordings for full-term neonates were
      carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic
      recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic
      characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed
      using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Amounts of daily sleep time, nightly
      sleep time, and sleep time during 24h were compared. Nursing/feeding epochs were 
      also analyzed for 5 preterm and 5 full-term neonates to compare their food intake
      behavior. The majority of preterm neonates showed a multitude of ultradian
      frequencies in their spectra. In contrast, several full-term neonates showed a
      distinct circadian frequency. In preterm neonates, average nightly sleep and
      average daily sleep of all recorded days were very similar, but after the fourth 
      day of life, only average nightly sleep increased. In full-term neonates, average
      nightly and daily sleep time of all recorded days differed by about 1h. Average
      sleep time during 24h for preterm and full-term neonates was similar. Preterm
      neonates showed longer intervals between events of food intake than full-term
      neonates. The circadian peaks in the frequency spectra of full-term neonates may 
      indicate the initial adaptation in the first week of life to a 24h day. This is
      in agreement with our results concerning the different durations of nightly and
      daily sleep. The increase in nightly sleep time of preterm neonates may be
      attributed to the progressing adaptation to a circadian activity-rest pattern.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour automated blood pressure monitoring as a predictor of
      preeclampsia.
PG  - 618-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive ability of
      parameters of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the development of
      preeclampsia or gestational hypertension in women who are already considered at
      risk for these disorders. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty-two pregnant women who
      were considered high risk for the development of preeclampsia underwent 24-hour
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring between 18 and 30 weeks gestation, while
      their condition was normotensive according to routine mercury sphygmomanometry.
      One hundred sixty-four healthy primigravid women who were considered at usual
      risk for preeclampsia underwent the same tests as a parallel study. Routine blood
      pressure, awake and sleep average blood pressure, and 24-hour mean average blood 
      pressure were entered into multiple logistic regression as predictors of either
      preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; significant variables were then tested 
      by a series of receiver operator curves. RESULTS: Eight percent of usual risk and
      45% of high risk women experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational
      hypertension. In both groups, the average routine mercury blood pressure and
      awake, sleeping, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood
      pressure were significantly higher in women who later experienced the development
      of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In usual risk women, 24-hour
      systolic blood pressure of >or=115 mm Hg and sleeping systolic blood pressure of 
      >or=106 mm Hg were predictive of later preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, 
      but sensitivities were low (77% and 54%, respectively). In high risk women,
      sleeping diastolic blood pressure of >or=62 mm Hg and sleeping mean arterial
      pressure of >or=79 mm Hg were predictive of preeclampsia or gestational
      hypertension, but again sensitivities were low (70% and 65%, respectively).
      CONCLUSION: Awake and sleeping blood pressure are higher in midpregnancy in women
      who later experience the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension.
      Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a noninvasive
      method of selecting some of these women, but this test has a sensitivity no
      better than that of other predictive tests, even in women at high risk for
      preeclampsia.

TI  - Circadian rhythm of ANP, aldosterone and PRA in normotensive IUGR.
PG  - 1659-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increases are reported during normal 
      pregnancy, but the relation to arterial pressure and the renin-angiotensin system
      is debatable. We assessed whether normotensive pregnancies with intrauterine
      growth retardation (IUGR) present an alteration of maternal ANP levels. DESIGN: A
      total of 11 pregnant women with IUGR, in the absence of any other maternal or
      fetal pathology, entered the study during the third trimester. They were compared
      with 12 healthy pregnant women of similar age and characteristics. We monitored
      all subjects for blood pressure (BP), ANP, aldosterone and plasma renin activity 
      (PRA), under the same conditions for 24 h. All subjects were submitted to the
      same regimen of life; with homogeneous dark : light periods, salt intake and meal
      times. METHODS: BP was monitored at 20 min intervals for 24 h and blood tests
      performed at six time points during the 24 h. EDTA plasma samples were
      immediately centrifuged. Hormone assays were performed by radioimmunoassay.
      Koch's nonparametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the
      hormone time-dependent profiles in the two groups. Circadian rhythms were
      assessed by cosinor analysis. RESULTS: The IUGR group was characterized by higher
      ANP values compared to normal pregnancy, (205 +/- 24 versus 146 +/- 21 pg/ml: P <
      0.05) but not significant differences were shown for PRA, aldosterone and BP
      circadian rhythms. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows higher ANP values in human
      pregnancy complicated by IUGR, with presence of normal BP, aldosterone and PRA
      profiles.

TI  - Pain management in the critically ill child.
PG  - 749-69
AB  - Children frequently received no treatment, or inadequate treatment, for pain and 
      for painful procedures. The newborn and critically ill children are especially
      vulnerable to no treatment or under-treatment. Nerve pathways essential for the
      transmission and perception of pain are present and functioning by 24 weeks of
      gestation. The failure to provide analgesia for pain results in rewiring the
      nerve pathways responsible for pain transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal
      cord and results in increased pain perception for future painful results. Many
      children would withdraw or deny their pain in an attempt to avoid yet another
      terrifying and painful experiences, such as the intramuscular injections.
      Societal fears of opioid addiction and lack of advocacy are also causal factors
      in the under-treatment of pediatric pain. False beliefs about addictions and
      proper use of acetaminophen and other analgesics resulted in the failure to
      provide analgesia to children. All children even the newborn and critically ill
      require analgesia for pain and painful procedures. Unbelieved pain interferes
      with sleep, leads to fatigue and a sense of helplessness, and may result in
      increased morbidity or mortality.

TI  - Developmental regulation before and after a developmental deadline: the sample
      case of "biological clock" for childbearing.
PG  - 400-13
AB  - This quasi-experimental research investigates developmental regulation around a
      critical life-span transition, the "biological clock" for childbearing. The
      action-phase model of developmental regulation proposes contrasting control
      orientations in individuals approaching versus those having passed a
      developmental deadline. Individuals in an urgency phase close to the deadline
      should be invested in goal pursuit, whereas those who have passed the deadline
      without attaining the goal should focus on goal disengagement and
      self-protection. In 2 studies, women at different ages and with or without
      children were compared with regard to various indicators of primary and secondary
      control striving for goal attainment versus goal disengagement and
      self-protection. Findings support the action-phase model of developmental
      regulation. Patterns of control striving congruent with the participants' status 
      as pre- versus postdeadline were associated with superior psychological
      well-being.

TI  - Maternal education and risk factors for sudden death in infants. Working Group of
      the Groupe Belge de Pediatres Francophones.
PG  - 505-8
AB  - UNLABELLED: To monitor infant care practices associated with risks for sudden
      infant death, 400 Belgian families with infants less than 6 months old were
      questioned by 21 paediatricians during routine visits to local paediatric
      practices and well baby services (11 in urban centres, 10 in rural areas).
      Because of incomplete information, 35 families were excluded. Of the 365 mothers 
      included in the study, 36.1% had under 7 years of schooling, 38.4% less than 13
      years, and 25.5% had a professional school or a university degree. Risk factors
      for sudden infant death were found in 208 (56.9%) families: a usual non-supine
      sleep position (31.5% of the infants); sleeping under a duvet (24.1%); mothers
      smoking during and after gestation (16.4%); a high room temperature (6.6%); use
      of sedatives (3.8%); necklaces or plastic film in the cot (2.5%); and soft
      beddings (2.2%). Maternal education, but not the fathers' profession was
      significantly related to the number of risk factors (mean odds ratio of 4.4; 95% 
      CI: 1.5 to 5.3; P = 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis identified
      the mother's length of schooling as the single most significant independent
      factor for the presence of risk (P < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Less educated mothers
      reported having been informed of risk-reducing recommendations as frequently as
      better educated mothers. It can be concluded that future reduction in risks for
      sudden infant death syndrome should include new strategies designed to modify
      infant care practices.

TI  - Development of circadian rhythms in rat pups exposed to microgravity during
      gestation.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - Ten pregnant Sprague Dawley rat dams were exposed to spaceflight aboard the Space
      Shuttle (STS-70) for gestational days 11-20 (G 11-20; FLT group). Control dams
      were maintained in either a flight-like (FDS group) or vivarium cage environment 
      (VIV group) on earth. All dams had ad lib access to food and water and were
      exposed to a light-dark cycle consisting of 12 hours of light (approximately 30
      lux) followed by 12 hours of darkness. The dams were closely monitored from G 22 
      until parturition. All pups were cross-fostered at birth; each foster dam had a
      litter of 10 pups. Pups remained with their foster dam until post natal day 21
      (PN 21). Pup body mass was measured twice weekly. At PN 14 FLT pups had a smaller
      body mass than did the VIV pups (p < 0.01). Circadian rhythms of body temperature
      and activity of pups from two FLT dams (n = 8), two FDS dams (n = 9) and two VIV 
      dams (n = 7) were studied starting from age PN 21. All pups had circadian rhythms
      of temperature and activity at this age. There were no significant differences in
      rhythms between groups that could be attributed to microgravity exposure. These
      results indicate that exposure to the microgravity environment of spaceflight
      during this embryonic development period does not affect the development of the
      circadian rhythms of body temperature and activity.

TI  - Hormonal and behavioural abnormalities induced by stress in utero: an animal
      model for depression.
PG  - 169-81
AB  - Prenatal stress in rats can exert profound influence on the off spring's
      development, inducing abnormalities such as increased "anxiety", "emotionality"
      or "depression-like" behaviours.Prenatal stress has long-term effects on the
      development of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis and forebrain
      cholinergic systems. These long-term neuroendocrinological effects are mediated, 
      at least in part, by stress-induced maternal corticosterone increase during
      pregnancy and stress-induced maternal anxiety during the postnatal period. We
      have shown a significant phase advance in the circadian rhythms of corticosterone
      secretion and locomotor activity in prenatally-stressed (PNS) rats. When
      subjected to an abrupt shift in the light-dark(LD) cycle, PNS rats resynchronized
      their activity rhythm more slowly than control rats. In view of the data
      suggesting abnormalities in the circadian timing system in these animals, we have
      investigated the effects of prenatal stress on the sleep-wake cycle in adult male
      rats. PNS rats exhibited various changes in sleep-wake parameters, including a
      dramatic increase in the amount of paradoxical sleep. Taken together, our results
      indicate that prenatal stress can induce increased responses to stress and
      abnormal circadian rhythms and sleep in adult rats.Various clinical observations 
      in humans suggest a possible pathophysiological link between depression and
      disturbances in circadian rhythmicity. Circadian abnormalities in depression can 
      be related to those found in PNS rats. Interestingly, we have recently shown that
      the increased immobility in the forced swimming test observed in PNS rats can be 
      corrected by chronic treatment with the antidepressant tianeptine, or with
      melatonin or S23478, a melatonin agonist. Those results reinforce the idea of the
      usefulness of PNS rats as an appropriate animal model to study human depression
      and support a new antidepressant-like effect of melatonin and the melatonin
      agonist S23478.

TI  - The prevalence and clinical significance of nocturnal hypertension in pregnancy.
PG  - 1437-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) the prevalence of hypertension during sleep in
      pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, and (b) whether women with
      hypertension during sleep have worse pregnancy outcomes than hypertensive
      pregnant women with controlled (normal) blood pressure (BP) during sleep. DESIGN:
      Prospective double-blind cohort study. SETTING: Inpatients and outpatients
      managed in a day assessment unit (DAU) at St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia. 
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 186 hypertensive pregnant women, 158 of whom had
      successful 24 h BP monitoring; 40% had proteinuric pre-eclampsia (PE), 43%
      gestational hypertension (GH) and 17% essential hypertension (EH). INTERVENTIONS:
      Blood pressure, 24 h non-invasive, monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was undertaken
      successfully in 158 women with PE, GH or EH, whether or not they were receiving
      antihypertensives. Women and clinicians were blinded to results of these BP
      monitors. Sleep hypertension was defined as BP > 117/68 mmHg at 26-30 weeks or > 
      123/72 mmHg after 30 weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal and fetal
      outcomes were compared between women with and without sleep hypertension and the 
      prevalence of sleep hypertension was determined. RESULTS: Sleep hypertension was 
      present in 59%, more commonly in PE (79%) than GH/EH (45%), P < 0.0001. Sleep
      hypertensives also had higher routine sphygmomanometer BPs [137(10)/91(7) mmHg;
      mean(SD)] than women with normal sleep BP [130(12)/ 87(8) mmHg] P = 0.007, and
      higher awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) BPs [137(8)/88(7) versus
      127(7)/79(6) mmHg], P < 0.0001. Awake, but not sleep, average heart rate was
      lower in sleep hypertensives [85(11) versus 91 (10) beats per minute, bpm], P =
      0.002. Sleep hypertensives had a significantly greater frequency of renal
      insufficiency, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and episodes of (awake) severe
      hypertension (P < 0.05), as well as lower birth weight babies [2715 (808) versus 
      3224(598) g, P < 0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension during sleep is a common
      finding in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly
      pre-eclampsia. These women also have higher awake BPs and a greater frequency of 
      adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. These findings are largely explained by the 
      greater likelihood of pre-eclamptics having sleep hypertension.

TI  - [Visual memory impairment during postpartum].
PG  - 236-41
AB  - Using a visual memory test we studied memory in pregnant women. Benton's Visual
      Retention Test was used with 54 pregnant women three times: at term, 3-4 days
      post-partum, and one month after birth. There was a significant decline in visual
      memory at 3-4 days post-partum (p < 0.01). There was no interaction between hours
      of sleep and memory of pregnant women at any period. Although memory declined at 
      3-4 days, there was no interaction between this decline and duration of labor,
      intra-partum hemorrhage, or memory at one month post-partum. It is not yet clear 
      why visual memory declined shortly after birth. Further studies on post-partum
      memory decline as well as the possible relationship to hormonal and mood changes 
      are necessary.

TI  - The community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women and associated illness
      behaviour.
PG  - 541-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pelvic pain has often been described as a major women's
      health issue, but no information exists on the extent of the problem in the
      United Kingdom. AIM: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic
      pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women. DESIGN
      OF STUDY: Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916)
      randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. METHOD: The
      questionnaire response rate (adjusted for non-deliveries) was 74% (2304/3106).
      Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least 
      six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case
      subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women
      who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group. RESULTS: The
      three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24.0% (95% CI = 22.1% to
      25.8%). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago.
      Recent consulters (32% of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of
      pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep
      quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41% of cases) did
      not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. 
      Irrespective of consulting behaviour, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was 
      found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31%) compared with women with
      dysmenorrhoea (7%). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high community prevalence of
      chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in
      the degree to which they were affected by their symptoms. The high
      symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information
      about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes.

TI  - Sleep apnea and respiratory dysfunction in congenital myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 221-5
AB  - A case of neonatal Myotonic Dystrophy (MD) is presented. A 35 week old 3570 g
      baby was born to a mother affected by MD and pregnancy-induced unstable diabetes.
      Soon after birth, he developed apnea, severe hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia,
      hypotonia and mild respiratory distress. His clinical course improved during the 
      following days, but persistent episodes of desaturation and/or cyanosis did not
      subside; hypotonia was mild. A polysomnographic recording showed mixed central
      and obstructive apnea. DNA testing showed trinucleotide repeat expansion
      mutations diagnostic of MD. The baby was discharged with home-sleep monitoring
      and breast-feeding. Recurrent apnea/bradycardia was the main clinical feature in 
      this case of congenital MD, with increased risk of an acute life-threatening
      event.

TI  - Familial adult onset primary alveolar hypoventilation syndrome.
PG  - 526-31
AB  - A 41-year-old man fell into type II respiratory failure after catching a cold,
      and became dependent on a respirator. Chest radiography showed no abnormalities
      and the hyperventilation test showed improved arterial blood gas findings. His
      sleep study showed marked nocturnal desaturation due to hypopnea and apnea with a
      decrease of thoracic and abdominal movement during sleep. Therefore, we diagnosed
      him as primary alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (PAH). Seven years previously,
      his 2-year elder sister had suffered from similar respiratory failure during her 
      second pregnancy and had been diagnosed as PAH. While myopathy was suspected in
      both cases, attenuation of muscle strength was slight and it appeared not to be
      the main cause of alveolar hypoventilation. Since medication was not effective in
      each case, they underwent non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).
      While sustained mild hypercapnia remained during the daytime, it improved their
      respiratory failure. To our knowledge, this is the first study of familial adult 
      onset PAH.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome and sleep disturbance during pregnancy: the role of folate
      and iron.
PG  - 335-41
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurosensory disorder that typically begins in 
      the evening and often prevents a person from falling asleep. It has been
      associated with iron deficiency anemia and dopaminergic pathways and is often
      treated with iron infusion or dopamine agonists. The purpose of this secondary
      analysis of longitudinal data collected on women before, during, and after
      pregnancy is to document the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy, contrast its
      effect on sleep and mood state, and explore the role of folate and iron in the
      expression of RLS, specifically during the third trimester when the syndrome is
      most distressing. The prevalence increased from 0 during preconception to 23% (n 
      = 7) during the third trimester of pregnancy. Only 1 subject continued to
      experience RLS after delivery. Compared with those without complaints of restless
      legs, those with restless legs had low serum ferritin at preconception and
      significantly lower folate levels during preconception and at each trimester. In 
      addition, time to sleep onset was significantly delayed and depressed mood was
      significantly higher in the RLS group. Rather than indicators of iron deficiency 
      anemia (serum ferritin, serum iron, and hemoglobin) or pernicious anemia (vitamin
      B(12)), it was reduced serum folate level that was associated with RLS in this
      sample of pregnant women. Findings indicate a need to reconsider recommendations 
      about the normal ranges of serum ferritin and serum folate levels during
      pregnancy to minimize the complaints of restless legs and promote more
      consolidated sleep and better daytime mood state during pregnancy.

TI  - Sleep and fatigue.
PG  - 249-73
AB  - This chapter provides a review and synthesis of research on women's sleep and
      fatigue from a nursing perspective. Most of the research involves four primary
      issues for women: menstrual cycles, childbearing, chronic mental or physical
      illness, and oncology. Research with healthy women focused on diurnal
      fluctuations in fatigue and relationships to sleep, without regard for exercise
      or level of daytime activity. Research on chronic illness and cancer fatigue
      focused on general fatigue and its impact on activity, without regard for sleep
      or therapeutic use of rest and naps. A comparison of these two areas highlights
      gaps in nursing knowledge about sleep and fatigue. Further research is needed to 
      understand relationships between nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and symptoms
      related to poor quality of life. From a synthesis of these studies,
      nonpharmacologic interventions that could be prove useful in promoting a higher
      quality of life for those with either acute or chronic fatigue are then proposed.

TI  - Comparisons of sleep patterns between mothers in post-partum from 9 to 12 weeks
      and non-pregnant women.
PG  - 227-8
AB  - In order to evaluate two patterns of interrupted and non-interrupted sleep for
      the post-partum mothers from 9 to 12 weeks after delivery, we compared them with 
      sleep patterns of non-pregnant women. Subjects were 10 primipara and 12
      non-pregnant women. Their polysomnographic recordings were made using a Medilog
      recorder at home. In interrupted sleep, low sleep efficiency, decreased total
      sleep time, and a decreased percentage of stage 2 were significantly observed
      compared with non-pregnant women. Sleep parameters of non-interrupted sleep,
      except for increased percentage of stage 4, did not show any significant
      differences from non-pregnant women. Mothers' sleep fluctuated between
      interrupted sleep similar to the early post-partum sleep from 1 to 6 weeks and
      non-interrupted sleep with increased stage 4.

TI  - Rat as model for studying behavior effects of hCG.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - The demonstration of receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic
      gonadotropin (hCG) in several parts of rat brain suggested their novel functional
      role. Subsequent studies tested the effect of hCG (intraperitoneally or
      intracerebroventricularly) on brain arousal and different types of stress
      situations in an intact female rat model on the day of proestrus. Treatment
      resulted in changes of activity and several other behavioral patterns associated 
      with sites of brain hCG/LH receptors. hCG given peripherally caused a longer
      sleeping time and a decreased activity level. Whereas administration of
      indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited the effects of hCG. 
      hCG increased immunoreactive prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and decreased PGE2 in brain 
      areas controlling activity and sleep. hCG effects were probably mediated via
      prostaglandin pathways. After central hCG treatment, animals were less active and
      showed less exploratory behavior in an open-field box than the control animals.
      Taste and odor neophobias were dramatically decreased following central injection
      of hCG. hCG-treated rats were less anxious and exhibited a higher level of
      maternal interest than the controls. hCG treatment also had a beneficial effect
      against stress ulcer, which was prevented by pretreatment with antisense receptor
      oligonucleotide, suggesting a direct hCG receptor-mediated effect. In summary,
      because hCG can cross the blood-brain barrier, both peripheral administration and
      central administration affect several behavioral patterns. This effect is similar
      to treatment with anxiolytics and suggests the functional relevance of brain
      LH/hCG receptors. Some observed behavioral changes have parallels in pregnant
      women.

TI  - Sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants below 30 weeks of gestational age.
      Preliminary results of a prospective amplitude-integrated EEG study.
PG  - 219-23
AB  - In the newborn, presence of sleep-wake cycles indicates integrity and maturity of
      the central nervous system. By spectral EEG analysis and polygraphic recordings
      subtle variations of EEG background activity and behavioural patterns
      corresponding to early sleep-wake cycles have been found in preterm infants as
      young as 27 weeks of gestation. The emergence of sleep-wake cycles at early
      gestational ages may have a positive predictive value for long-term neurological 
      outcome. Sleep-wake cycles and their significance for later outcome have not been
      studied in very preterm infants so far. Accordingly, we prospectively
      investigated maturational changes of EEG activity and sleep-wake cycles in
      preterm infants below 30 weeks of gestational age using the Cerebral Function
      Monitor, an amplitude-integrated EEG. We present preliminary data on the
      emergence of sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants from this ongoing study. Of 100
      infants enrolled during a 1-year period, 38 infants without neurological
      complications were included in the reference group. In this group (mean
      gestational age 27 weeks), we observed cyclical variations of EEG background
      activity resembling early sleep-wake cycles at a mean gestational age of 28 weeks
      and a median postnatal age of 6 days. It is hypothesised that these cyclical
      variations of EEG background activity may represent switches between
      thalamo-cortical and neo-cortical pattern generators and indicate integrity of
      central nervous system function. Amplitude-integrated EEG may thus serve as a
      useful noninvasive test for brain function in preterm infants.

TI  - Ventilatory responsiveness to progressive asphyxia during sleep in newborn lambs:
      effects of maternal anemia during pregnancy.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - Our aim was to determine the effects of intrauterine compromise, induced by
      maternal anemia, on ventilatory responsiveness of the sleeping newborn to
      progressive asphyxia. We induced anemia in 6 sheep for the final third of
      pregnancy and studied their offspring for 2-3 weeks after birth. Lambs from
      anemic ewes were growth-restricted at birth; they and 6 control lambs were
      chronically instrumented soon after birth and underwent studies during which we
      determined ventilatory and arousal responsiveness to a progressive asphyxic
      stimulus during sleep. During quiet wakefulness, active sleep and quiet sleep,
      lambs from anemic ewes had elevated end-tidal CO2 levels (FECO2,%) compared to
      controls. Ventilatory responsiveness (i.e., gradient of relationship between
      minute ventilation and FECO2) was greater in quiet sleep than in active sleep for
      both groups of lambs but did not differ between the two groups in either active
      or quiet sleep. Lambs from anemic ewes had significantly higher FECO2 values than
      controls before arousing from either active or quiet sleep. Other indices of
      arousability (time to arousal, percent hemoglobin saturation at arousal) were not
      different between the two groups. Our results indicate that prenatal exposure to 
      maternal anemia induces fetal growth restriction and elevates the CO2 'set-point'
      for normal ventilation. It does not, however, produce significant abnormalities
      in ventilatory responsiveness to progressive asphyxia during sleep.

TI  - Male fetal pig lower urinary tract function in mid second and early third
      trimester of gestation.
PG  - 2331-4
AB  - PURPOSE: Routine use of ultrasound during pregnancy has emphasized the need for
      greater knowledge about normal and abnormal voiding function during fetal live.
      We describe the developmental changes in lower urinary tract function from the
      middle of the second to the early third trimester of gestation. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: The study included 22 male fetal pigs of 13 pregnant Goettingen minipigs
      (gestational period 111 to 115 days) with 11 fetuses in the middle of the second 
      (median 61.5 days, 0.55 of term) and 11 fetuses in the beginning of the third
      trimester of gestation (median 80 days, 0.72 of term). With the sow under
      isoflurane anesthesia catheters were placed in the bladder, rectum and amniotic
      cavity of the fetuses, and a flow probe was placed around the distal urethra.
      After the sow was at light sleep urethral flow, amniotic pressure, abdominal
      pressure and bladder pressure were recorded a median of 241 minutes. RESULTS: The
      recordings of 14 fetuses were evaluable. In the middle of the second trimester
      the fetuses showed an almost constant dribbling with a median flow of 0.2 ml. per
      minute and a median of 4 concomitant bladder contractions per minute of median
      3.5 cm. H2O (detrusor pressure). At the beginning of the third trimester the
      fetuses had periods of staccato flow (median 0.2 ml. per minute, staccato
      frequency 1 to 2 Hz.) on top of contractions (median 4 contractions per minute,
      median detrusor pressure 5.5 cm. H2O) with no flow between voidings. CONCLUSIONS:
      Development of storage and voiding function in male pigs occurs between the
      mid-second and early third trimester of gestation, together with emergence of
      striated sphincter bursting activity, which interrupts flow in the urethra during
      the voiding phase.

TI  - Evaluation and treatment of galactorrhea.
PG  - 1763-70
AB  - Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that
      occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the
      presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress,
      suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin
      levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of
      galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism,
      numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic
      causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as
      well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such
      as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, 
      a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic
      resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include
      observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor
      size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with
      prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant
      women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly
      increase in size.

TI  - Twenty-four-hour pattern of cortisol in the human fetus at term.
PG  - 1278-83
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indirect evidence suggests that adrenal steroid production in the
      human fetus may have a circadian rhythm. To assess whether there is a 24-hour
      rhythm of fetal cortisol in the human fetus, we investigated the relationship
      between fetal and maternal cortisol and cortisone concentrations in maternal,
      umbilical arterial, and umbilical venous blood samples over a 24-hour period.
      STUDY DESIGN: Elective cesarean sections were scheduled every 2 hours around the 
      clock in 57 term (38-41 weeks' gestation) nonlaboring pregnant women. Plasma
      cortisol and cortisone concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid
      chromatography. RESULTS: The mean 24-hour cortisol concentration was higher in
      umbilical arterial than in umbilical venous blood samples, 63.6 +/- 4.6 ng/mL
      (SEM) versus 48.7 +/- 3.2 ng/mL, respectively (P <.05). Fetal plasma cortisol
      showed a rhythm in the umbilical artery (acme from noon to 4 PM ) (1-way analysis
      of variance and least significant difference test; P <.05) but not in the
      umbilical vein. Umbilical arteriovenous differences showed no net transfer of
      cortisol to the fetus at any time of the day and net fetal production of cortisol
      from 8 AM to 6 PM. There was limited transfer of cortisone to the fetus and only 
      in the 2 AM -to-noon time interval. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the presence
      of a 24-hour rhythm of fetal adrenal cortisol secretion that may be controlled by
      a fetal circadian pacemaker.

TI  - Restless Legs Syndrome.
PG  - 125-33
AB  - Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a well-defined symptom complex and is frequently 
      associated with sleep disturbance and a recognized family history. It occurs
      either as idiopathic RLS or in association with many medical, neurological or
      vascular disorders. The neurological examination and routine investigations in
      idiopathic RLS are normal. Polysomnography supports the diagnosis of RLS by
      documenting the associated sleep disturbances and periodic limb movements in
      sleep (PLMS). Although MRI studies disclose no intracerebral lesions, recent
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT) studies point to some involvement of the basal and red nuclei and the
      cerebellum. No definitive etiology is known for this condition, but several
      pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. There is supportive evidence
      that RLS is a Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction, suggesting widespread
      involvement of the descending dopaminergic (DA) pathways, possibly originating in
      the diencephalon or upper brainstem. This is corroborated by the successful
      treatment of RLS with DA agents, sedatives, and neurotransmitters. However, RLS
      can also occur with spinal disorders and spinal cord lesions implying the
      existence of a spinal generator. The incidence of RLS in pregnancy is well known 
      and its association with vascular disorders supports another mechanism in some
      patients. The primary treatment of RLS is largely symptomatic and quite effective
      with DA agents, DA agonists, opioids and other neurotransmitters. The treatment
      of RLS associated with various diseases is aimed at the correction of the
      underlying pathological or deficiency states. Antidepressant medications
      frequently precipitate or worsen the condition of RLS.

TI  - [Restless leg syndrome. Diagnosis and treatment].
PG  - 281-3
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The restless legs syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant
      sensation in the legs which causes an imperative need to move the legs and is
      therefore considered to be a disorder of movement. When it appears before going
      to sleep, it may interfere with falling asleep and lead to a sleep-deficit.
      DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSIONS: It is a clinical condition with a satisfactory
      treatment, and improvement of the associated sleep disorder. The etiology is
      unknown, sometimes it is familial. The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, 
      particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic
      renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Polysomnography is not 
      necessary, unless one suspects an associated disorder of periodic leg movements. 
      Treatment is by dopaminergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant drugs or
      clonidine.

TI  - Prevention of fetal demise and growth restriction in a mouse model of fetal
      alcohol syndrome.
PG  - 774-9
AB  - Two peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with
      novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to
      provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal
      demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of
      ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities
      elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated,
      in part, with severe oxidative damage. NAP and ADNF-9 have been shown to exhibit 
      antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar 
      combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth 
      abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in 
      alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on 
      fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction
      between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the
      combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced 
      glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with
      1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [(3)H]NAPVSIPQ
      indicated that 39% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in
      the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death
      and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented
      by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be 
      explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  - Threshold levels of maternal nicotine impairing protective responses of newborn
      rats to intermittent hypoxia.
PG  - 1968-76
AB  - Experiments were carried out to determine the threshold level of maternal
      nicotine that impairs protective responses of rat pups to hypoxia. From days 6 or
      7 of gestation, pregnant rats received either vehicle or nicotine (1.50, 3.00, or
      6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate. kg body wt(-1).day(-1)) or vehicle continuously via
      a subcutaneous osmotic minipump. On postnatal days 5 or 6, pups were exposed to a
      single period of hypoxia produced by breathing an anoxic gas mixture (97% N(2) or
      3% CO(2)) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they were exposed to
      intermittent hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from hypoxic-induced
      primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the
      time to last gasp or the total number of gasps when the pups were exposed to a
      single period of hypoxia. The number of successful autoresuscitations on repeated
      exposure to hypoxia was, however, decreased in pups whose dams had received
      either 3.00 or 6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate/kg body wt; these dosage regimens
      produced maternal serum nicotine concentrations of 19 +/- 6 and 35 +/- 8 ng/ml,
      respectively. Thus our experiments define the threshold level of maternal
      nicotine that significantly impairs protective responses of 5- to 6-day-old rat
      pups to intermittent hypoxia such as may occur in human infants during episodes
      of prolonged sleep apnea or positional asphyxia.

TI  - Buprenorphine treatment of pregnant opioid--dependent women: maternal and
      neonatal outcomes.
PG  - 97-103
AB  - This open-label prospective study examined maternal and neonatal safety and
      efficacy outcome measures during and following prenatal buprenorphine exposure.
      Three opioid-dependent pregnant women received 8 or 12 mg sublingual
      buprenorphine tablets daily for 15-16 weeks prior to delivery. Results showed
      that buprenorphine in combination with comprehensive prenatal care was safe and
      effective in these women. Prenatal exposure to buprenorphine resulted in normal
      birth outcomes, a mean of 4.33 days (minimum possible=4) hospitalization, and a
      'relatively mild' neonatal abstinence syndrome comprised primarily of tremors
      (disturbed), hyperactive moro and shortened sleep after feeding. The infants
      required no pharmacological treatment. Onset of neonatal abstinence signs
      occurred within the first 12 h after birth, peaked by 72 h and returned to below 
      pre-12 h levels by 120 h. It is concluded that buprenorphine has potential
      utility for the treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent women.

AB  - Since the introduction of antidepressants in the 1950s, it was assumed for the
      next several decades that there were no special reasons to look at the
      application of these medications to women. In the past half-century, particularly
      in the past decade, since the advent of the selective serotonin re-uptake
      inhibitors (SSRI), a series of specific foci have developed. Firstly, there
      appear to be differences in the degree of response to particular antidepressants 
      between the genders. Secondly, there is data concerning hormonal effects of
      particular relevance to women, i.e. prolactin, which separates out among the
      antidepressants. Also of concern to women are the potential teratogenic effects
      of these medications, which impact on their use during pregnancy. Finally, there 
      are certain diagnostic syndromes that are particularly relevant to women:
      premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); postpartum depression (PPD) and
      perimenopausal depression (PMD). It appears that the SSRIs may be more effective,
      relative to the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), in women than in men. The 
      SSRIs have shown to be effective in treating these disorders, with the
      possibility of intermittent luteal phase treatment of PMDD. Non-antidepressant
      (AD) approaches have generally been found to be less effective. In the first
      trimester of pregnancy, there is data available supporting the safe use of SSRIs,
      particularly those first released, i.e. fluoxetine and sertraline. Finally, all
      SSRIs, with the exception of sertraline, can increase the risk of
      hyperprolactinaemia. This can lead to a variety of complications including
      amenorrhea and osteoporosis. This effect of sertraline, due to its unique profile
      in blocking re-uptake of dopamine, extends itself into additional relative
      benefits for sleep and memory. The issues associated for women with bipolar
      disorder are dealt with in terms of both increased risk of relapse during
      pregnancy and postpartum periods, as well as the relative risk of use of lithium 
      and mood stabilizers in pregnancy and lactation.

TI  - Long-term telemetric measurement of cardiovascular parameters in awake mice: a
      physiological genomics tool.
PG  - 89-97
AB  - The recent miniaturization of implantable radiotelemetric devices offers the
      possibility of an accurate, reliable, and simple phenotyping tool for long-term, 
      hands-off measurement of blood pressure in unrestrained, untethered mice;
      however, use has been limited because of high morbidity and mortality in all but 
      larger-than-average mice. Also, because the device was developed for abdominal
      aorta implantation at the renal artery level, its use has not been feasible in
      studies where infrarenal blood flow is critical, i.e., in pregnant mice. We
      provide details of a very successful alternative approach for implanting
      radiotelemeters in mice, whereby thoracic aortic implantation of the
      pressure-sensing catheter is combined with subcutaneous placement of the
      transmitter body along the right flank. We used female C57/BL6 (C57) or BPH/5
      mice, a strain derived from the cross of inbred hypertensive and hypotensive
      mouse strains. We show that this is a reliable procedure for providing
      high-fidelity mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings for
      50-60 days in mice weighing 22 g on average but as small as 17 g. No morbidity or
      mortality was observed in either strain using this procedure. Importantly,
      neither strain fully recovered from anesthesia and surgery, as indicated by a
      return of normal circadian rhythms, until 5-7 days postsurgery. This was also
      reflected in significantly elevated baseline MAP and HR levels in both strains
      during this recovery period. Moreover, strain-related differences in relative
      increases in MAP during the first 5 days of recovery masked the significant
      elevation in BPH/5 baseline MAP (vs. C57) observed in fully recovered mice. This 
      suggests that methods must allow at least 5-7 days recovery from surgery to
      provide accurate cardiovascular (CV) phenotyping in mice. Finally, we show that
      CV parameters can be monitored continuously before, during, and after pregnancy
      in mice using this alternative implantation approach. The device did not
      interfere with conception, gestation, delivery, or postnatal care of pups. These 
      results demonstrate the feasibility of stress-free, long-term monitoring of CV
      parameters in pregnant or nonpregnant mice of typical size and offer exciting
      possibilities for application in CV functional genomic research.

TI  - Sleep and sleep disorders in pregnancy.
PG  - 396-408
AB  - Sleep problems are common in pregnant women. This review examines sleep in normal
      pregnancy; discusses the physiologic bases for alterations in sleep, including
      hormonal and mechanical factors; and correlates these factors with changes in
      sleep of pregnant women, as determined subjectively by surveys and objectively by
      polysomnographic studies. The changes in respiratory physiology during pregnancy,
      the possible predisposition of the pregnant woman to sleep-disordered breathing
      because of these changes, and results of published studies of sleep-disordered
      breathing in pregnancy are discussed. Finally, the effect of pregnancy on other
      sleep disorders and the management of these sleep disorders during pregnancy are 
      outlined, including changes in management necessitated by this state. The paucity
      of available data and the need for further studies of incidence and outcomes of
      sleep disorders in the pregnant woman are emphasized.

TI  - Non-linear changes of electrocortical activity after antenatal betamethasone
      treatment in fetal sheep.
PG  - 535-43
AB  - We determined the effects of betamethasone on the fetal sheep electrocorticogram 
      (ECoG) using linear (power spectral) and non-linear analysis. For non-linear
      analysis we used an algorithm based on the Wolf algorithm for the estimation of
      the leading Lyapunov exponent which calculates a prediction error based on the
      course of the time series in the phase space. A high prediction error stands for 
      low predictibility or low regularity and vice versa. After 48 h of baseline
      recordings, vehicle (n = 6) or betamethasone (n = 7) at 10 microg h(-1) was
      infused over 48 h to the sheep fetus at 128 days gestational age (0.87 of
      gestation). ECoG spectral analysis revealed no difference in power spectrum
      between vehicle- and betamethasone-treated fetuses. The prediction error of the
      ECoG during REM sleep was higher than during non-REM or quiet sleep in both
      groups (P < 0.0001) revealing lower causality of brain activity during REM sleep.
      During REM sleep, prediction error significantly decreased 18-24 h after onset of
      betamethasone treatment (P < 0.05) and returned to baseline values within the
      following 24 h of continued betamethasone treatment. No ECoG changes were found
      during quiet sleep. Non-linear ECoG changes during metabolically active REM sleep
      accompanied the previously described decrease in cerebral blood flow. These
      results suggest that betamethasone in doses used in perinatal medicine acutely
      alters complex neuronal activity.

TI  - Effects of prenatal exposure to marijuana.
PG  - 263-4
AB  - QUESTION: I am treating a 27-year-old woman who is now in her 10th week of
      pregnancy. She smokes marijuana two to three times a week, but does not use other
      drugs. She also smokes 20 cigarettes a day. I am concerned about the effects of
      marijuana exposure on her baby. ANSWER: It is not always possible to isolate the 
      effect of marijuana exposure from other possible confounders on pregnancy
      outcome. Although marijuana is not an established human teratogen, recent well
      conducted studies suggest it might have subtle negative effects on
      neurobehavioural outcomes, including sleep disturbances, impaired visual problem 
      solving, hyperactivity, impassivity, inattention, and increased delinquency.

TI  - Effects of impulse noise stimulation on electrocorticogram and heart rate.
PG  - 113-21
AB  - It is now recognized that high-level impulse noises penetrate the uterus of
      pregnant sheep, elevate thresholds of fetal auditory-evoked potential and produce
      damage to fetal inner ear hair cells. However, little is known about functional
      effects of airborne impulse noise on the late-term fetus. In the present study,
      the effects of a series of 20 impulses on the behavioral state of 6 fetal sheep
      were tested. Noise impulses produced 169.3 peak sound pressure level (pSPL) in
      air. Peak levels recorded near the fetal head averaged 161.1 dB. Impulses
      delivered to the fetus during periods of NREM sleep resulted in a decrease in
      average fetal heart rate (FHR) from 185 +/- 22 beats/min (bpm) before stimulation
      to 174 +/- 23 bpm 2-5 s after stimulation (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, an FHR
      acceleration occurred (before stimulation: 177 +/- 24 bpm, after stimulation: 189
      +/- 31 bpm; p < 0.05). Impulse exposure during NREM sleep resulted in reductions 
      in delta-, theta- and alpha-band powers. As a consequence, total power decreased 
      from 100 to 72 +/- 16% (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, stimulation provoked a short
      decrease in total band power from 100 to 73 +/- 20% and a similar decrease in the
      theta- and beta-band powers. The results indicated that impulse noise evoked
      short-term alterations in FHR and cortical activity. These changes were mediated 
      by auditory brain stem activation that led to cortical desynchronization during
      both NREM and REM sleep in late-term fetal sheep.

TI  - Apnoea of prematurity and arousal from sleep.
PG  - 119-33
AB  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been found to be
      consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants born 
      at term and this increase is inversely related to gestational age. The incidence 
      and severity of apnoea of prematurity, are also inversely related to gestational 
      age. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a neonatal history of
      apnoea/bradycardia affected the maturation of arousal responses. Twenty-five
      premature infants were studied. A perinatal risk score was determined for each
      infant and infants were divided into those with a neonatal history of
      apnoea/bradycardia (n=16) and those without (n=9). All infants were studied using
      daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) a preterm study around 36 weeks
      gestation, (b) within 3 weeks of term, and (c) 2-3 months post-term. Multiple
      measurements of arousal threshold (cm H2O) in response to air-jet stimulation
      applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet
      sleep (QS). Arousal thresholds were elevated in apnoeic infants compared to
      control infants in both AS (P<0.05) and QS (P<0.001) at the term study and in QS 
      at 2-3 months post-term (P<0.01). In addition, arousal thresholds were positively
      correlated with perinatal risk score in both sleep states, in all studies, with
      the exception of AS at 2-3 months when all infants were readily arouseable. We
      conclude that a history of prematurity with neonatal apnoea has a persisting
      effect on decreasing arousabilty from sleep and these infants may be at increased
      risk for SIDS.

TI  - Sleep effects on ambulatory blood pressure measurements in pregnant women.
PG  - 38-43
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the definition of daytime 
      and nighttime on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in pregnancy. To determine the
      prevalence of a <10% decrease in mean arterial pressure with sleep (nondipper) in
      pregnancy and the consistency of nondipper status throughout pregnancy. In a
      prospective, longitudinal study, 102 pregnant woman underwent 24-h ABP monitoring
      and recorded sleep patterns at < or = 14, 19 to 22, 27 to 30, 35 to 37 weeks'
      gestation and 5 to 9 weeks' postpartum. Nighttime was defined by arbitrary hours 
      or actual periods of sleep. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements using the
      different definitions of nighttime were compared in the total cohort and
      individual women. Nondipper status of each woman was determined throughout
      pregnancy and postpartum. At 35 to 37 weeks' gestation, 19% of women napped
      during the day and 20% were awake during the night. Throughout pregnancy, mean
      day and night systolic and diastolic ABP measurements were similar whether
      daytime and nighttime were defined by arbitrary hours or by sleep periods. In
      individuals, the use of arbitrary hours (day 07:00 to 21:59, night 22:00 to
      06:59) compared to sleep periods to define day and night resulted in differences 
      in daytime systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of up to 4 and 5 mm 
      Hg, respectively. Similarly there were individual differences in nighttime SBP up
      to 10 mm Hg and DBP up to 11 mm Hg. A third of women were nondippers at least
      once during pregnancy, but only two women were consistent nondippers. The
      different definitions of day and night did not change group ABP measurements, but
      resulted in significant variation in ABP measurements in individual pregnant
      women. Nondippers were common and nondipper status frequently changed during
      pregnancy.

TI  - Sound and the developing infant in the NICU: conclusions and recommendations for 
      care.
PG  - S88-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the conclusions and associated recommendations for care
      developed by the Physical and Developmental Environment of the High-Risk Infant
      Center, Study Group on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Sound, and the Expert 
      Review Panel. STUDY DESIGN: A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and
      researchers reviewed the literature regarding the effect of sound on the fetus,
      newborn, and preterm infant and developed recommendations based on the best
      evidence. An Expert Review Panel reviewed the data and conclusions. RESULTS: The 
      following recommendations are developed from the review of the literature and are
      clarified in the body of the article. (1) Women should avoid prolonged exposure
      to low-frequency sound levels (< 250 Hz) above 65 dB(A) during pregnancy. (2)
      Earphones or other devices for sound production should not be used directly
      attached to the pregnant woman's abdomen. (3) The voice of the mother during
      normal daily activities, along with the sounds produced by her body and those
      present in her usual surroundings, is sufficient for normal fetal auditory
      development. The fetus does not require supplemental stimulation. Programs to
      supplement the fetal auditory experience cannot be recommended. (4) Infant
      intensive care units should incorporate a system of regular noise assessment. (5)
      Sound limit recommendations are to maintain a nursery with an hourly Leq of 50
      dB(A), an hourly L10 of 55 dB(A) and a 1-second Lmax of 70 dB(A), all A-weighted,
      slow response scale. (6) Infant intensive care units should develop and maintain 
      a program of noise control and abatement in order to operate within the
      recommended permissible noise criteria. (7) Care practices must provide ample
      opportunity for the infant to hear parent voices live in interaction between
      parent and infant at the bedside. (8) Earphones and other devices attached to the
      infant's ears for sound transmission should not be used at any time. (9) There is
      little evidence to support the use of recorded music or speech in the environment
      of the high-risk infant. Audio recordings should not be used routinely or left
      unattended in the environment of the high-risk infant. CONCLUSION: The
      recommendations, if followed, should provide an environment that will protect
      sleep, support stable vital signs, improve speech intelligibility for the infant,
      and reduce potential adverse effects on auditory development.

TI  - Changes of serum melatonin level and its relationship to feto-placental unit
      during pregnancy.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - Serum melatonin concentrations were studied in normal pregnant women and in women
      with several types of pathologic pregnancies, e.g., twins, preeclampsia or
      intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Blood samples were collected from the
      maternal antecubital vein at 14:00 hr (daytime) and 02:00 hr (nighttime) during
      pregnancy, and also from the umbilical vein and artery immediately after
      delivery. Serum melatonin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay.
      Daytime serum melatonin levels in normal (single fetus; singleton) pregnancies
      were low. While the levels showed an increasing tendency toward the end of
      pregnancy, no statistically significant changes occurred. On the other hand, the 
      nighttime serum melatonin levels increased after 24 weeks of gestation, with
      significantly (P < 0.01) high levels after 32 weeks; these values decreased to
      non-pregnant levels on the 2nd day of puerperium. Nighttime serum melatonin
      levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in twin pregnancies after 28 weeks of
      gestation than in singleton pregnancies, whereas the patients with severe
      preeclampsia showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower serum melatonin levels than
      the mild preeclampsia or the normal pregnant women after 32 weeks of gestation.
      Melatonin concentrations in umbilical vessels showed a higher tendency in
      neonates who were born during at night compared with the other neonates;
      moreover, those in the umbilical artery were generally higher than those in the
      umbilical vein. The present results indicate that in humans, the maternal serum
      melatonin levels show a diurnal rhythm, which increases until the end of
      pregnancy, reflecting some pathologic states of the feto-placental unit. Fetuses 
      may produce melatonin with a circadian rhythm.

TI  - Who stops smoking during pregnancy?
PG  - 137-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The proportion of women who stop smoking during pregnancy has varied 
      between 17 and 40% percent in Sweden with a tendency of lower prevalence in
      recent years. The aim of the present study was to examine the factors that might 
      influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy. METHOD: One hundred and
      two women were interviewed shortly after their first visit to the antenatal
      clinic and a second time approximately one month after delivery. Two women who
      had late spontaneous abortions were excluded. The women were asked about
      background factors, smoking habits of their parents, smoking history and current 
      smoking habits. The carbon monoxide in expiratory air was measured to verify
      reported smoking habits. RESULTS: Fifty-six of the 100 participating women had
      stopped smoking before the second interview. Having started smoking at an older
      age, having no previous children, smoking few cigarettes, a higher level of
      education, positive support from the partner and having lived with non-smoking
      parents were all associated with stopping smoking when tested as single factors. 
      Reported smoking habits could be verified. Age, smoking habits of the partner,
      passive smoking at work, quality of sleep, general perceived health, length of
      sick-leave or amount of nausea were not correlated to stopping smoking.
      CONCLUSION: The presence of several factors found to influence stopping smoking
      during pregnancy, and the tendency for smoking habits to be passed over to the
      new generation, are reasons for comprehensive and individualized, anti-smoking
      support.

TI  - Prenatal and breast milk morphine exposure following maternal intrathecal
      morphine treatment.
PG  - 137-42
AB  - A case of an infant who had morphine exposure during and following pregnancy
      while her mother was treated with intrathecal (i.t.) morphine is presented along 
      with a review of the relevant literature. Successful maternal pain management was
      achieved during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Minimal maternal serum and
      breast milk levels in the first 7 postpartum weeks were found. Also, infant sleep
      and arousal behavior and general development at 2 and 7 months were unremarkable,
      illustrating the possible safe and efficacious use of i.t. morphine during and
      following pregnancy. Further work is required to understand opioid pharmacology
      during breastfeeding, which will be used to develop an empirical approach to
      breastfeeding and morphine use.

TI  - Ovine hourly fetal urine production: relation to fetal electrocortical activity.
PG  - 267-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound studies of hourly urine production rate in human fetuses
      have suggested that a fall in urine production occurs in state 2F (fetal quiet
      sleep) secondary to a state-dependent decrease in renal blood flow. We sought to 
      ascertain the relationship between fetal hourly urine production rate and
      behavioral state in the near-term ovine fetus, a model in which urine production 
      and fetal brain activity can be directly measured. METHODS: Six ewes with
      singleton pregnancies were prepared with vascular and amniotic fluid catheters.
      Fetuses were prepared with hindlimb vascular catheters, a bladder catheter, and
      biparietal ECoG electrodes. After at least 5 days of recovery (ga 130 +/- 2 days;
      term = 145-150 days), each animal was monitored for a 6-h period. Urine
      production was measured by draining the bladder catheter through a drop counter
      and fetal ECoG was continuously recorded (sampling rate of 50 Hz). ECoG activity 
      was analyzed using power spectral analysis and periods of active and quiet sleep 
      identified using both signal amplitude and corresponding 85% spectral edge
      frequency. RESULTS: Basal fetal arterial pH (7.36 +/- 0.01), pO2 (22.0 +/- 1.2
      mmHg) and pCO2 (47.0 +/- 1.6 mmHg) and plasma (295 +/- 2 mOsm/kg) and urine (179 
      +/- 3 mOsm/kg) osmolalities were within normal ranges. Active and quiet sleep
      comprised 50 +/- 2 and 43 +/- 1% time, respectively. There was no difference in
      hourly urine production rate in active sleep (21.4 +/- 9.7 ml/h) and quiet sleep 
      (18.8 +/- 7.7 ml/h). CONCLUSIONS: 1) Hourly fetal urine production rate is
      independent of ECoG activity state in the near-term ovine fetus. 2) Assuming only
      minor species differences, ultrasound measurement of human fetal hourly urine
      production rate can be performed without concern for fetal neurobehavioral state 
      changes.

TI  - Zaleplon: a pyrazolopyrimidine sedative-hypnotic agent for the treatment of
      insomnia.
PG  - 1254-67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is the subjective complaint of poor sleep or an inadequate
      amount of sleep that adversely affects daily functioning. For the past 4 decades,
      treatment of insomnia has shifted away from the use of barbiturates toward the
      use of hypnotic agents of the benzodiazepine class. However, problems associated 
      with the latter (eg, next-day sedation, rebound insomnia, dependence, and
      tolerance) have prompted development of other agents. OBJECTIVE: This review
      describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine agent, zaleplon. METHODS:
      Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles
      listed in MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation 
      on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences.
      RESULTS: The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the
      literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with
      placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep
      initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical
      effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual
      effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken < or = 2 hours before awakening
      without "hangover" effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being
      the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15%-18%). Compared
      with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon
      causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment (P < 0.001).
      Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon
      should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg.
      CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia has a substantial impact on daily functioning. If
      pharmacologic treatment is indicated for insomnia, the choice of an agent should 
      be guided by individual patient characteristics.

      18-22 weeks (n = 28), 25-28 weeks (n = 24), and 35-38 weeks (n = 38). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Questionnaire of sleep habits and sleep disturbances. RESULTS: A
      large percentage of the women experienced sleep disturbances during pregnancy,
      These problems included frequent night wakings, difficulty falling asleep, and
      symptoms of sleep apnea. Few differences in sleep patterns were found across
      pregnancy, although women were found to sleep more and nap more by the end of
      pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, especially
      late in pregnancy.

TI  - Complications and consequences of obstructive sleep apnea.
PG  - 485-9
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has many consequences. There is an independent
      association between OSA and hypertension. The Sleep Heart Health Study reported
      that hypertension prevalence increased as sleep disordered breathing severity
      increased. The Nurses' Health Study noted an age-adjusted relative risk of
      cardiovascular events of 1.46 for occasional snorers and 2.02 for regular
      snorers, and a risk of stroke of 1.60 for occasional snorers and 1.88 for regular
      snorers. Sleep apnea is also associated with pulmonary hypertension,
      neurocognitive effects, depressed quality of life, motor vehicle accidents,
      awakening headache, childhood growth interruption, pregnancy-induced
      hypertension, fetal growth retardation, and disruption of the patients'
      bed-partners' sleep quality. Further research will examine the possibility of
      causality, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and outcomes of therapeutic interventions
      for OSA on the many consequences of OSA.

TI  - REM sleep and mood state in childbearing women: sleepy or weepy?
PG  - 877-85
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To test the hypotheses that: 1) an increase in endogenous
      progesterone levels during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle will alter REM
      sleep and mood state, and 2) a decrease in endogenous progesterone levels during 
      postpartum will also alter REM sleep and mood state. DESIGN: A longitudinal
      descriptive study utilizing ambulatory polysomnography for two consecutive nights
      at seven time points. SETTING: Subject's homes. PARTICIPANTS: The first
      hypothesis was tested with 34 women studied during both the follicular and luteal
      phases of their menstrual cycle. The second hypothesis was tested with 31 women
      who completed the sleep studies during pregnancy and at one month postpartum.
      INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Women who ovulated (high levels of 
      serum progesterone in the luteal phase) had shorter REM latency, more REM sleep, 
      and more positive mood state compared to those who did not ovulate (low luteal
      progesterone). Compared to the third trimester (high progesterone), REM latency
      was significantly shorter at one month postpartum (low progesterone). Mood state 
      was most positive at the second trimester and most negative at one month
      postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: REM sleep and mood state were related to low
      progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle, but postpartum REM sleep and mood
      state were related to increased wake time rather than changes in progesterone
      levels.

TI  - Can critically timed sleep deprivation be useful in pregnancy and postpartum
      depressions?
PG  - 201-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of critically timed
      sleep deprivation in major mood disorders (MMD) occurring during pregnancy and
      postpartum. METHODS: Nine women who met DSM-IV criteria for a MMD with onset
      during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum underwent a trial of either
      early-night sleep deprivation (ESD), in which they were sleep deprived in the
      early part of one night and slept from 03:00-07:00 h, or late-night sleep
      deprivation (LSD), in which they were deprived of sleep in the latter part of one
      night and slept from 21:00-01:00 h. Mood was assessed before the night of sleep
      deprivation, after the night of sleep deprivation, and after a night of recovery 
      sleep (sleep 22:30-06:30 h) by trained clinicians, blind to treatment condition, 
      using standardized scales. RESULTS: More patients responded to LSD (nine of 11
      trials: 82%) compared with ESD (two of six trials: 33%) and they responded more
      after a night of recovery sleep (nine of 11 nights: 82%) than after a night of
      sleep deprivation (six of 11 nights: 55%). Pregnant women were the only
      responders to ESD and the only nonresponders to LSD. LIMITATIONS: The small and
      heterogeneous sample size prevents us from making more definitive conclusions
      based on statistical analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Although the findings are
      preliminary, the results suggest that with further study, critically timed sleep 
      deprivation interventions may benefit women with pregnancy or postpartum major
      mood disorders and potentially provide a viable alternative treatment modality
      for those women who are not candidates for pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic
      interventions. Such interventions are needed to help prevent the devastating
      effects of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period on the mother,
      infant, her family and society.

TI  - Feeding problems, sleep disturbances, and negative behaviors in a toddler.
PG  - 351-3; discussion 354-5
AB  - Tiffany, a 3-year-old girl, was referred to the developmental and behavioral
      pediatrics service for evaluation of significant and persistent negative
      behaviors associated with refusal to eat at meal time and constant snacking
      during the past 3 months. She lost 2 pounds, but her weight for her height was at
      the 50th percentile. Her mother indicated that Tiffany had frequent night
      awakenings (>10) and late sleep onset (between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m.). Her mother
      described her as being "easily frustrated," getting upset and angry very quickly.
      Tiffany was identified at an early intervention program as having mild to
      moderate developmental delays in pragmatic speech, gross and fine motor skills,
      and social interaction skills. Tiffany was born at 33 weeks gestation and was
      hospitalized for 10 days without significant perinatal problems. She was
      readmitted at 2 months of age when she was diagnosed with gastroesophageal
      reflux, lactose intolerance, sleep apnea, and bradycardia. She was discharged
      with an apnea monitor. A seizure disorder was diagnosed at 1 year of age and
      reactive airway disease at 2 years of age. At the time of the referral to the
      developmental and behavioral pediatrics service, Tiffany was followed by multiple
      services, including cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology, psychology, and
      pulmonary. Pharmacologic therapies included albuterol and cromalyn inhalers,
      phenobarbital, valproic acid, levocarnitine, ranitidine, and an inhaled steroid. 
      She continued to use the apnea monitor each night, although three sleep studies
      demonstrated a normal sleep pattern with no evidence of apnea or bradycardia. A
      recent electroencephalogram was normal. Tiffany lives with her mother and
      maternal grandparents. Her mother is morbidly obese with a history of asthma and 
      depression. She was infertile for a 10-year period, which she attributed to the
      stress associated with living with an abusive man. Tiffany was the result of a
      subsequent, brief relationship with another man; she has not had contact with her
      father. Her mother is a licensed practical nurse who has not worked as a nurse
      since Tiffany's birth. An interdisciplinary treatment approach to Tiffany's
      multiple biological and behavioral problems was implemented by admitting her to a
      collaborative care unit at a children's hospital.

TI  - Health status and health care use of Massachusetts women reporting partner abuse.
PG  - 302-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies indicate that women abused by their intimate partners are at 
      increased risk for a number of health problems and have increased rates of health
      care utilization. However, these findings are based mainly on studies using
      clinic or health plan populations. In this study, we examined the association
      between intimate partner abuse (IPA) and health concerns and health care
      utilization in a population-based sample of adult women. METHODS: We analyzed
      data on 2043 women aged 18 to 59 who participated in the 1998 Massachusetts
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a population-based health
      survey that included questions on IPA. IPA was defined as experiencing physical
      violence by, fear of, or control by an intimate partner. Consequences of IPA and 
      self-rated health status and health care utilization of women experiencing IPA
      were examined. RESULTS: A total of 6.3% of Massachusetts women aged 18 to 59
      reported IPA during the past year. Women experiencing IPA were more likely than
      other women to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation,
      disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Women
      experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance, but received routine 
      health care at similar rates as other women. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate 
      that women in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for
      several serious emotional and physical health concerns. Most of these women are
      in routine contact with health care providers. These findings also suggest that
      the BRFSS may provide a valuable mechanism for tracking state-based IPA
      prevalence rates over time.

TI  - Normal pregnancy, daytime sleeping, snoring and blood pressure.
PG  - 289-297
AB  - Objective: Investigation of daytime sleepiness, blood pressure changes and
      presence of sleep disordered breathing, in healthy young women during
      pregnancy.Methods: Young, healthy pregnant women between 18 and 32 years of age, 
      seen in three different prenatal care clinics, were enlisted in a prospective
      study divided in two parts: part 1 of the study consisted of completing a
      standardized questionnaire on past and present sleep disorders. It also included 
      filling out visual analog scales (VAS) for daytime sleepiness and snoring by the 
      subject and bed partner. Blood pressure measurement was performed at 9 AM as per 
      the WHO protocol. Similar data were collected again at the 6-month prenatal visit
      and at the 3-month post-delivery visit. At the 6-month visit, ambulatory
      monitoring of nocturnal sleep using a portable six-channel recorder
      (Edentrace((R))) was performed at home. Part 2 involved a subgroup of subjects
      that were randomly selected after stratification based on results of VAS and
      ambulatory monitoring. It included 1 night of nocturnal polysomnography with
      esophageal manometry and 24 h of ambulatory BP monitoring with portable equipment
      with cuff inflation every 30 min.Results: Of the 267 women who participated in
      part 1 of the study, only 128 consented to enroll in part 2, from which 26 were
      selected to undergo polysomnography. At the 6-week prenatal visit 37.45% of the
      subjects reported daytime sleepiness of variable severity. At the 6-month visit, 
      this was noted in 52% of the subjects. Bed-partners reported chronic, loud
      snoring prior to pregnancy in 3.7% of the study population, but this increased to
      11.8% at the 6-month visit. Blood pressure (BP) remained below the pathological
      range, i.e. less than 150/95 mm Hg, during the entire pregnancy. However,
      ambulatory monitoring indicated that 37 women, including the loud chronic
      snorers, had some minor SaO(2) drops during sleep and this same group presented
      the largest increase in BP between the 6th week and the 6th month prenatal
      visits. Part 2 included 26 women, 13 from the above identified 37 women and 13
      from the rest of the group, chosen randomly, age and body mass index (BMI)
      matched. Polysomnography did identify two abnormal breathing patterns during
      sleep: (1) esophageal pressure 'crescendos' associated predominantly with stage 1
      and 2 NREM sleep, and (2) 'abnormal sustained efforts' seen predominantly with
      delta sleep. These abnormal breathing patterns were noted during a significantly 
      longer time during sleep. This group of women with the abnormal breathing
      patterns were not only chronic snorers but also had significantly higher systolic
      and diastolic BP increases when compared to the 13 other non-snorers. Six out of 
      the 13 snorers were 'non-dippers' at the 24-h BP recording.Conclusion: Abnormal
      breathing during sleep (that is frequently, but not always, associated with loud,
      chronic snoring, and may be a consequence of edema induced by hormonal changes
      associated with pregnancy), can be seen in otherwise healthy young pregnant
      women. It may contribute to the symptom of daytime sleepiness. The changes in
      blood pressure noted were of no pathological significance in our population but
      could be an added risk factor in high-risk pregnancies.

      determination of arousal thresholds in infants.Review of confounding factors: The
      determination of arousal thresholds in infants measures their arousability from
      sleep. The evaluation is influenced by various conditions. The infant's
      arousability is decreased by maternal factors, such as exposure to cigarette
      smoke, alcohol, illegal drugs or medications during gestation or breastfeeding.
      The levels of arousal thresholds also depend on the age of the infant and on
      experimental conditions, such as previous sleep deprivation, type of arousal
      challenges, time of administration of the arousal challenge, sleep stage, body
      position, room temperature, use of a pacifier, bed sharing, or type of feeding.
      In addition, spontaneous arousals can occur and modify the infant's response to
      external arousal challenges.Conclusions: Factors known to modify infants'
      arousability from sleep should be controlled during studies designed to determine
      arousal thresholds.

TI  - Women's health after childbirth: a longitudinal study in France and Italy.
PG  - 1202-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of various symptoms five months and twelve 
      months after childbirth in two European countries, according to employment,
      financial difficulties and relationship with partner. DESIGN: Longitudinal
      multicentre survey with a similar design in France and Italy. Women were
      interviewed three times: at birth and twice after childbirth. At 12 months after 
      childbirth, the survey was postal in both countries. POPULATION: Women who had
      been delivered of their first or second baby in three maternity units in France
      and five units in Italy. Women who had multiple pregnancies, a stillbirth or
      known neonatal death were excluded. RESULTS: The response rates were 83% in
      France and 88% in Italy. Fifteen symptoms were considered. The results were
      similar in the two countries and showed that the prevalence of most symptoms was 
      higher at 12 months than at five months after childbirth. When their baby was one
      year old, more than half of the women reported backache, anxiety and extreme
      tiredness. Around one-third of women reported headache, lack of sexual desire,
      sleep disorders and depression. Piles, constipation and painful intercourse were 
      also common. One year postpartum women with financial problems or a difficult
      relationship reported poor psychological health more frequently. CONCLUSION:
      Physical and emotional problems are common after birth, and they tend to increase
      over time. Backache, headache and piles can seriously interfere with day-to-day
      life. Sexual problems also may be a source of unhappiness for the woman and her
      partner. Extreme tiredness, anxiety and depression may make a woman feel guilty
      for not corresponding to the image of a healthy, happy and well-coping mother.
      There is a link between financial problems or a difficult relationship with her
      partner and her own wellbeing. Health professionals should be aware of the high
      prevalence of health problems among new mothers, and of the social context of
      women who are more likely to suffer from them. They should counsel the women in
      their care, in order to help them to find the best solution, be it medical or
      social in nature.

TI  - The circadian rhythm of blood pressure during pregnancy.
PG  - 500-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the circadian rhythm of blood pressure
      during pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and
      MIRLYN. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies from 1 969 to 1997 were evaluated. DATA
      EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and information was organized under the following
      areas: definition of and the interconnection between circadian rhythm and blood
      pressure; the circadian variability of blood pressure throughout the trimesters; 
      the patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancies defined as 
      normal and those complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia; and
      clinical implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: The circadian rhythm of blood pressure in 
      pregnancy is the same as in the non-pregnant state, with a nocturnal decrease,
      especially during sleep. In patients with chronic hypertension, the nocturnal
      fall in blood pressure may be steeper. Patients with mild preeclampsia may
      experience a less pronounced nocturnal decrease in blood pressure. Patients with 
      severe preeclampsia may display a reversed circadian rhythm, with no decrease
      and/or an increase in nocturnal blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of the 
      circadian rhythm of blood pressure during normal pregnancy and pregnancies
      complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia warrant consideration when
      monitoring patients and implementing management plans.

TI  - Influence of light in the NICU on the development of circadian rhythms in preterm
      infants.
PG  - 247-57
AB  - The fetal biological clock is an endogenous clock capable of generating circadian
      rhythms and responding to maternal entraining signals. By at least the third
      trimester of pregnancy fetal diurnal rhythms are entrainable by maternal
      day-night rhythms. Maternal illness during pregnancy and premature birth are
      obvious clinical factors that may adversely affect circadian rhythm development. 
      Premature birth of the fetus has a most dramatic impact on maternal fetal
      interactions. The effect on biorhythms appears to be temporary and is greatest on
      the most immature infants. The results to date support the importance of fetal
      circadian rhythms and the relative lack of these rhythms in the preterm infant.
      It is well known that growth and development in the prematurely born infant are
      influenced by a multitude of factors; clearly, the neonatal intensive care unit
      is not a surrogate for the maternal placental unit. This article reviews what is 
      known about circadian development in the human infant with an emphasis on the
      unique circumstances of the preterm infant. The research on the short- and
      long-term effects of environmental interventions on circadian, sleep, and
      neurologic development is discussed. Although an earlier onset of circadian
      development did not result with cycled lighting in the neonatal nursery, there
      may still be important biological effects that have not been studied. There are
      sufficient data to state that there is no reason for continuing a chaotic,
      noncircadian environmental approach for the care of the prematurely born infant.

TI  - Real-time spectral analysis of the fetal EEG: a new approach to monitoring sleep 
      states and fetal condition during labor.
PG  - 340-5
AB  - Adverse perinatal events affecting cerebral functions are a major cause of
      neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term neurologic deficit. Intrapartum
      fetal EEG, which records fetal brain electrical activity, provides a monitoring
      modality for evaluating the fetal CNS during labor. In this study, we describe a 
      new approach to such monitoring that is based on real-time spectral analysis of
      the fetal EEG during labor. Fourteen pregnant women with uncomplicated term
      pregnancies who went into labor participated in the study. Two suction-cup
      electrodes were applied to the fetal scalp at the occipitoparietal or parietal
      region after rupture of membranes. Real-time spectral analysis was used to
      determine the frequency and amplitude of the fetal EEG signal. The spectral edge 
      frequency (SEF) was calculated as the frequency below which 90% of the power in
      the power spectrum resides. The average EEG amplitude and the SEF were displayed 
      using the density spectral array technique. Fetal heart rate and intrauterine
      pressure were also measured. Two fundamental EEG patterns were identified:
      high-voltage slow activity and low-voltage fast activity. The SEF was found to be
      an excellent index of cyclic EEG activity. Fetal heart rate demonstrated
      increased variability and an elevated baseline during low-voltage fast activity, 
      whereas both parameters decreased during high-voltage slow activity. During
      episodes of variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate, a decrease in the SEF
      was observed, accompanied by an increased EEG voltage. The results obtained
      substantiate the presence of sleep cycles in the human fetus. This kind of
      cortical activity monitoring may enable rapid alertness to cerebral hypoxia and
      allow for prompt intervention, thereby decreasing the risk for birth asphyxia and
      subsequent brain damage.

TI  - Blood pressure patterns in normal pregnancy, gestational hypertension, and
      preeclampsia.
PG  - 149-58
AB  - With the aim to describe the daily pattern of blood pressure during the
      trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women 
      who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 1494 blood
      pressure series systematically sampled by ambulatory monitoring for 48 hours
      every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 124 women with uncomplicated
      pregnancies, 55 with gestational hypertension, and 23 with a final diagnosis of
      preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group
      and trimester of gestation was established by population multiple-component
      analysis. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern represented by a
      linear model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 hours is
      demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for all groups of pregnant
      women in all trimesters (P:<0.001 in all cases). The differences in circadian
      rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly
      statistically significant in all trimesters (always P:<0.001). There is also a
      statistically significant difference in circadian amplitude (extent of daily
      change) of blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies in all
      trimesters (always P:<0.004). Results further indicate similar circadian
      characteristics between women who later developed gestational hypertension or
      preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these 2 
      groups in circadian mean is statistically significant in the second trimester for
      systolic (P:=0.022) but not for diastolic blood pressure (P:=0.986). In the third
      trimester, the difference in circadian mean is highly statistically significant
      for both variables (P:<0.001). The differences in blood pressure between healthy 
      and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of
      pregnancy. Those highly significant differences are found when both systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure for women with a later diagnosis of gestational
      hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological
      range of blood pressure variability. These differing changes in the circadian
      pattern of blood pressure with advancing gestational age between healthy and
      complicated pregnancies offer new end points that may lead to an early
      identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the
      establishment of prophylactic intervention.

TI  - Pre-eclampsia is associated with marked alterations in sleep architecture.
PG  - 619-25
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Pre-eclampsia is currently the predominant cause of maternal
      and fetal morbidity and mortality. Diurnal blood pressure variation is flattened 
      or reversed in pre-eclampsia; however, sleep has not been extensively
      investigated in this disease. Our objective was therefore to study sleep
      architecture in this group of patients. STUDY DESIGN: Full polysomnography using 
      the Compumedics Sleepwatch System or Compumedics p-series. SETTING: NA. PATIENTS:
      25 pre-eclamptic patients and 17 primigravidas with normal pregnancies and no
      history of cardiovascular disease or sleep disorder. With the exception of one
      subject, all pre-eclamptics were taking clonidine (a known suppressant of rapid
      eye movement-REM-sleep) for control of their hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: NA.
      RESULTS: Pre-eclamptic subjects had markedly altered sleep architecture, with a
      markedly increased percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) (21 * 2%
      versus 43 * 3%, p<0.001). There was a longer latency to rapid eye movement (REM) 
      sleep (92 * 11 mins vs. 205 * 23 mins in control and pre-eclamptic subjects,
      respectively, p<0.001) and reduced time spent in REM (18 * 1% and 10 * 2% in
      control and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While
      the increased REM latency and decreased REM time are most likely due to
      clonidine, this is unlikely to also account for the increased SWS. Two possible
      explanations for this include cerebral edema and release of cytokines, which are 
      known to alter sleep structure.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and frequency of the hereditary restless legs syndrome
      in a population of 300 patients.
PG  - 597-602
AB  - There is a genetic contribution to the idiopathic restless legs syndrome (iRLS). 
      An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is suspected, but as yet no gene has
      been identified. To assess the frequency and characteristics of the hereditary
      restless legs syndrome (RLS) in comparison to those of non-hereditary RLS, we
      analysed the clinical data of 300 RLS patients. All 300 patients diagnosed as RLS
      according to the criteria of the International RLS Study Group were examined
      using a standard questionnaire covering demographic data, family history,
      clinical symptoms, subjective sleep disturbances and course of the disease. In
      all patients a complete neurological examination was performed, and in selected
      cases electrophysiological examinations and polysomnographic studies. Family
      history was rated as definitely positive when at least one first-degree relative 
      was examined and classified as RLS according to the criteria by one of the
      authors. If it proved impossible to contact family members to verify reports of a
      family history, the patients were classified as only having a "possible positive 
      family history." 232 of the 300 patients had iRLS and 68 secondary RLS due to
      uremia (uRLS). 42.3% of the patients with iRLS and 11.7% of those with uRLS were 
      classified as having "definite positive" hereditary RLS, with a further 12.6% of 
      iRLS patients and 5.8% of uRLS patients as having "possible positive" hereditary 
      RLS. Patients with definite hereditary RLS were significantly younger at the age 
      of onset than those with a negative family history (35.45 vs. 47.17 years, p <
      0.05). The clinical characteristics of the disease were similar in both groups,
      except that women with hereditary RLS experienced a worsening of symptoms during 
      pregnancy (19.1% vs. 2.6%, p < 0.05). Our study shows that patients with
      hereditary RLS may experience an earlier onset of the disease. Hereditary and
      non-hereditary RLS present with similiar clinical signs and symptoms.

TI  - Control of neurulation by the nucleosome assembly protein-1-like 2.
PG  - 431-5
AB  - Neurulation is a complex process of histogenesis involving the precise temporal
      and spatial organization of gene expression. Genes influencing neurulation
      include proneural genes determining primary cell fate, neurogenic genes involved 
      in lateral inhibition pathways and genes controlling the frequency of mitotic
      events. This is reflected in the aetiology and genetics of human and mouse neural
      tube defects, which are of both multifactorial and multigenic origin. The
      X-linked gene Nap1l2, specifically expressed in neurons, encodes a protein that
      is highly similar to the nucleosome assembly (NAP) and SET proteins. We
      inactivated Nap1l2 in mice by gene targeting, leading to embryonic lethality from
      mid-gestation onwards. Surviving mutant chimaeric embryos showed extensive
      surface ectoderm defects as well as the presence of open neural tubes and exposed
      brains similar to those observed in human spina bifida and anencephaly. These
      defects correlated with an overproduction of neuronal precursor cells. Protein
      expression studies showed that the Nap1l2 protein binds to condensing chromatin
      during S phase and in apoptotic cells, but remained cytoplasmic during G1 phase. 
      Nap1l2 therefore likely represents a class of tissue-specific factors interacting
      with chromatin to regulate neuronal cell proliferation.

TI  - Enhancing pharmacologic effects in the treatment of depression in women.
PG  - 18-27
AB  - The prevalence of depressive disorders in women is twice that in men. This gender
      difference emerges around the time of puberty and persists through the
      childbearing years. Reproductive events and psychosocial factors are important
      influences on depression in women. Women often present with atypical depressive
      symptoms and comorbid disorders that can complicate both diagnosis and treatment.
      Sex differences in pharmacokinetics have been noted, as well as differences in
      antidepressant treatment response. While sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, 
      and weight gain may be part of the constellation of depressive symptoms, they are
      also important considerations in selecting a treatment option for depressed
      women.

TI  - Omission of nitrous oxide from a propofol-based anesthetic does not affect the
      recovery of women undergoing outpatient gynecologic surgery.
PG  - 332-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although nitrous oxide (N2O) is used commonly during anesthesia,
      clinically relevant advantages-disadvantages of using this agent are not well
      established in the ambulatory setting. This study in women undergoing ambulatory 
      gynecologic surgery compares outcomes in patients administered total intravenous 
      anesthesia with propofol versus the propofol plus N2O. The primary outcome was
      the time to home readiness. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of
      postanesthetic adverse events. METHODS: Women presenting for elective ambulatory 
      termination of pregnancy or gynecologic laparoscopy were induced with an
      intravenous sleep dose of propofol and fentanyl. After induction, subjects were
      randomly allocated to maintenance anesthesia with propofol alone or propofol plus
      65% N2O. Patients were assessed by a blinded observer in the postanesthetic care 
      unit at 20-min intervals to determine home readiness. Postoperative pain and
      nausea were measured with visual analog scales. Postoperative analgesics and
      antiemetics were recorded. The incidence of adverse events occurring after
      hospital discharge was assessed by a telephone interview 24 h postoperatively.
      RESULTS: A total of 740 patients received propofol alone, and 750 patients
      received propofol plus N2O. Mean home readiness times were not significantly
      different between treatment groups. There were no significant differences between
      groups in pain scores, nausea scores, analgesia administration, or antiemetic
      administration before discharge. There were no significant differences in the
      frequency of adverse events for 24 h after discharge from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Omission of N2O from a propofol-based anesthetic for ambulatory gynecologic
      surgery does not affect time to home readiness or the incidence of postoperative 
      adverse events up to 24 h after discharge from hospital. (Key words: Awareness;
      outpatient surgery; total intravenous anesthesia.)

TI  - Restless legs syndrome: detection and management in primary care. National Heart,
      Lung, and Blood Institute Working Group on Restless Legs Syndrome.
PG  - 108-14
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic movement disorder that is often
      associated with a sleep complaint. Patients with RLS have an irresistible urge to
      move their legs, which is usually due to disagreeable sensations that are worse
      during periods of inactivity and often interfere with sleep. It is estimated that
      between 2 and 15 percent of the population may experience symptoms of RLS.
      Primary RLS likely has a genetic origin. Secondary causes of RLS include iron
      deficiency, neurologic lesions, pregnancy and uremia. RLS also may occur
      secondarily to the use of certain medications. The diagnosis of RLS is based
      primarily on the patient's history. A list of questions that may be used as a
      basis to assess the likelihood of RLS is included in this article. Pharmacologic 
      treatment of RLS includes dopaminergic agents, opioids, benzodiazepines and
      anticonvulsants. The primary care physician plays a central role in the diagnosis
      and management of RLS.

TI  - Predictive value of neonatal neurological tests for developmental outcome of
      preterm infants.
PG  - 100-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to identify, as early as possible, infants who are at
      risk for long-term neurological morbidity. METHODS: To predict neurodevelopment
      outcome of preterm infants <30 weeks' gestation in a population of 100 infants,
      we used several neonatal and neurobehavioral tests, including cranial
      ultrasonography, the Prechtl neurological test, quality of spontaneous general
      movements, and quality of sleep-wake organization. RESULTS: The Prechtl test at
      corrected term age and findings on cranial sonograms both had high specificity,
      but the Prechtl test had better overall positive predictive power for normal
      neurological and developmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age. Developmental 
      changes in sleep and the amount of indeterminate sleep did not correlate with
      outcome. Scoring general movement quality did not predict outcome and did not
      augment the positive predictive power of the Prechtl test. CONCLUSIONS: The
      Prechtl test at corrected term age (independent of the other tests) is the best
      positive predictor of normal neurological outcome and Bayley test results at 2
      years' corrected age.

PG  - 135-52
AB  - It has been assumed that women recover from pregnancy and childbirth within 6
      weeks. Recent research shows that women's fatigue levels are the same, or higher,
      at 6 weeks postpartum as at the time of delivery. This study determined the
      differences in primiparous women's fatigue and energy levels at 6 weeks and 14 to
      19 months postpartum. Determinations of how some contributing factors and
      outcomes of postpartum fatigue relate to each other and to fatigue and energy at 
      14 to 19 months postpartum were also made. Analyses revealed that women are more 
      fatigued and less energetic at 14 to 19 months than they were at 6 weeks
      postpartum. Quality of sleep did not correlate with fatigue or energy. At 14 to
      19 months postpartum return to full functional status is almost complete, with
      household and infant care responsibilities being most complete. The women were
      experiencing mild life crises of various sorts, were somewhat depressed, and were
      gratified in the mothering role.

TI  - Lifestyle factors and continence status: comparison of self-report data from a
      postal survey in England.
PG  - 312-3, 315-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare health and lifestyle factors of people with and without
      urinary incontinence (UI). DESIGN: A postal survey was undertaken that represents
      the first of a 3-stage project designed to evaluate the health interventions of
      primary health care teams and continence advisory services on patient outcomes
      related to UI. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Two random samples of adult populations (N =
      12,529) were included, generated from the family physician patient registers
      within 2 health authorities in England. INSTRUMENTS: Data were collected using a 
      structured questionnaire that queried demography, perceived health status,
      activities of daily living, self-care, and use of local health and social
      services. Information was also collected on past and present continence status.
      METHODS: Structured questionnaires and a cover letter were mailed to the target
      population. Two reminders were sent to nonresponders to maximize the response
      rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main measures relate to factors associated with 
      UI: mobility, sleep, childbirth, smoking, diet, body mass index, and
      accommodation. RESULTS: Significantly more women than men had UI (P < .0001).
      Respondents with UI were older than those who were continent (P < .0001). Women
      with UI were significantly more likely to have a greater number of pregnancies (P
      < .0001), were more likely to have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 lb 
      (P < .01), and to have had more than 4 children (P = .01) compared with women who
      were continent. People with UI were less likely to be single and more likely to
      be widowed than those who were continent (P < .0001). People who lived alone and 
      who had UI were also significantly less likely to have a relative or friend that 
      they could depend on for help than those who were continent (P < .001). UI was
      also found to be significantly associated with impaired mobility (P < .0001) and 
      sleeping difficulties (P < .0001). No meaningful differences were found between
      diet and UI, although significantly more people with UI had higher mean body mass
      index, were obese, or reported that they felt too heavy for their height when
      compared with people who were continent (P < .0001). No association was found in 
      the present study with smoking or ethnicity and UI. CONCLUSIONS: Key health and
      lifestyle factors associated with UI included age, gender, childbirth, mobility, 
      sleep patterns, obesity, living alone, and access to help. These factors should
      be assessed when planning and implementing health care for persons with UI.
      Attention to these associated factors may prove useful in identifying new cases
      or people at risk of developing UI when screening people as part of routine
      health checks. This, in turn, could assist with targeting effective and efficient
      health care but may also contribute to prevention for some people.

TI  - The relationship between the response to external light stimulation and
      behavioral states in the human fetus: how it differs from vibroacoustic
      stimulation.
PG  - 153-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of external light stimulation on fetal
      behavioral states and know the difference from those of vibroacoustic
      stimulation. METHODS: A flashlight and a vibroacoustic stimulator was applied
      directly on the maternal abdomen to determine the response of 56 normal fetuses
      at 36-40 weeks gestation. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and body movements were recorded
      using an actocardiograph, and fetal eye movements were observed using real-time
      ultrasonography. Using Nijhuis's criteria, the fetal behavioral states (1F-4F)
      were determined. FHR acceleration was considered a fetal response to the
      stimulations. RESULTS: The lag time between stimulation and fetal response was
      within 4 s. A positive response rate to the light stimulation was higher at
      behavioral states 2F (82%) and 3F (83%) than at state 1F (4%). Light stimulation 
      changed the behavioral state of two of the six 3F fetuses (33%) from 3F to 4F. No
      change of state was observed in fetuses that were in states 1F and 2F. For
      vibroacoustic stimulation, fetal response was 100% positive and changes of states
      were observed frequently irrespective of the behavioral state before the
      stimulation. CONCLUSION: Fetal response to light stimulation is closely connected
      to fetal behavioral states and may reflect some distinct stages of the
      sleep-wakefulness cycle.

TI  - Sources of midsleep awakenings in childbearing women.
PG  - 386-97
AB  - Sleep disturbance is a complaint of childbearing women that has implications for 
      perinatal health. A descriptive, longitudinal study examined the numbers and
      sources of midsleep awakenings in women prior to conception and during each
      trimester of pregnancy. A secondary analysis of data from a larger study of sleep
      during childbearing was performed for subjects (n = 25) who completed sleep
      diaries across the four measurement periods. There was a two-fold increase in the
      number of awakenings from pre-conception to the third trimester of pregnancy.
      Maintenance insomnia during pregnancy follows a pattern of prevalence that can be
      characterized by trimester. The predominant source of awakening during the first 
      and third trimesters of pregnancy was due to the need to urinate. Parity and
      environmental circumstances can influence sources of awakenings. Nurses working
      with childbearing women can provide information and assistance with strategies to
      minimize or mitigate lengthy episodes of sleep disturbance.

TI  - Breastfeeding and asthma in children: findings from a West Australian study.
PG  - 5-11
AB  - The primary aim was to determine whether there was an inverse association between
      the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the development of traits associated 
      with asthma in children at age six years. A prospective cohort study of children 
      from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two
      thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal
      clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic
      regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive
      breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a
      number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking 
      in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the
      introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a
      significant (p < 0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in
      six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio inverted question
      markOR inverted question mark = 1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or
      more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the
      last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze
      within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis
      (hazard ratio inverted question markHR inverted question mark 1.22 inverted
      question mark1.03-1.43 inverted question mark); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36
      inverted question mark1.17-1.59 inverted question mark) and; (vii) positive
      reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial
      reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive 
      breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life. These
      findings are important for our understanding of the aetiology of and for the
      potential prevention of asthma in children.

TI  - Maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in pregnancy and the postpartum
      period. Postpartum-related disorders.
PG  - 95-106
AB  - During pregnancy, placenta-derived CRH increases exponentially in the plasma.
      Circulating levels of CRH-binding protein decrease considerably in the last
      trimester of pregnancy, resulting in further elevation of bioavailable plasma
      CRH. The adrenal glands during pregnancy gradually become hypertrophic because of
      the increase in ACTH, which parallels that of CRH. Thus, pregnancy is a transient
      period of relative hypercortisolism. The activation of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy has been proposed to
      function as a biological clock. In this model, the placenta is perceived as a
      stress-sensitive organ and placental CRH as a timing starter, determining a
      preterm, term, or postterm labor. During pregnancy, as well as during the
      immediate postpartum period, the hypothalamic maternal CRH secretion is
      suppressed, because of the circulating levels of cortisol. Hypothalamic CRH
      secretion normalizes within 12 weeks. This transient postpartum maternal
      hypothalamic CRH suppression, together with the steroid withdrawal that follows
      parturition, might be causally related to the mood disorders and the
      vulnerability to autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis 
      often observed during the postpartum period.

PG  - CD001139
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than a third of women experience back pain during pregnancy.
      OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review was to assess the effects of preventive
      interventions and treatments for backache in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We
      searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the
      Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of any
      treatment to reduce the incidence or severity of back pain in pregnancy, or to
      prevent back pain arising in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial
      quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN
      RESULTS: One trial of 109 women was included. This cross-over trial compared the 
      use of a special shaped pillow to fit under the woman's abdomen (Ozzlo pillow)
      with a standard pillow. Women experienced less pain in the week when they used
      the Ozzlo pillow than in the week with the standard pillow (odds ratio 0.32, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.18 to 0.58). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Specially shaped
      pillows appear to help reduce back pain in late pregnancy and improve sleep.

TI  - Interventions for influencing sleep patterns in exclusively breastfed infants.
PG  - CD000113
AB  - BACKGROUND: The difference between night and day may be reinforced in young
      babies by offering a 'focal feed' between 10pm and midnight and gradually
      lengthening the intervals between night-time feeds by a variety of other
      activities (such as nappy changing, re-swaddling and walking with the infant).
      OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using a
      structured training programme to teach exclusively breastfed infants to sleep
      through the night by eight weeks old. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane
      Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Acceptably
      controlled trials of a structured programme accentuating the difference between
      night and day compared with no intervention in first time parents of singleton
      babies, with mothers intending to exclusively breastfeed their infants for at
      least eight weeks post-partum. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was
      assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS:
      One trial involving 33 couples was included. More infants in the treatment group 
      were sleeping throughout the night by eight weeks of age than in the control
      group (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.21). REVIEWER'S
      CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence to show that first time parents using a
      structured sleeping programme can teach their babies to sleep through the night
      by eight weeks of age.

TI  - Diurnal rhythms in neurohypophysial function.
PG  - 179S-186S
AB  - The neurohypophysial hormones oxytocin and vasopressin show daily rhythms of
      secretion with elevated hormone release during the hours of sleep. This pattern
      can be modulated by ovarian steroids and alters with age. The pattern appears to 
      be due in part to the nocturnal increase in melatonin secretion, which stimulates
      hormone release in man, while being inhibitory in the rat. Pinealectomy alters
      both the 24 h pattern of neurohypophysial hormone release in the rat and the
      firing rate of magnocellular supraoptic nucleus neurones. There is also a reduced
      hormone release in response to hypovolaemia and raised plasma sodium
      concentration compared to sham operated animals, with a smaller increase in
      neuronal activity, as determined by immediate-early gene expression. The normal
      responses can be restored by nocturnal administration of melatonin. Melatonin
      also influences the neurohypophysial hormone response in the human to known
      stimuli of release, such as raised plasma osmolality, exercise and
      insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Recent studies have revealed that not only does
      the release of vasopressin and oxytocin vary over each 24 h, but the respective
      renal and pregnant uterine responses also show diurnal variations.

TI  - Effect of a neuroactive steroid infused into the cerebral ventricles of fetal
      sheep in utero using small infusion volumes.
PG  - 37-44
AB  - Placental progesterone metabolites may influence fetal behaviour during late
      gestation. We have investigated the effect of the neuroactive metabolite,
      pregnanolone, on the sleep/awake behaviour of fetal sheep. These studies can only
      be effectively performed in unanesthetized animals with chronically implanted
      leads and catheters. The relatively large internal volumes of these catheters
      raises problems for cerebroventriclear infusions. Therefore, we developed a
      device with negligible deadspace ( approximately 10 microl) consisting of a
      ventricular cannula attached to a small cap which allowed the instillation of
      microl volumes of neuroactive steroids into a cerebral ventricle of fetal sheep
      in utero. Two catheters attached to the cap allow it to be filled in a push-pull 
      configuration. The smaller internal diameter of the ventricular cannular prevents
      the solution entering the ventricle until the outflow catheter is occluded and
      solution is forced through the probe. Using this device, the infusion of
      5beta-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (pregnanolone, 1 mg), in 35%
      hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, resulted in a marked suppression of fetal
      behaviour parameters indicative of arousal, while vehicle alone did not affect
      these parameters. We conclude that neuroactive steroids can be infused into the
      cerebroventricular system of chronically catheterised fetal sheep in small
      volumes and that pregnanolone may act directly to influence fetal behaviour.

TI  - Effects of prematurity on arousal from sleep in the newborn infant.
PG  - 468-74
AB  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome has been found to be consistently
      higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants born at term.
      Failure to arouse from sleep is one possible mechanism for sudden infant death
      syndrome. This study compared the arousal responses to nasal air-jet stimulation 
      in a longitudinal study between groups of healthy preterm and term infants.
      Preterm infants (n = 9) were born at 31-35 wk gestation with normal birth weights
      for gestational age and studied on three occasions: a preterm study at 36 wk, at 
      2-3 wk post-term, and at 2-3 mo post-term. Term infants (n = 22) were born at
      37-42 wk and were studied at 2-3 wk and 2-3 mo post-term. Arousal thresholds were
      determined in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). In preterm infants,
      there was no state-related difference in arousal thresholds at either the 36 wk
      or 2-3 wk study; however, at 2-3 mo, arousal threshold was significantly greater 
      in QS than AS (p < 0.05). In contrast, in term infants, arousal thresholds were
      significantly elevated in QS compared with AS at both 2-3 wk and 2-3 mo (p <
      0.001). Arousal thresholds in AS were not different between the two groups of
      infants, with both groups of infants remaining readily arousable. However, in QS 
      at 2-3 mo, arousal thresholds were significantly lower in the preterm infants (p 
      < 0.05). This study has demonstrated that arousability is altered by gestational 
      and postnatal age. The lower arousability that characterizes QS in term infants
      regardless of age is not evident in preterm infants until 2-3 mo post-term age.

TI  - Circadian rhythms of arterial pressure: basic regulatory mechanisms and clinical 
      value.
PG  - 43-51
AB  - The circadian rhythm of arterial pressure (AP) is not a passive consequence of
      the impact of exogenous factors. Endogenous mechanisms play an important role in 
      the generation and maintenance of AP rhythm. The adaptation of the exogenous
      components of AP rhythm to the demands of the environment is modulated by the
      circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of the biologic oscillator. A neuronal
      network in the rostral hypothalamus including the suprachiasmatic nucleus is
      implicated in the generation of AP rhythm, in the modification of the rhythm
      amplitude (possibly due to homeostatic constraints), and in the regulation of its
      phase. The central sympathoexcitatory pathway to the upper thoracic cord plays a 
      crucial role in the maintenance of normal circadian AP rhythm. The circadian
      pattern of AP is influenced also by hormonal factors such as the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes, the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, opioids, and various vasoactive peptides.
      The circadian variations of AP depend on physiological state--sleep and
      wakefulness, pregnancy, work, and senescence (primary aging). In some essential
      hypertensive patients and in patients with secondary hypertension the nocturnal
      fall in AP is reduced or absent (nondippers). Target-organ damage is more
      advanced in nondippers than in dippers. The occurrence of cardiovascular events
      exhibits a prominent circadian pattern, with events more frequent in the morning 
      (06:00-12:00 h).

TI  - Effect of parity on pituitary prolactin response to metoclopramide and
      domperidone: implications for the enhancement of lactation.
PG  - 65-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The gastrointestinal motility agents metoclopramide and domperidone
      are known to increase pituitary prolactin (PRL) secretion and breast milk
      production. This study compared the effect of single doses of two strengths of
      metoclopramide and a single dose of domperidone on PRL secretion. METHODS: Ten
      nonpregnant women had baseline evaluation of serum PRL concentrations. The PRL
      concentrations were then determined after random oral administration of
      metoclopramide 10 mg, metoclopramide 5 mg, and domperidone 10 mg. Blood samples
      were drawn in the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle, at 13 time points over a
      6-hour period (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360
      minutes), with the zero time point beginning at 0800 hours. Variables such as
      weight, height, age, gravidity, parity, and oral contraceptive use were recorded.
      RESULTS: Baseline PRL concentrations showed the natural circadian rhythm.
      Metoclopramide and domperidone both caused a significant increase in PRL.
      However, PRL secretion was most influenced by parity. Nulliparous women had the
      quickest and highest PRL secretion with metoclopramide 10 mg, compared with the
      PRL response with metoclopramide 5 mg and domperidone 10 mg. Conversely,
      multiparous women had PRL secretion patterns that were equivalent between the
      medications. CONCLUSIONS: The PRL response to the medications was most influenced
      by parity. Therefore, we suggest that the medication therapy of choice for
      enhancing lactation may not be the same in all women, but may instead be
      determined by parity.
