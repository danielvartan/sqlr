TI  - The change of sleeping and lying posture of Japanese black cows after moving into
      new environment.
PG  - 1828-1832
LID - 10.5713/ajas.18.0048 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Environmental change is one of the stressful events in livestock
      production. Change in environment disturbs cow behavior and cows require several 
      days to regain a stable behavioral pattern. Sleeping posture (SP) and lying
      posture (LP) have been used as indicators for animal that are relaxed and
      well-acclimated to their environment. The aim of this study was to examine the
      time required by Japanese black cows for stabilization of SP and LP after moving 
      into new environment. METHODS: Seven pregnant Japanese black cows were used. Cows
      were moved into new tie-stall shed and their sleeping and lying posture measured 
      17 times during 35 experimental days. Both SP and LP were detected by
      accelerometer fixed on middle occipital and hip-cross, respectively. Daily total 
      time, frequency, and average bout of both SP and LP were calculated. RESULTS:
      Daily SP time was the shortest on day 1 and increased to the highest on day 3. It
      then decreased until day 9, after that stabilized about 65 min/d till the end of 
      experiment. Daily LP time changed in same manner as daily SP time. The average SP
      bout was the longest on day 1, and then decreased to stable level on day 7. On
      the other hand, the average LP bout was the shortest on day 1, and it increased
      to stable level on day 7. CONCLUSION: These results showed that pregnant Japanese
      black cows needed 1 week to stabilize their SP. However, there were different
      change patterns between the average SP and LP bout, even though the change
      pattern of daily SP and LP time were similar.

TI  - Extreme pregnancy: maternal physical activity at Everest Base Camp.
PG  - 580-585
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00146.2018 [doi]
AB  - High-altitude natives employ numerous physiological strategies to survive and
      reproduce. However, the concomitant influence of altitude and physical activity
      during pregnancy has not been studied above 3,700 m. We report a case of physical
      activity, sleep behavior, and physiological measurements on a 28-yr-old
      third-trimester pregnant native highlander (Sherpa) during ascent from 3,440 m to
      Everest Base Camp (~5,300 m) over 8 days in the Nepal Himalaya and again ~10 mo
      postpartum during a similar ascent profile. The participant engaged in 250-300
      min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day during ascent to altitude
      while pregnant, with similar volumes of moderate to vigorous physical activity
      while postpartum. There were no apparent maternal, fetal, or neonatal
      complications related to the superimposition of the large volumes of physical
      activity at altitude. This report demonstrates a rare description of physical
      activity and ascent to high altitude during pregnancy and points to novel
      questions regarding the superimposition of pregnancy, altitude, and physical
      activity in high-altitude natives.

PG  - 2095-2097
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwy089 [doi]
AB  - Ramadan is observed by 1.6 billion Muslims. In an accompanying article that uses 
      data from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Burkina Faso,
      Schoeps et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2018;187(10):2085-2092) find that exposure to
      Ramadan in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of mortality
      among children under age 5 years. Ramadan exposes observant individuals to a
      specific pattern of nutrition and other behaviors, including changes in sleep
      patterns. How these behaviors might result in child mortality is not yet
      understood, and the findings reported in this paper should be replicated in other
      settings.

TI  - Achondroplasia
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Achondroplasia is the most common cause of
      disproportionate short stature. Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening
      of the limbs, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal
      bossing and midface retrusion. In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition 
      of developmental motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed. 
      Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although craniocervical
      junction compression increases the risk of death in infancy. Additional
      complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, 
      and spinal stenosis. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by
      characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals.
      In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or atypical findings,
      identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR3 can establish the
      diagnosis. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
      may be required for increased intracranial pressure; suboccipital decompression
      as indicated for signs and symptoms of craniocervical junction compression;
      adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure, and, rarely, tracheostomy to
      correct obstructive sleep apnea; pressure-equalizing tubes for middle ear
      dysfunction; monitor and treat obesity; evaluation and treatment by an
      orthopedist if progressive bowing of the legs arises; spinal surgery may be
      needed for severe, persistent kyphosis; surgery to correct spinal stenosis in
      symptomatic adults; modification in the school and work setting to optimize
      function; educational support in socialization and school adjustment.
      Surveillance: Monitor height, weight, and head circumference in childhood using
      growth curves standardized for achondroplasia; evaluation of developmental
      milestones throughout infancy and childhood using achondroplasia-specific
      standards; baseline neuroimaging of craniocervical junction and brain in infancy;
      neurologic examinations monitoring for signs of cervical myelopathy; monitor for 
      signs and symptoms of sleep apnea; hearing evaluation as a newborn and
      tympanometric and behavioral audiometric evaluation by age approximately one
      year; monitor for middle ear problems or evidence of hearing loss in childhood;
      clinical assessment for kyphosis and bowed legs, with radiographic evaluation and
      referral to an orthopedist if necessary; in adults, clinical history and
      neurologic examination to screen for spinal stenosis every three to five years;
      discuss social adjustment at each visit with primary care provider.
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: Rear-facing car seats should be used as long as
      possible to avoid injury from motor vehicle accident. Avoid soft-back infant
      seats. Avoid activities in which there is risk of injury to the craniocervical
      junction, such as collision sports; use of a trampoline; diving from diving
      boards; vaulting in gymnastics; and hanging upside down from the knees or feet on
      playground equipment (due to risk of falling onto their head or neck). Pregnancy 
      management: Pregnant women with achondroplasia must undergo cesarean section
      delivery because of small pelvic size. GENETIC COUNSELING: Achondroplasia is
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with
      achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the
      result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of
      having another child with achondroplasia. An individual with achondroplasia who
      has a reproductive partner with average stature is at 50% risk in each pregnancy 
      of having a child with achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, the
      risk to their offspring of having average stature is 25%; of having
      achondroplasia, 50%; and of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal
      condition), 25%. If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are
      affected with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic
      counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of inheriting two
      dominant skeletal dysplasias. If the FGFR3 pathogenic variant has been identified
      in the affected parent or parents, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased 
      risk for achondroplasia is possible.

AB  - Pregnancy and lactation are metabolically challenging states, where the mother
      must supply all the energy requirements for the developing fetus and growing pups
      respectively. The aim of the current study was to characterize many aspects of
      energy homeostasis before and during pregnancy in the mouse, and to examine the
      role of voluntary activity on changes in energy expenditure during pregnancy. In 
      a secondary aim, we evaluate measures of energy homeostasis during pregnancy in
      mice that successfully reared their litter or in mice that went on to abandon
      their litter, to determine if an impairment in pregnancy-induced adaptation of
      energy homeostasis might underlie the abandonment of pups soon after birth.
      During pregnancy, food intake was increased, characterized by increased meal size
      and duration but not number of meals per day. The duration of time spent
      inactive, predicted to indicate sleep behaviour, was increased both early and
      late in pregnancy compared to pre-pregnancy levels. Increased x+y beam breaks, as
      a measure of activity increased during pregnancy and this reflected an increase
      in ambulatory behaviour in mid pregnancy and an increase in non-ambulatory
      movement in late pregnancy. Energy expenditure, as measured by indirect
      calorimetry, increased across pregnancy, likely due to the growth and development
      of fetal tissue. There was also a dramatic reduction in voluntary wheel running
      as soon as the mice became pregnant. Compared with successful pregnancies and
      lactations, pregnancies where pups were abandoned soon after birth were
      associated with reduced body weight gain and an increase in running wheel
      activity at the end of pregnancy, but no difference in food intake or energy
      expenditure. Overall, during pregnancy there are multiple adaptations to change
      energy homeostasis, resulting in partitioning of provisions of energy to the
      developing fetus and storing energy for future metabolic demands.

AB  - Bariatric patients may face specific clinical problems after surgery, and
      multidisciplinary long-term follow-up is usually provided in specialized centers.
      However, physicians, obstetricians, dieticians, nurses, clinical pharmacists,
      midwives, and physical therapists not specifically trained in bariatric medicine 
      may encounter post-bariatric patients with specific problems in their
      professional activity. This creates a growing need for dissemination of first
      level knowledge in the management of bariatric patients. Therefore, the Obesity
      Management Task Force (OMTF) of the European Association for the Study of Obesity
      (EASO) decided to produce and disseminate a document containing practical
      recommendations for the management of post-bariatric patients. The list of
      practical recommendations included in the EASO/OMTF document is reported in this 
      brief communication.

TI  - The effects of maternal risk factors during pregnancy on the onset of sleep
      difficulties in infants at 3 months old.

AB  - Sleep problems in young children are among the most common concerns reported to
      paediatricians. Sleep is thought to have important regulatory functions, and
      sleep difficulties in early childhood are linked to several psychosocial and
      physiological problems. Moreover, several prenatal factors have been found to
      influence infants' sleep. Among them, most of the studies have been focused on
      maternal prenatal depression and/or anxiety as potential risk factors for sleep
      problems in childhood, whereas other relevant psychological factors during
      pregnancy have not received as much attention. Therefore, we aimed to examine the
      effect of several psychiatric maternal risk factors during pregnancy (i.e.
      symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, alcohol use, seasonality, attention
      deficit and hyperactivity disorder and/or stressful life events) on the onset of 
      some sleep problems related to sleep quality and sleep practices in 3-month-old
      infants. We examined 1,221 cases from a population-based birth cohort, with
      subjective measures during pregnancy in mothers, and at 3 months after birth in
      the infants. The findings showed that all the maternal risk factors during
      pregnancy, except for symptoms of alcoholism and sleepiness, were related to
      sleep difficulties in infants. Interestingly, attention deficit and hyperactivity
      disorder symptomatology in mothers during pregnancy was the only variable that
      predicted more than two sleeping difficulties (i.e. long sleep-onset latency,
      co-sleeping with parents and irregular sleeping routines) at 3 months old. Our
      results highlight the relevance of maternal risk factors during pregnancy, and
      not only prenatal depression and/or anxiety, as variables to be considered when
      examining sleep difficulties in infants.

TI  - Health behaviour changes in partners of women with recent gestational diabetes: a
      phase IIa trial.
PG  - 575
LID - 10.1186/s12889-018-5490-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently demonstrated that a gestational diabetes history in
      mothers is associated with higher postpartum incident diabetes not only in
      mothers but also in fathers. In the present study, we examined changes in health 
      behaviours and cardiometabolic profiles in both mothers and partners who
      participated in a diabetes prevention program within 5 years of a gestational
      diabetes pregnancy. METHODS: Couples were enrolled into a 13-week program that
      included 5 half-day group sessions and web/telephone-based support between
      sessions. It was designed in consultation with patients and previously studied in
      mothers. We computed mean changes from baseline (95% CI) for physical activity,
      eating, and sleep measures, and cardiometabolic parameters (fasting and 2-h post 
      glucose load plasma glucose, BMI, blood pressure) in both partners and mothers.
      RESULTS: Among 59 couples enrolled, 45 partners (76%) and 47 mothers (80%)
      completed final evaluations. Baseline cardiometabolic measures averaged within
      normal limits. Similar to mothers, partners increased physical activity (+ 1645
      steps/day, 95%CI 730, 2561; accelerometer assessed moderate-to-vigorous physical 
      activity + 36.4 min/week, 95% CI 1.4, 71.4) and sleep duration (+ 0.5 h/night,
      95% CI 0.1, 0.9) and reduced the sodium-to-potassium ratio of food intake (- 0.09
      95% CI -0.19, - 0.001). No conclusive changes were observed in glucose measures
      or insulin resistance; in analyses combining mothers and partners, systolic blood
      pressure decreased (- 2.7 mmHg, 95% CI -4.4, - 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Partners and
      mothers demonstrated improved physical activity, sleep, and dietary quality.
      Baseline cardiometabolic profiles averaged at normal values and there were no
      changes in glucose or insulin resistance; some blood pressure impact was
      observed. While strategies need to be developed to attract participants at higher
      cardiometabolic risk, this study demonstrates that partners of women within 5
      years of a gestational diabetes diagnosis can be recruited and do achieve health 
      behaviour change. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02343354 (date of
      registration: January 22, 2015).

TI  - The weight of fatherhood: identifying mechanisms to explain paternal perinatal
      weight gain.
PG  - 294-311
LID - 10.1080/17437199.2018.1463166 [doi]
AB  - Men appear to gain weight during the transition to parenthood, and fathers are
      heavier than non-fathers. Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight
      trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not 
      undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific
      mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This
      review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting
      testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to
      parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven 
      mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical
      activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and
      psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects 
      of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., 'couvade syndrome') on men's body weight. 
      In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition
      to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we 
      describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three
      broad research questions to propel theoretical development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of pregnancy-associated insomnia is high. Although
      insomnia may flow from normal physiologic features of pregnancy, it may also be
      an early warning sign of a relapse, or a trigger for a relapse, of a psychiatric 
      illness. Those at risk for psychiatric illnesses may require medications as well 
      as behavioral and psychotherapeutic interventions, to prevent relapse in the
      perinatal period. Unfortunately, few reviews of psychotropics used to treat
      pregnancy-related sleep disorders exist. OBJECTIVE: We discuss issues related to 
      sleep and sleep disorders in pregnancy in the context of co-morbid psychiatric
      illness, and review the literature on the commonly-used medications (e.g.,
      benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, trazodone, and melatonin)
      for insomnia during pregnancy.

TI  - The relationship between sleep duration and fruit/vegetable intakes in UK adults:
      a cross-sectional study from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey.
PG  - e020810
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020810 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is increasing evidence to suggest an association between sleep 
      and diet. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between
      sleep duration and fruit/vegetable (FV) intakes and their associated biomarkers
      in UK adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Data from The National Diet and
      Nutrition Survey. PARTICIPANTS: 1612 adults aged 19-65 years were included,
      pregnant/breastfeeding women were excluded from the analyses. OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Sleep duration was assessed by self-report, and diet was assessed by 4-day food
      diaries, disaggregation of foods containing FV into their components was
      conducted to determine total FV intakes. Sleep duration was divided into: short
      (<7 hours/day), reference (7-8 hours/day) and long (>8 hours/day) sleep periods. 
      Multiple regression adjusting for confounders was used for analyses where sleep
      duration was the exposure and FV intakes and their associated biomarkers were the
      outcomes. Restricted cubic spline models were developed to explore potential
      non-linear associations. RESULTS: In adjusted models, long sleepers (LS) consumed
      on average 28 (95% CI -50 to -6, p=0.01) g/day less of total FV compared to
      reference sleepers (RS), whereas short sleepers (SS) consumed 24 g/day less (95% 
      CI -42 to -6, p=0.006) and had lower levels of FV biomarkers (total carotenoids, 
      beta-carotene and lycopene) compared to RS. Restricted cubic spline models showed
      that the association between sleep duration and FV intakes was non-linear
      (p<0.001) with RS having the highest intakes compared to SS and LS. The
      associations between sleep duration and plasma total carotenoids (p=0.0035),
      plasma vitamin C (p=0.009) and lycopene (p<0.001) were non-linear with RS having 
      the highest levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show a link between sleep
      duration and FV consumption. This may have important implications for lifestyle
      and behavioural change policy.

TI  - Waking up too early - the consequences of preterm birth on sleep development.
PG  - 5687-5708
LID - 10.1113/JP274950 [doi]
AB  - Good quality sleep of sufficient duration is vital for optimal physiological
      function and our health. Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired
      neurocognitive function and emotional control, and increases the risk for
      cardiometabolic diseases, obesity and cancer. Sleep develops during fetal life
      with the emergence of a recognisable pattern of sleep states in the preterm fetus
      associated with the development, maturation and connectivity within neural
      networks in the brain. Despite the physiological importance of sleep,
      surprisingly little is known about how sleep develops in individuals born
      preterm. Globally, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (<37 weeks
      gestation) each year, and these babies are at significant risk of neural injury
      and impaired brain development. This review discusses how sleep develops during
      fetal and neonatal life, how preterm birth impacts on sleep development to
      adulthood, and the factors which may contribute to impaired brain and sleep
      development, leading to altered neurocognitive, behavioural and motor
      capabilities in the infant and child. Going forward, the challenge is to identify
      specific risk factors for impaired sleep development in preterm babies to allow
      for the design of interventions that will improve the quality and quantity of
      sleep throughout life.

TI  - Exposure to different intrauterine environments: implications for telomere
      attrition in early life.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2018.1468879 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies focusing on telomere attrition in newborns and what factors
      could be involved in this issue are sparse; most reports have been in adult
      populations. Thereby, the aim of this study was to present an overview of what is
      currently known about the relationship between environmental exposure of the
      fetus during pregnancy and telomere length outcomes in early life. METHODS: The
      MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Bireme databases were searched for studies published
      until 1 June 2016. Studies that reported telomere length measurement from birth
      to age 1 year were included. RESULTS: Fifteen articles were selected that
      evaluated possible relationships between maternal smoking, hyperglycemia,
      hypertension, sleep apnea, psychological stress, folate concentration in early
      pregnancy, and radiation, in addition to small-for-gestational-age status and
      preterm birth. We found that sleep apnea, psychological stress, and folate
      concentration in early pregnancy were associated with telomere shortening in the 
      newborn. No association was found with radiation, small-for-gestational-age
      status, or preterm birth. Results for maternal smoking, hyperglycemia, and
      hypertension were conflicting, and further studies should be considered.
      CONCLUSION: The actual clinical implications of these findings have yet to be
      investigated.

AB  - There are many ways in which women experience sleep differently from men. Women
      contending with distinct sleep challenges respond differently to sleep disorders,
      as well as sleep deprivation and deficiency, and face particular health outcomes 
      as a result of poor sleep. Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the 
      biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the
      understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a
      woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep
      disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new
      research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the
      fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and
      arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions. Moreover, studies indicate
      that during times of hormonal change, women are at an increased risk for sleep
      disturbances such as poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, as well as sleep
      disorders such as OSA, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. This article reviews
      sleep changes in female subjects from neonatal life to menopause.

TI  - The Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) to Reduce Infant
      Mortality: An Outcome Evaluation From the US South, 2011 to 2014.
PG  - 815-821
LID - 10.2105/AJPH.2018.304371 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the Southern Public Health Regions'
      (Regions IV and IV) Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) to
      Reduce Infant Mortality, supported by the US Health Resources and Services
      Administration. METHODS: We examined pre-post change (2011-2014) for CoIIN
      strategies with available outcome data from vital records (early elective
      delivery, smoking) and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (safe
      sleep) as well as preterm birth and infant mortality for Regions IV and VI
      relative to all other regions. RESULTS: For most outcomes, CoIIN improvements
      were greater in Regions IV and VI than in other regions. For example, early
      elective delivery decreased by 22% versus 14% in other regions, smoking cessation
      during pregnancy increased by 7% versus 2%, and back sleep position increased by 
      5% versus 2%. Preterm birth decreased by 4%, twice that observed in other
      regions, but infant mortality reductions did not differ significantly.
      CONCLUSIONS: The CoIIN approach to public health improvement shows promise in
      accelerating progress in intermediate outcomes and preterm birth. Impact on
      infant mortality may require additional strategies and sustained efforts.

TI  - Grass greenness flush can influence breeding phenology and fertility in
      equatorial thoroughbred mares in the absence of photoperiod variation.
PG  - 919-924
LID - 10.1111/asj.12964 [doi]
AB  - Reproductive phenology is an important trait subjected to natural selection.
      Current horses in America belong to the Palearctic original populations after
      being introduced by European colonizers. Photoperiod variation is the main
      environmental factor for the adjustment of reproductive timing in horses, but is 
      absent in equatorial areas. Here we hypothesize that seasonality of green-grass
      availability may influence breeding phenology in equatorial regions. We used data
      of 929 services to mares from 2006 to 2011 in a thoroughbred equine exploitation 
      in Ecuador that experienced strong grass seasonality. Actual births could not be 
      used to infer natural phenology because they were influenced by management
      decisions. Instead, we used variations in the probability of pregnancy after a
      service as a measure of the natural tendency of mares to show breeding phenology.
      We found that although managers tended to schedule pregnancies in two periods
      within the year, mares were more prone to become pregnant after the increase in
      grass greenness that takes place at the beginning of the year (February). Our
      finding has potential applications to improve the success of services and the
      welfare of animals, by providing green-grass stimuli in the appropriate season.

PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1017/S2045796018000185 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Maternal mental disorders have been associated with the risk of
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Within the context
      of a mother-child cohort, we examined whether maternal anxiety, depression and
      sleep disorders are associated with pre-school ADHD symptoms. METHODS: The study 
      included 3634 singletons from the Italian NINFEA (Nascita e INFanzia: gli Effetti
      dell'Ambiente') cohort. Maternal doctor-diagnosed anxiety, depression and sleep
      disorders before and during pregnancy were assessed from the questionnaires
      completed during pregnancy and 6 months after delivery. Mothers rated child ADHD 
      symptoms at 4 years of age, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders. Hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-H), inattentive (ADHD-I) and total 
      ADHD scores were analysed in the models adjusted for child's gender, first-born
      status, maternal age, education, alcohol consumption and smoking during
      pregnancy. RESULTS: The total ADHD score at age 4 was associated with maternal
      lifetime anxiety (17.1% percentage difference in score compared with never; 95%
      CI 7.3-27.9%), sleep disorders (35.7%; 95% CI 10.7-66.5%) and depression (17.5%; 
      95% CI 3.2-33.8%). Similar positive associations were observed also for ADHD-H
      and ADHD-I traits, with slightly attenuated associations between maternal sleep
      disorders and child ADHD-I score, and maternal depression and both ADHD scores.
      All the estimates were enhanced when the disorders were active during pregnancy
      and attenuated for disorders active only during the pre-pregnancy period.
      CONCLUSIONS: Maternal anxiety, depression and sleep disorders are associated with
      a relative increase in the number of ADHD-H, ADHD-I and total ADHD symptoms in
      preschoolers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess satisfaction with maternity waiting home built spaces and
      features in women who are at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes
      (i.e. residential facilities that temporarily house near-term pregnant mothers
      close to healthcare facilities that provide obstetrical care). Specifically we
      wanted to answer the questions: (1) Are built spaces and features associated with
      maternity waiting home user satisfaction? (2) Can built spaces and features
      designed to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function improve maternity
      waiting home user satisfaction? And (3) Which built spaces and features are most 
      important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction? DESIGN: A cross-sectional
      study comparing satisfaction with standard and non-standard maternity waiting
      home designs. Between December 2016 and February 2017 we surveyed expectant
      mothers at two maternity waiting homes that differed in their design of built
      spaces and features. We used bivariate analyses to assess if built spaces and
      features were associated with satisfaction. We compared ratings of built spaces
      and features between the two maternity waiting homes using chi-squares and
      t-tests to assess if design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and
      function were associated with higher satisfaction. We used exploratory robust
      regression analysis to examine the relationship between built spaces and features
      and maternity waiting home satisfaction. SETTING: Two maternity waiting homes in 
      Malawi, one that incorporated non-standardized design features to improve
      hygiene, comfort, privacy, and function (Kasungu maternity waiting home) and the 
      other that had a standard maternity waiting home design (Dowa maternity waiting
      home). PARTICIPANTS: 322 expectant mothers at risk for underutilizing maternity
      waiting homes (i.e. first-time mothers and those with no pregnancy risk factors) 
      who had stayed at the Kasungu or Dowa maternity waiting homes. FINDINGS: There
      were significant differences in ratings of built spaces and features between the 
      two differently designed maternity waiting homes, with the non-standard design
      having higher ratings for: adequacy of toilets, and ratings of heating/cooling,
      air and water quality, sanitation, toilets/showers and kitchen facilities,
      building maintenance, sleep area, private storage space, comfort level, outdoor
      spaces and overall satisfaction (p=<.0001 for all). The final regression model
      showed that built spaces and features that are most important for maternity
      waiting home user satisfaction are toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety,
      building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space (R(2) = 0.28). KEY
      CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The design of maternity waiting home
      built spaces and features is associated with user satisfaction in women at risk
      for underutilizing maternity waiting homes, especially related to
      toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and
      private storage space. Improving maternity waiting home built spaces and features
      may offer a promising area for improving maternity waiting home satisfaction and 
      reducing barriers to maternity waiting home use.

      Approach to Management.

LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003335 [doi]
AB  - Among obese pregnant women, 15%-20% have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and this
      prevalence increases along with body mass index and in the presence of other
      comorbidities. Prepregnancy obesity and pregnancy-related weight gain are
      certainly risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy, but certain
      physiologic changes of pregnancy may also increase a woman's risk of developing
      or worsening OSA. While it has been shown that untreated OSA in postmenopausal
      women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic
      comorbidities, a body of literature is emerging that suggests OSA may also have
      serious implications for the health of mothers and fetuses during and after
      pregnancy. In this review, we discuss the following: pregnancy as a vulnerable
      period for the development or worsening of OSA; the associations between OSA and 
      maternal and fetal outcomes; the current screening modalities for OSA in
      pregnancy; and current recommendations regarding peripartum management of OSA.

TI  - The Collaborative IPD of Sleep and Stillbirth (Cribss): is maternal
      going-to-sleep position a risk factor for late stillbirth and does maternal sleep
      position interact with fetal vulnerability? An individual participant data
      meta-analysis study protocol.
PG  - e020323
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020323 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accumulating evidence has shown an association between maternal
      supine going-to-sleep position and stillbirth in late pregnancy. Advising women
      not to go-to-sleep on their back can potentially reduce late stillbirth rate by
      9%. However, the association between maternal right-sided going-to-sleep position
      and stillbirth is inconsistent across studies. Furthermore, individual studies
      are underpowered to investigate interactions between maternal going-to-sleep
      position and fetal vulnerability, which is potentially important for producing
      clear and tailored public health messages on safe going-to-sleep position. We
      will use individual participant data (IPD) from existing studies to assess
      whether right-side and supine going-to-sleep positions are independent risk
      factors for late stillbirth and to test the interaction between going-to-sleep
      position and fetal vulnerability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An IPD meta-analysis
      approach will be used using the Cochrane Collaboration-endorsed methodology. We
      will identify case-control and prospective cohort studies and randomised trials
      which collected maternal going-to-sleep position data and pregnancy outcome data 
      that included stillbirth. The primary outcome is stillbirth. A one stage
      procedure meta-analysis, stratified by study with adjustment of a priori
      confounders will be carried out. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The IPD meta-analysis 
      has obtained central ethics approval from the New Zealand Health and Disability
      Ethics Committee, ref: NTX/06/05/054/AM06. Individual studies should also have
      ethical approval from relevant local ethics committees. Interpretation of the
      results will be discussed with consumer representatives. Results of the study
      will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international
      conferences. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017047703.

AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is characterized by
      significant global developmental delays with moderate to severe intellectual
      disability and behavioral differences, characteristic facial features, and
      episodic hyperventilation and/or breath-holding while awake. Speech is
      significantly delayed and most individuals are nonverbal with receptive language 
      often stronger than expressive language. Other common findings are autism
      spectrum disorder symptoms, sleep disturbance, stereotypic hand movements,
      seizures, constipation, and severe myopia. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis is
      suspected on clinical findings and confirmed by identification on molecular
      genetic testing of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TCF4 or a deletion of the
      chromosome region in which TCF4 is located (18q21.2). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Developmental services for infants (physical, occupational, and
      speech therapies); individualized education plan for older children with strong
      consideration for early training in alternative means of communication;
      behavioral management strategies; possible treatment of abnormal respiratory
      pattern. Routine management of seizures, myopia, constipation, scoliosis, and
      ankle instability. Surveillance: Ongoing developmental assessments to tailor
      educational services to individual needs; regular follow up with an
      ophthalmologist to monitor for high myopia and strabismus; periodic reevaluation 
      with a clinical genetics professional regarding current information and
      recommendations. GENETIC COUNSELING: PTHS is caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4
      resulting from either a pathogenic variant in TCF4 or a deletion of the
      chromosome region in which TCF4 is located (18q21.2). Most affected individuals
      have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a 
      de novo pathogenic variant or deletion. The risk to sibs of a proband is low, but
      higher than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental
      germline mosaicism. Once the PTHS-related genetic alteration has been identified 
      in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk 
      and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

PG  - e000133
LID - 10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000133 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Qualitative interviews with mothers of babies at higher risk of sudden
      infant death syndrome (SIDS) were carried out to understand their views and
      decision-making process on the infant sleep environment and safe sleep messages. 
      Design and setting: Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted between
      February and November 2014 in deprived areas of Bristol, UK. Mothers were asked
      about their decision-making for the infant sleep environment and safe sleep
      messages including infant sleep position, co-sleeping, smoking, dummy use,
      feeding and disrupted routines. The interviews were transcribed, coded and
      thematic analysis carried out. Participants: Participants were invited based on
      an algorithm developed in a previous SIDS case control study that identified an
      increased risk of SIDS from four demographic characteristics: young maternal age,
      smoking during pregnancy, three or more children, and a measure of deprivation.
      The presence of three, or more characteristics led to being invited to take part 
      in the qualitative study. Results: Factors influencing mothers' adherence to the 
      safe sleep messages included previous experience and the credibility of the
      advice given. They described disrupted routines that led to risky scenarios with 
      a belief that occasional risks were acceptable. Where circumstances made
      following the advice more difficult they found alternative strategies to reduce
      the risk, including the use of movement monitors, regular checking and a belief
      that lighter maternal sleep in the presence of a baby was protective.
      Conclusions: Safer sleep messages should be tailored to fit with the lived
      realities of mothers, especially those at higher risk. The traditional list of
      'do's' and 'don'ts' was not well accepted by this group. Interventions that seek 
      to influence this higher-risk group should acknowledge mothers' own protective
      instincts and consider their beliefs and understanding behind the safer sleep
      messages if they are to be effective and encourage this group to change.

PG  - 32-34
LID - 10.1177/1753495X17708949 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is recent interest exploring the possible impact of sleep
      disordered breathing on the mechanisms of preeclampsia. A biomarker of
      preeclampsia, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, has come to prominence in
      recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between
      continuous positive airway pressure treatment, sleep disordered breathing and
      soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations during pregnancy. Methods: A
      38-year-old G1P0 presented at 20 + 5 weeks. She had a history of chronic
      hypertension. Sleep studies revealed she had sleep disordered breathing with an
      AHI of 7.3/h. She was commenced on continuous positive airway pressure. Soluble
      fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations and blood pressure recordings were
      taken at various points during her pregnancy. Results: She did not develop
      preeclampsia or require an escalation in her antihypertensives. Soluble fms-like 
      tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations rose 16% from a low baseline. She remained
      compliant with her continuous positive airway pressure. She progressed to birth a
      well, live, term baby. Conclusion: Continuous positive airway pressure treatment 
      controlled sleep disordered breathing in a high risk pregnant woman with chronic 
      hypertension with no increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1
      concentrations.

TI  - Perceptions, careseeking, and experiences pertaining to non-cephalic births in
      rural Sarlahi District, Nepal: a qualitative study.
PG  - 89
LID - 10.1186/s12884-018-1724-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In low-resource settings, a significant proportion of fetal,
      neonatal, and maternal deaths can be attributed to intrapartum-related
      complications. Certain risk factors, such as non-cephalic presentation, have a
      particularly high risk of complications. This qualitative study describes
      experiences around non-cephalic births and highlights existing perceptions and
      care-seeking behavior specific to non-cephalic presentation in rural Sarlahi
      District, Nepal. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 34 individuals,
      including women who recently gave birth to a non-cephalic infant and female
      decision-makers in their households. We also conducted two focus groups with
      mothers (have two or more children, with at least one child under age five) and
      two focus groups with grandmothers in the community. RESULTS: Several women
      described scenes of obstructed labor and practices like provision of unspecified 
      injections early in labor to assist with the delivery. There were reports of
      arduous care-seeking processes from primary health centers to tertiary
      facilities, and mixed quality of care among home birth attendants and
      facility-based health workers respectively. Very few women were aware of the
      fetal presentation prior to delivery, and we identified no consistent
      understanding among participants of the risks of and care strategies for
      non-cephalic births. Risk perception around non-cephalic presentation varied
      widely. Some participants were acutely aware of potential dangers, while others
      had not heard of non-cephalic birth. Many interviewees said that the position in 
      which a pregnant woman sleeps could impact the fetal position. Several
      participants had either taken or heard of medication intended to rotate the fetus
      into the correct position. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the mixed quality of
      and access to care associated with non-cephalic birth and a lack of consistent
      understanding of the risk of and care for non-cephalic births in rural Nepal. The
      high risk of the condition and the recommended tertiary care present a dilemma in
      low-resource settings; the logistical difficulties and the mixed quality of care 
      make care-seeking and referral decisions complex. While public health
      stakeholders strive to improve the quality of and access to the formal health
      system, those players must also be sensitive to the potential negative
      implications of promoting institutional care-seeking.

AB  - AIMS: To assess the implications of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on
      long-term respiratory related hospitalizations of the offspring. METHODS: A
      population-based cohort analysis including singleton pregnancies delivered
      between the years 1991 to 2014 in a tertiary referral hospital was conducted.
      Incidence of hospitalizations (up to age 18years) due to various respiratory
      diseases was compared between offspring of GDM-complicated pregnancies and
      normoglycemic pregnancies. Kaplan-Meyer curves were used to assess cumulative
      hospitalization incidence. Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for
      baseline selected confounders. RESULTS: During the study period 216,197
      deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 4.7% (n=10,184) were complicated
      by GDM. In most of the investigated respiratory diseases, no significant
      differences were found between offspring of both groups. Nonetheless, obstructive
      sleep apnea-related hospitalization rate was higher among the GDM group, an
      association which proved to be independent of potential confounders with an
      adjusted hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% CI 1.02-1.55; p=0.036). CONCLUSION:
      Gestational diabetes mellitus does not appear to be associated with long-term
      respiratory hospitalizations of the offspring other than obstructive sleep
      apnea-related hospitalizations.

      Postpartum Resolution.
PG  - 549-555
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.7042 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To measure prevalence and severity of third trimester
      obstructive sleep apnea and evaluate postpartum resolution. To assess a novel
      biomarker for screening for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy. METHODS: This
      prospective observational study was performed at Wake Forest School of Medicine
      obstetrics clinics between April 2014 and December 2015. Fractional exhaled
      nitric oxide measurements and sleep studies were obtained and compared at 32 0/7 
      to 35 6/7 weeks gestation and postpartum. Exhaled nitric oxide and risk factors
      for the development of gestational sleep apnea were evaluated for predictive
      ability independently and in screening models. RESULTS: Of 76 women enrolled, 73 
      performed valid sleep studies in pregnancy and 65 had an additional valid study 6
      to 15 weeks postpartum. Twenty-four women (37%) had gestational sleep apnea
      compared with 23 (35%) with postpartum sleep apnea (P > .99). Eight of 11 women
      (73%) retested 6 to 8 months postpartum had persistent sleep apnea. Exhaled
      nitric oxide had moderate discrimination screening for sleep apnea in pregnancy
      (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.64). A model
      utilizing exhaled nitric oxide, pregnancy-specific screening, and Mallampati
      score improved ability to identify women at risk for gestational sleep apnea
      (sensitivity = 46%, specificity = 91% and likelihood ratio = 5.11, area under
      receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Obstructive sleep
      apnea is common in the early postpartum period and often persisted at least 6
      months. Exhaled nitric oxide as a sole biomarker to screen for sleep apnea in
      pregnancy has only modest discrimination. Combined with additional parameters
      sensitivity and specificity improved. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registry:

      Female Rabbit's Brain.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2018.00106 [doi]
AB  - Clock gene oscillations are necessary for a successful pregnancy and parturition,
      but little is known about their function during lactation, a period demanding
      from the mother multiple physiological and behavioral adaptations to fulfill the 
      requirements of the offspring. First, we will focus on circadian rhythms and
      clock genes in reproductive tissues mainly in rodents. Disruption of circadian
      rhythms or proper rhythmic oscillations of clock genes provoke reproductive
      problems, as found in clock gene knockout mice. Then, we will focus mainly on the
      rabbit doe as this mammal nurses the young just once a day with circadian
      periodicity. This daily event synchronizes the behavior and the activity of
      specific brain regions critical for reproductive neuroendocrinology and maternal 
      behavior, like the preoptic area. This region shows strong rhythms of the PER1
      protein (product of the Per1 clock gene) associated with circadian nursing.
      Additionally, neuroendocrine cells related to milk production and ejections are
      also synchronized to daily nursing. A threshold of suckling is necessary to
      entrain once a day nursing; this process is independent of milk output as even
      virgin does (behaving maternally following anosmia) can display circadian nursing
      behavior. A timing motivational mechanism may regulate such behavior as
      mesolimbic dopaminergic cells are entrained by daily nursing. Finally, we will
      explore about the clinical importance of circadian rhythms. Indeed, women in
      chronic shift-work schedules show problems in their menstrual cycles and
      pregnancies and also have a high risk of preterm delivery, making this an
      important field of translational research.

TI  - Perinatal Programming of Circadian Clock-Stress Crosstalk.
PG  - 5689165
LID - 10.1155/2018/5689165 [doi]
AB  - An intact communication between circadian clocks and the stress system is
      important for maintaining physiological homeostasis under resting conditions and 
      in response to external stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for a reciprocal 
      interaction between both-from the systemic to the molecular level. Disruption of 
      this interaction by external factors such as shiftwork, jetlag, or chronic stress
      increases the risk of developing metabolic, immune, or mood disorders. From
      experiments in rodents, we know that both systems maturate during the perinatal
      period. During that time, exogenous factors such as stress or alterations in the 
      external photoperiod may critically affect-or program-physiological functions
      later in life. This developmental programming process has been attributed to
      maternal stress signals reaching the embryo, which lastingly change gene
      expression through the induction of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the well-known
      function of the adult circadian system in temporal coordination of physiology and
      behavior, the role of maternal and embryonic circadian clocks during pregnancy
      and postnatal development is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the 
      circadian-stress crosstalk at different periods of development may help to
      improve stress resistance and devise preventive and therapeutic strategies
      against chronic stress-associated disorders.

TI  - The Circadian Rhythm-Related MTNR1B Genotype, Gestational Weight Gain, and
      Postpartum Glycemic Changes.

AB  - Context: Disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep quality during pregnancy have been
      related to gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which
      affect postpartum glucose metabolism and future risk of type 2 diabetes.
      Objective: We assessed whether the circadian rhythm-related melatonin receptor 1B
      (MTNR1B) genotype was associated with 1 to 5 years of postpartum glycemic changes
      among women with a history of GDM and whether gestational weight gain modified
      such associations. Design, Settings, and Participants: The established circadian 
      rhythm-associated MTNR1B genetic variant (rs10830963) was genotyped in 1025
      Chinese women with a history of GDM. Body weight and glycemic traits, during and 
      after pregnancy, were longitudinally collected. Main Outcome Measures: The main
      outcome measure was postpartum glycemic changes. Results: We found that women
      carrying different MTNR1B genotypes showed distinct postpartum changes in 2-hour 
      oral glucose tolerance test: 0.36, 0.20, and -0.19 mM per additional copy of the 
      shorter sleep duration-related G allele in women with inadequate, adequate, and
      excessive gestational weight gain, respectively (for interaction, P = 0.028). The
      corresponding changes in fasting glucose were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.01 mM, although
      the modification effect of gestational weight gain on the genetic association was
      marginally significant (for interaction, P = 0.067). Conclusions: Our findings
      suggest that gestational weight gain may modify the circadian rhythm-related
      MTNR1B genetic variant on long-term glycemic changes, highlighting the
      significance of gestational weight management in diabetes prevention among women 
      with GDM.

TI  - Associations Among Sleep, Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference, and Risk of Type 
      2 Diabetes Among U.S. Childbearing-Age Women: National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey.
PG  - 1400-1407
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2017.6534 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women of childbearing age (18-44 years) present an important group
      for understanding sleep, but few studies have focused on this population. No
      study has investigated the associations among sleep, overweight/obesity, and risk
      of type 2 diabetes among childbearing-age women in the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: Data were from NHANES, 2005-2008.
      The study population consisted of 18-44 year old women. Pregnant women and those 
      diagnosed with sleep disorders were excluded. Sleep duration and quality were
      self-reported. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) measurements, and 
      a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed by trained NHANES
      staff. An unadjusted linear regression analysis; a second adjusted for
      demographics only (partially adjusted model); and a third adjusted for
      demographics and variables associated with overweight/obesity and diabetes (fully
      adjusted model) were computed to assess associations among sleep duration/quality
      and BMI, WC, and 2-hour OGTT. RESULTS: Total sample consisted of 2388
      childbearing-age women. Only sleep duration was significantly associated with BMI
      and WC in the unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but was no longer
      significant in the fully adjusted model. Neither sleep duration nor quality was
      significantly associated with 2-hour OGTT in any of the models. CONCLUSIONS:
      Targeting sleep duration and sleep quality alone would not likely contribute to
      significantly lower BMI, WC, or risk of type 2 diabetes in US childbearing-age
      women. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones using objective measures 
      of sleep, are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Time and sex dependent effects of magnesium sulphate on post-asphyxial seizures
      in preterm fetal sheep.
PG  - 6079-6092
LID - 10.1113/JP275627 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: We evaluated the effect of magnesium sulphate (MgSO4 ) on seizures
      induced by asphyxia in preterm fetal sheep. MgSO4 did not prevent seizures, but
      significantly reduced the total duration, number of seizures, seizure amplitude
      and average seizure burden. Saline-asphyxia male fetuses had significantly more
      seizures than female fetuses, but male fetuses showed significantly greater
      reduction in seizures during MgSO4 infusion than female fetuses. A circadian
      profile of seizure activity was observed in all fetuses, with peak seizures seen 
      around 04.00-06.00 h on the first and second days after the end of asphyxia. This
      study is the first to demonstrate that MgSO4 has utility as an anti-seizure agent
      after hypoxia-ischaemia. More information is needed about the mechanisms
      mediating the effect of MgSO4 on seizures and sexual dimorphism, and the
      influence of circadian rhythms on seizure expression. ABSTRACT: Seizures are
      common in newborns after asphyxia at birth and are often refractory to
      anti-seizure agents. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4 ) has anticonvulsant effects and
      is increasingly given to women in preterm labour for potential neuroprotection.
      There is limited information on its effects on perinatal seizures. We examined
      the hypothesis that MgSO4 infusion would reduce fetal seizures after asphyxia in 
      utero. Preterm fetal sheep at 0.7 gestation (104 days, term = 147 days) were
      given intravenous infusions of either saline (n = 14) or MgSO4 (n = 12, 160 mg
      bolus + 48 mg h(-1) infusion over 48 h). Fetuses underwent umbilical cord
      occlusion (UCO) for 25 min, 24 h after the start of infusion. The start time for 
      seizures did not differ between groups, but MgSO4 significantly reduced the total
      number of seizures (P < 0.001), peak seizure amplitude (P < 0.05) and seizure
      burden (P < 0.005). Within the saline-asphyxia group, male fetuses had
      significantly more seizures than females (P < 0.05). Within the MgSO4 -asphyxia
      group, although both sexes had fewer seizures than the saline-asphyxia group, the
      greatest effect of MgSO4 was on male fetuses, with reduced numbers of seizures (P
      < 0.001) and seizure burden (P < 0.005). Only 1 out of 6 MgSO4 males had seizures
      on the second day post-UCO compared to 5 out of 6 MgSO4 female fetuses (P =
      0.08). Finally, seizures showed a circadian profile with peak seizures between
      04.00 and 06.00 h on the first and second day post-UCO. Collectively, these
      results suggest that MgSO4 may have utility in treating perinatal seizures and
      has sexually dimorphic effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively the association between male sleep duration 
      and fecundability. DESIGN: Pregnancy Online Study (PRESTO), a Web-based
      prospective cohort study of North American couples enrolled during the
      preconception period (2013-2017). SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Male
      participants were aged >/=21 years; female participants were aged 21-45 years.
      INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): At enrollment, men reported their
      average nightly sleep duration in the previous month. Pregnancy status was
      updated on female follow-up questionnaires every 8 weeks for up to 12 months or
      until conception. Analyses were restricted to 1,176 couples who had been
      attempting to conceive for up to six cycles at enrollment. Proportional
      probabilities regression models were used to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) 
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders.
      RESULT(S): Relative to 8 hours per night of sleep, multivariable-adjusted FRs for
      <6, 6, 7, and >/=9 hours per night of sleep were 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.87), 1.06
      (95% CI 0.87-1.30), 0.97 (95% CI 0.81-1.17), and 0.73 (95% CI 0.46-1.15),
      respectively. The association between short sleep duration (<6 hours per night)
      and fecundability was similar among men not working nights or rotating shifts (FR
      0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88) and among men without a history of infertility (FR 0.62, 
      95% CI 0.44-0.87) and was stronger among fathers (FR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76).
      CONCLUSION(S): Short sleep duration in men was associated with reduced
      fecundability. Because male factor accounts for 50% of couple infertility,
      identifying modifiable determinants of infertility could provide alternatives to 
      expensive fertility workups and treatments.

TI  - Findings and methodological quality of systematic reviews focusing on acupuncture
      for pregnancy-related acute conditions.
PG  - 146-152
LID - 10.1136/acupmed-2017-011436 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Major concerns regarding the use of medication during pregnancy
      justify the need for safer interventions. Acupuncture is an emerging alternative 
      for several clinical conditions during this period. The objective of this study
      is to summarise evidence derived from systematic reviews (SRs) focusing on
      acupuncture for pregnancy-related acute conditions. METHODS: Review of SRs. A
      systematic literature search was carried out in several electronic databases,
      aiming to include all SRs assessing the effects of acupuncture for acute
      conditions during pregnancy. Methodological quality and quality of the
      publication/reporting of each SR were assessed by the application of AMSTAR
      (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) and PRISMA
      (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses),
      respectively. RESULTS: The initial search retrieved 11 492 records, of which 16
      SRs met our inclusion criteria. The average AMSTAR score was 7.3, the lowest
      score being 3 and the highest 11. The lowest PRISMA score was 12, the highest 25,
      and the average PRISMA score was 19.9. The results support the proposal that
      acupuncture might be considered an option for alleviating pain during labour, for
      correcting breech presentation, and for managing pelvic and back pain during
      pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for inducing
      labour, managing nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, improving sleep quality,
      controlling nausea and vomiting associated with Caesarean delivery, and managing 
      urinary infection. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture might be an option for alleviating
      pain during labour, for correcting breech presentation, and for managing pelvic
      and back pain during pregnancy. More studies are needed to confirm the effects of
      acupuncture for other pregnancy-related acute conditions.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 28
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) is characterized
      by young-adult onset, very slowly progressive gait and limb ataxia resulting in
      coordination and balance problems, dysarthria, ptosis, nystagmus, and
      ophthalmoparesis. In most individuals, SCA28 presents as a loss of coordination
      of lower limbs (unsteadiness, gait ataxia). Less frequently,
      ptosis/ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, or upper-limb incoordination may occur as the
      initial finding. The course of the disease is slowly progressive without
      impairment of functional autonomy even decades after onset. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING:
      Because the phenotype of SCA28 is indistinguishable from many other inherited
      disorders with SCA, the diagnosis of SCA28 is established in a proband with
      typical clinical findings by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic
      variant in AFG3L2 by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Ambulatory aids (crutches, canes, walkers); home adaptations as
      needed; physical therapy to help with tasks such as eating, dressing, walking,
      and bathing; stretching exercise for those with pyramidal involvement to avoid
      contractions and lack of comfort during sleep. Speech/ language therapy is
      helpful for those with dysarthria and swallowing difficulties as is surgery for
      severe ptosis. Prevention of secondary complications: Psychological support;
      weight control to facilitate ambulation; thickened feeds or gastrostomy feedings 
      to avoid aspiration pneumonia. Surveillance: Annual assessment to evaluate
      stability or progression of the cerebellar ataxia. Monitoring of speech and
      swallowing. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol consumption and sedatives such
      as benzodiazepines that may worsen gait ataxia and coordination. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: SCA28 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals 
      diagnosed with SCA28 have an affected parent; the proportion of cases caused by
      de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. Each child of an individual with SCA28
      has a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for
      pregnancies at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible 
      options if the pathogenic variant in the family has been identified.

TI  - Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy
      (ADNFLE) is characterized by clusters of nocturnal motor seizures, which are
      often stereotyped and brief (5 seconds to 5 minutes). They vary from simple
      arousals from sleep to dramatic, often bizarre hyperkinetic events with tonic or 
      dystonic features. Affected individuals may experience aura. Retained awareness
      during seizures is common. A minority of individuals experience daytime seizures.
      Onset ranges from infancy to adulthood. About 80% of individuals develop ADNFLE
      in the first two decades of life; mean age of onset is ten years. Clinical
      neurologic examination is normal and intellect is usually preserved, but reduced 
      intellect, psychiatric comorbidity, or cognitive deficits may occur. Within a
      family, the manifestations of the disorder may vary considerably. ADNFLE is
      lifelong but not progressive. As an individual reaches middle age, attacks may
      become milder and less frequent. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ADNFLE is
      established in a proband who has suggestive clinical findings combined with a
      family history that is positive for other affected individuals and/or by the
      identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in CHRNA4, CHRNB2, CHRNA2,
      KCNT1, DEPDC5, or CRH on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Carbamazepine is associated with remission in about 70% of
      individuals, often in relatively low doses. Individuals with ADNFLE associated
      with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu are more responsive to zonisamide 
      than carbamazepine. Resistance to AEDs, present in about 30% of affected
      individuals, requires a trial of all appropriate AEDs. Adjunctive fenofibrate
      therapy or vagal nerve stimulation may be considered for individuals resistant to
      AEDs. Surveillance: Reevaluation of EEGs at regular intervals to monitor disease 
      progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: A medical history from relatives at
      risk can identify those with ADNFLE so that treatment can be initiated promptly. 
      Pregnancy management: Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given
      antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to
      conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be
      possible. GENETIC COUNSELING: ADNFLE is inherited in an autosomal dominant
      manner. Most individuals diagnosed with ADNFLE have an affected parent. The
      proportion of cases caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown, as the
      frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly
      evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufficient. Penetrance is estimated at
      70% and the risk to each offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%;
      thus, the chance that the offspring will manifest ADNFLE is (50% x 70% =) 35%.
      Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.

TI  - Certified Nurse-Midwives' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors About Infant Safe
      Sleep.
PG  - 196-204
LID - 10.1111/jmwh.12706 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of
      certified nurse-midwives related to sudden infant death syndrome and infant safe 
      sleep. However, this population is an important and trusted source of information
      for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these
      topics with certified nurse-midwives to identify potential barriers as well as
      enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep
      education in the prenatal health care environment. METHODS: Participants in this 
      cross-sectional survey study were certified nurse-midwives who provide prenatal
      health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse-midwives
      listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333).
      RESULTS: A total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response 
      rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe
      sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two-thirds had
      positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal
      environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to
      providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated
      that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive
      attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether 
      they discussed this topic with their patients. DISCUSSION: Certified
      nurse-midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important
      that they are familiar with current evidence-based recommendations on infant safe
      sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep
      education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to
      improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep
      education in the prenatal environment.

AB  - AIM: To compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of labetalol and
      nifedipine modified release (MR) in hypertensive pregnant women. We also
      investigated the effect on the heart rate (HR) and determined the proportion of
      time spent in target. METHODS: This was an exploratory study. Women with chronic 
      hypertension taking either labetalol or nifedipine were offered 24-h ambulatory
      blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Sleep, wake and drug ingestion times were
      self-reported. An indirect response model was used to analyse the systolic BP
      (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and HR time-series; the effect of gestation and type of
      drug was evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-eight women were recruited: 24 in each group. 
      There was no difference in clinical characteristics. In women taking nifedipine
      there was a positive association between the dose of nifedipine and pre-dose BP
      p=.002, this was not present in the labetalol group. There was a difference
      between the drug effects on both the SBP and DBP time-series (p=.014). In
      comparison to labetalol, there was less variation in day time BP in those women
      prescribed nifedipine. Women on labetalol spent a larger proportion of time with 
      their DBP below target (<80mmHg). The HR dynamics were qualitatively different, a
      stimulatory effect was found with nifedipine compared to an inhibitory effect
      with labetalol. CONCLUSION: There are significant and important differences
      between the BP lowering effects of nifedipine and labetalol. A large randomised
      control trial is required to investigate the relationship between BP variability 
      and time in target on pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in pregnancy, but there
      are limited data on predictors. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to
      develop predictive models of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy. STUDY
      DESIGN: Nulliparous women completed validated questionnaires to assess for
      symptoms related to snoring, fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and
      restless leg syndrome. The questionnaires included questions regarding the timing
      of sleep and sleep duration, work schedules (eg, shift work, night work), sleep
      positions, and previously diagnosed sleep disorders. Frequent snoring was defined
      as self-reported snoring >/=3 days per week. Participants underwent in-home
      portable sleep studies for sleep-disordered breathing assessment in early (6-15
      weeks gestation) and mid pregnancy (22-31 weeks gestation). Sleep-disordered
      breathing was characterized by an apnea hypopnea index that included all apneas, 
      plus hypopneas with >/=3% oxygen desaturation. For primary analyses, an apnea
      hypopnea index >/=5 events per hour was used to define sleep-disordered
      breathing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for predictor
      variables. Predictive ability of the logistic models was estimated with area
      under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves, along with sensitivities,
      specificities, and positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios.
      RESULTS: Among 3705 women who were enrolled, data were available for 3264 and
      2512 women in early and mid pregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence
      of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%, respectively. At each time point
      in gestation, frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, greater maternal age, body 
      mass index, neck circumference, and systolic blood pressure were associated most 
      strongly with an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Logistic
      regression models that included current age, body mass index, and frequent
      snoring predicted sleep-disordered breathing in early pregnancy, sleep-disordered
      breathing in mid pregnancy, and new onset sleep-disordered breathing in mid
      pregnancy with 10-fold cross-validated area under the
      receiver-operating-characteristic curves of 0.870, 0.838, and 0.809. We provide a
      supplement with expanded tables, integrated predictiveness, classification
      curves, and an predicted probability calculator. CONCLUSION: Among nulliparous
      pregnant women, logistic regression models with just 3 variables (ie, age, body
      mass index, and frequent snoring) achieved good prediction of prevalent and
      incident sleep-disordered breathing. These results can help with screening for
      sleep-disordered breathing in the clinical setting and for future clinical
      treatment trials.

AB  - The article presents analysis of application of time budget by contingent of
      female students-artists of different courses. The purpose of study is to
      investigate life-style and health indices of female students-artists. The study
      tasks included to determine time spending for various kinds of activity of female
      students, to analyze certain health indices of female artists and to substantiate
      activities related to health promotion of this contingent. The applied methods
      included analysis of publications, analysis of temporarily disability
      certificates, questionnaire survey, health indices testing. The study carried out
      in the Gzhelskii state university and covered female students of I--III courses. 
      The greatest percentage in the time budget structure takes sleep (29.8%), though 
      at I and II courses female students sleep less that standard requires. The study 
      established an insufficient motion activity of female artists resulting in
      immunity decreasing and cold diseases that made up to 86.3% in the structure of
      morbidity. Certain health indices (breath holding at breathing in and breathing
      out, wrist dynamometry) in female students-artists are worse than in female
      students of other professions. The preparation of female artists to future
      child-bearing and efficient professional activity it is necessary to implement
      health-preserving technologies and mass physical culture and sport activities
      during out-learning period.

AB  - Maternal perinatal depression exerts pervasive effects on the developing brain,
      as evidenced by electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns that differ between
      children of women who do and do not meet DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria. However,
      little research has examined if the same EEG pattern of right-frontal alpha
      asymmetry exists in newborns and thus originates in utero independent of
      postnatal influences, and if depressive symptoms are associated with this neural 
      signature. Utilizing 125-lead EEG (n=18), this study considered clinician-rated
      maternal prenatal depressive symptoms in relation to newborn EEG. Maternal
      depressive symptomatology was associated with greater relative right-frontal
      alpha asymmetry during quiet sleep. These results suggest that even subclinical
      levels of maternal depression may influence infant brain development, and further
      support the role of the prenatal environment in shaping children's future
      neurobehavioral trajectories.

TI  - Evaluation of a Crib Distribution and Safe Sleep Educational Program to Reduce
      Risk of Sleep-Related Infant Death.

AB  - To increase access to safe infant sleep surfaces and reduce risk of sleep-related
      infant deaths, the Georgia Department of Public Health implemented a portable
      crib distribution and safe sleep educational program. The aim of this evaluation 
      was to compare parental knowledge and practices related to infant sleep before
      and after receipt of the safe sleep educational program and crib. A prospective, 
      matched pre- and post-test cohort design with a follow-up survey was utilized to 
      evaluate changes in knowledge and practices. Female participants were recruited
      through the county health department and met the following criteria: (1) between 
      32 and 40 weeks pregnant or within 3 months postpartum, and (2) demonstrated
      financial need. Participants completed a survey prior to the start of a group
      educational program and upon program completion. For those who agreed, a
      follow-up phone survey was conducted approximately 10 weeks after program
      completion or after the infant's birth. McNemar's Chi square tests were conducted
      to detect significant differences between specific items on pre-test, post-test, 
      and follow-up surveys, and paired sample t tests were conducted to compare
      differences in knowledge and practice scores. A total of 132 participants
      completed matched pre- and post-test surveys and 76 completed follow-up surveys. 
      Knowledge of recommendations regarding position, surface, environment, smoking,
      breastfeeding, and pacifier use increased significantly between pre- and
      post-test, with most participants maintaining knowledge at follow-up. The
      proportion of recommended practices also increased significantly. A group-based
      safe sleep educational program can be effective in reducing risky infant sleep
      practices.

TI  - POLG-Related Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: POLG-related disorders comprise a continuum of
      overlapping phenotypes that were clinically defined long before their molecular
      basis was known. Most affected individuals have some, but not all, of the
      features of a given phenotype; nonetheless, the following nomenclature can assist
      the clinician in diagnosis and management. Onset of the POLG-related disorders
      ranges from infancy to late adulthood. Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), one of
      the most severe phenotypes, is characterized by childhood-onset progressive and
      ultimately severe encephalopathy with intractable epilepsy and hepatic failure.
      Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS) presents between the first few
      months of life and about age three years with developmental delay or dementia,
      lactic acidosis, and a myopathy with failure to thrive. Other findings can
      include liver failure, renal tubular acidosis, pancreatitis, cyclic vomiting, and
      hearing loss. Myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia (MEMSA) now describes
      the spectrum of disorders with epilepsy, myopathy, and ataxia without
      ophthalmoplegia. MEMSA now includes the disorders previously described as
      spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy (SCAE). The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS)
      includes the phenotypes previously referred to as mitochondrial recessive ataxia 
      syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia
      (SANDO). About 90% of persons in the ANS have ataxia and neuropathy as core
      features. Approximately two thirds develop seizures and almost one half develop
      ophthalmoplegia; clinical myopathy is rare. Autosomal recessive progressive
      external ophthalmoplegia (arPEO) is characterized by progressive weakness of the 
      extraocular eye muscles resulting in ptosis and ophthalmoparesis (or paresis of
      the extraocular muscles) without associated systemic involvement; however,
      caution is advised because many individuals with apparently isolated arPEO at the
      onset develop other manifestations of POLG-related disorders over years or
      decades. Of note, in the ANS spectrum the neuropathy commonly precedes the onset 
      of PEO by years to decades. Autosomal dominant progressive external
      ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) typically includes a generalized myopathy and often
      variable degrees of sensorineural hearing loss, axonal neuropathy, ataxia,
      depression, parkinsonism, hypogonadism, and cataracts (in what has been called
      "chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia plus," or "CPEO+").
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Establishing the diagnosis of a POLG-related disorder relies
      on clinical findings and identification of biallelic POLG pathogenic variants for
      all phenotypes except adPEO, for which identification of a heterozygous POLG
      pathogenic variant is diagnostic. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations:
      Clinical management is largely supportive and involves conventional approaches
      for associated complications including occupational, physical, and speech
      therapy; nutritional interventions; and standard respiratory support, treatment
      for liver failure and disorders of arousal and sleep, and management of seizures 
      and movement disorders. Prevention of secondary complications: Dose reductions of
      medications metabolized by hepatic enzymes to avoid toxicity. Surveillance:
      Evaluations by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers based on
      clinical findings; monitoring of liver enzymes every two to four weeks after
      introduction of any new anticonvulsant. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Valproic
      acid (Depakene((R))) and sodium divalproate (divalproex) (Depakote((R))) because 
      of the risk of precipitating and/or accelerating liver disease. GENETIC
      COUNSELING: The POLG-related disorders in the spectrum of AHS, MCHS, MEMSA, ANS, 
      and arPEO are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal dominant PEO 
      (adPEO) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. For autosomal recessive
      phenotypes: heterozygotes (carriers) are generally believed to be asymptomatic;
      the offspring of carrier parents have a 25% chance of being affected, a 50%
      chance of being carriers, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not carriers; 
      carrier testing for at-risk family members is possible if the pathogenic variants
      in the family are known. For the autosomal dominant phenotype: most affected
      individuals have an affected parent; each child of an affected individual has a
      50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. For pregnancies at increased
      risk for all phenotypes, prenatal diagnosis is possible if the pathogenic
      variant(s) in the family are known.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of RLS in pregnancy is higher when compared with the
      general population however it remains unknown among indigenous black Africans.
      Available data indicate that RLS is uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa. We embarked
      on this study to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in an
      antenatal clinic sample of Nigerian pregnant women compared with a primary care
      sample of non-pregnant women. METHODS: A total of 310 pregnant women and
      non-pregnant women filled out a questionnaire which incorporated the 2014 minimal
      criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Demographic and
      clinical data, including sleep duration and samples for blood hemoglobin
      concentration and urinalysis were obtained. RESULTS: The mean ages of the
      pregnant and non-pregnant women were 24.9 +/- 5.6 years and 23.6 + 5.4 years,
      respectively (p = 0.003). There was no case of RLS found among pregnant women
      while five (1.6%) of the non-pregnant women fulfilled the criteria for RLS.
      Overall, the prevalence report of RLS symptoms was associated with lower mean
      habitual nocturnal sleep duration (p < 0.05) coffee (p = 0.013) and kola nut
      (0.023) consumption, report of leg cramps (p < 0.001) and proteinuria (p =
      0.047), Report of leg cramps and proteinuria were independently associated with
      RLS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of restless legs syndrome is low among women of
      child-bearing age in the Nigerian population and may be lower in pregnancy.
      Report of leg cramps and proteinuria are independently associated with RLS.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the association of sleep duration and quality at 12
      months and myopia at 3 years. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: The Growing Up in
      Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort recruited pregnant women 
      at 2 major public maternity hospitals (n = 1236). We included 376 children of
      Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnicity who had completed caregiver questionnaires
      on the child's sleep at 12 months of age [Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire
      (BISQ)] and also completed cycloplegic autorefraction and eye axial length (AL)
      measurement at 3 years of age. Data on total sleep duration and number of night
      wakings were collected by BISQ. Univariable and multivariable regression models
      adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, parental myopia,
      maternal education level, outdoor time, near work, and height) were used.
      RESULTS: Thirteen (3.5%) participants were myopic and mean spherical equivalent
      (SE) was 0.89 diopters (D) (SD 0.88) at 3 years. Total sleep duration and number 
      of night wakings at 12 months were not associated with SE at 3 years (P > 0.05). 
      The total sleep duration (P = 0.07) and number of night wakings (P = 0.49) were
      not associated with AL in the multivariate model. Total sleep duration in tertile
      2 was not associated with AL (P = 0.11) compared with tertile 1. Only total sleep
      duration in tertile 3 was associated with longer AL (P = 0.006), but there was no
      association with SE. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep duration and quality at 12 months of age 
      were not associated with refractive error at 3 years.

TI  - Resting Heart Rate Variability and the Effects of Biofeedback Intervention in
      Women with Low-Risk Pregnancy and Prenatal Childbirth Fear.
PG  - 113-121
LID - 10.1007/s10484-018-9389-1 [doi]
AB  - Anxiety about labor in women at the end of pregnancy sometimes reaches levels
      that are clinically concerning. We investigated whether low-risk pregnant women
      with childbirth fear during the last trimester demonstrate specific findings with
      regard to resting heart rate variability (HRV) and examined whether HRV
      biofeedback can reduce this fear and alter resting HRV. We measured the levels of
      childbirth fear (Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire, W-DEQ) and
      resting HRV indexes in 97 low-risk pregnant women in their 32nd-34th week of
      gestation and advised women with W-DEQ scores of >/= 66 (n = 40) to practice HRV 
      biofeedback (StressEraser) at home. We then reassessed these measures 3-4 weeks
      later in the 36th-37th week of gestation regardless of whether the women
      practiced the method. We found that childbirth fear had no significant effect on 
      resting HRV indexes when the W-DEQ cutoff was conventionally set at >/= 66.
      However, women with W-DEQ scores of >/= 90 (n = 5) had a significantly lower
      high-frequency power than their counterparts (p = 0.028). The W-DEQ scores
      reduced significantly in women who performed HRV biofeedback (n = 18, p < 0.001),
      but there was no change in those who did not perform the method (n = 20). These
      findings suggested that very high W-DEQ scores (>/= 90), but not the conventional
      criteria (W-DEQ score >/= 66), of the fear of childbirth were associated with low
      parasympathetic activity among low-risk pregnant women and that HRV biofeedback
      intervention can effectively decrease the fear of childbirth in these women.

TI  - Opioid-related genetic polymorphisms do not influence postoperative opioid
      requirement: A prospective observational study.
PG  - 496-504
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0000000000000793 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the various factors that may influence the pharmacological
      response to opioids, genetic polymorphisms [single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNP)] have generated some interest. OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence on
      morphine dose requirements and adverse events in the postoperative period of four
      SNP [opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1
      (ABCB1) ex-21 and ex-26, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT)] in candidate genes 
      involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. DESIGN: A single
      centre prospective study. SETTING: University Hospital, Paris, France, from 2
      January 2007 to 15 November 2011. PATIENTS: A total of 438 white adults scheduled
      for major orthopaedic surgery (spine, hip and knee) under general anaesthesia.
      The main exclusion criteria were receiving opioids for chronic pain, nonopioid
      drugs within 2 days prior to surgery, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, sleep
      apnoea obstruction syndrome, morbid obesity, severe hepatic impairment, cognitive
      dysfunction. INTERVENTIONS: Assays of plasma concentrations of morphine and
      metabolites (morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine 6-glucuronide) were performed
      and common polymorphisms in four candidate genes [OPRM1 A118G rs1799971;
      P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) T3435C (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582); COMT Val 158 
      Met (rs4680)] were analysed.Morphine was titrated by staff in the postanaesthesia
      care unit (PACU) and in the ward patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was
      used for 24 h. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The dose of morphine required to achieve
      pain relief and the influence of SNP in genes involved in morphine
      pharmacodynamics and kinetics on morphine dose requirements. Secondary endpoints 
      were the concentrations of morphine, morphine 6-glucuronide and morphine
      3-gluguronide, the proportion of patients requiring a rescue analgesic and the
      proportion of morphine-related adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 404 patients
      completed the study to final analysis. The mean +/- SD morphine dose to achieve
      pain relief was 15.8 +/- 8.8 mg in the PACU and 22.7 +/- 18.6 mg during
      patient-controlled intravenous administration. Morphine-related adverse events
      were observed in 37%. There was no relationship between any genetic polymorphisms
      and morphine dose, morphine 3-gluguronide and morphine 6-glucuronide
      concentration, morphine-related adverse events or pain level. In the PACU only,
      P-glycoprotein polymorphisms (ex-21; ex-26) were significantly associated with
      morphine concentration but the prediction of the model was poor (R = 0.04)
      CONCLUSION: No major relationship has been demonstrated between SNP of OPRM1,
      ABCB1, COMT and morphine requirement, pain level or adverse effects in the
      postoperative period. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00822549 (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

TI  - ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a
      clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been
      delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of
      childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and 
      sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have
      intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of
      these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia
      over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural
      instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an
      adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic
      stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial
      appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second
      episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals
      have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety,
      depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 
      years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 
      months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most
      frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic
      neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia,
      quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can 
      last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with
      sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits 
      including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism,
      and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those
      affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement
      disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic
      atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of
      ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset
      is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve;
      progression of sensory losses and severity vary. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis of 
      an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the
      clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of 
      a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure
      disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP
      for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy
      tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor
      dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate 
      or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with
      benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard
      pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for
      developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: 
      Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic
      diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in
      individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be
      avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present,
      physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance.
      Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP
      and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP).
      Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever,
      psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers
      including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g.,
      bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure
      (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes);
      missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular
      sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness,
      pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for 
      the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is
      small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure
      to antiepileptic medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse
      outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated 
      with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks 
      and benefits of using a given antiepileptic medication during pregnancy should
      ideally take place before conception. GENETIC COUNSELING: ATP1A3-related
      neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3
      pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial
      reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC,
      pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and
      CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed.
      Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% 
      chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for
      pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the
      family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known
      ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong
      asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have
      been reported in families with RDP.

TI  - Correlates and Predictors of New Mothers' Responses to Postpartum Thoughts of
      Accidental and Intentional Harm and Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms.
PG  - 437-453
LID - 10.1017/S1352465817000765 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unwanted, intrusive thoughts of infant-related harm are a normal,
      albeit distressing experience for most new mothers. The occurrence of these
      thoughts can represent a risk factor for the development of obsessive compulsive 
      disorder (OCD). As the early postpartum period represents a time of increased
      risk for OCD development, the transition to parenthood provides a unique
      opportunity to better understand OCD development. AIMS: The purpose of this study
      was to assess components of cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of
      postpartum OCD in relation to new mothers' thoughts of infant-related harm.
      METHOD: English-speaking pregnant women (n = 100) participated. Questionnaires
      were completed at approximately 36 weeks of gestation, and at 4 and 12 weeks
      postpartum. An interview to assess postpartum harm thoughts was administered at 4
      and 12 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires assessed OC symptoms, OC-related beliefs,
      fatigue, sleep difficulties and negative mood. RESULTS: Prenatal OC-related
      beliefs predicted postpartum OC symptoms, as well as harm thought characteristics
      and behavioural responses to harm thoughts. The severity of behavioural responses
      to early postpartum harm thoughts did not predict later postpartum OC symptoms,
      but did predict frequency and time occupation of accidental harm thoughts, and
      interference in parenting by intentional harm thoughts. Strong relationships
      between OC symptoms and harm thought characteristics, and concurrent sleep
      difficulties, negative mood and fatigue were also found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings
      provide support for cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of postpartum OCD
      and emphasize the importance of maternal sleep, fatigue and negative mood in the 
      relationship between OC-related beliefs and maternal cognitive and behavioural
      responses to postpartum harm thoughts.

TI  - Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Therapy in Gestational Diabetes With
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 327-336

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with gestational
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study assessed the effects of continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP) in obese pregnant females with GDM and OSA. METHODS: A
      randomized controlled trial was conducted (April 2014 - June 2016). Obese females
      at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and with diet-controlled GDM were screened for OSA.
      Those with OSA were randomly assigned to receive 2 weeks nightly CPAP or be part 
      of a waitlist control group. After 2 weeks, all patients were offered CPAP. The
      primary outcome was glucose metabolism, obtained from an oral meal tolerance test
      (MTT) at baseline and 2 weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were collected. RESULTS:
      Eighteen patients were randomized to CPAP and 18 to control groups. There were no
      significant changes between groups in fasting glucose, glucose response to MTT,
      and insulin sensitivity or secretion after 2 weeks. Those adherent to CPAP had
      significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .016) compared to the control
      group. When a counterfactual instrumental variable approach was applied to deal
      with nonadherence, the CPAP group had significantly improved insulin secretion (P
      = .002) and insulin sensitivity (P = .015). Lower rates of preterm delivery (P = 
      .002), unplanned cesarean section (P = .005), and neonatal intensive care unit
      admissions (P < .001) were observed among those who used CPAP longer than 2
      weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks of CPAP in females with GDM and OSA did not result 
      in improved glucose levels, but insulin secretion improved in those adherent to
      CPAP. Continued CPAP use was possibly associated with improved pregnancy
      outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; Title:

TI  - The intrapartum and perinatal risks of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy: a
      systematic review and metaanalysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE DATA: Sleep-disordered breathing is an increasingly common condition in
      nonobstetric populations and is associated with significant morbidity. The
      incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy is unknown, and it is likely
      that many cases go undiagnosed. STUDY: A systematic review and metaanalysis was
      undertaken to determine whether pregnant women who receive a diagnosis of
      sleep-disordered breathing are more likely to have adverse intrapartum and
      perinatal outcomes compared with control subjects. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS 
      METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl databases were searched for full-text
      publications in English of sleep-disordered breathing and human pregnancy up to
      June 2017. Only studies that reported on sleep-disordered breathing in relation
      to gestational age or birthweight at delivery, preterm birth, mode of delivery,
      cord pH, Apgar score, nursery admission, stillbirth or perinatal death, meconium 
      at delivery, or wound complications were included. RESULTS: A total of 1576
      results were identified; 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Women with
      sleep-disordered breathing were older (mean difference, 1.66; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.04-2.28) and had a higher body mass index (mean difference, 3.31; 95%
      confidence interval, 2.30-4.32) than those who did not. Maternal sleep-disordered
      breathing was associated significantly with preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation;
      odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.31) and low birthweight (<2500 
      g; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.78). These women were also
      less likely to have a vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.48-0.78) and to be at a higher risk of having an assisted vaginal
      delivery (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.21) or a cesarean
      delivery (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.11). The risk of both
      elective (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 - 1.76) and emergency
      cesarean (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.29) was increased. In
      addition, women with sleep-disordered breathing were at a higher risk of having
      an infant with a 5-minute Apgar score <7 (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.24-3.71), stillbirth or perinatal death (odds ratio, 2.02; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.25-3.28), and neonatal nursery admission (odds ratio,
      1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-2.61). CONCLUSION: Maternal sleep-disordered 
      breathing is associated with increased risks of adverse intrapartum and perinatal
      outcomes.

TI  - Bohring-Opitz Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS) is characterized by
      distinctive facial features and posture, growth failure, variable but usually
      severe intellectual disability, and variable anomalies. The facial features may
      include microcephaly or trigonocephaly / prominent (but not fused) metopic ridge,
      hypotonic facies with full cheeks, synophrys, glabellar and eyelid nevus flammeus
      (simplex), prominent globes, widely set eyes, palate anomalies, and micrognathia.
      The BOS posture, which is most striking in early childhood and often becomes less
      apparent with age, is characterized by flexion at the elbows with ulnar deviation
      and flexion of the wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints. Feeding difficulties in
      early childhood, including cyclic vomiting, have a significant impact on overall 
      health; feeding tends to improve with age. Seizures are common and typically
      responsive to standard epileptic medications. Minor cardiac anomalies and
      transient bradycardia and apnea may be present. Affected individuals may
      experience recurrent infections, which also tend to improve with age. Isolated
      case reports suggest that individuals with BOS are at greater risk for Wilms
      tumor than the general population, but large-scale epidemiologic studies have not
      been conducted. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Bohring-Opitz syndrome (BOS) 
      is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and/or the
      identification of a constitutional heterozygous pathogenic variant in ASXL1 by
      molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations. Cyclic
      vomiting may be managed by identification and avoidance of triggers, daily
      maintenance medication, and early abortive treatment; G-tubes or GJ-tubes may
      decrease aspiration and improve nutrition. Due to the prevalence of obstructive
      sleep apnea, polysomnography should be considered. Referral to a craniofacial
      team should be considered for those with palatal abnormalities, micrognathia, or 
      obstructive sleep apnea. Tracheostomy may be considered for those with recurrent 
      aspiration who develop secondary lung disease, or in those with severe sleep
      apnea that is not adequately treated with noninvasive pressure support (e.g.,
      CPAP, BiPAP) or surgical intervention (e.g., mandibular distraction). Standard
      management is indicated for seizures, congenital heart defects, intellectual
      disability, myopia, urinary tract infections, urinary retention, and renal
      stones. Prevention of primary manifestations. Adequate treatment of severe emesis
      can decrease hospitalizations, infectious exposures, and ascending aspiration.
      Surveillance: Renal ultrasound every three months from birth to age eight to
      screen for the development of Wilms tumor; frequent monitoring of growth and
      development; close monitoring of feeding intolerance with a gastroenterology
      specialist; regular follow up for vision optimization. Agents/circumstances to
      avoid. Triggers for vomiting should be avoided and managed with prophylactic
      antiemetics prior to the exposure. GENETIC COUNSELING: Bohring-Opitz syndrome
      (BOS) is typically the result of a de novo pathogenic variant in ASXL1. When BOS 
      results from a de novo variant, the risk to the sibs of a proband is small. No
      individuals with BOS have been reported to reproduce. Although the vast majority 
      of BOS occurs as the result of a de novo variant in ASXL1, molecular genetic
      testing can be used to evaluate a pregnancy at theoretically increased risk as a 
      result of constitutional and/or germline mosaicism for an ASXL1 pathogenic
      variant in a clinically unaffected parent.

PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/15402002.2018.1435547 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Women of childbearing age (WOCBA) may be at high risk for
      short or poor sleep. Yet few studies have focused on this population. The study
      objective was to identify individual correlates of sleep duration and quality
      among WOCBA. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 9,749 WOCBA aged 18-44 years
      from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2011-2014. METHODS: All variables were 
      self-reported. Sleep duration was dichotomized as insufficient (< 7 hr/night) or 
      adequate (>/= 7 hr/night). A composite score of sleep quality was dichotomized as
      having sleeping problems none/little or some/most/all the time. Age, ethnicity,
      level of education, household income, mood disorders, parity, geographical
      location, fruit and vegetable (FV) intake, physical activity, smoking and alcohol
      consumption were tested as correlates of sleep duration or quality using
      hierarchical logistic regression. RESULTS: Ethnicity, parity, geographical
      location and smoking were correlates of sleep duration; this model discriminated 
      56.9% of WOCBA. Ethnic minorities, WOCBA with many children, living in urban
      areas and smoking were associated with lower odds of having adequate sleep
      duration. Ethnicity, level of education, mood disorders, geographical location,
      FV intake, and alcohol consumption were correlates of sleep quality; this model
      discriminated 59.0% of WOCBA. Ethnic minorities, lower level of education, mood
      disorders, living in urban areas, low FV intake, and alcohol consumption were
      associated with lower odds of having quality sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Some WOCBA may
      be more at risk for short or poor sleep based on their demographics and health
      behaviors. This can be used to identify which WOCBA are most in need of sleep
      interventions.

      Bidirectional associations, joint effects, and sex differences.

LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.11.038 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and 
      cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex 
      differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between
      maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time.
      METHODS: The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income,
      minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and
      cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed 
      during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child
      age. RESULTS: Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for
      girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing
      problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep
      problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes
      per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher
      anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations
      were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for
      prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior 
      problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher
      cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems 
      at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later.
      CONCLUSIONS: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and
      cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations
      between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate
      generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.

TI  - Neurochemical Alterations in Sudden Unexplained Perinatal Deaths-A Review.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.3389/fped.2018.00006 [doi]
AB  - Sudden unexpected perinatal collapse is a major trauma for the parents of
      victims. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is unexpected and mysterious death
      of an apparently healthy neonate from birth till 1 year of age without any known 
      causes, even after thorough postmortem investigations. However, the incidence of 
      sudden intrauterine unexplained death syndrome (SIUDS) is seven times higher as
      compared with SIDS. This observation is approximated 40-80%. Stillbirth is
      defined as death of a fetus after 20th week of gestation or just before delivery 
      at full term without a known reason. Pakistan has the highest burden of
      stillbirth in the world. This basis of SIDS, SIUDS, and stillbirths eludes
      specialists. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors behind failure
      in control of these unexplained deaths and how research may go ahead with
      improved prospects. Animal models and physiological data demonstrate that sleep, 
      arousal, and cardiorespiratory malfunctioning are abnormal mechanisms in SIUDS
      risk factors or in newborn children who subsequently die from SIDS. This review
      focuses on insights in neuropathology and mechanisms of SIDS and SIUDS in terms
      of different receptors involved in this major perinatal demise. Several studies
      conducted in the past decade have confirmed neuropathological and neurochemical
      anomalies related to serotonin transporter, substance P, acetylcholine alpha7
      nicotine receptors, etc., in sudden unexplained fetal and infant deaths. There is
      need to focus more on research in this area to unveil the major curtain to
      neuroprotection by underlying mechanisms leading to such deaths.

TI  - NGLY1-Related Congenital Disorder of Deglycosylation
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Individuals with NGLY1-related congenital disorder of
      deglycosylation (NGLY1-CDDG) typically display a clinical tetrad of developmental
      delay / intellectual disability in the mild to profound range, hypo- or alacrima,
      elevated liver transaminases that may spontaneously resolve in childhood, and a
      complex hyperkinetic movement disorder that can include choreiform, athetoid,
      dystonic, myoclonic, action tremor, and dysmetric movements. About half of
      affected individuals will develop clinical seizures. Other findings may include
      obstructive and/or central sleep apnea, oral motor defects that affect feeding
      ability, auditory neuropathy, constipation, scoliosis, and peripheral neuropathy.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of NGLY1-CDDG is established in a proband by the
      identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in NGLY1 on molecular genetic
      testing. Typical serum screening tests for congenital disorders of glycosylation 
      (i.e., analysis of serum transferrin glycoforms, N and O glycan profiling) will
      NOT reliably detect NGLY1-CDDG. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations:
      Lubricating eye drops and/or bland ointments for hypolacrima; feeding therapy
      and/or supplemental tube feeding for those with oromotor deficits and feeding
      difficulties; adequate access to water and a cool environment (including a
      cooling vest for those who live in hot climates) for hypohydrosis; vitamin D
      supplementation for those with vitamin D deficiency; evaluation by a
      developmental pediatrician and supportive therapies for developmental and
      cognitive issues; standard treatment for hearing loss, sleep apnea, constipation,
      scoliosis, and seizure disorder; consideration of referral to a hematologist for 
      abnormal hematologic studies; consideration of referral to a gastroenterologist
      for elevated liver transaminases. Surveillance: Annual follow up by a
      pediatrician/internist, rehabilitation medicine specialist, ophthalmologist,
      neurologist, and nutritionist is recommended. Periodic evaluation by a
      developmental pediatrician, gastroenterologist/hepatologist, and audiologist
      should be considered. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Hot environment in those
      with hypohydrosis. GENETIC COUNSELING: NGLY1-CDDG is inherited in an autosomal
      recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25%
      chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk
      relatives, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk, and
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible if the pathogenic variants in the 
      family are known.

TI  - Psychosomatic symptoms of the Couvade syndrome in Finnish and Polish expectant
      fathers.
PG  - 35-39
LID - 10.5603/GP.a2018.0007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of symptoms
      associated with the Couvade syndrome in two groups of men of Polish and Finnish
      nationality, and to perform a comparative analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The
      study was conducted in two groups of men (expectant fathers): 51 Poles and 40
      Finns using a self-constructed questionnaire prepared in Polish and English
      languages. The statistical analysis was performed in Micro-soft Office Excel 2010
      and Statistica 12. The Pearson's test was calculated, and the statistical
      significance level was p < 0.05. RESULTS: The most common physical symptoms
      reported by the Polish men were weight gain (78%) and gastric disorders (80%),
      whereas the Finns most frequently declared weight gain (60%). As for emotional
      symptoms, mood swings (p = 0.0001) and sleep disorders (p = 0.00004) were
      significantly more common in the Poles, whilst the Finns experienced frustration 
      (p = 0.0403) and nervousness (p = 0.01579) significantly more frequently. The
      Finnish respondents more often used profes-sional forms of preparation for
      childbirth and parenthood (p = 0.00229). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosomatic symptoms of
      the Couvade syndrome are significantly more common in Polish than in Finnish
      expectant fathers. Compared with Polish fathers, Finns significantly more
      frequently attend ante-natal classes. Ante-natal care should encompass education 
      of men as they do experience the symptoms of the Couvade syndrome during their
      wives'/partners' pregnancies.

TI  - Long QT Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac electrophysiologic
      disorder, characterized by QT prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG
      that are associated with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia 
      torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a
      syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac
      events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently
      during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to 
      ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is 
      defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a
      pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms,
      usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy
      through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. 
      Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac
      arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle
      weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7),
      hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type
      8), and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson
      syndrome. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis of LQTS is established by prolongation of 
      the QTc interval in the absence of specific conditions known to lengthen it (for 
      example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or by molecular genetic testing that identifies
      a diagnostic change (or changes) in one or more of the 15 genes known to be
      associated with LQTS - of which KCNH2 (LQT2), KCNQ1 (locus name LQT1), and SCN5A 
      (LQT3) are the most common. Approximately 20% of families meeting clinical
      diagnostic criteria for LQTS do not have detectable pathogenic variants in a
      known gene. LQTS associated with biallelic pathogenic variants or heterozygosity 
      for pathogenic variants in two different genes (i.e., digenic pathogenic
      variants) is generally associated with a more severe phenotype with longer QTc
      interval. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Beta blocker medication is the
      primary treatment for LQTS; possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillators
      (ICD) and/or left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) for those with
      beta-blocker-resistant symptoms, inability to take beta blockers, and/or history 
      of cardiac arrest. Sodium channel blockers can be useful as additional
      pharmacologic therapy for patients with a QTc interval >500 ms. Prevention of
      primary manifestations: Beta blockers are clinically indicated in all
      asymptomatic individuals meeting diagnostic criteria, including those who have a 
      pathogenic variant on molecular testing and a normal QTc interval. In general,
      ICD implantation is not indicated for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic 
      and who have not been tried on beta blocker therapy. Prophylactic ICD therapy can
      be considered for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic but suspected to be 
      at very high risk (e.g., those with >/=2 pathogenic variants on molecular
      testing). Surveillance: Regular assessment of beta blocker dose for efficacy and 
      adverse effects in all individuals with LQTS, especially children during rapid
      growth; regular periodic evaluations of ICDs for inappropriate shocks and pocket 
      or lead complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that cause further
      prolongation of the QT interval or provoke torsade de pointes; competitive sports
      / activities associated with intense physical activity and/or emotional stress
      for most individuals. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis
      and treatment is warranted in relatives at risk to prevent syncope and sudden
      death. Other: For some individuals, availability of automatic external
      defibrillators at home, at school, and in play areas. GENETIC COUNSELING: LQTS is
      typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An exception is LQTS
      associated with sensorineural deafness (known as Jervell and Lange-Nielsen
      syndrome), which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most individuals 
      diagnosed with LQTS have an affected parent. The proportion of LQTS caused by a
      de novo pathogenic variant is small. Each child of an individual with autosomal
      dominant LQTS has a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance of 
      the disorder may vary. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk and
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible once the pathogenic variant(s)
      have been identified in the family.

TI  - The prevalence of restless leg syndrome among pregnant Saudi women.
PG  - 18-23
LID - 10.4103/ajm.AJM_123_17 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common among pregnant women, but it
      has not been documented in pregnant Saudi Arabian women. The main purpose of this
      study was to estimate the extent of the prevalence of RLS and identify both the
      associated factors and the associated risk factors among pregnant Saudi women.
      Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women visiting
      obstetric clinics at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh (KAMC-Riyadh) over the
      period from June 1 to November 1, 2014. We interviewed the participants and
      collected demographic data, number of pregnancies, duration of pregnancy,
      comorbidities, and symptoms of RLS. The diagnosis of RLS is based on the four
      criteria designated by the International RLS Study Group. Results: The total
      number of participants enrolled was 517, and the mean age was 30.11 +/- 5.42
      years. The prevalence of RLS was 21.3% (110/517) (95% confidence interval [CI]:
      17.83%-25.06%). RLS symptoms were more common among women in the third trimester 
      (24.1%) compared to the second trimester (14.3%) and first trimester (13.6%), P =
      0.043. The stepwise multivariate logistic model identified insomnia (odds ratio
      [OR]: 3.6, 95% CI: 2.167-6.017, P = 0.001), and poor sleep quality (OR: 4.9, 95% 
      CI: 1.473-16.454, P = 0.010) were associated with RLS. Conclusion: RLS occurs in 
      two of ten pregnant women visiting obstetric clinics at KAMC-Riyadh and is
      strongly associated with insomnia and poor sleep quality. Studies are needed to
      explore the causality of these associations.

TI  - The relationship between general health and coping style with perceived stress in
      primigravida healthy pregnant women: Using the PATH model.
PG  - 41-54
LID - 10.1080/03630242.2018.1434587 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze relationships among general health, coping
      style, and perceived stress in healthy primigravida pregnant women. A
      cross-sectional study was conducted at public health clinics in Hamadan city,
      Iran between July and December 2015. In total, 380 pregnant women were selected
      through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using the Revised
      Prenatal Coping Inventory and General Health Questionnaire. Perceived stress was 
      assessed through an interview comprised of open-ended questions. The final PATH
      model fit well; general health (beta = 0.02) as well as anxiety and sleep
      disorders (beta = 0.03) were slightly directly associated with perceived stress, 
      and only planning-preparation was related to perceived stress through general
      health (beta = 0.09). The findings enhance the knowledge gained from previous
      perinatal stress research. General health status was directly related to stress, 
      and coping style was indirectly related to stress. Coping styles may mediate the 
      relationship between general health status and perceived stress, suggesting that 
      midwives should attempt to improve the general health of women to reduce stress
      and its consequences during pregnancy by teaching patients appropriate coping

TI  - Coffin-Lowry Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS) is usually characterized by
      severe-to-profound intellectual disability in males; less severely impaired
      individuals have been reported. Neuropsychiatric concerns can include behavioral 
      problems, loss of strength, progressive spasticity or paraplegia, sleep apnea, or
      stroke. Stimulus-induced drop attacks (SIDAs) in which unexpected tactile or
      auditory stimuli or excitement triggers a brief collapse but no loss of
      consciousness are present in approximately 20% of affected individuals. Typically
      SIDAs begin between mid-childhood and the teens. Characteristic facial features
      may be more apparent with age. Upper-extremity differences may be subtle and
      include short, soft, fleshy hands with tapered fingers as well as fleshy
      forearms. Progressive kyphoscoliosis is one of the most difficult aspects of
      long-term care. Affected females tend to have intellectual disability in the mild
      to moderate range and may also have the typical facial, hand, and skeletal
      findings noted in males. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CLS is established
      in males with the identification of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in RPS6KA3.
      The diagnosis of CLS is usually established in a female proband with
      identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RPS6KA3 by molecular
      genetic testing. Genetic mechanisms other than skewed X-chromosome inactivation
      in a heterozygous female (e.g., biallelic RPS6KA3 pathogenic variants or whole or
      partial deletion of one X chromosome in a female with an RPS6KA3 pathogenic
      variant on her other X chromosome) have been reported. Careful examination of an 
      intellectually normal female relative of an affected individual may reveal mild
      facial and/or hand manifestations. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: SIDAs
      are treated with medications such as clonazepam, valproate, selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors, or benzodiazepines; trials with different medications with
      efforts to optimize the dosage may be needed to improve outcome. Individuals who 
      experience frequent SIDAs may require use of a protective helmet or a wheelchair 
      and should be protected, if possible, from being startled. Risperidone may be of 
      benefit to individuals who display destructive or self-injurious behavior.
      Feeding difficulties, abnormal growth velocity, behavioral problems,
      kyphoscoliosis, and obesity (if present) are treated in a standard manner.
      Prevention of secondary complications: Intervention to prevent progression of
      kyphoscoliosis to the point of cardiorespiratory compromise. Surveillance:
      Periodic hearing, dental, and vision examinations; annual clinical cardiac
      examination, adding an echocardiogram every five to ten years; regular monitoring
      of the spine for progressive kyphoscoliosis. Agents/circumstances to avoid:
      Individuals who experience SIDAs should be protected as much as possible from
      being startled and/or from falls. GENETIC COUNSELING: CLS is inherited in an
      X-linked manner. Approximately 70%-80% of probands have no family history of CLS,
      and 20%-30% have more than one additional affected family member. Children of a
      woman known to be heterozygous are at 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic
      variant. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who
      inherit the pathogenic variant will be heterozygous and at high risk for at least
      some developmental delay and mild physical signs of CLS. Molecular genetic
      testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at
      increased risk are possible in families in which the pathogenic variant has been 
      identified in an affected family member.

TI  - Premature birth and circadian preference in young adulthood: evidence from two
      birth cohorts.
PG  - 555-564
LID - 10.1080/07420528.2017.1420078 [doi]
AB  - A preference for eveningness (being a "night owl") and preterm birth (<37 weeks
      of gestation) are associated with similar adversities, such as elevated blood
      pressure, impaired glucose regulation, poorer physical fitness, and lower mood.
      Yet, it remains unclear if and how preterm birth is associated with circadian
      preference. The aim of this study was to assess this association across the whole
      gestation range, using both objective and subjective measurements of circadian
      preference. Circadian preference was measured among 594 young adults (mean age
      24.3 years, SD 1.3) from two cohorts: the ESTER study and the Arvo Ylppo
      Longitudinal Study. We compared 83 participants born early preterm (<34 weeks)
      and 165 late preterm (34 to <37 weeks) with those born at term (>/=37 weeks, n = 
      346). We also compared very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) participants with
      term-born controls. We obtained objective sleep data with actigraphs that were
      worn for a mean period of 6.8 (SD 1.4) nights. Our primary outcome was sleep
      midpoint during weekdays and weekend. The sleep midpoint is the half-way time
      between falling asleep and waking up, and it represents sleep timing. We also
      investigated subjective chronotype with the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire
      (MEQ) in 688 (n = 138/221/329) ESTER participants. The MEQ consists of 19
      questions, which estimates the respondent to be of a "morning", "evening," or
      "intermediate" chronotype, based on the Morningness-Eveningness Score (MES). We
      analyzed the data from the actigraphs and the MES with three linear regression
      models, and analyzed distribution of the chronotype class with Pearson chi2.
      There were no consistent differences across the study groups in sleep midpoint.
      As compared with those born at term, the mean differences in minutes:seconds and 
      95% confidence intervals for the sleep midpoint were: early preterm weekdays
      11:47 (-8:34 to 32:08), early preterm weekend 4:14 (-19:45 to 28:13), late
      preterm weekdays -10:28 (-26:16 to 5:21), and late preterm weekend -1:29 (-20:36 
      to 17:37). There was no difference in sleep timing between VLBW-participants and 
      controls either. The distribution of chronotype in the MEQ among all participants
      was 12.4% morningness, 65.4% intermediate, and 22.2% eveningness. The
      distribution of the subjective chronotype class did not differ between the three 
      gestational age groups (p = 0.98). The linear regression models did not show any 
      influence of gestational age group or VLBW status on the MES (all p > 0.5). We
      found no consistent differences between adults born early or late preterm and
      those born at term in circadian preference. The earlier circadian preference
      previously observed in those born smallest is unlikely to extend across the whole
      range of preterm birth.

      offspring rats.

AB  - Maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) has been suggested to be associated with
      increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in both humans
      and animal models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is
      still unclear. We have recently reported that MSD at different stages of
      pregnancy impairs the emotional and cognitive functions, and suppresses
      hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) in the offspring rats. Here, we
      report that the MSD induced LTP impairment at the CA1 hippocampus of the
      offspring rats is associated with increased long-term depression (LTD) and
      reduced expression of postsynaptic GluA2-containing
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs).
      Importantly, we found that inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis by a synthetic peptide
      Tat-GluA23Y (3mumol/kg, i.p.) not only increased level of AMPARs and reduced LTD,
      but also restored LTP. Moreover, treatment with Tat-GluA23Y peptide markedly
      alleviated the MSD-induced impairments of spatial learning and memory; and
      decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring. Together, our 
      findings suggest that the MSD-induced postsynaptic AMPAR endocytosis causally
      contributes to the impairments of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, thereby
      disrupting the emotional and cognitive functions in the offspring.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a BMI-matched 
      study.
PG  - e12656
LID - 10.1111/jsr.12656 [doi]
AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing is more common in hypertensive disorders during
      pregnancy; however, most studies have not adequately accounted for the potential 
      confounding impact of obesity. This study evaluated the frequency of
      sleep-disordered breathing in women with gestational hypertension and
      pre-eclampsia compared with body mass index- and gestation-matched normotensive
      pregnant women. Women diagnosed with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia
      underwent polysomnography shortly after diagnosis. Normotensive controls body
      mass index-matched within +/-4 kg m(-2) underwent polysomnography within +/-4
      weeks of gestational age of their matched case. The mean body mass index and
      gestational age at polysomnography were successfully matched for 40 women with
      gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and 40 controls. The frequency of
      sleep-disordered breathing in the cases was 52.5% compared with 37.5% in the
      control group (P = 0.18), and the respiratory disturbance index overall did not
      differ (P = 0.20). However, more severe sleep-disordered breathing was more than 
      twice as common in women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia (35%
      versus 15%, P = 0.039). While more than half of women with a hypertensive
      disorder of pregnancy meet the clinical criteria for sleep-disordered breathing, 
      it is also very common in normotensive women of similar body mass index. This
      underscores the importance of adjusting for obesity when exploring the
      relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension in pregnancy.
      More severe degrees of sleep-disordered breathing are significantly associated
      with gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and sleep-disordered breathing
      may plausibly play a role in the pathophysiology of pregnancy hypertension in
      these women. This suggests that more severe sleep-disordered breathing is a
      potential therapeutic target for reducing the prevalence or severity of
      hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

TI  - Effect of orexin B on CYP17A1 and CYP19A3 expression and oestradiol, oestrone and
      testosterone secretion in the porcine uterus during early pregnancy and the
      oestrous cycle.
PG  - 1921-1932
LID - 10.1017/S1751731117003779 [doi]
AB  - Orexin A (OXA) and B (OXB) are hypothalamic neuropeptides identified as
      regulators of food intake, energy homoeostasis, sleep-wake cycle and arousal.
      They also create an integrative link between energy homoeostasis and
      reproduction. Although their functions in the ovaries and testes have been
      partially explored, to date, less attention has been focused on the role of the
      peptides in the uterus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      one of orexins - orexin B on oestradiol (E2), oestrone (E1) and testosterone (T) 
      secretion by porcine endometrial and myometrial slices as well as the gene
      expression of key steroidogenic enzymes responsible for steroid production
      (CYP17A1, CYP19A3) during the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle (days 10 to 11) 
      and early pregnancy (days 10 to 11, 12 to 13, 15 to 16, 27 to 28). Orexin B
      suppressed E2 secretion by endometrial slices on days 10 to 11 and 15 to 16 of
      pregnancy, and days 10 to 11 of the cycle. In the myometrium, OXB inhibited E2
      production on days 10 to 11 of pregnancy, whereas on days 12 to 13 it enhanced
      steroid output. Endometrial E1 release was potentiated by the peptide during all 
      studied periods of the cycle and pregnancy, with the exception of days 12 to 13, 
      when an inhibitory effect was observed. Myometrial secretion of E1 was increased,
      except on days 27 to 28. Testosterone secretion by endometrial slices was
      increased on days 12 to 13 and 27 to 28 of pregnancy. On days 10 to 11 of the
      cycle, T release was stimulated in response to the lowest and decreased under the
      influence of the highest dose of OXB. In the myometrium, T production was
      inhibited by OXB on days 10 to 11 of pregnancy and during the corresponding
      period of the cycle. On days 27 to 28 of pregnancy, T release was potentiated by 
      the lowest dose of OXB. Expression of both genes was modified by OXB depending on
      the period of pregnancy and the type of examined uterine tissues. Our findings
      suggest that OXB, through modulation of uterine steroidogenesis, may have a
      regulatory role in the uterus.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Numerous physiologic and anatomic changes during pregnancy
      exacerbate or unmask obstructive sleep apnea in women. Left untreated, upper
      airway flow limitation during pregnancy may lead to dire maternal and fetal
      health consequences. Areas covered: This review outlines the relationship between
      sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and 
      gestational diabetes. It also discusses the implications of SDB on fetal and
      maternal health and concludes with a review of the emerging literature of
      treatment options for SDB in pregnancy and its benefit. Expert commentary:
      Providers should screen, recognize, and treat SDB in pregnant women given its
      implicated risk on maternal and fetal health. This is particularly true in
      preeclampsia, a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality where
      SDB has been shown to add risk and severity. It is important to note that
      repetitive upper airway flow limitations in pregnancy are associated with surges 
      in nocturnal blood pressure and poor maternal and fetal outcomes, and may be just
      as detrimental as frank apneas/hypopneas. Future large, prospective, randomized
      controlled studies on the effects of CPAP are still needed. The epidemiology of
      SDB in pregnant women needs to be further studied, as well as highlighting the
      need for systematic, long-term follow ups on mother and infant health
      post-delivery.

      function in rats.
PG  - 821-830

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in pregnancy and may compromise fetal and
      even postnatal development. We developed an animal model to determine if maternal
      OSA could have lasting effects in offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were
      exposed to reduced ambient O2 from 21 to 4-5%, approximately once per minute
      [chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)] for 8 h/day during gestation days 3-19.
      Similarly handled animals exposed to ambient air served as controls (HC).
      Offspring were studied for body growth and cardiovascular function for 8
      postnatal weeks. Compared with HC, prenatal CIH led to growth restriction,
      indicated by smaller body weight and tibial length, and higher arterial blood
      pressure in both male and female offspring. Compared with same-sex HC, CIH males 
      showed abdominal obesity (greater ratio of abdominal fat weight to body weight or
      tibial length), left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (greater heart weight-to-tibial
      length ratio and LV posterior wall diastolic thickness), elevated LV
      contractility (increases in LV ejection fraction, end-systolic pressure-volume
      relations, and preload recruitable stroke work), elevated LV and arterial
      stiffness (increased end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship and arterial
      elasticity), and LV oxidative stress (greater lipid peroxide content). Compared
      with female CIH offspring, male CIH offspring had more profound changes in blood 
      pressure (BP), cardiac function, myocardial lipid peroxidase (LPO) content, and
      abdominal adiposity. Rodent prenatal CIH exposure, mimicking human maternal OSA, 
      exerts detrimental morphological and cardiovascular effects on developing
      offspring; the model may provide useful insights of OSA effects in humans. NEW & 
      NOTEWORTHY Obstructive sleep apnea is common in human pregnancy. Following
      maternal exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia, a hallmark of sleep apnea,
      both sexes of rat offspring showed growth retardation, with males being more
      vulnerable to hypertension and dysfunctional left ventricular changes. This model
      is useful to study detrimental effects of maternal obstructive sleep apnea on
      developing offspring in humans.

      parameters and sleep apnea in juvenile and adult rats.
PG  - e0191237
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0191237 [doi]
AB  - The widely used organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is often detected
      in food. CPF inhibits acetylcholinesterase and can modify muscle contractility
      and respiratory patterns. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to CPF on
      respiratory parameters and diaphragm contractility in 21- and 60-days old rats.
      Pregnant rats were exposed to oral CPF (1 or 5 mg/ kg /day: CPF-1 or CPF-5 groups
      vs vehicle: controls) from gestation onset up to weaning of the pups that were
      individually gavaged (CPF or vehicle) thereafter. Two developmental time points
      were studied: weaning (day 21) and adulthood (day 60). Whole-body plethysmography
      was used to score breathing patterns and apnea index during sleep. Then,
      diaphragm strips were dissected for the assessment of contractility and
      acetylcholinesterase activity. Results showed that the sleep apnea index was
      higher in CPF-exposed rats than in controls. In adult rats, the expiratory time
      and tidal volume were higher in CPF-exposed animals than in controls. At both
      ages, the diaphragm's amplitude of contraction and fatigability index were higher
      in the CPF-5 group, due to lower acetylcholinesterase activity. We conclude that 
      chronic exposure to CPF is associated with higher sleep apnea index and diaphragm
      contractility, and modifies respiratory patterns in sleeping juvenile and adult
      rats.

LID - 10.1002/ijgo.12446 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is a non-pharmacological option to relieve
      pregnancy-related complaints. OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise the best
      available evidence for the use of acupuncture in outpatient care. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: The MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
      databases were searched for English-language and German-language papers published
      from January 1980 to March 2017 using search terms related to pregnancy combined 
      with 'acupuncture'. SELECTION CRITERIA: Systematic reviews and randomized
      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-pharmacological treatments in unselected
      or low-risk pregnant women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Quality was assessed
      using a checklist (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and the
      Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were also performed. MAIN RESULTS:
      High-quality systematic reviews (n=5) and RCTs with low risk of bias (n=3) were
      identified. The systematic reviews were based on single studies, with small
      sample sizes, that showed a benefit of acupuncture for evening pelvic pain;
      pelvic and low-back pain; nausea; functional disability; and sleep quality.
      Contradictory results were found in the RCTs regarding cesarean delivery; time to
      delivery; spontaneous labor; fetal distress; and Apgar score. Data pooling
      emphasized the heterogeneity of results. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence to support the use
      of acupuncture for relief of pregnancy-related conditions was limited.

TI  - Working (longer than) 9 to 5: are there cardiometabolic health risks for young
      Australian workers who report longer than 38-h working weeks?
PG  - 403-412
LID - 10.1007/s00420-018-1289-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The average Australian working week in middle-aged and older workers
      exceeds government recommendations. Long working weeks are associated with poor
      health outcomes; however, the relationship between long working weeks and health 
      in young Australian workers is unknown. METHODS: Data were drawn from the 22-year
      follow-up of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study in Perth,
      Western Australia. Information was available from 873 young adults about working 
      hours per week, shift work and sleep duration. Blood samples provided measures of
      cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors. RESULTS: Almost one-third (32.8%) of young
      workers reported > 38 h working weeks. This was commonly reported in mining and
      construction industries for males; health and social assistance, mining and
      retail trade industries for females. CMR factors including increased waist
      circumference, higher fasting plasma glucose and reduced HDL cholesterol were
      associated with > 38 h working weeks. These relationships were not moderated by
      gender or by BMI for glucose and HDL cholesterol. Total sleep time was
      significantly lower in both male and female workers reporting > 38 h working
      weeks, but did not mediate the relationships seen with CMR factors. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings point to early associations between > 38 h working weeks and CMR
      risk, and highlight the potential benefit of making young employees aware of the 
      health associations with working arrangements to reduce the longer-term
      relationships seen with working hours and poor cardiometabolic health in
      population studies.

TI  - The Relationship between Autism Spectrum Disorder and Melatonin during Fetal
      Development.
LID - E198 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules23010198 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this review is to clarify the interrelationship between melatonin and 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during fetal development. ASD refers to a diverse 
      range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social deficits, impaired 
      communication, and stereotyped or repetitive behaviors. Melatonin, which is
      secreted by the pineal gland, has well-established neuroprotective and circadian 
      entraining effects. During pregnancy, the hormone crosses the placenta into the
      fetal circulation and transmits photoperiodic information to the fetus allowing
      the establishment of normal sleep patterns and circadian rhythms that are
      essential for normal neurodevelopment. Melatonin synthesis is frequently impaired
      in patients with ASD. The hormone reduces oxidative stress, which is harmful to
      the central nervous system. Therefore, the neuroprotective and circadian
      entraining roles of melatonin may reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders
      such as ASD.

TI  - Binge eating disorder and depressive symptoms among females of child-bearing age:
      the Korea Nurses' Health Study.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s12888-018-1601-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies regarding the relationship between binge eating disorder
      (BED) and depression have targeted obese populations. However, nurses,
      particularly female nurses, are one of the vocations that face these issues due
      to various reasons including high stress and shift work. This study investigated 
      the prevalence of BED and the correlation between BED and severity of
      self-reported depressive symptoms among female nurses in South Korea. METHODS:
      Participants were 7,267 female nurses, of which 502 had symptoms of BED. Using
      the propensity score matching (PSM) technique, 502 nurses with BED and 502
      without BED were included in the analyses. Data were analyzed using descriptive
      statistics, Spearman's correlation, and multivariable ordinal logistic regression
      analysis. RESULTS: The proportion of binge eating disorder was 6.90% among the
      nurses, and 81.3% of nurses displayed some levels of depressive symptoms.
      Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that age (40 years
      old and older), alcohol consumption (frequent drinkers), self-rated health, sleep
      problems, and stress were associated with self-reported depression symptoms.
      Overall, after adjusting for confounders, nurses with BED had 1.80 times the risk
      (95% CI = [1.41-2.30]; p-value < 0.001) of experiencing a greater severity of
      self-reported depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Korean female nurse showed a
      higher prevalence of both binge eating disorder and depressive symptoms, and the 
      association between the two factors was proven in the study. Therefore, hospital 
      management and health policy makers should be alarmed and agreed on both
      examining nurses on such problems and providing organized and systematic
      assistance.

TI  - PRRT2-Associated Paroxysmal Movement Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: PRRT2-associated paroxysmal movement disorders
      (PRRT2-PxMD) include paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), benign familial
      infantile epilepsy (BFIE), paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia with infantile
      convulsions (PKD/IC), and hemiplegic migraine (HM). In addition, PRRT2 pathogenic
      variants have been identified in other childhood-onset movement disorders and
      different types of seizures, suggesting that the understanding of the spectrum of
      PRRT2-PxMD is still evolving. The paroxysmal attacks in PKD are characterized by 
      dystonia, choreoathetosis, and less commonly ballismus. The seizures of BFIE are 
      usually focal with or without generalization. Thirty percent of PRRT2-associated 
      PKD is associated with BFIE and is referred to as PKD/IC. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The 
      diagnosis of PRRT2-PxMD is established in a proband who has one of the following 
      three findings on molecular genetic testing: a PRRT2 heterozygous pathogenic
      variant (~99% of affected individuals); the 16p11.2 recurrent deletion that
      includes PRRT2 (<1% of affected individuals); or biallelic PRRT2 pathogenic
      variants (<1% of affected individuals, typically those with a more severe
      phenotype). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: PKD attack frequency is
      reduced or prevented by treatment with low doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
      Avoiding stress, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and other triggers that can
      precipitate PKD episodes can help prevent attacks and can lower attack frequency.
      For BFIE, seizure frequency is decreased by therapeutic doses of AEDs; seizures
      lasting longer than five minutes or seizure clusters may respond to use of
      benzodiazepines. Seizures tend to spontaneously remit by age two years.
      Surveillance: Individuals with PKD or PKD/IC can be monitored clinically every
      one to two years, particularly with respect to evaluating medication needs and
      dosing. Individuals with BFIE are monitored clinically for seizures; AEDs are
      adjusted accordingly. Agents/circumstances to avoid: PKD: Avoid triggers known to
      precipitate attacks. Pregnancy management: Prenatal exposure to AEDs may increase
      the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the
      stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). Discussion of the risks and
      benefits of using a given AED during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to
      conception. GENETIC COUNSELING: PRRT2-PxMD caused by a heterozygous PRRT2
      pathogenic variant or, rarely, the 16p11.2 recurrent deletion (that includes
      PRRT2) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Rarely PRRT2-PxMD (typically
      associated with a more severe phenotype) is inherited in an autosomal recessive
      manner. For autosomal dominant PRRT2-PxMD: approximately 90% of pathogenic
      variants are inherited and 10% are de novo. Each child of an individual with
      PRRT2-PxMD has a 50% chance of inheriting the PRRT2 pathogenic variant. Once the 
      PRRT2 pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member,
      prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic
      diagnosis are possible; however, reduced penetrance and variable expressivity
      lead to phenotypic variability within families.

TI  - Lifestyle-Related Factors Associated with Reproductive Health in Couples Seeking 
      Fertility Treatments: Results of A Pilot Study.
PG  - 19-26
LID - 10.22074/ijfs.2018.5135 [doi]
AB  - Background: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of 
      conducting a larger prospective cohort study, which will aim at determining the
      independent contribution of male and female lifestyle-related factors to assisted
      reproductive technology (ART) success. The study also examined whether couples
      seeking fertility treatments present lifestyle-related factors that may interfere
      with their reproductive health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective pilot
      study was conducted in a fertility clinic between May 2015 and February 2016.
      Feasibility factors evaluated were recruitment rates, compliance with the
      protocol, retention rate and ART outcomes at six-month follow-up. Anthropometric 
      profile and lifestyle habits of both partners were evaluated before the beginning
      of infertility treatments. RESULTS: We approached 130 eligible infertile couples.
      Among them, 32 (25%) agreed to participate and 28 (88%) complied with the
      protocol. At six-month follow-up, seven couples (25%) did not start, or stop,
      infertility treatments and 13 couples (62%) achieved a clinical pregnancy. Among 
      the 28 couples included in the analyses, 16% of the partners were obese and 23%
      had abdominal obesity. The majority of the subjects were still drinking alcohol
      (84%). Sixty-eight percent of women needed improvement in their diet (vs. 95% of 
      men, P=0.05) and none of them achieved the Canadian recommendations for physical 
      activity (vs. 33% of men, P=0.001). Moreover, 35% of the partners had a poor
      sleep quality. Overall, women presented a worse reproductive health profile than 
      men, with 3.1 and 2.4 out of seven adverse factors, respectively (P=0.04).
      CONCLUSION: Conducting a large prospective cohort study in our fertility clinic
      will be feasible but recruitment and compliance with the protocol need to be
      improved. Many women and men seeking fertility treatments present unfavourable
      lifestyle-related factors that may explain, at least partially, their
      difficulties in conceiving.

TI  - Evaluation of a Health Education Intervention to Improve Knowledge, Skills,
      Behavioral Intentions and Resources Associated with Preventable Determinants of
      Infant Mortality.
PG  - 290-295
AB  - Mississippi has the highest rate of infant mortality in the nation (9.3 infant
      deaths for 1,000 live births). A health disparity exists between white infants
      (6.2) and black infants (13.0). This project reports on the effectiveness of a
      pilot educational program, Healthy Moms and Healthy Babies, which sought to
      improve knowledge, skills, behavioral intentions and resources related to
      preventable determinants of infant mortality. A curriculum was developed and
      piloted with women who were currently pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant or 
      who had an infant <1 year old. Local Head Start Centers offered recruiting
      assistance and meeting space for the sessions. Six content areas were developed
      which addressed pre- and postnatal nutrition and physical activity, smoking,
      breastfeeding, maternal mental health and safe infant sleep. Sixteen objectives
      were evaluated to determine intervention effectiveness. Participants were very
      satisfied with the program overall. Fourteen of sixteen objectives were met.
      Unmet objectives were gaining the skill of interpreting a nutritional label
      (Objective 75.0%, Observed 71.4%) and being able to name five health benefits of 
      breastfeeding (Objective 85.0%, Observed 81.0%). Future programs will incorporate
      participant feedback which included allowing more time to learn about
      interpreting food labels and addressing financial stress. Reducing preterm birth 
      is a national public health priority. Addressing knowledge gaps through
      risk-reduction education may reduce behaviors associated with determinants of
      infant mortality such as low birth weight and preterm birth. Head Start Centers
      are convenient locations that can serve as hubs of education for the entire
      family. Addressing knowledge gaps through risk-reduction education and providing 
      adequate resources for smoking cessation and lactation support may increase
      knowledge and skills and reduce behaviors associated with determinants of infant 
      mortality such as low birth weight and preterm birth.

TI  - Effects of sleep hygiene training given to pregnant women with restless leg
      syndrome on their sleep quality.
PG  - 527-535
LID - 10.1007/s11325-018-1619-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This research was conducted to determine the effects of sleep hygiene
      training given to pregnant women with restless leg syndrome on their sleep
      quality. METHODS: This study was conducted using a quasi-experimental design with
      pre-test and post-test, and a control group. When the power analysis was made, a 
      sample size with 5% two-sided significance, 95% confidence interval, and 95%
      ability to represent the population was calculated to have a total of 128
      pregnant women. The sleeping hygiene training was given to two sessions of the
      experiment group. A personal identification form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Index were used for the collection of data. Percentage distribution, arithmetic
      mean, standard deviation, and chi-square were used for statistical evaluation in 
      addition to dependent and independent groups t tests. RESULTS: PSQI pre-test mean
      values revealed that sleep quality in both groups was similarly poor (p = 0.353).
      It was determined that the mean post-test score after sleep hygiene training was 
      7.23 +/- 2.17 in the experiment group and 10.54 +/- 2.20 in the control group,
      while the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p =
      0.000). Accordingly, it was determined that the sleepers in the experimental
      group had better sleep quality than those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS:
      Sleep hygiene training given to pregnant women with restless leg syndrome
      increased sleep quality.

TI  - Prospective Associations Between Infant Sleep at 12 Months and Autism Spectrum
      Disorder Screening Scores at 24 Months in a Community-Based Birth Cohort.
LID - 10.4088/JCP.16m11127 [doi]
LID - 16m11127 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep problems have been associated with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) symptoms and diagnosis. However, past research has studied the simultaneous
      association of sleep problems with precursor ASD symptoms. Using data from a
      birth cohort, we estimate prospective associations between infant sleep
      characteristics at 12 months and later ASD screening scores at 24 months.
      METHODS: We obtained data from children (N = 1,096) and their mothers as
      participants in the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning 
      in Early Childhood longitudinal birth cohort study. Mothers were enrolled between
      2006 and 2011, when they were 16-26 weeks pregnant. Using linear regression, we
      examined the influence of infant sleep characteristics (nighttime and daytime
      sleep, night wakings, and sleep onset latency) at 12 months on ASD screening
      scores at 24 months while controlling for other psychosocial characteristics.
      RESULTS: The number of night wakings was the only sleep characteristic at 12
      months to be significantly associated with the development of early ASD symptoms 
      at 24 months (B = 0.097, P = .021; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.180). However, other
      competing risks, especially child socioemotional competence at 12 months (B =
      0.573, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.361 to 0.785), showed stronger relative contributions 
      in predicting ASD risk. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with more sleep problems by 12
      months, especially those waking more often during the night, showed an increased 
      number of early ASD symptoms a year later. This study suggests that infant sleep 
      characteristics could constitute one clinical sign of ASD risk, together with key
      psychosocial characteristics.

TI  - Sleep findings in Brazilian children with congenital Zika syndrome.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsy009 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: Zika virus infection during pregnancy may result in congenital 
      Zika syndrome (CZS), whose characteristics are being described. Methods: The
      present study aimed to investigate the sleep characteristics of 136
      infants/toddlers (88 with CZS and 48 with typical development (TD), age and
      gender matched, 60% girls and 40% boys in both groups) using the Brief Infant
      Sleep Questionnaire. The ages of children in both groups ranged from 5 to 24
      months (CZS 15.9 +/- 0.4 vs. TD 15.8 +/- 1.0 months, P= 0.90). Results: The
      results show that 34.1% of CZS and 2% of TD children were defined as poor
      sleepers, 15% of CZS and 2% of TD children remained awake at night for a period
      longer than 1 hour, and 24% of CZS and 2% of TD children slept less than 9 hours.
      The CZS group showed shorter total sleep time (CZS 11.24 +/- 2.6 vs. TD 12.02 +/-
      1.9 hours, P= 0.03) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration than the TD group (CZS
      8.2 +/- 0.2 vs. TD 9.4 +/- 0.2 hours, P= 0.0002). In contrast to the control
      group (P= 0.02, r= -0.34), in the CZS group, no correlation was found between age
      and nocturnal wakefulness. Future studies should explore these data in relation
      to the development and maturation of the central nervous system of these
      children. Conclusions: Considering the well-known consequences of poor sleep
      quality on health in several populations, the presence of sleep disorders should 
      be considered in CZS using multidisciplinary treatments.

BTI - Bed Sharing, Pacifier, Breastfeeding and Cot-Death -- Is There a Connection?
AB  - The rate of cot-death for Norway in 2004 was 0,4 per 1000 live births. Even with 
      such a low rate approximately 20 children die inexplicably every year.
      Co-sleeping (baby and mother in same bed) has been cited as a risk factor for
      cotdeath. Some have claimed that co-sleeping during the whole or parts of the
      night can promote successful breastfeeding. Studies have shown that the use of
      pacifier might prevent cot-death but there is concern that the use of a pacifier 
      impedes successful breastfeeding. It has also been argued that breastfeeding is a
      protective factor against cot-death. A multi-professional group conducted a
      systematic review as part of this Health Technology Assessment. Method We
      systematically searched for studies of experimental and observational design in
      the following databases: Cochrane Library, MIDIRS, Cinahl, Embase, Medline and
      Swemed, June 2004. The search was updated in February 2005. We assessed studies
      that had evaluated newborn and infants and the effect of sleeping alone or in
      parent's bed, the use of pacifier and/or breastfeeding with the outcomes
      breastfeeding rates and cot-death. The studies were critically appraised and
      included or excluded according to inclusion criteria for study design and
      methodological quality. Results The search identified more than 1000 references. 
      40 studies were included according to the inclusion criteria. Only a few studies 
      compared groups that were randomly allocated to one intervention or another. It
      is therefore difficult to determine causation. Researchers have already shown
      that there is an increased risk for cot-death with cosleeping if the mother has
      smoked during pregnancy or if parents smoke after birth, if they have drunk
      alcohol or taken sedatives. Five studies assessed the effect of co-sleeping on
      breastfeeding. They all showed that the infants that sleep in their parents' bed 
      were breast-fed more than those who slept alone. However, it is not clear if
      co-sleeping encourages breastfeeding or if it is the mothers who breastfeed who
      choose to have the babies in bed with them. Research has not shown that
      co-sleeping is a risk factor for cot-death for infants older than eight weeks. It
      is unclear if co-sleeping gives a higher risk for infants less than eight weeks
      old. The results from the eleven included studies vary, but eight do not show an 
      association. Three randomised studies showed that the use of pacifiers by infants
      probably does not influence overall breastfeeding. It is however, unclear if an
      early introduction to pacifiers interferes with breastfeeding duration. Another
      unanswered question is whether early introduction to pacifier influences the
      rates of full and partial breastfeeding. We do not know if the use of pacifier is
      a marker for breastfeeding problems or if early use of pacifier leads to less
      breastfeeding. All included studies found that the use of pacifier is associated 
      with a reduction in the risk of cot-death. However, because of limitations in the
      study design it is impossible to determine if there is causation. When looking at
      the effect of breastfeeding on cot-death we included six studies that found no
      significant association for reduced risk for breastfed infants. Seven studies
      showed that breastfeeding could protect against cot-death. It is unclear whether 
      breastfeeding protects against cot-death. Conclusion Because of limitations in
      the study designs we can not draw any firm conclusions about the factors we
      investigated. There is an increased risk for cot-death with cosleeping if the
      mother has smoked during pregnancy. It is uncertain whether there is a reduced
      risk of cot-death with breastfeeding or with the use of pacifier, if cosleeping
      encourages breastfeeding, if co-sleeping is associated with increased risk of
      cot-death for infants older than eight weeks or if the use of pacifiers
      influences overall breastfeeding. It is unclear whether co-sleeping with newborns
      less than eight weeks of age is harmful.

AB  - With rapid urbanization and life style changes, loud noise is omnipresent and has
      become a part of life. Indoor and outdoor environmental noise pollution have been
      documented as a serious health hazard with increasing adverse effects on fetus,
      infants, children, adolescents and adults. Noise induced hearing loss and
      non-auditory adverse effects due to noise pollution, are being increasingly
      diagnosed in all age groups including the fetus. Outdated motorized vehicles,
      machinery, increasing traffic, congested residential areas, crowded educational
      institutions and workplaces, unregulated commercial and industrial noise have
      become a source of noise pollution with long-term disability. Areas of noise
      pollution must be identified and corrective measures be taken. Toys, personal,
      domestic, commercial, industrial equipment should be within the safe sound
      intensity. Loudspeakers and vehicular horns should be banned except in
      emergencies. Nocturnal noise pollution must be avoided near residential areas as 
      sleep disturbances have serious long-term health consequences. Pregnant women,
      fetus, newborns, infants and children are most susceptible to noise induced
      health hazards and should be given utmost protection. Educational institutions,
      workplaces, commercial and industrial areas should be regularly monitored for
      noise levels and protective ear muffs and plugs be used. Public be educated
      repeatedly regarding health hazards of noise. Traffic noise should be regulated
      to be within safe limits. Bus-stands, railway stations and airports should be
      moved away from residential areas. Houses should be sound proofed suitably. Long 
      term studies should be conducted in pregnant women, newborn children and adults
      to have more data on hazards of noise pollution.

TI  - Sleep/Wake Behaviors in Mice During Pregnancy and Pregnancy-Associated
      Hypertensive Mice.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsx209 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: In humans and other mammals, sleep is altered during pregnancy.
      However, no studies have been conducted on sleep/wakefulness during pregnancy in 
      mice. In this study, we examined sleep/wakefulness in female C57BL/6 mice during 
      pregnancy. We also examined sleep/wake behaviors in an animal model of
      preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertensive (PAH) mice, in which increased
      angiotensin causes hypertension. Methods: Sleep/wake behaviors of female C57BL/6 
      and PAH mice were examined based on electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram 
      recordings before, during, and after pregnancy. To examine whether high blood
      pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in PAH mice, Evans
      blue dye was injected intravenously. Angiotensin II receptor blocker
      (olmesartan)-administered PAH mice and female Tsukuba hypertensive mice were also
      examined. Results: C57BL/6 mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased 
      nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time during late pregnancy. Rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy. PAH mice
      exhibited a general slowing of EEG during late pregnancy and subsequently
      returned to apparently normal sleep/wakefulness after delivery. All PAH mice
      exhibited multiple focal leakages of Evans blue dye in the brain. Spike-and-wave 
      discharges were observed in 50% of PAH mice. Olmesartan-administered PAH mice did
      not show general slowing of EEG. Tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time
      spent in wakefulness and NREM sleep and a decreased total REM sleep time.
      Conclusions: This study showed pregnant-stage-specific changes in
      sleep/wakefulness in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, PAH mice may be useful as an
      animal model for eclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify insomnia and their components in a longitudinal cohort of 
      pregnant women and factors associated with insomnia. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective 
      cohort of 486 healthy singleton pregnancies assembled before the 14th gestational
      week (February 2013 to March 2016). Insomnia data were collected
      pre-gestationally, in each trimester and six months post-partum, analysing five
      different moments. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to
      generate adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of
      determinants of insomnia in each trimester, defined using Athens Insomnia Scale
      (AIS) as score >/=8. RESULTS: Insomnia prevalence was 6.1% (3.9-8.9)
      pre-gestational, 44.2% (39.3-49.6) in first trimester (T1), 46.3% (41.9-51.3) in 
      second (T2) and 63.7% (57.7-67.8) in third trimester (T3). Post-gestational
      insomnia was 33.2% (28.2-37.9) (p<0.001 pre-gestational vs T1, T2 vs T3 and T3 vs
      after pregnancy). There was worsening mean AIS score, from: 2.34 before pregnancy
      to 9.87 in T3 because the deterioration of nighttime sleep, in absolute terms,
      but daytime impact was higher in T1. Previous trimester insomnia was associated
      with insomnia in T2 (aOR=4.21, 95% CI 2.78-6.37) and T3 (aOR=4.43, 95% CI
      2.77-7.08). Pre-gestational insomnia was determinant of insomnia in T1 (aOR
      12.50, 95% CI 3.58-43.60) and obesity was associated with insomnia in T3
      (aOR=2.30, 95% CI 0.99-5.32). On the contrary, moderate physical activity reduced
      the odds of insomnia in T3 (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia
      prevalence was high from the beginning of pregnancy, associated with
      pre-gestational insomnia. In late pregnancy, two out of three pregnant women
      suffering insomnia. Insomnia prevention should be targeted particularly to those 
      with high body mass index and pre-gestational insomnia.

TI  - Experience with FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system in management of 
      refractory dumping syndrome in pregnancy shortly after bariatric surgery.
LID - 17-0128 [pii]
LID - 10.1530/EDM-17-0128 [doi]
AB  - Bariatric surgery is an effective therapy for obesity but is associated with
      long-term complications such as dumping syndromes and nutritional deficiencies.
      We report a case of a 26-year-old caucasian female, with history of morbid
      obesity and gestational diabetes (GDM), who became pregnant 4 months after
      Roux-en-Y bypass surgery. She developed GDM during subsequent pregnancy, which
      was initially managed with metformin and insulin. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia causing
      sleep disturbance and daytime somnolence occured at 19 weeks of pregnancy
      (19/40). Treatment with rapid-acting carbohydrates precipitated further
      hypoglycaemia. Laboratory investigations confirmed hypoglycaemia at 2.2 mmol/L
      with appropriately low insulin and C-peptide, intact HPA axis and negative IgG
      insulin antibodies. The patient was seen regularly by the bariatric dietetic team
      but concerns about compliance persisted. A FreeStyle Libre system was used from
      21/40 enabling the patient a real-time feedback of changes in interstitial
      glucose following high or low GI index food intake. The patient declined a trial 
      of acarbose but consented to an intraveneous dextrose infusion overnight
      resulting in improvement but not complete abolishment of nocturnal hypoglycaemia.
      Hypoglycaemias subsided at 34/40 and metformin and insulin had to be
      re-introduced due to high post-prandial blood glucose readings. An emergency
      C-section was indicated at 35 + 1/40 and a small-for-gestational-age female was
      delivered. There have been no further episodes of hypoglycaemia following
      delivery. This case illustrates challenges in the management of pregnancy
      following bariatric surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first use of FreeStyle
      Libre in dumping syndrome in pregnancy following bariatric surgery with
      troublesome nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Learning points: Bariatric surgery
      represents the most effective treatment modality in cases of severe obesity. With
      increasing prevalence of obesity, more people are likely to undergo bariatric
      procedures, many of which are women of childbearing age.Fertility generally
      improves after bariatric surgery due to weight reduction, but pregnancy is not
      recommended for at least 12-24 months after surgery. If pregnancy occurs, there
      are currently little evidence-based guidelines available on how to manage
      complications such as dumping syndromes or gestational diabetes (GDM) in women
      with history of bariatric surgery.Diagnosis of GDM relies on the use of a 75 g
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The use of this test in pregnant women is not
      recommended due to its potential to precipitate dumping syndrome. Capillary
      glucose monitoring profiles or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is being
      currently discussed as alternative testing modalities.As the CGM technology
      becomes more available, including the recently introduced FreeStyle Libre Flash
      glucose monitoring system, more pregnant women, including those after bariatric
      surgery, will have access to this technology. We suggest urgent development of
      guidelines regarding the use of CGM and flash glucose monitoring tools in these
      circumstances and in the interim recommend careful consideration of their use on 
      a case-to-case basis.

TI  - Designing a Mobile Health Application Prototype for the Management of
      Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome.
PG  - 94-97
AB  - The design of an early mobile health application (app) prototype to manage
      interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, a chronic condition characterized
      by recurrent pain/discomfort in the bladder and pelvic floor, is described. The
      purpose of this app prototype is to help people who have IC/PBS manage and learn 
      what triggers their symptoms. Another aim of this research was to provide an
      example of how sex and gender could be included into the design of a health
      information system. Based on a literature search of common symptoms and
      challenges faced by people living with IC/PBS, the researcher created an app
      prototype design including many features: resources for relaxation, mental
      health, intimacy, pregnancy, and daily life; reminders for appointments, and
      medication; logs for diet, activity, sleep, pain, menstruation; and a link to a
      public washroom locator. This prototype will later undergo usability and content 
      evaluation.

TI  - Prevalence and Determinants of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Cross-Sectional
      Study in China.
LID - E1532 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14121532 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to identify the prevalence of gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) and to examine its associations with social and behavioral
      factors, maternal body mass index (BMI), anemia, and hypertension. Methods: A
      cross-sectional analysis was performed on data collected from 2345 pregnant women
      from 16 hospitals in five selected provinces in mainland China. RESULTS:
      Prevalence of GDM was as follows: overall: 3.7%; pregnant women in the first
      pregnancy: 3.4%; pregnant women in the second pregnancy: 4.6%. Compared with
      early pregnancy women, late-stage pregnant women were more likely to have GDM (OR
      = 4.32, 95% CI (1.82, 10.27)). Compared with 18-25 years old pregnant women,
      women aged 36-45 years were more likely to have GDM (OR = 3.98, 95% CI (1.41,
      11.28). Compared with non-hypertensive patients, hypertensive patients were more 
      likely to have GDM (OR = 6.93, 95% CI (1.28, 37.64)). However, second pregnancy, 
      high maternal BMI, prolonged screen time (TV-viewing time, computer-using time,
      and mobile-phone using time), insufficient and excessive sleep duration, poor
      sleep quality, smoking, and secondhand smoke exposure were not significantly
      associated with an increased risk of GDM. Conclusions: Women in the second
      pregnancy do not appear to predict an increased risk for developing GDM than
      women in the first pregnancy. High-risk groups of GDM included women in their
      late pregnancy, aged 36-45 years old, and with hypertension. The findings will
      contribute to an improved understanding of social and behavioral determinants of 
      GDM in Chinese population and contribute to the development of health-prevention 
      promotion interventions to address GDM.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infants are at risk of overweight. Infant overweight predisposes
      child, adolescent, and adult to obesity. We hypothesized that parent education,
      initiated prenatally and provided in the home, would reduce the incidence of
      infant overweight at age 12 months. METHODS: Pregnant obese Latina women were
      recruited at Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
      Children (WIC) and randomized to intervention versus control. Intervention
      subjects received home visits by trained Spanish-fluent community health workers 
      who provided counseling on infant growth, breastfeeding, nutrition, child
      development, sleep, physical activity, and safety. Promotoras did not visit the
      control subjects. A research assistant collected outcome data on all subjects.
      RESULTS: Compared to controls, parent education did not reduce infant overweight.
      Infant overweight developed rapidly and was present in 46% of infants by age 6
      months. Infants overweight at 6 months were likely to be overweight at age 12
      months (r = 0.60, P < .0001). Overweight was more common in formula-fed infants
      at ages 6 months (P < .06) and 12 months (P = .005). Breastfeeding was less
      common in families with employed mothers (P = .02) and unemployed fathers (P <
      .01), but the father living with the mother at the time of the prenatal visit
      predicted successful breastfeeding at infant age 2 months (P < .003). Compared to
      formula feeding, overweight at age 12 months was 2.7 times less likely for
      infants breastfed for >/=2 months (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of success of 
      the intervention may be explained in part by a high cesarean section rate in the 
      intervention group, food and employment insecurity, and confounding by WIC
      breastfeeding promotion, which was available to all mothers. Breastfeeding was
      the most important mediator of infant overweight. The study supports efforts by
      WIC to vigorously promote breastfeeding.

AB  - Sleep and pregnancy are dynamic processes with unique and evolving physiological 
      substrates. Given the "restorative hypothesis" of sleep as an anabolic process
      essential for cellular and tissue regeneration, the largely unexplored role of
      sleep in gestational physiology and pregnancy outcomes promises to be a
      fascinating topic. Emerging literature suggests that objectively measured or
      self-reported short sleep duration may be a risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
      including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension, and
      cesarean delivery. In this review, we discuss obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and
      restless legs syndrome (RLS), two sleep disorders prevalent in pregnancy. OSA is 
      especially likely in high-risk pregnancy where it is associated with comorbid
      cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances. We review new data strongly suggesting
      that OSA is an independent risk factor for GDM and gestational hypertension. It
      remains to be seen if sleep disruption, whether or not in the context of
      gestational RLS and gestational OSA, is a modifiable factor for adverse pregnancy
      outcomes. Clinicians are encouraged to query sleep symptoms in pregnant women and
      to have a low threshold to pursue investigations for OSA, including the
      subjective symptoms of snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime sleepiness, and
      also medical comorbidities, such as chronic hypertension.

AB  - Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics and relevant factors
      on the comorbidity of hyperactivity behavior and allergic disease among preschool
      children in urban areas of Ma'anshan city. Methods: During April 2014 to April
      2015, 91 kindergartens over 3 years old were investigated. In the investigation, 
      16 439 questionnaires were distributed to parents, and 15 291 valid
      questionnaires were collected. Conners abbreviated symptom questionnaire (brief
      symptom questionnaire) was filled out by parents to assess the children's
      hyperactive behaviors. Information of allergic disease history was reported by
      parents, including allergic dermatitis/eczema, food/drug allergy, allergic
      rhinitis and asthma. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression was used to
      analyze the relevant factors of comorbidity of hyperactivity behavior and allergy
      diseases. Results: The average age of the 15 291 children were (4.5+/-1.0) years 
      old, among which 53.7% (8 218/15 291) were boys. The prevalence of hyperactive
      behaviors was 8.6%(1 317/15 291), and the comorbidity rate of hyperactivity and
      allergic deseases was 1.7% (258/15 291). After confounding factors including
      gender, age, delivery mode, father's age and pregnancy complications adjusted,
      poor sleep quality (OR=4.45, 95%CI: 2.85-6.94), long duration of watching TV at
      weekend (OR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.00-1.94) and poor eating behavior (OR=1.78, 95%CI:
      1.07-2.98) were relevant factors of the comorbidity of hyperactivity and allergic
      diseases. Conclusion: The prevalence of comorbidity of hyperactivity behavior and
      allergic disease among preschool children in urban areas of Ma'anshan city was
      not high. Poor night sleep quality, long duration of watching TV and frequently
      picky eating were relevant factors of the comorbidity of hyperactive behaviors
      and allergic diseases.

      Pregnant Patients Under Chiropractic Care Utilizing the Webster Technique.
PG  - 90-98
LID - 10.1089/acm.2017.0162 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify the quality of life (QoL) and visit-specific satisfaction 
      of pregnant women. DESIGN: A prospective cohort within a practice-based research 
      network (PBRN). Setting/Locations: Individual chiropractic offices. SUBJECTS:
      Pregnant women (age >/=18 years) attending chiropractic care. INTERVENTION(S):
      Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and
      adjunctive therapies). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The RAND VSQ9 to measure
      visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS((R)))-29 to measure QoL. RESULTS: A convenience sample
      of 343 pregnant patients (average age = 30.96 years) comprised their study
      population. They were highly educated with 75% attaining a 2-year associate's
      degree or higher. The pregnant patients presented for chiropractic care with a
      mean week of gestation of 25.67 weeks (median = 28 weeks; range = 0-42 weeks) and
      parity (i.e., the number of live births) of 0.92 live births (median = 1; range =
      0-6). From baseline (i.e., at study entrance with minimum first visit) and
      comparative (i.e., following a course of chiropractic care), the VSQ9
      measurements revealed increasingly high satisfaction on the part of the subjects 
      (i.e., the mean difference of baseline minus comparative measures = -0.7322; p < 
      0.005). The median number of visits (i.e., visits attended) at baseline and
      comparative measures was 1.00 (standard deviation [SD] = 22.69) and 3.30 (SD =
      22.71), respectively. Across outcomes, QoL improved from baseline to comparative 
      measurement after holding constant for visit number and time lapse, trimester of 
      pregnancy, and care provider type. There was a reduction in mean T scores
      associated with fatigue (p < 0.05), pain interference (p < 0.05), sleep
      disturbance (p < 0.05), and an improvement in satisfaction with social roles (p <
      0.05). A significant decrease was also found with pain interference (p < 0.05).
      No evidence was found that anxiety (p = 0.1404) or depression (p = 0.8785)
      changed. CONCLUSION: A PBRN study was successfully implemented among
      chiropractors to find pregnant patients highly satisfied and their QoL scores
      improving with care beyond chance.

TI  - Interleukin 1 gene polymorphism and susceptibility to disease.
PG  - 40-56
LID - 10.1111/imr.12620 [doi]
AB  - The Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family plays a central role in the generation and
      regulation of inflammatory responses, in both innate and adaptive immunity.
      Although the IL-1 molecules are traditionally considered to be classical
      proinflammatory cytokines, their functions are not restricted to inflammation,
      and they have also been shown to play a key role in a wide range of additional
      physiological and pathological functions, including learning modulation, sleep,
      pregnancy, depression, appetite, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and many others.
      Since their effect as cytokines and regulators of inflammation is so pleiotropic,
      any shift of the biological balance between agonistic and antagonistic signals
      has the potential to cause disease. Here, we consider the genetic influence of
      interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in the context of susceptibility to human
      diseases. We review known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-1 genes
      linked to human diseases, and suggest how exploring biological effects of IL-1
      gene cluster polymorphism may lead to new directions in understanding and
      diagnostic of disease and effective treatment.

TI  - Prenatal and early postnatal measures of brain development and childhood sleep
      patterns.
PG  - 760-766
LID - 10.1038/pr.2017.318 [doi]
AB  - BackgroundBrain development underlies maturation of sleep patterns throughout
      childhood. Intrauterine head growth-marker of early neurodevelopment-has not been
      associated with childhood sleep characteristics. We explored associations between
      ultrasonographic measures of prenatal and early postnatal neurodevelopment and
      childhood sleep.MethodsA total of 6,808 children from a population-based birth
      cohort (Generation R) were included. Head circumference (HC) and lateral
      ventricles size were assessed with mid- and late-pregnancy fetal ultrasounds, and
      with cranial ultrasound 3-20 weeks postnatally. Mothers reported children's sleep
      duration at 2 and 3 years, and sleep problems at 1.5, 3, and 6
      years.ResultsLarger ventricular size, but not HC, was related to longer sleep
      duration at 3 years (beta=0.06 h, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02; 0.10 in
      late-pregnancy and beta=0.11 h, 95% CI: 0.02; 0.20 in early infancy,
      mid-pregnancy parameters were unrelated to sleep duration). Larger HC in
      mid-pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk for being a "problematic
      sleeper" up to the age of 6 years (odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% CI: 0.89; 0.99).
      Consistently, children with larger HC in early infancy were less likely to be
      "problematic sleepers" at 3 and 6 years.ConclusionsThis study shows that
      variations in fetal and neonatal brain size may underlie behavioral expression of
      sleep in childhood. Albeit small effect estimates, these associations provide
      evidence for neurodevelopmental origins of sleep.

TI  - Correlates of ideal cardiovascular health in European adolescents: The HELENA
      study.
PG  - 187-194
LID - S0939-4753(17)30258-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.numecd.2017.10.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The ideal cardiovascular health (iCVH) construct consists of
      4 health behaviors (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) 
      and 3 health factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose). A
      greater number of iCVH components in adolescence are related to better
      cardiovascular health, but little is known about the correlates of iCVH in
      adolescents. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine correlates of iCVH in
      European adolescents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study comprised 637 European
      adolescents with complete iCVH data. Participants were part of the Healthy
      Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a
      cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted in 9 different European countries.
      Correlates investigated were sex and age, family affluence scale, maternal
      education, geographic location, sleep time, television viewing, duration of
      pregnancy, birth weight and breastfeeding. Younger adolescents, those whose
      mothers had medium/high education or those who watched television less than 2 h
      per day had a greater number of iCVH components compared to those who were older,
      had a mother with low education or watched television 2 h or more daily (P </=
      0.01). CONCLUSION: Since in our study older adolescents had worse iCVH than
      younger adolescents, early promotion of cardiovascular health may be important.
      Future studies may also investigate the usefulness of limiting television viewing
      to promote iCVH. Finally, since adolescents of mothers with low education had
      poorer iCVH, it may be of special interest to tailor public health promotion to
      adolescents from families with low socioeconomic status.

TI  - Emergency salpingectomy for ruptured ectopic pregnancy in patient with
      Melnick-Needles syndrome: a rare otopalatodigital syndrome.

AB  - Melnick-Needles syndrome (M-NS) is a rare genetic disorder which primarily
      affects skeletal developments. M-NS may also affect the cardiorespiratory and
      renal systems. A 35 kg patient presented complaining of abdominal pain. Following
      a positive pregnancy test and ultrasound examination, she was diagnosed with a
      ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She had a significant background history of M-NS,
      obstructive sleep apnoea (with narrow gauge tracheostomy in situ), obstructive
      lung disease and scoliosis. She received fluid resuscitation, and the case was
      managed using an open salpingectomy and clot evacuation under combined
      spinal/epidural anaesthesia. Anticipated difficulty in securing a definitive
      airway was pivotal to choosing a regional anaesthetic technique. The operation
      was successful and the patient recovered well. This was a unique surgical and
      anaesthetic challenge due to abnormal facial, spinal and abdominal morphology
      compounded by the time-critical emergency nature of the case. Individually
      tailored perioperative management is frequently required for patients with rare
      syndromes.

TI  - Prader-Willi Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is characterized by severe 
      hypotonia and feeding difficulties in early infancy, followed in later infancy or
      early childhood by excessive eating and gradual development of morbid obesity
      (unless eating is externally controlled). Motor milestones and language
      development are delayed. All individuals have some degree of cognitive
      impairment. A distinctive behavioral phenotype (with temper tantrums,
      stubbornness, manipulative behavior, and obsessive-compulsive characteristics) is
      common. Hypogonadism is present in both males and females and manifests as
      genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most, infertility.
      Short stature is common (if not treated with growth hormone); characteristic
      facial features, strabismus, and scoliosis are often present. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: 
      Consensus clinical diagnostic criteria are accurate, but the mainstay of
      diagnosis is DNA methylation testing to detect abnormal parent-specific
      imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) on chromosome 15; this 
      testing determines whether the region is maternally inherited only (i.e., the
      paternally contributed region is absent) and detects more than 99% of affected
      individuals. DNA methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the
      diagnosis of PWS in all individuals, but especially in those who have atypical
      findings or are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis
      on clinical grounds. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: In infancy, special
      nipples or enteral tube feeding to assure adequate nutrition; physical therapy
      may improve muscle strength; hormonal and surgical treatments can be considered
      for cryptorchidism. In childhood, strict supervision of daily food intake based
      on height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) to provide energy requirements while
      limiting excessive weight gain (keeping BMI Z score <2 or better) and encouraging
      physical activity. Growth hormone replacement therapy to normalize height,
      increase lean body mass and mobility, and decrease fat mass. Evaluation and
      treatment of sleep disturbance per the general population. Educational planning
      should be instigated and speech therapy provided if needed. Firm limit-setting to
      manage behavioral problems; serotonin reuptake inhibitors are helpful for most
      teenagers and adults. Replacement of sex hormones at puberty produces adequate
      secondary sexual characteristics. N-acetylcysteine or topiramate may help reduce 
      skin picking. Modafinil has been successful in treating daytime sleepiness in
      many children. In adulthood, a group home for individuals with PWS that regulates
      behavior and weight management may prevent morbid obesity, and growth hormone may
      help to maintain muscle bulk. Prevention of secondary complications: Weight
      control to avoid development of type 2 diabetes mellitus; calcium and vitamin D
      supplementation to avoid osteoporosis; if osteoporosis develops, consider
      treatment with a bisphosphonate. Surveillance: Infants should be screened for
      strabismus; routine monitoring of height, weight, and BMI to assure
      appropriateness of exercise program and diet; annual testing for hypothyroidism. 
      Other: No medications are currently known to aid in controlling hyperphagia,
      although several are under investigation. GENETIC COUNSELING: PWS is caused by an
      absence of expression of imprinted genes in the paternally derived PWS/Angelman
      syndrome (AS) region (i.e., 15q11.2-q13) of chromosome 15 by one of several
      genetic mechanisms (paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15 and rarely 
      an imprinting defect). The risk to the sibs of an affected child of having PWS
      depends on the genetic mechanism that resulted in the absence of expression of
      the paternally contributed 15q11.2-q13 region. The risk to sibs is typically less
      than 1% if the affected child has a deletion or uniparental disomy, up to 50% if 
      the affected child has an imprinting defect, and up to 25% if a parental
      chromosome translocation is present. Prenatal testing is possible for pregnancies
      at increased risk if the underlying genetic mechanism is known.

TI  - Depression and Anxiety: Lack of Associations with an Inadequate Diet in a Sample 
      of Pregnant Women with a History of Bariatric Surgery-a Multicenter Prospective
      Controlled Cohort Study.
PG  - 1629-1635
LID - 10.1007/s11695-017-3060-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression levels are higher in obese compared to those
      in normal weight pregnant women. The aims of this study are to examine anxiety
      and depression in pregnancy following bariatric surgery and to compare with obese
      pregnant controls considering the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (PUFA), folate, and vitamin B12. METHODS: Anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory)
      and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) were examined in the first 
      (T1) and third (T3) pregnancy trimester in 54 women with bariatric surgery and 25
      obese. T1 and T3 dietary intake of PUFA, folate, and vitamin B12 intake was
      assessed using a 3-day food record. Mixed models with a compound symmetry
      covariance structure and regression models were applied. RESULTS: About half of
      the women with surgery had high state and trait anxiety scores (>/= 40), which
      did not significantly change during pregnancy. Every 10-kg postoperative weight
      loss was associated with an increase in T1 state and trait anxiety with
      respectively 2.7 and 2.3 points. A smoking woman had a 8.6-point higher state
      anxiety score than a non-smoking woman in T1. In T3, every additional hour of
      sleep was associated with a decrease in trait anxiety score with 1.59 points.
      Anxiety and depression scores were not associated with and could not be explained
      by inadequate PUFAs, folate, and vitamin B12 intakes. Anxiety scores were higher 
      following surgery than those in untreated obesity at both time points.
      CONCLUSION: Pregnancy following bariatric surgery induces high levels of anxiety 
      that are not associated with an inadequate maternal diet.

TI  - Changes in the Cholinergic, Catecholaminergic, Orexinergic and Serotonergic
      Structures Forming Part of the Sleep Systems of Adult Mice Exposed to
      Intrauterine Alcohol.
PG  - 110
LID - 10.3389/fnana.2017.00110 [doi]
AB  - We examined the effect of chronic prenatal alcohol exposure on certain neuronal
      systems involved with the sleep-wake cycle of C57BL/6J mice exposed to prenatal
      alcohol once they had reached 56 days post-natal. Pregnant mice were exposed to
      alcohol, through oral gavage, on gestational days 7-16, with recorded blood
      alcohol concentration (BAC)s averaging 1.84 mg/ml (chronic alcohol group, CA).
      Two control groups, an oral gavage sucrose control group (chronic alcohol control
      group, CAc) and a non-treated control group (NTc), were also examined. At 56 days
      post-natal, the pups from each group were sacrificed and the whole brain
      sectioned in a coronal plane and immunolabeled for cholineacetyltransferase
      (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), serotonin (5HT) and orexin-A (OxA) which
      labels cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic structures
      respectively. The overall nuclear organization and neuronal morphology were
      identical in all three groups studied, and resemble that previously reported for 
      laboratory rodents. Quantification of the estimated numbers of ChAT
      immunopositive (+) neurons of the pons, the TH+ neurons of the pons and the OxA+ 
      neurons of the hypothalamus showed no statistically significant difference
      between the three experimental groups. The stereologically estimated areas and
      volumes of OxA+ neurons in the CA group were statistically significantly larger
      than the groups not exposed to prenatal alcohol, but the ChAT+ neurons in the CA 
      group were statistically significantly smaller. The density of orexinergic
      boutons in the anterior cingulate cortex was lower in the CA group than the other
      groups. No statistically significant difference was found in the area and volume 
      of TH+ neurons between the three experimental groups. These differences are
      discussed in relation to the sleep disorders recorded in children with fetal
      alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).

TI  - CHARACTERISTICS OF WEST SYNDROME IN GEORGIA, PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE
      PROSPECTIVE STUDY.
PG  - 104-109
AB  - West syndrome hasn't been thoroughly investigated in Georgia. The purposes of our
      study were a) to assess the clinical and etiological peculiarities of West
      syndrome, based on MRI data and its relation to the long-term outcome; b) to
      assess the evolution of West syndrome and its relation to patient
      characteristics; c) to compare the efficacies of treatments with ACTH and
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); d) to evaluate the neuropsychological outcome after
      12 and 24 months and their early predictors. We evaluated 31 patients (17 male,
      14 female) with infantile spasms. Mean age of seizure onset was 6.3 months.
      Inclusion criteria were newly diagnosed patients with infantile spasms from 2 to 
      18 months, abnormal EEG and written informed consent of parents/ caregivers. We
      collected birth, family and seizure detailed history. All patients were examined 
      neurologically, investigated with prolonged sleep and awake video - EEG, brain
      MRI, developmental screening tests (Ages & Stages Questionnaires(R), Third
      Edition, ASQ-3) at the time of admission. Spasm diary was given and filled by
      every parent/caregiver. The video-recording of seizures to study the detailed
      phenomenology of event was done in all cases as well. In 94% of patients (n=29)
      spasm were observed in clusters. EEG investigation revealed hypsarrhythmia in
      majority of cases (n=20; 65%). 19% (n=6) and 16% (n=5) patients had modified
      hypsarrhythmia and other types of EEG changes respectively. In 19 (61%) cases
      neurological examination was normal. 7 patients (22.6%) showed normal
      neuropsychological development. In remaining 12 (38.7%) and 12 (38.7%) cases
      moderate and severe delay of development was revealed accordingly. MRI
      investigation revealed no abnormality in 16% (n=5). 16 (52%) individuals were
      treated with ACTH only. In 12 (39%) cases ACTH and AED were used simultaneously
      and 2 (6.5%) cases were treated with AED only. One year follow-up assessments
      were provided in 22 (74%) cases. One patient died during the study.
      Neuropsychological development was with no changes in 12 (55%) individuals. In 3 
      (9.7%) cases some improvement was detected and the deterioration of development
      was identified in 6 (19%) individuals. In all cases with developmental
      deterioration, seizures were started before seven month of age, this association 
      was statistically significant (Pearson Chi-Square 6.3; df 1; p=0.019). There was 
      no relationship between developmental changes and sex, birth from full term
      pregnancy, infantile spasm type, treatment, or EEG pattern, however. Despite the 
      fact, that the number of included patients was small, preliminary findings are in
      accordance to the other published data. The current study is still in process.
      12-24 months follow-up with clinical, EEG and neuropsychological monitoring is
      planned for all cases.

TI  - Influence of time of delivery on risk of adverse neonatal outcome in different
      size of delivery units: a retrospective cohort study in Finland.
PG  - 1696-1702
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2017.1416081 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of time of birth on adverse neonatal outcome in
      singleton term hospital births. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical Birth Register
      Data in Finland from 2005 to 2009. Study population was all hospital births (n = 
      263,901), excluding multiple pregnancies, preterm births <37 weeks, major
      congenital anomalies or birth defects, and antepartum stillbirths. Main outcome
      measures were either 1-minute Apgar score 0-3, 5-minute Apgar score 0-6, or
      umbilical artery pH <7.00, and intrapartum and early neonatal mortality. We
      calculated risk ratios (ARRs) adjusted for maternal age and parity, and 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs) to indicate the probability of adverse neonatal
      outcome outside of office hours in normal vaginal delivery, in vaginal breech
      delivery, in instrumental vaginal delivery, and in elective and nonelective
      cesarean sections. We analyzed different size-categories of maternity hospitals
      and different on-call arrangements. RESULTS: Instrumental vaginal delivery had
      increased risk for mortality (ARR 3.31, 95%CI; 1.01-10.82) outside office hours. 
      Regardless of hospital volume and on-call arrangement, the risk for low Apgar
      score or low umbilical artery pH was higher outside office hours (ARR 1.23,
      95%CI; 1.15-1.30). Intrapartum and early neonatal mortality increased only in
      large, nonuniversity hospitals outside office hours (ARR 1.51, 95%CI; 1.07-2.14).
      CONCLUSIONS: Compared to office hours, babies born outside office hours are in
      higher risk for adverse outcome. Demonstration of more detailed circadian effects
      on adverse neonatal outcomes in different subgroups requires larger data.

AB  - Although several states have implemented programs providing boxes for infant
      sleep, safe sleep experts express concern regarding the paucity of safety and
      efficacy research on boxes. The purpose of this study was to assess pregnant
      women's perceptions regarding use of baby sleep boxes. A convenience sample was
      recruited from a community prenatal education program. Twenty-eight women were
      administered a brief semistructured interview about their knowledge of baby sleep
      boxes, opinions about the boxes, and questions they would have. For most (n = 15,
      54%), this was their first pregnancy. Participants self-identified as white
      (43%), black (36%), Hispanic (18%), and "other" (4%). Ten subthemes emerged
      related to previous knowledge of boxes (useful for families in need, historic
      precedent in other countries), positive attributes (portable, compact,
      affordable, decorative), and negative attributes (low to ground, structural
      integrity/design, stability, stigma). Research on safety and efficacy could
      reduce concerns, but issues of stigma may persist.

TI  - Long-term cardiovascular reprogramming by short-term perinatal exposure to
      nicotine's main metabolite cotinine.
PG  - 638-646
LID - 10.1111/apa.14181 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Gather 'proof-of-concept' evidence of the adverse developmental potential of
      cotinine (a seemingly benign biomarker of recent nicotine/tobacco smoke
      exposure). METHODS: Pregnant C57 mice drank nicotine- or cotinine-laced water for
      6 wks from conception (NPRE = 2% saccharin + 100 mug nicotine/mL; CPRE = 2%
      saccharin + 10 mug cotinine/mL) or 3 wks after birth (CPOST = 2% saccharin + 30
      mug cotinine/mL). Controls drank 2% saccharin (CTRL). At 17 +/- 1 weeks (male
      pups; CTRL n = 6; CPOST n = 6; CPRE n = 8; NPRE n = 9), we assessed (i)
      cardiovascular control during sleep; (ii) arterial reactivity ex vivo; and (iii) 
      expression of genes involved in arterial constriction/dilation. RESULTS: Blood
      cotinine levels recapitulated those of passive smoker mothers' infants. Pups
      exposed to cotinine exhibited (i) mild bradycardia - hypotension at rest (p <
      0.001); (ii) attenuated (CPRE , p < 0.0001) or reverse (CPOST ; p < 0.0001) BP
      stress reactivity; (iii) adrenergic hypocontractility (p < 0.0003), low protein
      kinase C (p < 0.001) and elevated adrenergic receptor mRNA (p < 0.05; all
      drug-treated arteries); and (iv) endothelial dysfunction (NPRE only). CONCLUSION:
      Cotinine has subtle, enduring developmental consequences. Some cardiovascular
      effects of nicotine can plausibly arise via conversion into cotinine. Low-level
      exposure to this metabolite may pose unrecognised perinatal risks. Adults must
      avoid inadvertently exposing a foetus or infant to cotinine as well as nicotine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For many women, pregnancy-related sleep disturbances and
      pregnancy-related anxiety change as pregnancy progresses and both are associated 
      with lower maternal quality of life and less favorable birth outcomes. Thus, the 
      interplay between these two problems across pregnancy is of interest. In
      addition, psychological resilience may explain individual differences in this
      association, as it may promote coping with both sleep disturbances and anxiety,
      and thereby reduce their mutual effects. Therefore, the aim of the current study 
      was to examine whether sleep quality and sleep duration, and changes in sleep are
      associated with the level of and changes in anxiety during pregnancy.
      Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of resilience on these
      associations. METHODS: At gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34, 532 pregnant women
      from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland filled out questionnaires on
      general sleep quality, sleep duration and pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience
      was assessed in week 14. RESULTS: Parallel process latent growth curve models
      showed that shorter initial sleep duration predicted a higher initial level of
      anxiety, and a higher initial anxiety level predicted a faster shortening of
      sleep duration. Changes in sleep duration and changes in anxiety over the course 
      of pregnancy were not related. The predicted moderating effect of resilience was 
      not found. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that pregnant women reporting
      anxiety problems should also be screened for sleeping problems, and vice versa,
      because women who experienced one of these pregnancy-related problems were also
      at risk of experiencing or developing the other problem.

AB  - Bariatric surgery is today the most effective long-term therapy for the
      management of patients with severe obesity, and its use is recommended by the
      relevant guidelines of the management of obesity in adults. Bariatric surgery is 
      in general safe and effective, but it can cause new clinical problems and is
      associated with specific diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic needs. For
      clinicians, the acquisition of special knowledge and skills is required in order 
      to deliver appropriate and effective care to the post-bariatric patient. In the
      present recommendations, the basic notions needed to provide first-level adequate
      medical care to post-bariatric patients are summarised. Basic information about
      nutrition, management of co-morbidities, pregnancy, psychological issues as well 
      as weight regain prevention and management is derived from current evidences and 
      existing guidelines. A short list of clinical practical recommendations is
      included for each item. It remains clear that referral to a bariatric
      multidisciplinary centre, preferably the one performing the original procedure,
      should be considered in case of more complex clinical situations.

LID - 10.1186/s12884-017-1595-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal
      morbidity and mortality, and subsequent possible adverse effects on the
      cognitive, emotional and behavioral development of the child. The aim of the
      study was to identify maternal characteristics associated with poor mental
      health, in a group of overweight/obese pregnant women in nine European countries,
      and thus, to contribute to better recognition and intervention for maternal
      depression. METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, baseline data
      from early pregnancy (< 20 weeks) of the DALI (Vitamin D and Lifestyle
      Intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention) study were analyzed.
      Maternal mental health was assessed with the World Health Organization Well-Being
      Index (WHO-5). Women were classified as having a low (WHO-5 </= 50) or high
      wellbeing. RESULTS: A total of 735 pregnant women were included. The prevalence
      of having a low wellbeing was 27.2%, 95% CI [24.0, 30.4]. Multivariate analysis
      showed independent associations between low wellbeing and European ethnicity, OR 
      = .44, 95% CI [.25, .77], shift work, OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.11, 2.93],
      insufficient sleep, OR = 3.30, 95% CI [1.96, 5.55], self-efficacy, OR = .95, 95% 
      CI [.92, .98], social support, OR = .94, 95% CI [.90, .99], and pregnancy-related
      worries (socioeconomic: OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.02, 1.15]; health: OR = 1.06, 95% CI
      [1.01, 1.11]; relationship: OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.05, 1.31]). CONCLUSIONS: Mental 
      health problems are common in European overweight/obese pregnant women. The
      identified correlates might help in early recognition and subsequent treatment of
      poor mental health problems during pregnancy. This is important to reduce the
      unfavorable effects of poor mental health on pregnancy outcomes. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between
      the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and markers of microvascular
      disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 
      151 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited for repeat 24-h BP
      recordings thrice during pregnancy and once three months post partum. Fifty women
      without diabetes served as controls. The AASI and pulse pressure (PP) were
      computed from blood pressure recordings. Repeated measures analysis of variance
      was used for comparison between groups during and after pregnancy. Linear
      regression analysis was performed with AASI and PP as dependent variables and
      albuminuria and retinopathy as independent variables. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AASI
      during diabetic pregnancy and association with microvascular disease. RESULTS:
      Micro- or macroalbuminuria was present in 23% of the women and 58% had either
      simplex or proliferative retinopathy. The AASI was inversely associated with the 
      coefficient of determination, which means that the stiffer vascular wall the more
      random variability in BP. CONCLUSION: AASI showed a strong association with
      microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes. Together
      with the flattened circadian rhythm this indicates a pregnancy-related functional
      change in the vascular bed.

TI  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Gestational Diabetes: A Pilot Study of the Role of the
      Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis.
PG  - 87-93
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.6888 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy is associated with
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This propensity toward heightened insulin
      resistance in OSA patients has not been well characterized and may be related to 
      dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The aim of this
      study was to (1) assess the prevalence of OSA in pregnant women with GDM, (2)
      evaluate whether HPA axis dysregulation relates to OSA, and (3) investigate the
      relation between insulin resistance and OSA. We hypothesized that OSA is
      prevalent among pregnant women with GDM and that women with OSA will have higher 
      levels of insulin resistance and dysregulation of the HPA axis. METHODS:
      Twenty-five pregnant women in whom GDM was diagnosed were enrolled. Subjects
      answered sleep questionnaires and underwent in-home sleep studies using a level
      III device. The presence of OSA was defined by apnea-hypopnea index >/= 5
      events/h. Homeostasis Model Assessment of insulin resistance was derived from
      measurements of fasting glucose and C-peptide levels. Three salivary cortisol
      levels were obtained across 1 day to assess circadian variation. Multivariable
      linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between variables.
      RESULTS: The sample consisted of 54% Caucasian pregnant women with a median body 
      mass index of 36.1 and interquartile ratio of 10.6 kg/m(2). OSA was diagnosed in 
      17% of participants. Circadian variation of cortisol was preserved in women with 
      OSA. Women with OSA displayed blunted cortisol awakening responses. CONCLUSIONS: 
      OSA is prevalent in women with GDM. OSA is associated with preserved circadian
      variation and blunted cortisol awakening responses.

TI  - Nutrition in the First 1000 Days: Ten Practices to Minimize Obesity Emerging from
      Published Science.
LID - E1491 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14121491 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has increased in most
      countries the last decades. Considering this in a simplistic way, we can say that
      obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and energy
      expenditure. Moreover, the environment from conception to childhood could
      influence the child's future health. The first 1000 days of life start with
      woman's pregnancy, and offer a unique window of opportunity to contribute to
      obesity prevention. In light of the actual literature, the aim of our article is 
      to discuss a proposal of 10 good practices to minimize obesity in the first 1000 
      days emerging from published science. (1) Both the mother's and the father's
      behaviors are important. A balanced diet with appropriate fat and protein intake,
      and favoring fruits and vegetables, is recommended for both parents during the
      conception period and pregnancy. Furthermore, overweight/obese women who are
      planning to become pregnant should reduce their weight before conception. (2)
      During pregnancy, at birth, and during early life, body composition measurements 
      are crucial to monitor the baby's growth. (3) Exclusive breastfeeding is
      recommended at the beginning of life until six months of age. (4) Four to six
      months of age is the optimal window to introduce complementary feeding. Until one
      year of age, breast milk or follow-on/commercial formula is the main recommended 
      feeding source, and cow's milk should be avoided until one year of age. (5) Fruit
      and vegetable introduction should begin early. Daily variety, diversity in a
      meal, and repeated exposure to the food, up to eight times, are efficient
      strategies to increase acceptance of food not well accepted at first. There is no
      need to add sugar, salt, or sugary fluids to the diet. (6) Respect the child's
      appetite and avoid coercive "clean your plate" feeding practices. Adapt the
      portion of food and don't use food as reward for good behavior. (7) Limit animal 
      protein intake in early life to reduce the risk of an early adiposity rebound.
      Growing-up milk for children between one and three years of age should be
      preferred to cow's milk, in order to limit intake and meet essential fatty acid
      and iron needs. (8) The intake of adequate fat containing essential fatty acids
      should be promoted. (9) Parents should be role models when feeding, with TV and
      other screens turned-off during meals. (10) Preventive interventions consisting
      of promoting physical activity and sufficient time dedicated to sleep should be
      employed. In fact, short sleep duration may be associated with increased risk of 
      developing obesity. Based on literature reviews, and given the suggestions
      described in this manuscript, concerted public health efforts are needed to
      achieve the healthy objectives for obesity and nutrition, and to fight the
      childhood obesity epidemic.

AB  - Maternal obesity induces pregnancy complications and disturbs fetal development, 
      but the specific mechanisms underlying these outcomes are unclear. Circadian
      rhythms are implicated in metabolic complications associated with obesity, and
      maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. Accordingly, obesity-induced
      circadian dysfunction may drive adverse outcomes in obese pregnancy. This study
      investigated whether maternal obesity alters the rhythmic expression of clock
      genes and associated nuclear receptors across maternal, fetal, and placental
      tissues. Wistar rats were maintained on a cafeteria (CAF) diet prior to and
      throughout gestation to induce maternal obesity. Maternal and fetal liver and
      placental labyrinth zone (LZ) were collected at four-hourly time points across
      days 15-16 and 21-22 of gestation (term = 23 days). Gene expression was analyzed 
      by RT-qPCR. Expression of the accessory clock gene Nr1d1 was rhythmic in the
      maternal and fetal liver and LZ of chow-fed controls, but in each case CAF
      feeding reduced peak Nr1d1 expression. Obesity resulted in a phase advance
      (approx. 1.5 h) in the rhythms of several clock genes and Ppar-delta in maternal 
      liver. Aside from Nr1d1, expression of clock genes was mostly arrhythmic in LZ
      and fetal liver, and was unaffected by the CAF diet. In conclusion, maternal
      obesity suppressed Nr1d1 expression across maternal, fetal, and placental
      compartments and phase-advanced the rhythms of maternal hepatic clock genes.
      Given the key role of Nr1d1 in regulating metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory
      processes, our data suggest that disruptions to rhythmic Nr1d1 expression in
      utero may contribute to programmed health complications in offspring of obese
      pregnancies.

      temperature associated with the menstrual cycle.

AB  - Core and peripheral body temperatures are affected by changes in reproductive
      hormones during the menstrual cycle. Women worldwide use the basal body
      temperature (BBT) method to aid and prevent conception. However, prior research
      suggests that taking one's daily temperature can prove inconvenient and subject
      to environmental factors. We investigate whether a more automatic, non-invasive
      temperature measurement system can detect changes in temperature across the
      menstrual cycle. We examined how wrist skin temperature (WST), measured with
      wearable sensors, correlates with urinary tests of ovulation and may serve as a
      new method of fertility tracking. One hundred and thirty-six eumenorrheic,
      non-pregnant women participated in an observational study. Participants wore WST 
      biosensors during sleep and reported their daily activities. An at-home
      luteinizing hormone (LH) test was used to confirm ovulation. WST was recorded
      across 437 cycles (mean cycles/participant = 3.21, S.D. = 2.25). We tested the
      relationship between the fertile window and WST temperature shifts, using the BBT
      three-over-six rule. A sustained 3-day temperature shift was observed in 357/437 
      cycles (82%), with the lowest cycle temperature occurring in the fertile window
      41% of the time. Most temporal shifts (307/357, 86%) occurred on ovulation day
      (OV) or later. The average early-luteal phase temperature was 0.33 degrees C
      higher than in the fertile window. Menstrual cycle changes in WST were impervious
      to lifestyle factors, like having sex, alcohol, or eating prior to bed, that, in 
      prior work, have been shown to obfuscate BBT readings. Although currently
      costlier than BBT, the present study suggests that WST could be a promising,
      convenient parameter for future multiparameter fertility awareness methods.

AB  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during
      pregnancy are growing health concerns because these conditions are associated
      with adverse outcomes for newborn infants. SDB/OSA during pregnancy exposes the
      mother and the fetus to intermittent hypoxia. Direct exposure of adults and
      neonates to IH causes neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, and exposure to
      IH during gestation (GIH) causes long-term deficits in offspring respiratory
      function. However, the role of neuroinflammation in CNS respiratory control
      centers of GIH offspring has not been investigated. Thus, the goal of this hybrid
      review/research article is to comprehensively review the available literature
      both in humans and experimental rodent models of SDB in order to highlight key
      gaps in knowledge. To begin to address some of these gaps, we also include data
      demonstrating the consequences of GIH on respiratory rhythm generation and
      neuroinflammation in CNS respiratory control regions. Pregnant rats were exposed 
      to daily intermittent hypoxia during gestation (G10-G21). Neuroinflammation in
      brainstem and cervical spinal cord was evaluated in P0-P3 pups that were injected
      with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.1mg/kg, 3h). In CNS respiratory control
      centers, we found that GIH attenuated the normal CNS immune response to LPS
      challenge in a gene-, sex-, and CNS region-specific manner. GIH also altered
      normal respiratory motor responses to LPS in newborn offspring brainstem-spinal
      cord preparations. These data underscore the need for further study of the
      long-term consequences of maternal SDB on the relationship between inflammation
      and the respiratory control system, in both neonatal and adult offspring.

TI  - Thiol/disulfide homeostasis in pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/14767058.2017.1401995 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive episodes of hypoxia and reoxygenation during sleep in
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) resemble an
      ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to test the hypothesis that oxidative
      stress occurs in pregnant women with OSAS. We also aimed to compare
      thiol/disulfide homeostasis with ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and total
      antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of ischemia-reperfusion injury in pregnant 
      women with and without OSAS and healthy control. METHODS: This study included 29 
      pregnant women with OSAS, 30 women without OSAS in the third trimester applying
      for periodic examinations, and 30 healthy women. Serum IMA and TAC (using the
      ferric reducing power of plasma method) were measured. Serum thiol/disulfide
      homeostasis was determined by a novel automated method. RESULTS: The mean age of 
      the pregnant women with OSAS was 31.0 +/- 4.7 years with a mean gestational age
      of 36.5 +/- 3.0 weeks. The mean age of pregnant women without OSAS was 29.8 +/-
      4.9 years with a mean gestational age of 36.9 +/- 2.7 weeks. The mean age of the 
      nonpregnant control group was 29.7 +/- 6.4 years. Both native thiol (291 +/- 29
      mumol/L versus 314 +/- 30 mumol/L; p = .018) and total thiol (325 +/- 32 versus
      350 +/- 32, p = .025) levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to
      pregnant women without OSAS, respectively (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the
      first study demonstrating the thiol/disulfide homeostasis in pregnant women with 
      OSAS. Native thiol and total thiol levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS 
      compared to those without OSAS. However, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis
      parameters cannot provide valuable information to discriminate OSAS in pregnant
      women.

TI  - Being Born Too Small and Too Early May Alter Sleep in Childhood.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsx193 [doi]
AB  - Study Objectives: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) occurs in up to 10% of
      pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of prematurity and
      neurodevelopmental impairment. FGR also alters sleep state distribution in utero 
      and maturation in infancy. Currently, limited data on the long-term associations 
      of FGR and childhood sleep exist. Accordingly, we assessed the associations
      between preterm birth and FGR and sleep in children aged 5-12 years. Methods: 17 
      children born preterm and FGR, 15 children born preterm but appropriately grown
      (AGA) and 20 term AGA children (controls) were studied using overnight
      polysomnography. Sleep macro-architecture was assessed using standard criteria
      and sleep micro-architecture was assessed using spectral analysis of the EEG
      (C4-M1) with Total, Delta (0.5Hz-3.9Hz), Theta (4.0Hz-7.9Hz), Alpha
      (8.0Hz-11.9Hz), Sigma (12.0Hz-13.9Hz) and Beta Power (14.0Hz-30Hz) calculated.
      Results: For sleep macro-architecture, preterm FGR children had higher N2%
      compared to term AGA children (p<0.05). Preterm AGA children had reduced total
      sleep time, NREM% and sleep efficiency compared to term AGA children (p<0.05 for 
      all). For sleep micro-architecture, preterm FGR children had a higher amount of
      Total, delta and alpha power compared to both groups (p<0.05). Sigma and beta
      power were lowest in the preterm AGA group compared to both groups (p<0.05 for
      both). Conclusions: Prematurity and FGR were associated with altered sleep macro-
      and micro-architecture measures indicative of reduced sleep quantity and quality 
      in childhood. As sleep disturbance can impact both behavior and neurodevelopment 
      in children, sleep in FGR and preterm children warrants further investigation.

TI  - Road traffic noise and children's inattention.
PG  - 127
LID - 10.1186/s12940-017-0337-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of children are exposed to road traffic noise
      levels that may lead to adverse effects on health and daily functioning.
      Childhood is a period of intense growth and brain maturation, and children may
      therefore be especially vulnerable to road traffic noise. The objective of the
      present study was to examine whether road traffic noise was associated with
      reported inattention symptoms in children, and whether this association was
      mediated by sleep duration. METHODS: This study was based on the Norwegian Mother
      and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
      Parental reports of children's inattention at age 8 were linked to modelled
      levels of residential road traffic noise. We investigated the association between
      inattention and noise exposure during pregnancy (n = 1934), noise exposure
      averaged over 5 years (age 3 to 8 years; n = 1384) and noise exposure at age 8
      years (n = 1384), using fractional logit response models. The participants were
      children from Oslo, Norway. RESULTS: An association with inattention at age 8
      years was found for road traffic noise exposure at age 8 years (coef = .0083, CI 
      = [.0012, .0154]; 1.2% point increase in inattention score per 10 dB increase in 
      noise level), road traffic noise exposure average for the last 5 years (coef =
      .0090, CI = [.0016, .0164]; 1.3% point increase/10 dB), and for pregnancy road
      traffic noise exposure for boys (coef = .0091, CI = [.0010, .0171]), but not
      girls (coef = -.0021, CI = [-.0094, .0053]). Criteria for doing mediation
      analyses were not fulfilled. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that road traffic noise
      has a negative impact on children's inattention. We found no mediation by sleep
      duration.

TI  - Rural households at risk of malaria did not own sufficient insecticide treated
      nets at Dabat HDSS site: evidence from a cross sectional re-census.
PG  - 888
LID - 10.1186/s12889-017-4906-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of disease burden across the world,
      especially in African countries. Ethiopia has designed a five year (2011-2015)
      plan to cover 100% of the households in malarious areas with one insecticide
      treated net (ITN) for every two persons, and to raise consistent ITN utilization 
      to at least 80%. However, evidence on ownership of ITN among malarious rural
      households in northwest Ethiopia is quite limited. Hence, the present study aimed
      at assessing ownership of ITN and associated factors among rural households at
      risk of malaria at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site,
      northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross sectional re-census was carried out in Dabat
      Health and Demographic Surveillance System site during peak malaria seasons from 
      October to December, 2014. Data for 15,088 households at Dabat Health and
      Demographic Surveillance System site were used for the analysis. Descriptive
      measures and binary logistic regression were carried out. RESULTS: Among those
      who owned at least one ITN, 53.4% were living at an altitude >2500 m above sea
      level. However, out of households living at an altitude <2000 m above sea level, 
      15.8% (95% CI 14.4%, 17.3%) owned ITN at an average of 4.3 +/- 2.1 persons per
      ITN. Of these, 69.5% (95% CI 64.7%, 74.1%) used the ITN. Among utilizing
      households at malarious areas, 23.7% prioritized pregnant women and 31.4%
      children to use ITN. The availability of radio receiver/mobile (AOR 1.60, 95%CI
      1.08, 2.35) and secondary/above educational status of household member (AOR 1.54,
      95%CI 1.19, 2.04) were predictors of ownership of ITN. CONCLUSION: Rural
      households at risk of malaria did not own a sufficient number of ITN though the
      utilization is promising. Moreover, prioritizing children and pregnant women to
      sleep under ITN remains public health problems. Programmers, partners and
      implementers should consider tailored intervention strategy stratified by
      altitude in distributing ITN. ITN distribution should also be accompanied by
      using exhaustive promotion strategies that consider people without access to any 
      source of information, and educating households to prioritize pregnant and under 
      five children to sleep under ITN.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was shown to be associated with
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its
      relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM
      between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was
      used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor.
      Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA
      underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters.
      Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA.
      RESULTS: At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of
      the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4,
      12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose
      but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen
      desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and 
      more severe beta-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool
      involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was
      developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The
      overall accuracy was 70%. CONCLUSION: OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women
      with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA
      severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting
      glucose, insulin resistance, and beta-cell function. A simple screening tool
      involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting
      OSA in this patient group.

AB  - Obesity is one of the major health problems and a determining factor in the
      prevalence of diseases such as metabolic syndrome, asthma, sleep apnea,
      infertility and various types of cancer. Its origin is multifactorial, involving 
      genetic, socioeconomic and environmental factors. These last ones contribute
      mostly to explain the current epidemic growth of this disease. The sedentary
      lifestyle, inadequate diet, lack of sleep, alterations in intestinal microbiota
      and stress are factors related to its development. Since Barker presented his
      hypothesis about the "fetal origin of adult diseases", there are increasing
      number of studies that show the influence of an inadequate nutritional status and
      maternal weight in the development of chronic diseases, as obesity in offspring. 
      The nutritional deficiencies of the pregnant mother cause epigenetic
      modifications and abnormal programming of the development oforgans and devices,
      adapting the fetus to this situation of deficiency and being able to adapt to an 
      obesogenic environment after birth, increasing its propensity to obesity. Also,
      poor maternal nutritional status is related to intrauterine growth retardation
      and low birth weight infants, with a higher risk of childhood and adult central
      obesity. Currently, deficient intake of micronutrients and overweight or maternal
      obesity tend to overlap, and this combination may exacerbate the increase in
      obesity in the offspring. It is important to identify pregnant mothers at risk of
      suffering nutritional alterations and establish their improvement as a primary
      prevention strategy for overweight and obesity.

TI  - Association between maternal sleep practices and late stillbirth - findings from 
      a stillbirth case-control study.
PG  - 254-262
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.14967 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report maternal sleep practices in women who experienced a
      stillbirth compared with controls with ongoing live pregnancies at similar
      gestation. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Forty-one maternity
      units in the United Kingdom. POPULATION: Women who had a stillbirth after >/= 28 
      weeks' gestation (n = 291) and women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of
      interview (n = 733). METHODS: Data were collected using an
      interviewer-administered questionnaire that included questions on maternal sleep 
      practices before pregnancy, in the four weeks prior to, and on the night before
      the interview/stillbirth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal sleep practices during 
      pregnancy. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, supine going-to-sleep position the
      night before stillbirth had a 2.3-fold increased risk of late stillbirth
      [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.04-5.11] compared with the left side.
      In addition, women who had a stillbirth were more likely to report sleep duration
      less than 5.5 hours on the night before stillbirth (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.68), 
      getting up to the toilet once or less (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.85-4.26), and a daytime
      nap every day (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.94). No interaction was detected between
      supine going-to-sleep position and a small-for-gestational-age infant, maternal
      body mass index, or gestational age. The population-attributable risk for supine 
      going-to-sleep position was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5-9.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      confirms that supine going-to-sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. 
      Further work is required to determine whether intervention(s) can decrease the
      frequency of supine going-to-sleep position and the incidence of late stillbirth.
      TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with 2.3x
      increased risk of stillbirth after 28 weeks' gestation. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY:
      Stillbirth, the death of a baby before birth, is a tragedy for mothers and
      families. One approach to reduce stillbirths is to identify factors that are
      associated with stillbirth. There are few risk factors for stillbirth that can be
      easily changed, but this study is looking at identifying how mothers may be able 
      to reduce their risk. In this study, we interviewed 291 women who had a
      stillbirth and 733 women who had a live-born baby from 41 maternity units
      throughout the UK. The mothers who had a stillbirth were interviewed as soon as
      practical after their baby died. Mothers who had a live birth were interviewed
      during their pregnancies at the same times in pregnancy as when the stillbirths
      occurred. We did not interview mothers who had twins or who had a baby with a
      major abnormality. Mothers who went to sleep on their back had at least twice the
      risk of stillbirth compared with mothers who went to sleep on their left-hand
      side. This study suggests that 3.7% of stillbirths after 28 weeks of pregnancy
      were linked with going to sleep lying on the back. This study also shows that the
      link between going-to-sleep position and late stillbirth was not affected by the 
      duration of pregnancy after 28 weeks, the size of the baby, or the mother's
      weight. Women who got up to the toilet once or more at night had a reduced risk
      of stillbirth. This is the largest of four similar studies that have all shown
      the same link between the position in which a mother goes to sleep and stillbirth
      after 28 weeks of pregnancy. Further studies are needed to see whether women can 
      easily change their sleep position in late pregnancy and whether changing the
      position a mother goes to sleep in reduces stillbirth.

AB  - PURPOSE: To establish evidence based guidelines to advise patients on the
      relationship between habits, diet, certain circumstances, diseases and glaucoma. 
      METHODS: Review of all published articles on glaucoma and sports or other
      activities. The papers were classified according to the level of scientific
      evidence based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine classification.
      RESULTS: The evidence on the relationship between diet or supplements and the
      incidence or progression of glaucoma is insufficient to make a general
      recommendation for glaucoma patients. Although some studies on normal tension
      glaucoma suggest that Gingko biloba could reduce glaucoma progression, the
      results do not allow a general recommendation for all these patients. Similarly, 
      the evidence on the usefulness of vitamin supplements is not conclusive. The
      studies on smoking do not clearly demonstrate the relationship between this habit
      and incidence of glaucoma. Marihuana is not a useful treatment for glaucoma.
      Although the results on the relationship between sleep apnoea and glaucoma are
      heterogeneous, it is recommended that patients with moderate to intense apnoea
      are tested for glaucoma. Pregnancy does not influence the course of the disease, 
      but several hypotensive drugs may be harmful for the foetus. Nocturnal systemic
      hypotension is a risk factor for glaucoma progression. CONCLUSIONS: Certain
      habits, circumstances, or diseases may have an influence on the onset or
      progression of glaucoma. It is important to have adequate information about the
      scientific evidence in the publications in order to properly advise patients.

AB  - Evidence on the association between sleep, diet, and eating behaviors in pregnant
      women is lacking. We examine this in a cohort of apparently healthy pregnant
      women. At 26-28 weeks gestation, 497 participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep 
      Quality Index to assess sleep and a 24-h recall to assess dietary intake. Diet
      quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index for pregnant women in Singapore 
      (HEI-SGP) score and previously derived dietary patterns (vegetables-fruit-rice,
      seafood-noodles, and pasta-cheese-meat pattern). Eating behaviors studied
      included the longest night-time fasting interval, frequency of consumption
      occasions, energy from discretionary foods, and nighttime eating. Adjusted means 
      were estimated between poor/good quality and short/normal sleepers using linear
      regressions, including covariates. Good sleep quality versus poor sleep quality, 
      was associated with better diet quality (mean HEI-SGP 54.6 vs. 52.0; p = 0.032), 
      greater adherence to the vegetables-fruit-rice pattern (mean 0.03 vs. -0.15; p = 
      0.039), lesser adherence to the seafood-noodle pattern (mean -0.14 vs. 0.03; p = 
      0.024), and a trending lower calories from discretionary foods (mean 330.5 vs.
      382.6 kcal; p = 0.073), after adjusting for covariates. After additional
      adjustment for anxiety, only sleep quality and the seafood-noodle pattern
      remained significantly associated (p = 0.018). Short sleep was not associated
      with any diet or eating behavior. In conclusion, good sleep quality is associated
      with a better diet quality and a greater adherence to the vegetable-fruit-rice
      pattern, but with lesser adherence to the seafood-noodle diets in pregnant women.

      Recommendations, for a DMP "Chronic Heart Failure"
AB  - Key statement Research question The aim of the present investigation is to
      identify current, topic-relevant, evidence-based guidelines, extract their
      recommendations and designate those recommendations that are relevant for the
      care of patients in a disease management programme (DMP) "chronic heart failure".
      Conclusion On the basis of Grades of Recommendation (GoR) (or alternatively of
      Levels of Evidence [LoE]) of the extracted recommendations from current
      evidence-based guidelines, relevant and potentially relevant recommendations on
      all prespecified healthcare aspects were identified for a DMP "chronic heart
      failure". In addition, relevant and potentially relevant recommendations were
      identified on the healthcare aspects of patients with decompensated heart
      failure, palliative care, heart failure in specific patient groups, treatment of 
      concomitant diseases, right heart failure, DMPs, and nursing management of
      nursing facility residents with heart failure. The diagnostic recommendations
      refer to basic and further diagnostics of heart failure, as well as to the
      diagnostics of right heart failure. For non-drug therapy and general measures,
      recommendations were identified on lifestyle changes, diet, weight control, on
      physical activity/sports, as well as on vaccinations. For drug therapy, the
      recommendations identified refer to general aspects of drug therapy, as well as
      to treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers,
      angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, diuretics, cardiac
      glycosides, oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, antiarrhythmic drugs,
      isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine, inotropic drugs, as well as other drugs.
      Treatment with nutritional supplements is also addressed. For interventional
      therapy, the recommendations identified refer to cardiac resynchronization
      therapy, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, mechanical circulatory support,
      heart transplantation, and heart valve replacement or reconstruction.
      Furthermore, recommendations on patient monitoring and on patient training were
      identified. In addition, for patients with decompensated heart failure,
      recommendations were identified on diagnostics, hospital admission, treatment
      goals, non-drug and drug therapy, as well as on monitoring. Furthermore, the
      recommendations identified refer to the care of patients after decompensation of 
      chronic heart failure, to palliative care and to the cooperation of healthcare
      sectors. Specific recommendations were identified for heart failure in pregnancy 
      and in children and adolescents. In addition, for treatment of concomitant or
      triggering diseases, recommendations for patients with the following disorders
      were identified: sleep disorders, coronary heart disease, hypertension,
      myocarditis, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, constrictive
      pericarditis, ventricular rhythm disorders, atrial fibrillation, anaemia,
      depression, anxiety disorders or sexual dysfunction. Recommendations were also
      identified on DMPs and on heart failure management in skilled nursing facilities.

AB  - The in utero environment is inherently rhythmic, with the fetus subjected to
      circadian changes in temperature, substrates, and various maternal hormones.
      Meanwhile, the fetus is developing an endogenous circadian timing system,
      preparing for life in an external environment where light, food availability, and
      other environmental factors change predictably and repeatedly every 24 h. In
      humans, there are many situations that can disrupt circadian rhythms, including
      shift work, international travel, insomnias, and circadian rhythm disorders
      (e.g., advanced/delayed sleep phase disorder), with a growing consensus that this
      chronodisruption can have deleterious consequences for an individual's health and
      well-being. However, the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy on the
      health of both the mother and fetus is not well understood. In this review, we
      outline circadian timing system ontogeny in mammals and examine emerging research
      from animal models demonstrating long-term negative implications for progeny

LID - 10.1177/1099800417738363 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate relationships among obesity in pregnancy and plasma levels
      of tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenine (KYN), inflammatory markers, and depressed
      mood. METHODS: Pregnant women ( N = 374) were enrolled, and data were collected
      at a mean gestation of 20 weeks in this cross-sectional study. Plasma was
      analyzed for TRP, KYN, neopterin, and nitrite levels. Women completed demographic
      and mood scales. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant inverse
      correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TRP and positive correlations
      between BMI and KYN and the kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio. Neopterin was 
      correlated with KYN/TRP, suggesting that the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1
      (IDO-1) enzyme was activated. The correlations of neopterin and nitrite with BMI 
      were too small to be clinically meaningful but may provide mechanistic insight.
      There was a correlation between depressed mood and nitrite levels. Depressed mood
      was also associated with lower TRP levels. When the sample was divided into
      pregnant women with or without obesity, TRP was significantly lower and the
      KYN/TRP ratio was significantly higher in the women with obesity. CONCLUSION: The
      pro-inflammatory state of obesity in pregnancy may drive activation of IDO-1,
      resulting in diversion of TRP away from serotonin and melatonin production and
      toward KYN metabolites. This alteration could contribute to depression, impaired 
      sleep, increased production of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, and reinforcement
      of a pro-inflammatory state in pregnancy.

TI  - What Happens After Menopause? (WHAM): protocol for a prospective, multicentre,
      age-matched cohort trial of risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in
      high-risk premenopausal women.
PG  - e018758
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018758 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Women at high inherited risk of ovarian cancer are advised to
      undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) at age 40-45 years 
      or when their families are complete. Most women are premenopausal at this age, so
      RRBSO will induce surgical menopause. Despite the clear benefits of RRBSO for
      cancer risk reduction, much less is known about the impact on non-cancer outcomes
      that contribute to health and well-being and inform surveillance and management
      strategies. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be a multicentre, prospective cohort 
      study of 105 premenopausal high-risk women undergoing RRBSO and an age-matched
      comparison group of 105 premenopausal women not planning oophorectomy or
      pregnancy in the next 2 years. The aim of this study is to measure the impact of 
      RRBSO on sexual function (primary outcome) at 24 months in high-risk
      premenopausal women compared with the comparison group. Secondary outcomes
      include menopausal symptoms and menopause-related quality of life, mood, sleep
      quality, markers of cardiovascular disease and pre-diabetes, bone density and
      markers of bone turnover, and the impact of hormone replacement therapy use on
      these outcomes. Data analysis methods will include logistic and linear regression
      using general estimating equations accounting for the repeated outcome
      measurements within each participant. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has
      been approved by institutional ethics committees at each participating centre.
      Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference
      presentations, and national and international networks of centres managing
      high-risk women, and will inform national and international clinical guidelines. 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The pre-results protocol for this trial is registered 
      with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (anzctr.org.au;
      registration no: ACTRN12615000082505).

      Georgia.
PG  - 496-507
LID - 10.1007/s10900-017-0442-4 [doi]
AB  - Breastfeeding benefits both infant and mother, including reducing the risk of
      Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). To further reduce risk of SIDS, the American
      Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants sleep on their backs on a separate sleep
      surface. Our objective was to describe trends and factors associated with
      breastfeeding and infant sleep practices in Georgia. Pregnancy Risk Assessment
      Monitoring System 2004-2013 data were obtained from the Georgia Department of
      Public Health. Chi square tests for trends were utilized to determine whether
      there were significant linear trends in breastfeeding and infant sleep overtime
      and by survey phase. After exclusions, 4643 cases remained for analysis. From
      2004 to 2013, there was a slight (insignificant) decrease in breastfeeding
      initiation, with the highest proportion in 2010 (79.9%) and the lowest in 2013
      (66.9%). Rates of exclusive breastfeeding increased significantly from 2004
      (31.3%) to 2013 (81.7%). During that time, the proportion of infants being placed
      back to sleep slightly decreased (though not significantly), from 59.7 to 48.9%. 
      The proportion of mothers who reported never bed-sharing increased significantly 
      from 26.7 to 45.1% over this period. The decreasing breastfeeding initiation
      rates in Georgia diverge from national upward trends, however, exclusive
      breastfeeding rates by survey phase were slightly higher than national trends.
      Our results suggest the need for targeted education and support for breastfeeding
      and safe sleep practices. State-level trends data on breastfeeding and infant
      sleep practices provide valuable information for state-level public health
      professionals and policy makers, health care providers, and breastfeeding and
      safe sleep advocates.

      Obstetric Physicians.

AB  - Obstetricians may be a pregnant woman's primary professional source of
      information about her infant prior to the birth, but infant safe sleep knowledge,
      attitudes and behaviors of this population are unknown. This study explores
      obstetric physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to Sudden
      Infant Death Syndrome and infant safe sleep and identifies barriers as well as
      enabling and/or reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep
      education in the prenatal environment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted
      with obstetric physicians who provide prenatal healthcare to women in Ohio.
      Surveys were sent to all licensed physicians included in the registry of the
      State Medical Board of Ohio with "obstetrics," "obstetrics and gynecology," or
      "maternal and fetal medicine" as their primary specialty (n = 1771). The response
      rate was 30%, with 418 physicians included in the analysis. Many participants
      were knowledgeable about infant safe sleep recommendations; however, only 55%
      indicated that it was important for obstetric physicians to discuss Sudden Infant
      Death Syndrome and/or infant safe sleep with prenatal patients. Many participants
      (70%) perceived barriers to providing infant safe sleep education, however most
      (82%) indicated interest in doing so. Participants' knowledge and attitudes were 
      significant predictors of whether they discuss this topic with patients.
      Obstetric physicians can influence the infant safe sleep decisions that women
      make. Improving obstetricians' knowledge and attitudes about infant safe sleep
      and supporting physicians who wish to provide education on this topic may help to
      ensure that women are receiving frequent and consistent infant safe sleep
      messaging throughout the prenatal period.

TI  - Evaluation of a sudden unexpected death in infancy intervention programme aimed
      at improving parental awareness of risk factors and protective infant care
      practices.

AB  - AIM: Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) rates for Maori and Pacific
      infants remain higher than for other ethnic groups in New Zealand and bed-sharing
      is a major risk factor when there is smoking exposure in pregnancy. Sleep space
      programmes of education and Pepi-Pod baby beds require evaluation. METHODS: Two
      hundred and forty Maori and Pacific women and infants were randomised 1:1, to the
      Pepi-Pod sleep space programme, or to a control group with 'usual care'. When
      infants were under 2 weeks of age, baseline interviews occurred, followed up by
      interviews at 2 and 4 months of age to assess safe sleep knowledge, infant care
      practices and Pepi-Pod use and acceptability. All participants were offered a New
      Zealand Standard approved portable cot. RESULTS: At baseline, 25% of babies did
      not have a baby bed. Knowledge of smoking and bed-sharing as SUDI risks improved 
      at follow-up in both groups. One quarter regularly bed-shared at follow-up in
      both groups. Intention to bed-share was a strong predictor of subsequent
      behaviour. Pepi-Pods were regularly used by 46% at 2 months and 16% at 4 months
      follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Bed-sharing and knowledge improvement were similar
      irrespective of group. It is likely that the impact of the intervention was
      reduced because the control group received better support than 'usual care' and

TI  - Sleep disturbances and memory impairment among pregnant women consuming khat: An 
      under-recognized problem.
PG  - 247-251
LID - 10.4103/atm.ATM_24_17 [doi]
AB  - Khat (Catha edulis) is a evergreen flowering shrub that is cultivated at high
      altitudes, especially in East Africa and the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. 
      The plant contains alkaloids, of which cathinone and cathine have structural
      similarity and pharmacological action similar to amphetamines. The leaves are,
      therefore, consumed in some regions as a psychoactive stimulant due to cultural
      beliefs and misperceptions on the health benefits of khat consumption. This
      resulted in a growing prevalence of khat consumption among pregnant women. The
      myriad of physiological changes associated with pregnancy impairs sleep and
      memory. Moreover, khat has also been shown to have adverse effects on memory and 
      sleep. Therefore, its use during pregnancy may further aggravate those
      impairments. The purpose of this mini-review is to summarize the changes in sleep
      and memory during pregnancy and the evidence supporting a relationship between
      khat consumption and neurocognitive deficits and sleep dysfunctions. The
      misperceptions of beneficial effects of khat, the high prevalence of consumption 
      among pregnant women, and the possibility of under-reporting of khat abuse do
      necessitate the development of alternative methodologies to identify cases of
      unreported khat abuse in pregnant women. It is proposed that screening for sleep 
      problems and memory deficits may help identify under-reported cases of khat abuse
      in pregnant women.

TI  - Improving Sleep for Hospitalized Antepartum Patients: A Non-Randomized Controlled
      Pilot Study.
PG  - 1445-1453
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.6846 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate feasibility and efficacy of a hospital-based
      protocol for improving sleep in high- risk antepartum patients. METHODS: Sleep
      measures were compared during 1 week of hospitalization before and after
      implementing a Sleep Improvement Protocol for Antepartum Patients (SIP-AP). A
      non-randomized convenience sample of usual care controls was compared to a
      subsequent intervention sample after the protocol was implemented. Women were
      eligible if they spoke English, were medically stable, pregnant for at least 20
      weeks, and hospitalized at least 24 hours; 25 pregnant women had sufficient data 
      for analyses (11 controls, 14 intervention). Sleep was assessed in 3 ways: the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was completed after obtaining consent to estimate 
      sleep quality prior to hospital admission; sleep diary completed each hospital
      day; and General Sleep Disturbance Scale completed at 7 days or prior to hospital
      discharge. Symptoms that could affect sleep were assessed with the Memorial
      Symptom Assessment Scale. RESULTS: Both groups recorded similar sleep duration (7
      hours) but the intervention group had fewer symptoms and significantly (P = .015)
      lower sleep disturbance scores (53.1 +/- 14.5) than controls (71.9 +/- 18.8).
      Participant feedback about the intervention was positive, although adherence to
      components of the intervention protocol was variable. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot
      study provides evidence of the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the SIP-AP
      intervention for reducing symptoms and improving sleep of antepartum patients
      during hospitalization. Further detailed evaluation of specific components of
      this protocol is warranted, and other types of hospitalized patients may benefit 
      from unit-based modifications to this SIP-AP protocol.

AB  - Since the inception of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure (HF)
      guidelines in 2006, much has changed in the care for patients with HF. Over the
      past decade, the HF Guidelines Committee has published regular updates. However, 
      because of the major changes that have occurred, the Guidelines Committee
      believes that a comprehensive reassessment of the HF management recommendations
      is presently needed, with a view to producing a full and complete set of updated 
      guidelines. The primary and secondary Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF panel
      members as well as external experts have reviewed clinically relevant literature 
      to provide guidance for the practicing clinician. The 2017 HF guidelines provide 
      updated guidance on the diagnosis and management (self-care, pharmacologic,
      nonpharmacologic, device, and referral) that should aid in day-to-day decisions
      for caring for patients with HF. Among specific issues covered are risk scores,
      the differences in management for HF with preserved vs reduced ejection fraction,
      exercise and rehabilitation, implantable devices, revascularization, right
      ventricular dysfunction, anemia, and iron deficiency, cardiorenal syndrome, sleep
      apnea, cardiomyopathies, HF in pregnancy, cardio-oncology, and myocarditis. We
      devoted attention to strategies and treatments to prevent HF, to the organization
      of HF care, comorbidity management, as well as practical issues around the timing
      of referral and follow-up care. Recognition and treatment of advanced HF is
      another important aspect of this update, including how to select advanced
      therapies as well as end of life considerations. Finally, we acknowledge the
      remaining gaps in evidence that need to be filled by future research.

AB  - Short sleep duration has been linked to maternal hyperglycemia. Systematic review
      and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between sleep
      duration and hyperglycemia in pregnancy or gestational diabetes (GDM). MEDLINE
      and Scopus were searched until July 2017. Studies that assessed sleep duration
      and had objective measurements of hyperglycemia during pregnancy were eligible.
      Aggregate data were available from eight studies, n = 17,308 (seven with
      self-reported and one with objectively measured sleep duration). Meta-analysis
      was applied for pooling aggregate data using a random-effects model. Identified
      authors provided individual patient data (IPD) from four studies with objectively
      measured sleep duration, n = 287. A one-stage approach with a hierarchical
      mixed-effect logit model was applied to pool IPD across studies. Aggregate data
      analysis revealed that women with short sleep duration (<6-7 h) were more likely 
      to have GDM than women without short sleep duration, odds ratio 1.70 (95% CI:
      1.24, 2.33). IPD analysis demonstrated that, compared to sleeping >6.25 h, women 
      who slept </=6.25 h had higher 1-h glucose levels after 50-g oral glucose
      tolerance testing by 0.65 mmol/L (0.18, 1.13) and an increased risk of GDM,
      adjusted odds ratio 2.84 (1.25, 6.44). In conclusion, short sleep duration in
      pregnancy, both self-reported and objectively measured, is associated with
      hyperglycemia and an increased GDM risk.

AB  - Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from concurrent medical 
      symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) and sleeping problems. However, there
      is limited information on the correlation between co-morbidities and autistic
      behavioral symptoms. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of GI and sleep
      problems in Chinese ASD children, examined the impacts of GI and sleep problems
      on autistic behavioral symptoms, and investigated the factors associated with GI 
      and sleep problems. The survey included 169 ASD and 172 healthy children. Data
      regarding demographic characteristics, GI symptoms, sleep disturbances and
      behavioral symptoms were collected through questionnaires. GI and sleep problems 
      were prevalent in Chinese ASD children. Moreover, ASD children with GI symptoms
      reported more severe ASD core symptoms than others. Autistic children's GI
      symptoms were associated with maternal sleep problems during pregnancy, child's
      0-6 month food sources and picky eating. ASD children with sleep disturbances had
      lower performance in daily living skills, social cognition, social communication 
      and intellectual development than ASD children without sleep disturbances. Sleep 
      disturbances were associated with extra nutrient supply during lactation and
      feeding, and child's picky eating. Autistic children with GI or/and sleep
      problems may represent clinically relevant subtypes of ASD, for which targeted
      treatments may be needed.

TI  - Identification and prediction of the fertile window with a new web-based medical 
      device using a vaginal biosensor for measuring the circadian and circamensual
      core body temperature.

AB  - Fertility awareness-based (FAB) methods represent a term that includes all family
      planning methods that are based on the identification of the fertile window. They
      are based on the woman's observation of physiological signs of the fertile and
      infertile phases of the menstrual cycle. The first approach consists basically in
      symptothermal methods accompanied by cervical mucus measurements and clinical
      menstrual cycling data recording. The second most often used methods are the
      urinary measurement of E3G and luteinizing hormone (LH) with a personalized
      computer system. Hence these systems lack the efficacy of the continuous
      circadian and circamensual measurement of the core body temperature. Only this
      approach enables the accurate detection of the ovulation during the fertile
      window. A new medical device called OvulaRing has been developed to fill this
      gap. In the present study, the system and its first clinical results are
      presented. OvulaRing is a medical device used just like a tampon. The device is a
      vaginal ring of evatane that contains an integrated biosensor. This sensor
      measures continuously every 5 min the core body temperature throughout the entire
      cycle. This device allows a circadian and circamensual intravaginal exact
      measurement. With this system, 288 measurements are created per day. The system
      can detect retrospectively and predict prospectively the fertile window of the
      users. One hundred and fifty eight women aged between 18 and 45 years used this
      medical device in an open non-randomized clinical study for 15 months. A total of
      470 cycles could be recorded and were able for analysis. By the same time in a
      subgroup of patients, hormonal assessments of LH, follicle-stimulating hormone,
      estradiol and progesterone as well as vaginal ultrasound were performed in
      parallel between the 9th and the 36th day of the cycle. The validation error due 
      to software errors was 0.89% for the retrospective analysis; that means that the 
      accuracy for the detection of the ovulation was 99.11%. Accuracy of 88.8% for a
      window of 3 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation and the 3 days after
      ovulation was achieved for the prospective analysis. In the subgroup of woman
      with recorded pregnancies, it could be shown that after 3.79 months of use
      (median) pregnancies were observed. In 67.72% in up to 3 months, in 16.36%
      between 3 and 6 months of use, in 7.27% between 7 and 9 months, in 5.45% between 
      10 and 12 months and in 1.82% between 13 and 15 months of use of the system. With
      this new web-based system, a precise determination of the fertile window even in 
      women with ultralong cycles (>35 days) could be detected independently of their
      personal live circumstances. Exact determination of the fertile window is
      herewith possible so that OvulaRing represents an evolution in the FAB method for
      the cycle diagnosis of women with regular, irregular or anovulatory menstrual
      cycles.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To partner with obstetrical providers to increase promotion of the
      American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for infant safe sleep. Specifically,
      this study evaluates the effectiveness of the Safe Sleep Toolkit during
      obstetrical visits. Secondary objectives include improving provider and maternal 
      knowledge of safe sleep. METHODS: Obstetrical providers (n=11) and staff at an
      outpatient clinic were trained using the Safe Sleep Toolkit and encouraged to
      discuss infant safe sleep with pregnant women at their 28- or 36-week gestation
      appointment (n=111, 56 pre- and 55 post-intervention). Provider-reported time
      spent counseling women on safe sleep recommendations and safe sleep knowledge was
      measured before and after the intervention. Surveys were conducted with women
      assessing safe sleep knowledge, intention to follow guidelines, and whether safe 
      sleep was discussed at the appointment. RESULTS: Significantly more
      post-intervention women reported their provider had discussed safe sleep (78% vs 
      32%) (P<.001). Similarly, provider-reported discussion with women increased
      significantly for all safe sleep guidelines (82%-90% vs 8%-12%) (all P<.001).
      Maternal knowledge, especially surrounding unsafe sleep practices, improved
      significantly post-intervention. CONCLUSION: Training obstetricians to use a
      toolkit to promote infant safe sleep guidelines increases the prenatal delivery
      of this information, and improves pregnant women's knowledge and intentions
      regarding safe infant sleep.

AB  - Emerging literature suggests that sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) worsens over
      the course of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and fetal
      outcomes. Earlier studies, using mainly snoring as a surrogate marker for SDB,
      have shown an increase in the prevalence of SDB during pregnancy compared with
      that in the pregravid state. More recently, prospective observational studies in 
      which the investigators ascertained SDB by using complete polysomnography have
      shown a prevalence ranging from approximately 17% to 45% in the third trimester. 
      Pregnancy itself can be associated with daytime hypersomnolence, so complaints of
      increasing fatigue and sleepiness during pregnancy are not specific for SDB.
      Moreover, snoring in isolation also has relatively poor sensitivity and
      specificity as a screening tool for diagnosing maternal SDB. The indications for 
      screening for SDB during routine obstetric prenatal visits are still unclear, but
      observational studies indicate that maternal SDB is linked with the development
      of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational hypertension and gestational
      diabetes mellitus. Some studies also have identified a relationship between
      maternal SDB and the delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. Aside
      from a few small interventional studies of CPAP in pregnant patients with
      gestational hypertension, little currently is known about whether treatment of
      SDB during pregnancy improves clinical outcomes for the mother and/or baby.
      Additional current knowledge gaps include elucidating underlying mechanisms of
      maternal SDB, determining optimal treatment strategies, and understanding the
      trajectory of SDB after delivery.

TI  - Micronutrients Drift During Daily and Weekly Iron Supplementation in Non-anaemic 
      and Anaemic Pregnancy.

AB  - AIMS: Pregnancy is a phenomenon associated with dynamic changes in physical,
      mental and biochemical status of body and demands increased nutritional intake
      for developing foetus. The level of various micronutrients which act as
      co-factors for antioxidant enzymes or it-self as antioxidants gets altered with
      the progression of pregnancy. The present longitudinal study summarized the trend
      of selected micronutrients level in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida
      (NAP) supplemented with daily and weekly oral iron folic acid (IFA) tablet during
      pregnancy and postpartum. METHODS: A total of 200 primigravida {N = 100; NAP (Hb 
      > 11 g/dl) and N = 100 AP (Hb = 8-11 g/dl) assigned daily (N = 50) and weekly (N 
      = 50) supplementation} were recruited and overnight fasting blood samples were
      withdrawn at 13-16 weeks, after 3 months and 6 weeks postpartum. The serum iron, 
      copper, zinc, magnesium and manganese were estimated by inductively coupled
      plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometer. RESULTS: Serum manganese (p < 0.05) at 
      baseline and magnesium (p < 0.01) at postpartum was significantly different
      between NAP and AP supplemented with daily IFA tablets. The trend of copper found
      to be increased during pregnancy and later declined at postpartum in both the
      groups. Daily supplementation resulted in significantly high iron (p < 0.05) in
      NAP during third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Hypozincemia and hypomagnesemia was
      observed in anaemic pregnancy supplemented with weekly and daily IFA
      respectively. Clear evidence of altered micronutrients levels during healthy and 
      anaemic pregnancy was seen. The reference values may be drawn from this study for
      the nutritional assessment during pregnancy for healthy pregnancy outcomes. TRIAL

AB  - This review presents the current status of a method for prevention and timely
      correction of human functional disturbances that was first proposed by Russian
      neurologist Ya.I. Levin in 1998 and further developed by the authors. The
      approach is named "Music of the Brain" and is based on musical or music-like
      stimulation organized in strict accordance with the biopotentials of a patient's 
      brain. Initial studies on the music of the brain approach were analyzed, and its 
      limitations were noted. To enhance the efficiency and usability of the approach, 
      several combinations of music therapy with neurofeedback technique - musical
      neurofeedback - were developed. Enhanced efficiency of the approach has been
      shown for correction of functional disturbances during pregnancy and for
      elimination of stress-induced states in high technology specialists. The use and 
      advantages of musical neurofeedback technology for increasing human cognitive
      activity, correcting sleep disturbances and treatment of disorders of attention
      were verified. After further development and testing the approach may be suited
      for a wide range of therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures in the protection
      of public health.

TI  - Prenatal Nicotine Exposure Disrupts Infant Neural Markers of Orienting.
PG  - 897-902
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntx177 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) from maternal cigarette smoking is
      linked to developmental deficits, including impaired auditory processing,
      language, generalized intelligence, attention, and sleep. Fetal brain undergoes
      massive growth, organization, and connectivity during gestation, making it
      particularly vulnerable to neurotoxic insult. Nicotine binds to nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptors, which are extensively involved in growth, connectivity, 
      and function of developing neural circuitry and neurotransmitter systems. Thus,
      PNE may have long-term impact on neurobehavioral development. The purpose of this
      study was to compare the auditory K-complex, an event-related potential
      reflective of auditory gating, sleep preservation and memory consolidation during
      sleep, in infants with and without PNE and to relate these neural correlates to
      neurobehavioral development. Methods: We compared brain responses to an auditory 
      paired-click paradigm in 3- to 5-month-old infants during Stage 2 sleep, when the
      K-complex is best observed. We measured component amplitude and delta activity
      during the K-complex. Results: Infants with PNE demonstrated significantly
      smaller amplitude of the N550 component and reduced delta-band power within
      elicited K-complexes compared to nonexposed infants and also were less likely to 
      orient with a head turn to a novel auditory stimulus (bell ring) when awake.
      Conclusions: PNE may impair auditory sensory gating, which may contribute to
      disrupted sleep and to reduced auditory discrimination and learning, attention
      re-orienting, and/or arousal during wakefulness reported in other studies.
      Implications: Links between PNE and reduced K-complex amplitude and delta power
      may represent altered cholinergic and GABAergic synaptic programming and possibly
      reflect early neural bases for PNE-linked disruptions in sleep quality and
      auditory processing. These may pose significant disadvantage for language
      acquisition, attention, and social interaction necessary for academic and social 
      success.

TI  - Headache and pregnancy: a systematic review.
PG  - 106
LID - 10.1186/s10194-017-0816-0 [doi]
AB  - This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy
      with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy
      and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and
      breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in
      pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in
      the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common
      secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid
      hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic
      intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
      Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular
      events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early 
      diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and
      fetus life. It is especially important to identify "red flag symptoms" suggesting
      that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary 
      headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound 
      of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast
      ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the
      preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should
      always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an
      undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor 
      nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother
      and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a
      well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking
      into account all the benefits and possible risks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy and the obesity epidemic impacting women of reproductive age
      appear to predispose women to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. The aim
      of this study is to examine the association between OSA and adverse maternal
      outcomes in a national cohort. METHODS: The National Perinatal Information Center
      in the US was used to identify women with a delivery discharge diagnosis of OSA
      from 2010 to 2014. We used the International Classification of Diseases, ninth
      Revision to classify OSA diagnosis and maternal outcomes. MEASUREMENTS: The
      sample consisted of 1,577,632 gravidas with a rate of OSA of 0.12% (N = 1963).
      There was a significant association between OSA and preeclampsia (adjusted odds
      ratio (aOR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-2.54), eclampsia (aOR 2.95,
      1.08-8.02), and gestational diabetes (aOR 1.51, 1.34-1.72) after adjusting for a 
      comprehensive list of covariates which includes maternal obesity. OSA status was 
      also associated with a 2.5-3.5-fold increase in risk of severe complications such
      as cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. Length of hospital
      stay was significantly longer (5.1 + 5.6 vs 3.0 + 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and odds
      of an admission to an intensive care unit higher (aOR 2.74, 2.36-3.18) in women
      with OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to pregnant women without OSA, pregnant women
      with OSA have a significantly higher risk of pregnancy-specific complications
      such as gestational hypertensive conditions and gestational diabetes, and rare
      medical and surgical complications such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema,
      congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. OSA diagnosis was also associated
      with a longer hospital stay and significantly increased odds for admission to the
      intensive care unit.

      Population Record-Linkage Study.
LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsx158 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Sleep apnea in pregnancy is known to adversely affect birth outcomes.
      Whether in utero exposure to maternal sleep apnea is associated with long-term
      childhood consequences is unclear. Methods: Population-based longitudinal study
      of singleton infants born during 2002-2012 was conducted using linked birth,
      hospital, death, developmental, and educational records from New South Wales,
      Australia. Maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy was identified from hospital
      records. Outcomes were mortality and hospitalizations up to age 6, developmental 
      vulnerability in the first year of school (aged 5-6 years), and performance on
      standardized tests in the third year of school (aged 7-9 years). Cox proportional
      hazards and modified Poisson regression models were used to calculate hazard and 
      risk ratios for outcomes in children exposed to maternal apnea compared with
      those not exposed. Results: Two hundred nine of 626188 singleton infants were
      exposed to maternal sleep apnea. Maternal apnea was not significantly associated 
      with mortality (Fisher's exact p = .48), developmental vulnerability (adjusted RR
      1.29; 95% CI 0.75-2.21), special needs status (1.58; 0.61-4.07), or low numeracy 
      test scores (1.03; 0.63-1.67) but was associated with low reading test scores
      (1.55; 1.08-2.23). Maternal apnea significantly increased hospitalizations in the
      first year of life (adjusted HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.40-2.34) and between the first and
      sixth birthdays (1.41; 1.14-1.75). This is partly due to admissions for suspected
      pediatric sleep apnea. Conclusions: Maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy is
      associated with poorer childhood health. Its impact on developmental and
      cognitive outcomes warrants further investigation.

      menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 
      years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become
      depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when
      menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is
      associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones,
      an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other
      hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of
      aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the 
      menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier
      than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations 
      to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are
      affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular,
      skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, 
      mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests
      for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical
      investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of
      assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before 
      bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. 
      This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review
      is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on
      healthcare services.

TI  - SATB2-Associated Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: SATB2-associated syndrome (SAS) is a multisystem
      disorder characterized by significant neurodevelopmental compromise with limited 
      to absent speech, behavioral issues, and craniofacial anomalies. All individuals 
      described to date have manifest developmental delay / intellectual disability,
      with severe speech delay. Affected individuals often have hypotonia and feeding
      difficulties in infancy. Behavioral issues may include autistic features,
      hyperactivity, and aggressiveness. Craniofacial anomalies may include palatal
      abnormalities (cleft palate, high-arched palate, and bifid uvula), micrognathia, 
      and abnormal shape or size of the upper central incisors. Less common features
      include skeletal anomalies (osteopenia, pectus deformities, kyphosis/lordosis,
      and scoliosis), growth restriction, strabismus/refractive errors, congenital
      heart defects, genitourinary anomalies, and epilepsy. While dysmorphic features
      have been described in individuals with this condition, these features are not
      typically distinctive enough to allow for a clinical diagnosis of SAS.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SATB2-associated syndrome (SAS) is
      established in a proband by detection of one of the following: A heterozygous
      intragenic SATB2 pathogenic variant (61%). A heterozygous deletion at chromosome 
      2q33.1 that includes SATB2 (22%). An intragenic deletion or duplication of SATB2 
      (9%). A chromosome translocation with a chromosome 2q33.1 breakpoint that
      disrupts SATB2 (8%). MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is
      symptomatic. Nutritional support for feeding difficulties and management by a
      cleft/craniofacial team for those with palatal anomalies early in life. Early
      referral for developmental support/special education; standard treatment for
      dental anomalies, sleep disturbance, skeletal anomalies, seizure disorders,
      genitourinary anomalies, strabismus and refractive errors, and congenital heart
      defects. Surveillance: Evaluation of nutritional status, growth, and
      developmental progress at each visit; routine monitoring by a neurologist for
      those with epilepsy; annual sleep study in those with a history of sleep
      disturbance; evaluation for scoliosis/spine deformity at each visit and
      consideration of screening for osteopenia; routine evaluations by dentistry and
      ophthalmology. GENETIC COUNSELING: SATB2-associated syndrome (SAS) is an
      autosomal dominant disorder. Almost all probands with SAS reported to date have
      the disorder as the result of a de novo genetic event. In two families, parental 
      mosaicism seemed likely (given recurrence of SAS in sibs and failure to detect
      the genetic alteration in parental blood samples).To date, individuals with SAS
      are not known to reproduce. Once an SATB2 intragenic pathogenic variant, a 2q33.1
      deletion that includes SATB2, or a chromosome translocation affecting SATB2 has
      been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at
      increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.

TI  - Maternal melatonin or agomelatine therapy prevents programmed hypertension in
      male offspring of mother exposed to continuous light.
PG  - 636-643
LID - 10.1093/biolre/iox115 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension can originate from early-life insults, whereas maternal melatonin
      therapy can be protective in a variety of models of programmed hypertension. We
      hypothesize that melatonin or melatonin receptor agonist agomelatine can prevent 
      programmed hypertension in adult offspring induced by maternal exposure to
      continuous light. Female Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats randomly divided into four 
      groups: controls, rats exposed to continuous light, exposed to continuous light
      plus treated with agomelatine (50 mg/day i.p.), and exposed to continuous light
      plus treated with 0.01% melatonin in drinking water throughout pregnancy and
      lactation period. Male offspring (n = 10/group) from three litters were examined 
      at 12 weeks of age. Maternal continuous light exposure-induced hypertension in
      male offspring, which was prevented by melatonin or agomelatine therapy.
      Continuous light exposure did not affect melatonin pathway in adult offspring
      kidney. Genes that belong to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), sodium
      transporters, AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and circadian rhythm were
      potentially involved in the maternal exposure to continuous light-induced
      programmed hypertension. Maternal agomelatine therapy decreased Ace expression
      but increased Agtr2 and Mas1. Maternal melatonin therapy prevented the increases 
      of Slc9a3, Slc12a3, and Atp1a1 expression induced by maternal continuous light
      exposure. In conclusion, maternal melatonin or agomelatine therapy prevents
      programmed hypertension induced by maternal exposure to continuous light.
      Agomelatine and melatonin reprogram the RAS and sodium transporters
      differentially, to prevent negative programming of continuous light. Our data
      highlight candidate genes and pathways in renal programming as targets for
      therapeutic approaches to prevent programmed hypertension caused by early-life
      disturbance of the circadian rhythm.

TI  - An investigation of fetal behavioural states during maternal sleep in healthy
      late gestation pregnancy: an observational study.
PG  - 7441-7450
LID - 10.1113/JP275084 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Fetal behavioural state in healthy late gestation pregnancy is
      significantly affected by maternal position overnight. Maternal left lateral
      position is the one most frequently adopted at sleep onset. The maternal position
      at sleep onset is maintained the longest overnight. Fetal state 1F is more common
      in maternal supine positions overnight. Fetal state 4F is less common in maternal
      supine sleep positions. Fetal state and maternal sleep position are independently
      associated with fetal heart rate variability. Maternal sleep position
      significantly affects fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and affects
      circadian fetal heart rate patterns. ABSTRACT: Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are
      measures of fetal wellbeing. Maternal position affects FBS with supine position
      being associated with an increased likelihood of fetal quiescence consistent with
      the human fetus adapting to a lower oxygen consuming state. Several studies have 
      now confirmed the association between sleep position and risk of late
      intrauterine death. We designed this study to observe the effects of maternal
      sleep positions overnight in healthy late gestation pregnancy. Twenty-nine
      healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings overnight. Two blinded
      observers assigned fetal states in 5 min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate
      variability (FHRV) were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Maternal position 
      was determined from infrared video recording. Compared to state 2F (active
      sleep), 4F (active awake-high activity) occurred almost exclusively when the
      mother was in a left or right lateral position. State 1F (quiet sleep) was more
      common when the mother was supine [odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 1.11-1.52] and less common on the maternal right side with the left being
      the referent position (OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.70-0.93). State 4F was more common
      between 21.00 and 01.00 h than between 01.00 and 07.00 h (OR 2.83, 95% CI
      2.32-3.47). In each fetal state, maternal position had significant effects on
      fetal heart rate and measures of FHRV. In healthy late gestation pregnancy,
      maternal sleep position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are
      probably fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

TI  - The significance of breastfeeding on sleep patterns during the first 48 hours
      postpartum for first time mothers.
PG  - 316-320
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2017.1353594 [doi]
AB  - Postpartum women sleep less during the early days following delivery. Long-term
      sleep disturbance and fatigue can have significant implications for physical and 
      mental health, relationships, employment and parental competence. Most studies
      focus on the quality and quantity of maternal sleep between weeks one and six
      postpartum. We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time 
      mothers immediately following delivery. Thirty first-time mothers completed a
      postnatal sleep questionnaire, detailing their total sleep time (TST), the
      reasons for being awake and their level of fatigue. The logs were completed in
      real time during the first 48 h postpartum, while they were still in a hospital
      environment. The data collected from the mothers in the study indicated that the 
      mean TST in the first 48 h was 9.7 h. Of the factors explored only breastfeeding 
      influenced the TST. Breastfeeding women slept on average 2.6 h longer than women 
      who bottle-fed (p = .042). Impact statement What is already known on this
      subject: Childbearing affects women's sleep in many ways. Hormonal changes during
      pregnancy and postpartum as well as physiological and anatomical alterations, and
      the process of adaptation to the new parent's responsibilities contribute to
      changes in sleep architecture. Since first study of sleep and pregnancy published
      in 1968 there have been very few publications addressing maternal sleep
      postpartum. Most studies which have focussed on quality of maternal sleep in the 
      first 6-months postpartum period describe the relationships between poor maternal
      sleep and postpartum depression and other mental health outcomes. What the
      results of this study add: We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness
      of first-time mothers immediately following delivery while they remained in the
      hospital environment. We found that environmental factors such as background
      noise, shared rooms, type of delivery, feeding and worrying about the neonate did
      not influence the total sleep time, however, the main outcome of our study is
      that breastfeeding promotes maternal sleep. What the implications are of these
      findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that this
      study would be of interest to many obstetricians, general practitioners, nurses
      and midwives as well as to the general public. Appropriate counselling of
      patients early in postnatal period can improve their sleep patterns and reduce
      the risk of depression and other abnormal physical, psychological and social
      outcomes.

      Wellness and Healthy Behaviors During the Transition to Parenthood?
PG  - e325

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 18% of men experience depression and/or anxiety during the
      transition to parenthood. Interventions designed specifically to promote the
      mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce.
      Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing 
      mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new
      fathers. OBJECTIVE: To guide the development of Healthydads.ca, a website
      designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a
      needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers' perspectives of barriers to
      seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting
      the decision to visit such a website. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-four men
      whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian
      provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring
      about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to
      parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the
      decision to visit a father-focused website. RESULTS: Most men (155/174, 89.1%)
      reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an
      average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the
      Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per
      month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional
      wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance
      (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174,
      72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling
      that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that
      were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting
      (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, 
      work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and
      managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant
      (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and
      having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important
      factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and
      easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge
      (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website
      visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional
      (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal
      motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a
      revisit. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest
      among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to
      prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health.
      Specific user and website features were identified to optimize the use of
      father-focused websites.

AB  - Sleep related breathing disorders include central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive 
      sleep apnea (OSA), sleep-related hypoventilation, and sleep-related hypoxia.
      These disorders are frequent and growing in clinical relevance. The related
      chapter of the S3 guideline "Non-restorative sleep/Sleep disorders", published by
      the German Sleep Society (DGSM), has recently been updated in November 2016.
      Epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutic procedures, and classification of sleep
      related disorders have been revised. Concerning epidemiology, a considerably
      higher mortality rate among pregnant women with OSA has been emphasized. With
      regards to diagnostics, the authors point out that respiratory polygraphy may be 
      sufficient in diagnosing OSA, if a typical clinical condition is given. For CSA, 
      recommendations were changed to diagnose CSA with low apnea rates present.
      Significant changes for treating CSA in patients with left ventricular
      dysfunction have been introduced. In addition, there is now to be differentiated 
      between sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxaemia. Obesity
      hypoventilation syndrome is discussed in more detail. This article sums up and
      comments on the published changes.

AB  - Pregnant women and their fetuses represent susceptible populations to
      environmental contaminants. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
      among pregnant women may contribute to adverse birth outcomes such as preterm
      birth. Multiple previous studies have assessed airborne sources of PAHs among
      pregnant women but few have measured urinary PAH metabolites which can capture
      total exposure through multiple routes. The aim of this study was to bridge this 
      knowledge gap by assessing longitudinal urinary PAH metabolite concentrations
      over two time points in pregnancy cohorts in Boston (N = 200) and Puerto Rico (N 
      = 50) to better understand exposure distributions throughout pregnancy and how
      they relate to demographic factors. Urine samples were analyzed for 1-NAP, 2-NAP,
      2-FLU, 1-PHE, 2,3-PHE, 4-PHE, 9-PHE, and 1-PYR. Concentrations of 2-NAP, 1-PYR,
      and 4-PHE were higher in Puerto Rico, while all other metabolites were present in
      higher concentrations in Boston. In Puerto Rico, intraclass correlation
      coefficients (ICC) were weak to moderate, ranging from 0.06 to 0.42. PAH
      metabolite concentrations were significantly higher among younger, heavier
      (except 1-NAP and 9-PHE), and less educated individuals in Boston only.
      Consistent significant associations between PAH concentrations and measured
      covariates were not found in Puerto Rico. Our results suggest that potentially
      important differences in PAH exposure exist between these two populations.
      Additionally, our results indicate that multiple urinary measurements are
      required to accurately assess PAH exposure throughout pregnancy.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0185266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of primary
      interventions aiming to prevent excess weight gain among young children.
      Evaluating behavioral changes, such as physical activity (PA), may add to future 
      development of efficient interventions. The objective was to evaluate the effect 
      on PA outcomes of the 15 month Healthy Start intervention that focused on
      changing diet, PA, sleep and stress management among normal weight but
      obesity-prone preschool children. Children were defined as obesity-prone if they 
      had a birth weight > 4,000 g, mothers with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of >
      28 kg/m2, or mothers with </= 10 years of schooling. METHOD: From a baseline
      study population of 635 normal weight 2-6 year old preschool children from the
      greater Copenhagen area, parents of 307 children had given information on PA at
      both the baseline and follow-up examinations. PA was obtained from a 7 days
      recording in the Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire. Time used for sport 
      activities were combined with outdoor playing time to achieve a proxy of total PA
      level of moderate to vigorous intensity. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses
      revealed that at follow-up the intervention group spent more time on sports and
      outdoor activities combined per week than the control group (ITT analyses:
      intervention: 400 min/week; 95% confidence interval (CI): 341, 459 versus
      control: 321 min/week; 95% CI: 277, 366; p = 0.02), although no significant
      intervention effects were seen for each of the subcategories, e.g. sports
      participation, outdoor activities, screen time, or commuting frequency.
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the overall time spent on sports and outdoor
      activities combined was increased at follow-up among normal weight obesity-prone 
      children, as a result of the Healthy Start intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Perinatal Immune Activation Produces Persistent Sleep Alterations and
      Epileptiform Activity in Male Mice.
PG  - 482-491
LID - 10.1038/npp.2017.243 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests a role for inflammation in neuropsychiatric
      conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous work in rodents
      has established that immune activation during critical developmental periods can 
      cause phenotypes that reproduce core features of ASD, including decreased social 
      interaction, aberrant communication, and increased repetitive behavior. In
      humans, ASD is frequently associated with comorbid medical conditions including
      sleep disorders, motor hyperactivity, and seizures. Here we use a 'two-hit'
      immune-activation paradigm to determine whether perinatal immune activation can
      also produce these comorbid features in mice. In this paradigm, we treated
      timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which
      simulates a viral infection, on gestational day 12.5 according to an established 
      maternal immune activation regimen. A subset of the offspring also received a
      second 'hit' of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which simulates a bacterial infection, 
      on postnatal day 9. At 6 weeks of age, mice were implanted with wireless
      telemetry transmitters that enabled continuous measurements of
      electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), locomotor activity, and
      subcutaneous temperature. Effects at 7 and 12 weeks of age were compared. Both
      prenatal Poly I:C and postnatal LPS produced changes in locomotor activity and
      temperature patterns, increases in slow-wave sleep, and shifts in EEG spectral
      power, several of which persisted at 12 weeks of age. Postnatal LPS also produced
      persistent increases in spontaneous bursts of epileptiform activity (spike-wave
      discharges) that occurred predominantly during sleep. Our findings demonstrate
      that early-life immune activation can lead to long-lasting physiologic
      perturbations that resemble medical comorbidities often seen in ASD and other
      neuropsychiatric conditions.

TI  - Economic Hardship in Childhood: A Neglected Issue in ACE Studies?
PG  - 308-317
LID - 10.1007/s10995-017-2368-y [doi]
AB  - Objectives Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked with ill-health 
      in adulthood, but ACE literature has focused on family disruption or dysfunction 
      (e.g., child abuse, parental separation), with less attention to economic
      adversity. We examined whether a mother's economic hardship in childhood (EHC)
      was associated with women's hardships and health-risk behaviors during/just
      before pregnancy. Methods We analyzed population-based survey data on 27,102
      postpartum California women. EHC included respondents' reports that during
      childhood they/their families experienced hunger because of inability to afford
      food or moved because of problems paying rent/mortgage and the frequency of
      difficulty paying for basic needs. We examined six maternal hardships/behaviors
      during/just before pregnancy, including four hardships (poverty, food insecurity,
      homelessness/no regular place to sleep, intimate partner violence) and two
      behaviors (smoking, binge drinking). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated from
      sequential logistic regression models estimating associations between EHC
      (categorized by level of hardship) and each maternal hardship/behavior, first
      without adjustment, then adjusting for other childhood and current maternal
      factors, and finally adding family disruption/dysfunction. Results Before
      adjustment for family disruption/dysfunction, the highest and intermediate EHC
      levels were associated with each maternal hardship/behavior; after full
      adjustment, those associations persisted except with smoking. Higher EHC levels
      generally appeared associated with larger PRs, although confidence intervals
      overlapped. Conclusions for Policy/Practice These findings link childhood
      economic hardship with women's hardships, binge drinking, and possibly smoking
      around the time of pregnancy. Without establishing causality, they support
      previous research indicating that childhood economic adversity should be
      considered an ACE.

      transgenerational mood disorder-like behaviors in mice.
PG  - 12641
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-13067-y [doi]
AB  - It remains unknown whether chronic circadian disturbance (CCD) during pregnancy
      can lead to mood disorders in the offspring. Here we show that pregnant mice in
      the F0 generation that were exposed to CCD stress displayed depression-like
      behaviors, and produced offspring in the F1 and F2 generations that also
      exhibited mood-associated behavioral phenotypes despite the lack of direct
      stressful experiences during their postnatal or adult period. Prenatal CCD stress
      was correlated with the elevation of plasma corticosterone levels in F1 mice.
      Furthermore, the diurnal expression profiles of core circadian clock genes were
      disrupted in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of F1 mice. Proteomics analysis revealed
      that prenatal CCD stress resulted in distinct changes in protein expression in
      the hypothalamus of female F1 mice, in particular proteins that were associated
      with cellular activities, metabolism, development and diseases. Sex-specific
      differences in melanocortin 4 receptor expression were apparent in the CCD F1
      generation. We conclude that maternal exposure to chronic circadian disturbance
      during pregnancy can lead to sex-specific mood disorders that persist for at
      least two filial generations. The underlying mechanisms may depend on
      transgenerational changes in plasma corticosterone levels, circadian pacemaking, 
      and hypothalamic protein expression.

TI  - Sensory exposure of neonates in single-room environments (SENSE): an
      observational study of light.
PG  - F436-F440
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2017-312977 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the internal and external light exposure of incubators and
      open cots in an Australian single-room configured neonatal unit and compare
      findings to current recommendations. METHODS: Light meters were placed in the
      internal and external environment of incubators and open cots within occupied
      single rooms in a tertiary-level neonatal unit between 15 September and 28
      October 2015. Data were recorded in one-second increments over a minimum of 48
      hours per room. RESULTS: Internal median light in incubators and open cots
      predominantly fell below 50 lux, with low amplitude diurnal cycling. Incubator
      covers substantially reduced external light exposure, contributing to very low
      light conditions (<10 lux). Periodically, light inside incubators peaked six
      times greater than the maximum recommendation of 600 lux. Overall, internal
      incubator and open cot lighting in the neonatal unit met American Academy of
      Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      recommendations for 65.1% of the time during the day and 25.6% overnight.
      Australasian Health Infrastructure Alliance recommendations were met for 6.7% of 
      the time during the day and 2.4% overnight. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, light levels
      fell predominantly below 50 lux with peak periods of extreme light exposure. Low 
      amplitude cyclic light was evident, but it remains unknown if this is sufficient 
      to produce an effect on circadian entrainment, especially in preterm neonates.
      Current guidelines do not stipulate optimal cyclic light levels in neonatal units
      to promote circadian rhythms in the newborn population. Further research to
      determine well-defined lighting parameters for neonates of different gestations
      is paramount.

TI  - On the difference of cardiorespiratory synchronisation and coordination.
PG  - 093933
LID - 10.1063/1.4999352 [doi]
AB  - Cardiorespiratory phase synchronisation (CRS) is a type of cardiorespiratory
      coupling that manifests through a prediliction for heart beats to occur at
      specific points relative to the phase of the respiratory cycle. It has been under
      investigation for nearly 20 years, and while it seems to be mostly occurring in
      relaxed states such as deep sleep and anesthesia, no clear clinical implications 
      have been established. Cardiorespiratory coordination (CRC) is a recent
      development in this field where the relationship between the respiratory onset
      and heart beat is analysed in the time domain and the possible relationship of
      each heart beat is considered for both the previous and the next respiratory
      onset. This ostensibly closely related effect must not only show relevant
      information content but also do so independent of CRS in order to be relevant for
      future studies. In this paper, we investigate CRC and its relation to CRS mainly 
      using graphical and statistical methods on two exemplary datasets: measurements
      from a pregnant woman participating in a preeclampsia study and those from a man 
      suffering from sleep apnea. We show fundamental differences between the results
      of both approaches and are able to show a formerly unknown dependency between the
      heart activity and respiratory rate, potentially indicating heartbeat-initiated
      inspiration. Despite their differences, methods developed for the quantification 
      of CRS can be adapted to CRC. Completing the comparison is an investigation into 
      the relationship between CRC and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Similar to
      previous results for CRS, the two effects are found to be orthogonal, meaning
      that they can be observed independently or in conjunction.

AB  - Sex-bias in gene expression is a widespread mechanism for controlling the
      development of phenotypes that differ between males and females. Most studies on 
      sex-bias in gene expression have focused on species that exhibit traditional
      sex-roles (male-male competition and female parental care). By contrast the
      Syngnathid fishes (sea horses, pipefish, and sea dragons) are a group of
      organisms where many species exhibit male brooding and sex-role reversal
      (female-female competition for mates and paternal parental care), and little is
      known about how patterns of sex-bias in gene expression vary in species with
      sex-role reversal. Here we utilize RNA-seq technology to investigate patterns of 
      sex-bias in gene expression in the brain tissue of the Gulf Pipefish (Syngnathus 
      scovelli) a species that exhibits sex-role reversal. Gene expression analysis
      identified 73 sex-biased genes, 26 genes upregulated in females and 47 genes
      upregulated in males. Gene ontology analysis found 52 terms enriched for the
      sex-biased genes in a wide range of pathways suggesting that multiple functions
      and processes differ between the sexes. We focused on two areas of interest: sex 
      steroids/hormones and circadian rhythms, both of which exhibited sex-bias in gene
      expression, and are known to influence sexual development in other species.
      Lastly, the work presented herein contributes to a growing body of genome data
      available for the Syngnathids, increasing our knowledge on patterns of gene
      expression in these unusual fishes.

LID - 10.1080/01616412.2017.1376394 [doi]
AB  - AIM/BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological and sleep
      disorder. Metabolic disorders are known to be related to sleep disorders. We
      prospectively evaluated whether obesity and its possible cofactors were related
      to the presence of RLS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 143 obese and
      94 non-obese individuals. Obese patients had a BMI of 30 and over, while
      non-obese patients had a BMI lower than 30. Patients with arthritis and pregnancy
      were excluded but not those with diabetes mellitus. Participants who met
      diagnostic criteria recommended by the International RLS Study Group were
      diagnosed as having RLS. Depression, anxiety, daytime sleepiness, insomnia and
      sleep quality were evaluated in detail. RESULTS: The mean age of obese patients
      was 40.52 years and that of non-obese patients was 39.76 years. The mean body
      mass index was 36.77 in the obese group and 25.71 in the non-obese group. The
      occurrence of depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and insomnia scores were
      significantly higher in obese individuals. The evaluations of daytime sleepiness,
      sleep efficiency and sleep latency were not significantly different between the
      groups. DISCUSSION: Although the presence of RLS was correlated with obesity and 
      vascular risk factors at a significant level, it was also shown that depression, 
      anxiety and insomnia were significantly frequent in obese patients (although not 
      daytime sleepiness). Further studies are needed.

LID - 10.1111/apa.14079 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine the effect of music on sleep-wake cycle (SWC) patterns in late 
      preterm neonates. METHODS: In a masked crossover study, infants between 32 and 36
      6/7 weeks gestation were randomised to music exposure either during the first six
      or last six hours of a 12-hour observation period. SWC characteristics were
      determined by continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) read 
      by two coders masked to exposure sequence. Analysis was performed in paired
      comparisons. ANOVA was used to assess the effects of music exposure, period and
      crossover on SWC outcomes: (i) Burdjalov Scores (BS) during active sleep (AS)
      (ii) per cent and duration of quiet sleep (QS). RESULTS: Thirty infants were
      studied. A total of 222 QS cycles (median seven per patient; range five to 12)
      were analysed. Music exposure was associated with higher BS (F = 10.60, p =
      0.0019) in AS and decreased interruptions during QS. The advanced postconceptual 
      age (PCA) SWC pattern during AS was equivalent to a one-week mean. Number,
      duration and ratio of QS cycles did not change with music exposure. CONCLUSION:
      Music exposure elicits an increasing PCA pattern in AS and fewer interruptions in
      QS. Music may benefit sleep in late preterm infants.

TI  - Risk of glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes mellitus in relation to
      maternal habitual snoring during early pregnancy.
PG  - e0184966
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0184966 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring is known to be
      associated with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes among both men and
      non-pregnant women. We examined the association of habitual snoring during early 
      pregnancy with risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM). METHODS: A cohort of 1,579 women was interviewed during early
      pregnancy. We collected information about snoring frequency during early
      pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic tests for IGT and GDM were
      abstracted from medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were
      fitted to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of IGT 
      and GDM associated with snoring in early pregnancy. RESULTS: Overall, women who
      snored "most or all of the time" had a 2.1-fold increased odds of IGT (OR 2.10;
      95% CI 1.31-3.35) and a 2.5-fold increased odds of GDM (OR 2.50; 95% CI
      1.34-4.67) as compared with women who never snored. Compared with lean women
      (pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2) who did not snore, lean snorers
      had a 2-fold increased odds of GDM (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.07-3.68). The odds of
      GDM risk was particularly elevated among overweight women (BMI >/= 25 kg/m2) who 
      snored (OR = 5.01; 95% CI 2.71-9.26). However, there was no evidence of an
      interaction between overweight and snoring with GDM risk (p-value = 0.144).
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings, if confirmed, may have important implications for
      tailoring prenatal care for overweight pregnant women, and /or those with a
      history of habitual snoring in early pregnancy.

TI  - Thin blue lines: product placement and the drama of pregnancy testing in British 
      cinema and television.
PG  - 495-520
LID - 10.1017/S0007087417000619 [doi]
AB  - This article uses the case of pregnancy testing in Britain to investigate the
      process whereby new and often controversial reproductive technologies are made
      visible and normalized in mainstream entertainment media. It shows how in the
      1980s and 1990s the then nascent product placement industry was instrumental in
      embedding pregnancy testing in British cinema and television's dramatic
      productions. In this period, the pregnancy-test close-up became a conventional
      trope and the thin blue lines associated with Unilever's Clearblue rose to
      prominence in mainstream consumer culture. This article investigates the
      aestheticization of pregnancy testing and shows how increasingly visible public
      concerns about 'schoolgirl mums', abortion and the biological clock, dramatized
      on the big and small screen, propelled the commercial rise of Clearblue. It
      argues that the Clearblue close-up ambiguously concealed as much as it revealed; 
      abstraction, ambiguity and flexibility were its keys to success.

TI  - Deciphering the Function of the Blunt Circadian Rhythm of Melatonin in the
      Newborn Lamb: Impact on Adrenal and Heart.
PG  - 2895-2905
LID - 10.1210/en.2017-00254 [doi]
AB  - Neonatal lambs, as with human and other neonates, have low arrhythmic endogenous 
      levels of melatonin for several weeks until they start their own pineal rhythm of
      melatonin production at approximately 2 weeks of life. During pregnancy, daily
      rhythmic transfer of maternal melatonin to the fetus has important physiological 
      roles in sheep, nonhuman primates, and rats. This melatonin rhythm provides a
      circadian signal and also participates in adjusting the physiology of several
      organs in preparation for extrauterine life. We propose that the ensuing absence 
      of a melatonin rhythm plays a role in neonatal adaptation. To test this
      hypothesis, we studied the effects of imposing a high-amplitude melatonin rhythm 
      in the newborn lamb on (1) clock time-related changes in cortisol and plasma
      variables and (2) clock time-related changes of gene expression of clock genes
      and selected functional genes in the adrenal gland and heart. We treated newborn 
      lambs with a daily oral dose of melatonin (0.25 mg/kg) from birth to 5 days of
      age, recreating a high-amplitude melatonin rhythm. This treatment suppressed
      clock time-related changes of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, clock
      gene expression, and functional genes in the newborn adrenal gland. In the heart,
      it decreased heart/body weight ratio, increased expression of Anp and Bnp, and
      resulted in different heart gene expression from control newborns. The
      interference of this postnatal melatonin treatment with the normal postnatal
      pattern of adrenocortical function and heart development support a physiological 
      role for the window of flat postnatal melatonin levels during the neonatal
      transition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Modern technology may have desensitised the 'biological clock' to
      environmental cues, disrupting the appropriate co-ordination of metabolic
      processes. Susceptibility to misalignment of circadian rhythms may be partly
      genetically influenced and effects on sleep quality and duration could predispose
      to poorer health outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is associated with obesity
      traits, which are brought on by an increased opportunity to eat and/or a shift of
      hormonal profile promoting hunger. We hypothesised that increased sleep duration 
      will offset susceptible genetic effects, resulting in reduced obesity risk.
      METHODS: We recruited 643 (male: 338; female: 305) European children born to
      participants in the New Zealand centre of the International Screening for
      Pregnancy Endpoints sleep study. Ten genes directly involved in the circadian
      rhythm machinery and a further 20 genes hypothesised to be driven by cyclic
      oscillations were evaluated by Sequenom assay. Multivariable regression was
      performed to test the interaction between gene variants and average sleep length 
      (derived from actigraphy), in relation to obesity traits (body mass index (BMI)
      z-scores and percentage body fat (PBF)). RESULTS: No association was found
      between average sleep length and BMI z-scores (p = 0.056) or PBF (p = 0.609).
      Uncorrected genotype associations were detected between STAT-rs8069645 (p =
      0.0052) and ADIPOQ-rs266729 (p = 0.019) with differences in average sleep
      duration. Evidence for uncorrected gene-by-sleep interactions of the

      0.046) were found in relation to BMI z-scores but not for PBF. CONCLUSION: Our
      results indicate that children may have different genetic susceptibility to the
      effects of sleep duration on obesity. Further confirmatory studies are required
      in other population cohorts of different age groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses
      following childbirth (i.e. "postpartum psychosis", PP) and there is a need to
      identify which factors underlie this increased risk. Vulnerability to mood
      dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is
      typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes 
      triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder
      (BD). METHODS: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the
      Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal
      episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether
      mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of
      PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following
      sleep loss. RESULTS: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania
      were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI =
      1.47-2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no
      significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p =
      0.526). LIMITATIONS: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall
      bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred
      during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical 
      practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased 
      vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or
      planning to conceive.

TI  - Effects of the Healthy Start randomized intervention on dietary intake among
      obesity-prone normal-weight children.
PG  - 2988-2997
LID - 10.1017/S1368980017002026 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 15-month intervention on
      dietary intake conducted among obesity-prone normal-weight pre-school children.
      DESIGN: Information on dietary intake was obtained using a 4 d diet record. A
      diet quality index was adapted to assess how well children's diet complied with
      the Danish national guidelines. Linear regression per protocol and
      intention-to-treat analyses of differences in intakes of energy, macronutrients, 
      fruit, vegetables, fish, sugar-sweetened beverages and diet quality index between
      the two groups were conducted. SETTING: The Healthy Start study was conducted
      during 2009-2011, focusing on changing diet, physical activity, sleep and stress 
      management to prevent excessive weight gain among Danish children. SUBJECTS: From
      a population of 635 Danish pre-school children, who had a high birth weight
      (>/=4000 g), high maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (>/=28.0 kg/m2) or low maternal
      educational level (<10 years of schooling), 285 children completed the
      intervention and had complete information on dietary intake. RESULTS: Children in
      the intervention group had a lower energy intake after the 15-month intervention 
      (group means: 5.29 v. 5.59 MJ, P=0.02) compared with the control group. We
      observed lower intakes of carbohydrates and added sugar in the intervention group
      compared with the control group after the intervention (P=0.002, P=0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: The intervention resulted in a lower energy intake, particularly
      from carbohydrates and added sugar after 15 months of intervention, suggesting
      that dietary intake can be changed in a healthier direction in children
      predisposed to obesity.

TI  - Maternal Habitual Midday Napping Duration and Frequency are Associated with High 
      Birthweight.
PG  - 10564
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-09683-3 [doi]
AB  - Habitual midday napping is a common habit in China, especially for pregnant
      women. The purpose of this study was to examine whether duration and frequency of
      maternal habitual midday napping were associated with high birthweight (HBW). A
      total of 10,482 participants from Healthy Baby Cohort were include in our
      analysis. The information of the mothers and their infants were abstracted from
      medical records, or obtained from questionnaire. Logistic regression models were 
      used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of
      habitual midday napping duration and frequency with HBW. Of the participants,
      8,705 (83.0%) reported having habitual midday napping. Duration and frequency of 
      napping had a positive association with HBW without adjustment. After controlling
      for potential confounders, increasing risk of HBW was observed in participants
      who napped 1.5-2 hours (OR, 1.50, 95% CI, 1.14, 1.98), and >/=2 hours (OR, 1.35, 
      95% CI, 1.03, 1.78) compared with no habitual midday napping. Participants who
      took naps >/=5 days/week had a higher risk of HBW (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.07, 1.77) 
      compared with the women without naps. This suggests that longer (>/=1.5 hours)
      and more frequent (>/=5 days/week) maternal habitual midday napping were
      associated with an increased risk of HBW.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems are likely to 
      emerge from the complex interplay of various factors. AIMS: To investigate the
      role of infant (e.g., temperament), maternal (e.g., anxiety and depressive
      disorders), and familial (e.g., social support) factors as potential precursors
      of infant regulatory problems. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective-longitudinal study.
      SUBJECTS: 286 mother-infant dyads were investigated from early pregnancy until 16
      months postpartum via questionnaires and interviews. OUTCOME MEASURES: Regulatory
      problems at 2, 4 and 16 months postpartum assessed by standardized diagnostic
      interviews. RESULTS: Fussy infant temperament and maternal anxiety disorders were
      associated with excessive infant crying (OR=1.16, 95%CI:1.05-1.29, OR=3.28,
      95%CI:1.16-9.26) and feeding problems (OR=1.05, 95%CI:1.01-1.11, OR=2.27,
      95%CI:1.36-3.80) whereas maternal depressive disorders were associated with
      infant sleeping problems (OR=2.55, 95%CI:1.06-6.11). Moreover, high maternal age 
      (OR=0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.98) was associated with a lower risk for excessive crying 
      and being a single mother (OR=0.16, 95%CI:0.03-0.73) and cognitive reappraisal to
      regulate emotions (OR: 0.59, 95%CI:0.36-0.96) was associated with a lower risk
      for sleeping problems. CONCLUSION: Excessive infant crying and feeding problems
      may be related to interactional deficits of anxious mothers who perceive their
      infants as "difficult" during soothing or feeding situations. Sleeping problems
      may be transmitted already during pregnancy by an altered sleep-wake-rhythm of
      mothers with a history of depression or by a genetic predisposition. Therapeutic 
      interventions should focus on maternal anxiety and depression, behavior
      management techniques to cope with difficult situations with "fussy" infants and 
      potential protective factors (e.g. favorable maternal emotion regulation) to
      address crying, feeding and sleeping problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations
      and sleep and mental well-being. As no studies have been performed in pregnant
      women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during
      pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy. METHODS:
      Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy
      Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at
      26-28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan
      concentrations were measured at 26-28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions
      estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor 
      sleep quality (PSQI global score > 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS >/=
      15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state >/= 41) were calculated adjusting for
      covariates. RESULTS: Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0micromol/L
      (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower 
      prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88
      (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10micromol/L], especially in those participants who also 
      suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations
      were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal
      sleep quality or mental well-being. LIMITATION: Subjective measures were used to 
      assess sleep and mental well-being. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that higher plasma
      tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor
      sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. 
      These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan
      concentrations during pregnancy.

AB  - Women's sleep quality has been reported to change during pregnancy; prevalence
      estimates of poor sleep quality during pregnancy vary widely. To further
      understand the observed variation of findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to
      quantify the prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Articles (N = 24)
      that reported prevalence of poor sleep quality as captured by the Pittsburgh
      sleep quality index (PSQI) >/= 5 were included, with a total of 11,002
      participants contributing data. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases
      were systematically searched. Results indicated that the average PSQI score
      during pregnancy was 6.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.30, 6.85], and 45.7%, 
      95% CI [36.5%, 55.2%], of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality.
      Longitudinal studies indicated that sleep quality decreased from second (M =
      5.31, SE = 0.40) to third trimester (M = 7.03, SE = 0.85) by 1.68 points, 95% CI 
      [0.42, 2.94]. Gestational age moderated the average PSQI scores and prevalence of
      PSQI scores >/=5; older samples reported higher mean PSQI scores and higher
      prevalence of poor sleep quality. Clinicians should be aware that some reduction 
      in sleep quality is expected during pregnancy, but complaints of very poor sleep 
      quality could require intervention. Future research should examine various
      factors underlying poor sleep quality during pregnancy.

TI  - Doppler-based fetal heart rate analysis markers for the detection of early
      intrauterine growth restriction.
PG  - 1322-1329
LID - 10.1111/aogs.13228 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One indicator for fetal risk of mortality is intrauterine growth
      restriction (IUGR). Whether markers reflecting the impact of growth restriction
      on the cardiovascular system, computed from a Doppler-derived heart rate signal, 
      would be suitable for its detection antenatally was studied. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: We used a cardiotocography archive of 1163 IUGR cases and 1163 healthy
      controls, matched for gestation and gender. We assessed the discriminative power 
      of short-term variability and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate,
      computed over episodes of high and low variation aiming to separate
      growth-restricted fetuses from controls. Metrics characterizing the sleep state
      distribution within a trace were also considered for inclusion into an IUGR
      detection model. RESULTS: Significant differences in the risk markers comparing
      growth-restricted with healthy fetuses were found. When used in a logistic
      regression classifier, their performance for identifying IUGR was considerably
      superior before 34 weeks of gestation. Long-term variability in active sleep was 
      superior to short-term variability [area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) 
      of 72% compared with 71%]. Most predictive was the number of minutes in high
      variation per hour (AUC of 75%). A multivariate IUGR prediction model improved
      the AUC to 76%. CONCLUSION: We suggest that heart rate variability markers
      together with surrogate information on sleep states can contribute to the
      detection of early-onset IUGR.

TI  - Insomnia in Pregnancy Is Associated With Depressive Symptoms and Eating at Night.
PG  - 1171-1176
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.6764 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Deterioration in sleep quality seems to be a natural
      consequence of physical changes during pregnancy. It is still unclear if insomnia
      in pregnancy is associated with the same factors as chronic insomnia in the
      general population. The aim of this study was to explore the determinants of
      insomnia during pregnancy. METHODS: The study included 266 women (mean age: 30.6 
      +/- 5 years, weeks of pregnancy: 36 [interquartile range 32-38]) recruited at the
      Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical University of Warsaw. The
      assessment of variables was performed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), Regestein Hyperarousal Scale (HS), Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS), General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire, and a
      semi-structured interview about different sleep disorders. RESULTS: Almost 40% of
      the women in our study received a diagnosis of insomnia based on AIS cutoff
      scores. The between-group analyses indicated that HS score, BDI score, eating at 
      night, legs tingling, nightmares, snoring, and myoclonus differentiated the
      groups of individuals with insomnia from those without insomnia. Other variables 
      were not significantly different between the groups. We divided individuals with 
      insomnia in terms of insomnia duration: 49% developed insomnia at least 1 year
      before the study onset and 39.6% during pregnancy. For further analyses we used
      only the women in whom insomnia developed during pregnancy. Logistic regression
      confirmed that depressive symptoms (BDI) and eating at night were significant
      predictors of insomnia in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms and night
      eating are key factors related to insomnia developed during pregnancy.

TI  - Mapping White Matter Microstructure in the One Month Human Brain.
PG  - 9759
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-09915-6 [doi]
AB  - White matter microstructure, essential for efficient and coordinated transmission
      of neural communications, undergoes pronounced development during the first years
      of life, while deviations to this neurodevelopmental trajectory likely result in 
      alterations of brain connectivity relevant to behavior. Hence, systematic
      evaluation of white matter microstructure in the normative brain is critical for 
      a neuroscientific approach to both typical and atypical early behavioral
      development. However, few studies have examined the infant brain in detail,
      particularly in infants under 3 months of age. Here, we utilize quantitative
      techniques of diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and
      density imaging to investigate neonatal white matter microstructure in 104
      infants. An optimized multiple b-value diffusion protocol was developed to allow 
      for successful acquisition during non-sedated sleep. Associations between white
      matter microstructure measures and gestation corrected age, regional asymmetries,
      infant sex, as well as newborn growth measures were assessed. Results highlight
      changes of white matter microstructure during the earliest periods of development
      and demonstrate differential timing of developing regions and regional
      asymmetries. Our results contribute to a growing body of research investigating
      the neurobiological changes associated with neurodevelopment and suggest that
      characteristics of white matter microstructure are already underway in the weeks 
      immediately following birth.

TI  - Sleep Disorders: Restless Legs Syndrome.
PG  - 29-32
AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder that often is underdiagnosed
      and undertreated. Patients with RLS describe an urge to move their legs,
      especially in the evenings and during periods of inactivity. The prevalence of
      clinically significant RLS is approximately 2% to 3% in adults in Europe and
      North America. RLS can be an independent disorder or may occur in conjunction
      with other conditions (eg, iron deficiency, pregnancy, chronic renal failure).
      Diagnosis is based on clinical history. Routine polysomnography typically is not 
      recommended unless there is suspicion of other sleep disorders (eg, obstructive
      sleep apnea). Management includes a combination of supportive measures,
      dopaminergic drugs, gabapentinoids, opioids, or benzodiazepines. Good sleep
      hygiene can help prevent development of insomnia related to RLS. Avoiding alcohol
      and reducing caffeine intake is recommended. If iron stores are low, iron
      supplementation may improve symptoms. The main pharmacologic options for RLS
      management are dopaminergic agonists (eg, pramipexole and ropinirole);
      gabapentinoids also are good options. Patients may experience augmentation, an
      increase in RLS symptom severity with increasing drug dosage, which is the main
      complication of dopaminergic drugs. There is no evidence to support use of
      vibratory devices that provide stimulation to the lower extremities.

TI  - Intimate partner violence during pregnancy and use of antenatal care among rural 
      women in southern Terai of Nepal.
PG  - 96-102
LID - S1871-5192(16)30143-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.wombi.2017.07.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Underutilisation of antenatal care services due to intimate partner
      violence during pregnancy has been well documented elsewhere, but it is
      understudied in Nepal. Our study aimed at exploring the impact of intimate
      partner violence on antenatal care service utilisation in southern Terai of
      Nepal. METHOD: A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in 6 village
      development committees in Dhanusha district, Nepal. A total of 426 pregnant women
      in their second trimester were selected using a multistage cluster sampling
      method. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association
      between exposure to intimate partner violence and selected antenatal care
      services, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Among 426 pregnant women, almost
      three out of ten women (28.9%) were exposed to intimate partner violence at some 
      point during their pregnancy. Pregnant women who were exposed to intimate partner
      violence were less likely to: register for antenatal care (OR 0.31; 95% CI
      (0.08-0.50)), take iron and folic acid (OR 0.55; 95% CI (0.12-0.90)), report
      dietary diversity (middle vs low: OR 0.34; 95% CI (0.11-0.58) and high vs low: OR
      0.18; 95% CI (0.08-0.37)), have rest and sleep during day time (OR 0.47; 95% CI
      (0.61-0.58)), and attend mother's group meetings (OR 0.29; 95% CI (0.10-0.83)).
      CONCLUSIONS: Intimate partner violence during pregnancy is associated with low
      utilisation of antenatal care services. Therefore, effective strategies to
      prevent or reduce intimate partner violence during pregnancy is needed, which may
      lead to improved antenatal care service utilization in Nepal with healthier
      mothers and children's outcome.

TI  - The Role of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Developing Gestational Hypertension and
      Preeclampsia.
PG  - 330-333
AB  - Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are the most frequent medical
      complications in pregnancy and major causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and
      mortality. It is also known that these conditions are associated with a long term
      increased cardiovascular global risk for these young women. Obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) seems to be not only a frequent pathology associated with pregnancy
      but also an independent factor for developing gestational hypertension. It is
      well known the relationship between gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and
      intrauterine growth restriction of the foetus so the outcomes of this pathologies
      are important for both mother and child. Increasing awareness of OSA among
      pregnant women with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is important given 
      the potential benefits of the treatment with continuous positive airway pressure 
      (CPAP) on these patients.

TI  - Sickle Cell Disease
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by
      intermittent vaso-occlusive events and chronic hemolytic anemia. Vaso-occlusive
      events result in tissue ischemia leading to acute and chronic pain as well as
      organ damage that can affect any organ system, including the bones, spleen,
      liver, brain, lungs, kidneys, and joints. Dactylitis (pain and/or swelling of the
      hands or feet) is often the earliest manifestation of SCD. In children, the
      spleen can become engorged with blood cells in a "splenic sequestration." The
      spleen is particularly vulnerable to infarction and the majority of individuals
      with SCD who are not on hydroxyurea or transfusion therapy become functionally
      asplenic in early childhood, increasing their risk for certain types of bacterial
      infections. Acute chest syndrome is a major cause of mortality in SCD. Chronic
      hemolysis can result in varying degrees of anemia, jaundice, cholelithiasis, and 
      delayed growth and sexual maturation. Individuals with the highest rates of
      hemolysis are predisposed to pulmonary artery hypertension, priapism, and leg
      ulcers but may be relatively protected from vaso-occlusive pain.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: SCD encompasses a group of disorders characterized by the
      presence of at least one hemoglobin S allele (HbS; p.Glu6Val in HBB) and a second
      HBB pathogenic variant resulting in abnormal hemoglobin polymerization. Hb S/S
      (homozygous p.Glu6Val in HBB) accounts for 60%-70% of SCD in the United States.
      Other forms of SCD result from coinheritance of HbS with other abnormal
      beta-globin chain variants, the most common forms being sickle-hemoglobin C
      disease (Hb S/C) and two types of sickle beta-thalassemia (Hb
      S/beta(+)-thalassemia and Hb S/beta degrees -thalassemia); rarer forms result
      from coinheritance of other Hb variants such as D-Punjab, O-Arab, and E. The
      diagnosis of SCD is established by identification of significant quantities of
      HbS with or without an additional abnormal beta-globin chain variant by
      hemoglobin assay or by identification of biallelic HBB pathogenic variants where 
      at least one allele is the p.Glu6Val pathogenic variant (e.g., homozygous
      p.Glu6Val; p.Glu6Val and a second HBB pathogenic variant) on molecular genetic
      testing. All states in the US have included newborn screening for SCD since 2005.
      Newborn screening programs perform isoelectric focusing and/or high-performance
      liquid chromatography (HPLC) of an eluate of dried blood spots. A few newborn
      screening programs confirm results with molecular testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment 
      of manifestations: Management of pain episodes includes hydration,
      anti-inflammatory agents, and pain medication. Pain episodes are additionally
      managed with a multimodel approach (e.g., warmth, massage, distraction,
      acupuncture, biofeedback, self-hypnosis). Fever and suspected infection is
      treated with appropriate antibiotics. Life-threatening or severe complications
      (e.g., severe acute chest syndrome, aplastic crisis, and stroke) are often
      treated with red blood cell transfusion. Splenectomy may be necessary for splenic
      sequestration. Severe priapism may require aspiration and irrigation. Prevention 
      of primary manifestations: Maintain hydration and avoid climate extremes. Chronic
      red blood cell transfusion in children at risk for stroke and individuals with
      pulmonary hypertension, chronic renal failure, recurrent acute chest syndrome,
      and severe end-organ damage. Hydroxyurea can decrease the frequency and severity 
      of vaso-occlusive processes, reduce transfusion needs, and increase life span.
      Glutamine has received FDA approval for the prevention of acute complications in 
      individuals with SCD age five years and older. Stem cell transplantation may be
      an option in selected individuals. Prevention of secondary complications:
      Aggressive education on the management of fevers; prophylactic antibiotics,
      including penicillin in children; immunizations; folic acid supplementation; and 
      iron chelation therapy for those with iron overload. Surveillance: Periodic
      comprehensive medical and social evaluation, mental health and neurocognitive
      assessment, and routine dental care. Annual CBC and reticulocyte count,
      assessment of iron status, liver and renal function tests, urinalysis, LDH, and
      vitamin D level. Annual transcranial Doppler to determine risk of stroke in all
      children with Hb S/S and Hb S/beta degrees -thalassemia and ophthalmologic
      evaluation in all with sickling disorders. There should be a low threshold to
      evaluate for end-organ damage including chest x-ray, ECG, abdominal ultrasound,
      and iron overload. Due to the high frequency and severity of cardiopulmonary
      complications there should be a particularly low threshold to obtain an
      echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests, and sleep study in individuals of any
      age with cardiac or pulmonary concerns. Agents/circumstances to avoid:
      Dehydration, extremes of temperature, physical exhaustion, extremely high
      altitude, recreational drugs with vasoconstrictive or cardiac stimulation
      effects, and meperidine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis of
      at-risk family members allows education and intervention before symptoms or
      end-organ damage are present. Pregnancy management: Women with SCD who become
      pregnant require close follow up and monitoring by a hematologist and
      obstetrician; an increased risk for preterm labor, thrombosis, infectious
      complications, and acute painful episodes has been reported during pregnancy;
      hydroxyurea should be discontinued during pregnancy. GENETIC COUNSELING: SCD is
      inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If one parent is a carrier of the HBB
      HbS pathogenic variant and the other is a carrier of any of the HBB pathogenic
      variants (e.g., HbS, HbC, beta-thalassemia), each child has a 25% chance of being
      affected, a 50% chance of being unaffected and a carrier, and a 25% chance of
      being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier detection for common forms of SCD is 
      most commonly accomplished by isoelectric focusing or HPLC. Prenatal diagnosis
      for pregnancies at increased risk for SCD is possible by molecular genetic
      testing if the HBB pathogenic variants have been identified in the parents.

AB  - Maternal hypothyroidism (MH) is the most common cause of transient congenital
      hypothyroidism. Different animal models are used for assessing developmental
      effects of MH in offspring. The severity and status of hypothyroidism in animal
      models must be a reflection of the actual conditions in humans. To obtain
      comparable results with different clinical conditions, which lead to MH in
      humans, several factors have been suggested for researchers to consider before
      designing the experimental models. Regarding development of fetal body systems
      during pregnancy, interference at different times provides different results and 
      the appropriate time for induction of hypothyroidism should be selected based on 
      accurate time of development of the system under assessment. Other factors that
      should be taken into consideration include, physiological and biochemical
      differences between humans and other species, thyroid hormone-independent effects
      of anti-thyroid drugs, circadian rhythms in TSH secretion, sex differences,
      physical and psychological stress. This review addresses essential guidelines for
      selecting and managing the optimal animal model for MH as well as discussing the 
      pros and cons of currently used models.

TI  - Sleep Disorder Diagnosis During Pregnancy and Risk of Preterm Birth.
PG  - 573-581
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002132 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that sleep disorder diagnosis would be
      associated with increased risk of preterm birth and to examine risk by
      gestational age, preterm birth type, and specific sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep
      apnea, movement disorder, and other). METHODS: In this observational study,
      participants were from a cohort of nearly 3 million women in California between
      2007 and 2012. Inclusion criteria were women with singleton neonates liveborn
      between 20 and 44 weeks of gestation without chromosomal abnormalities or major
      structural birth defects linked to a hospital discharge database maintained by
      the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development and without
      mental illness during pregnancy. Sleep disorder was defined based on
      International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification
      diagnostic code (n=2,265). Propensity score matching was used to select a
      referent population at a one-to-one ratio. Odds of preterm birth were examined by
      gestational age (less than 34 weeks, 34-36 weeks, and less than 37 weeks of
      gestation) and type (spontaneous, indicated). RESULTS: Prevalence of preterm
      birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) was 10.9% in the referent group compared
      with 14.6% among women with a recorded sleep disorder diagnosis. Compared with
      the referent group, odds (95% CI, P value, percentage) of preterm birth were 1.3 
      (1.0-1.7, P=.023, 14.1%) for insomnia and 1.5 (1.2-1.8, P<.001, 15.5%) for sleep 
      apnea. Risk varied by gestational age and preterm birth type. Odds of preterm
      birth were not significantly increased for sleep-related movement disorders or
      other sleep disorders. CONCLUSION: Insomnia and sleep apnea were associated with 
      significantly increased risk of preterm birth. Considering the high prevalence of
      sleep disorders during pregnancy and availability of evidence-based
      nonpharmacologic interventions, current findings suggest that screening for
      severe presentations would be prudent.

PG  - 1913-1918
LID - 10.1007/s11011-017-0079-0 [doi]
AB  - After childbirth, women may develop symptoms of depression with the associated
      sleep disturbances. This study assessed the relationship between insomnia and
      both depression symptoms and blood estradiol levels in women during the early
      postpartum period. 84 patients were assessed 24-48 h after labor. The main
      assessment methods were the following psychometric scales: Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Athens Insomnia 
      Scale (AIS). Serum estradiol levels were measured using ELISA assay. Women who
      developed postpartum insomnia significantly more often reported insomnia during
      pregnancy (P = 0.001), were more likely to have suffered from depression in the
      past (P = 0.007) and had significantly higher BDI (P = 0.002) and EPDS (P =
      0.048) scores. Our study demonstrated no significant association between Restless
      Legs Syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and postpartum insomnia. The groups of women
      with and without postpartum RLS showed no significant differences in the
      incidence of postpartum insomnia. No significant differences in estradiol levels 
      were observed in women with and without postpartum insomnia. The study showed the
      following factors to play a major role in development of postpartum insomnia: an 
      increase in Beck Depression Inventory score, a history of depression and a
      history of insomnia during pregnancy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of mild to moderate hypertension might not benefit
      maternal or fetal outcome. This pessimistic point of view may have come about by 
      using non-validated methods for measuring blood pressure in pregnancy combined
      with inadequate methodology for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring effects.
      AIM: To determine the association between AASI in women with type 1 diabetes
      mellitus (T1DM) and preeclampsia, and to assess the ability of AASI to diagnose
      preeclampsia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Repeated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure
      recordings were performed three times during pregnancy and once three months
      postpartum in 151 women with T1DM and 50 control women without diabetes.
      Circadian rhythm was evaluated as the night day ratio, night blood pressure
      divided by day blood pressure. RESULTS: Of the T1DM women, 33 developed
      preeclampsia, which was associated with AASI in the 3rd trimester (p<0.05). The
      best predictor of preeclampsia in T1DM was an AASI of 0.35. The diurnal blood
      pressure was significantly higher in all trimesters in women who later had
      preeclampsia. A flattened circadian rhythm was present in T1DM women with
      preeclampsia compared to women without preeclampsia (night-day ratio: systole 2nd
      trimester: 0.94+/-0.07 vs. 0.91+/-0.05, women with and without preeclampsia,
      respectively, p=0.015; diastole 2nd trimester: 0.89+/-0.07 vs. 0.85+/-0.07,
      p=0.003). AASI was higher during pregnancy compared to postpartum in women with
      T1DM (0.31+/-0.16, 0.31+/-0.16 and 0.33+/-0.18 vs. 0.25+/-0.17; 1st, 2nd and 3rd 
      trimester vs. postpartum). CONCLUSION: Women with T1DM and preeclampsia
      demonstrate increased arterial stiffness and had early manifestations in the
      non-dipping of blood pressure.

TI  - Cerebral oxygenation during skin-to-skin care in preterm infants not receiving
      respiratory support.
PG  - F137-F142

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Skin-to-skin care (SSC) has proven benefits in preterm infants, but
      increased hypoxic and bradycardic events have been reported. This may make
      clinicians hesitant to recommend SSC as standard care. We hypothesised that
      regional cerebral oxygenation (rStO2) measured with near infrared spectroscopy is
      not worse during SSC compared with standard incubator care. DESIGN: Prospective, 
      observational, non-inferiority study. SETTING: Single tertiary perinatal centre
      in Australia. PATIENTS: Forty preterm infants (median (IQR) 30.6 (29.1-31.7)
      weeks' gestation) not receiving respiratory support were studied on day 14
      (8-38). INTERVENTIONS: Recordings during 90 min of incubator care, followed by 90
      min of SSC. Each infant acted as their own control and caregivers were blinded to
      the rStO2 measurements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the mean
      difference in rStO2 between SSC and incubator care. The prespecified margin of
      non-inferiority was -1.5%. Secondary outcomes included heart rate (HR),
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), time in quiet sleep, temperature and hypoxic
      (SpO2 <80% for >5 s) or bradycardic events (HR <80 bpm for >5 s) and time spent
      in cerebral hypoxia (rStO2<55%) and hyperoxia (rStO2>85%). RESULTS: Mean (SD)
      rStO2 was lower during SSC compared with incubator care: 73.6 (6.0)% vs 74.8
      (4.6)%, mean difference (95% CI) 1.3 (2.2 to 0.4)%. HR was 5 bpm higher, SpO2 1% 
      lower and time in quiet sleep 24% longer during SSC. Little evidence of a
      difference was observed in temperature. The number of hypoxic or bradycardic
      events as well as the proportion of time spent in cerebral hypoxia and hyperoxia 
      was very low in both periods. CONCLUSIONS: Mean rStO2 was marginally lower during
      SSC without observed differences in hypoxic or bardycardic events but an increase
      in time spent in quiet sleep. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This trial is linked to 
      Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: identifier 12616000240448. It
      was registered pre-results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, many women experience sleep problems and anxiety
      that require treatment. The long-term safety for the child of maternal
      benzodiazepine (BZD) and z-hypnotic use during pregnancy remains controversial.
      METHOD: We conducted a cohort and a sibling control study using data from the
      Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Data on use of BZD and z-hypnotics,
      internalizing and externalizing outcomes, and covariates were collected from
      mothers at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and when children were 0.5, 1.5, and 3
      years of age. The total sample consisted of 71,996 children (19,297 siblings) at 
      1.5 years and 55,081 children (13,779 siblings) at 3 years. Short-term use was
      defined as use in one pregnancy period only. Long-term use was defined as use in 
      two or more pregnancy periods. Linear full cohort random-effect and
      sibling-matched fixed-effect regression models were used to compare internalizing
      and externalizing behavior in children prenatally exposed compared to those
      unexposed in the full cohort of pregnancies accounting for family clusters, as
      well as within sibling clusters comparing pregnancies with discordant exposures. 
      Propensity score (PS) adjustment included variables on indication for use (sleep 
      problems, symptoms of anxiety and depression) and other potential confounding
      factors. RESULTS: Long-term prenatal exposure to BZD or z-hypnotics was
      associated with increased internalizing behavior in crude cohort analyses and at 
      age 1.5 years after PS adjustment in sibling-matched fixed-effect models [beta
      0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.95]. Analyses on specific drug groups showed
      that prenatal exposure to BZD-anxiolytics was associated with increased
      internalizing problems at both 1.5 years [beta 0.25, 0.01-0.49] and 3 years [beta
      0.26, 0.002-0.52] while exposure to z-hypnotics was not associated with any
      adverse outcomes after adjustment. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a moderate
      association between BZD-anxiolytic exposure and child internalizing problems that
      is not likely due to stable familial confounding factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible association between fetal gender and
      long-term pediatric neurological morbidity. METHODS: We performed a
      population-based retrospective cohort analysis comparing the risk of long-term
      neurological morbidity (up to age 18 years) of children born during the years
      1991 to 2013 according to their gender. Neurological morbidity evaluated included
      hospitalizations in childhood involving pervasive developmental disorder,
      obstructive sleep apnea, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and infantile spasms and
      disorders of eating as recorded in the hospital files. Multiple pregnancies and
      fetal congenital malformations were excluded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
      constructed to compare the cumulative neurological morbidity over the study
      period. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for obstetrical
      confounders, including gestational age at birth, birth weight, and maternal
      factors. RESULTS: During the study period, 240,953 newborns were included in the 
      long-term analysis: 51.0% (n = 122,840) males and 49.0% (n = 118,113) females.
      Hospitalizations for neurological problems (up to age 18 years) were
      significantly more common in males compared with females (1.1% vs 0.8%,
      respectively, odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001).
      Specifically, pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea were
      found to be significantly more common in males, and cerebral palsy reached
      borderline significance (0.1% vs 0.04%, odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 
      0.9 to 1.9, P = 0.06). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated males to
      have a significantly higher cumulative incidence of total neurological morbidity 
      as well as of pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea (all
      log-rank test P values <0.001). In the Cox regression model, male gender
      exhibited an independent association with long-term neurological morbidity, while
      adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, and other confounding variables
      (adjusted hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: Males are at an increased risk for pediatric neurological morbidity
      independent of gestational age at birth and birth weight.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet few studies are
      currently available regarding the determinants of sleep quality among pregnant
      women in China. This study aimed to: (a) calculate the prevalence of sleep
      disorder during pregnancy, (b) examine the difference in sleep quality among
      three trimesters, and (c) identify determinants of sleep quality in pregnant
      women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed as a cross-sectional
      survey. Five hundred pregnant women were recruited at the outpatient department
      of obstetrics and gynecology of two teaching hospitals in central China. Five
      selfreport questionnaires were used for gathering data, including information of 
      sample characteristics, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)),
      prenatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)), perceived 
      stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and perceived social support
      (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)). RESULTS: A total of
      454 pregnant women participated in the study between September 2016 and April
      2017. Eighty-seven percent pregnant women experienced sleep disorder (PSQI score 
      >5). Poorer global sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, lower sleep
      efficiency and sleep disturbances were most prevalent during third trimester. The
      significant contributors to sleep quality for pregnant women were prenatal
      depression, maternal age, and gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorder is
      very common in pregnant women from China. Depressive symptoms, increased maternal
      age, and gestational age are determinants of sleep quality. These determinants
      can assist healthcare professionals in preventative intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep during pregnancy involves a physiological challenge to provide
      sufficient gas exchange to the fetus. Enhanced ventilatory responses to
      hypercapnia and hypoxia may protect from deficient gas exchange, but
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may predispose to adverse events. The aim of
      this study was to analyze sleep and breathing in healthy pregnant women compared 
      to non-pregnant controls, with a focus on CO2 changes and upper-airway flow
      limitation. METHODS: Healthy women in the third trimester and healthy
      non-pregnant women with normal body mass index (BMI) were recruited for
      polysomnography. Conventional analysis of sleep and breathing was performed.
      Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) was determined for each sleep stage.
      Flow-limitation was analyzed using the flattening index and TcCO2 values were
      recorded for every inspiration. RESULTS: Eighteen pregnant women and 12 controls 
      were studied. Pregnancy was associated with shorter sleep duration and more
      superficial sleep. Apnea-hypopnea index, arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation,
      flow-limitation, snoring or periodic leg movements were similar in the two
      groups. Mean SaO2 and minimum SaO2 were lower and average heart rate was higher
      in the pregnant group. TcCO2 levels did not differ between groups but variance of
      TcCO2 was smaller in pregnant women during non-rapid eye movement (NREM). TcCO2
      profiles showed transient TcCO2 peaks, which seem specific to pregnancy.
      CONCLUSIONS: Healthy pregnancy does not predispose to SDB. Enhanced ventilatory
      control manifests as narrowing threshold of TcCO2 between wakefulness and sleep. 
      Pregnant women have a tendency for rapid CO2 increases during sleep which might
      have harmful consequences if not properly compensated.

TI  - Sleep Duration and Quality in Pregnant Women: A Cross-Sectional Survey in China.
LID - E817 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph14070817 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Good maternal health and fetal development require sufficient and
      good quality of sleep during pregnancy. This study investigated sleep duration
      and quality in pregnant women, assessing factors with possibly influence on
      sleep. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on pregnant women between
      June and August in 2015 in 16 hospitals in five provinces in China. A total of
      2345 pregnant women aged 18 years and older were surveyed. Insufficient sleeping 
      duration was defined as sleeping of less than 7 h per day. Excessive sleep
      duration was defined as sleeping of more than 9 h per day. Results: A total of
      561 (23.9%) participants reported insufficient sleeping duration, whereas 485
      (20.9%) claimed excessive sleep duration. A total of 358 (15.2%) of pregnant
      women reported problems regarding sleep quality. Compared to pregnant women with 
      sufficient sleeping duration, those with insufficient sleeping duration were
      prone to have poor sleep quality, whereas those with excessive sleeping duration 
      featured low possibility of poor sleep quality. High-risk groups of insufficient 
      sleep duration include women of Han nationality, with siblings, in their first
      trimester of pregnancy, receiving care in low-capacity/quality hospital settings,
      and with daily or 1-3 days of secondhand smoke exposure. High-risk groups of
      excessive sleep duration include women living in rural areas, unemployed, in
      their third trimester of pregnancy, and receiving care in medium-capacity/quality
      hospital settings. High-risk groups of poor sleep quality include women of
      non-Han nationality, low income level, in their third trimester of pregnancy, and
      with insufficient sleep duration. Conclusions: Insufficient/excessive sleep
      duration and poor sleep quality commonly occur during pregnancy in China.
      Findings provide a better understanding of the influencing factors of
      insufficient/excessive sleep duration and poor quality of sleep. These findings
      have some implications for future interventions on sleep among pregnant women.

TI  - The collateral venous system in late pregnancy: A systematic review of the
      literature.
PG  - 1087-1095
LID - 10.1002/ca.22959 [doi]
AB  - Recent literature has reported an association between maternal supine sleep
      position and stillbirth during late pregnancy. In this position the gravid uterus
      almost completely obstructs the inferior vena cava. A small number of women
      experience supine hypotension, thought to be due in part to inadequate collateral
      venous circulation. The aim of this paper is to review the literature describing 
      the anatomy of the collateral venous system and in particular the azygos system, 
      the abdominal portion of which has not been well studied. A systematic review was
      conducted using the electronic databases: Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google
      Scholar. Relevant anatomical and radiological literature concerning the azygos
      system in particular was reviewed. The search was limited to adult human studies 
      only. The collateral venous system can be divided into superficial, intermediate 
      and deep systems. The azygos system in particular provides immediate collateral
      venous circulation in the event of acute inferior vena caval obstruction. The
      abdominal portion of this pathway, including the ascending lumbar vein, has not
      been well studied and there are certain variations that can render it
      ineffective. In conclusion, the collateral venous system provides an alternative 
      route for blood to flow back to the systemic circulation when acute occlusion of 
      the inferior vena cava occurs in the supine position during late pregnancy.
      However, certain anatomical variations can render this pathway ineffective, and
      this could have implications for the development of supine hypotension and
      stillbirth in late pregnancy. Clin. Anat. 30:1087-1095, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O&NS) biomarkers at the
      end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers 
      and pregnancy-related outcome variables. METHODS: We measured plasma advanced
      oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical 
      trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and
      paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal
      depression and non-pregnant controls. RESULTS: Pregnancy is accompanied by
      significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased
      O&NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and 
      physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms).
      Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered -SH, TRAP and
      zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased
      O&NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g.
      hyperpigmentation, labor duration, caesarian section, cord length, breast milk
      flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics.
      CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O&NS, lowered
      antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O&NS at the
      end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms
      and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby.

AB  - Sinus bradycardia which is a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of less than 
      60 bpm is caused by intrinsic cardiac disorders like sick sinus syndrome or
      inferior myocardial infarction, metabolic and environmental causes (such as
      hypothyroidism and electrolyte disorders), medications (such as beta-blockers and
      amiodarone), infection (such as myocarditis), increased intracranial pressure,
      and toxic exposure, while it can sometimes be a normal phenomenon, especially
      during sleep, in athletes, and during pregnancy. Symptomatic sinus bradycardia
      should warrant a thorough work-up in order to identify any reversible causes;
      otherwise, placement of a permanent pacemaker could be needed. We present the
      case of a patient who was admitted due to confusion and fever and was found to
      have pneumococcal meningitis and bacteremia, and during his hospital stay he
      developed symptomatic sinus bradycardia that was of intractable cause and
      persistent. Placement of a permanent pacemaker was chosen until the night staff
      of the hospital discovered by chance the neglected cause of his bradycardia.

AB  - Neonatal sleep is a crucial state that involves endogenous driven brain activity,
      important for neuronal survival and guidance of brain networks. Sequential
      EEG-sleep analysis in preterm infants provides insights into functional brain
      integrity and can document deviations of the biologically pre-programmed process 
      of sleep ontogenesis during the neonatal period. Visual assessment of neonatal
      sleep-EEG, with integration of both cerebral and non-cerebral measures to better 
      define neonatal state, is still considered the gold standard. Electrographic
      patterns evolve over time and are gradually time locked with behavioural
      characteristics which allow classification of quiet sleep and active sleep
      periods during the last 10weeks of gestation. Near term age, the neonate
      expresses a short ultradian sleep cycle, with two distinct active and quiet
      sleep, as well as brief periods of transitional or indeterminate sleep.
      Qualitative assessment of neonatal sleep is however challenged by biological and 
      environmental variables that influence the expression of EEG-sleep patterns and
      sleep organization. Developing normative EEG-sleep data with the aid of automated
      analytic methods, can further improve our understanding of extra-uterine brain
      development and state organization under stressful or pathological conditions.
      Based on those developmental biomarkers of normal and abnormal brain function,
      research can be conducted to support and optimise sleep in the NICU, with the
      ultimate goal to improve therapeutic interventions and neurodevelopmental
      outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research examined the association between perceived everyday
      racial discrimination, as a psychosocial stressor, and perinatal sleep quality.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional (N=640) and longitudinal associations (N=133) between
      everyday experiences of discrimination and sleep quality were examined using a
      pregnancy and postpartum data registry. PARTICIPANTS: We studied a sample of 640 
      unique women from the Perinatal Research Repository (PRR), a longitudinal study
      of mothers, fathers, and babies recruited from Nationwide Children's Hospital and
      The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. MEASUREMENTS: Discrimination and
      sleep quality were assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination Scale and the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, everyday
      discrimination was associated with poorer global sleep quality and all but three 
      sleep sub-measures of the PSQI cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. When
      stratified, the adverse effects of everyday discrimination varied by race and
      perinatal time period. Increases in everyday discrimination were independently
      associated with poorer sleep initiation, poorer sleep maintenance and poorer
      daytime dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the immediate stressors
      of everyday racial discrimination were independently associated with poorer sleep
      quality among pregnant women cross-sectionally. Poorer sleep quality has been
      associated with numerous adverse perinatal outcomes and this association may be
      important in understanding racial discrimination as a risk factor. Our failure to
      identify a longitudinal association makes the direction of causation uncertain,
      however. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify the association,
      given the potential importance of poor sleep quality in the pathogenesis of
      pregnancy complications.

TI  - Continuity of sleep problems from adolescence to young adulthood: results from a 
      longitudinal study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the lack of evidence on incidence and continuity of sleep
      problems from adolescence to young adulthood, this study explores sleep problems'
      incidence and their continuation rates from 14 to 21 years. METHODS: Sleep data
      from the 14-year (n = 4,924) and 21-year (n = 3660) follow-up of the
      Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort were used.
      Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychological conditions were explored for their
      role in sleep problems. Modified Poisson regression with a robust error variance 
      was used to identify predictors. Inverse probability weights were used to account
      for attrition. RESULTS: Of all subjects, 26.0% of the subjects at 14 years and
      28.3% of the subjects at 21 years reported "often" sleep problems, with 41.7% of 
      adolescent sleep problems persisting at 21 years. Perinatal and early-life
      maternal factors, for example, drug abuse (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.32; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.71), smoking, depression, and anxiety, were
      significant predictors of adolescent sleep problems. Female sex (IRR, 2.13; 95%
      CI, 1.55-2.94), advanced pubertal stages, and smoking were the important
      predictors of sleep problems at 21 years. Adolescent depression/anxiety supported
      the continuity of sleep problems (IRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.40), whereas exercise
      was seen to exert a protective effect. CONCLUSION: This study indicates high
      rates of sleep problems in young subjects, with around half of sleep problems
      originating in adolescence persisting in young adulthood. Therefore, early
      interventions are needed to manage sleep problems in young subjects and prevent
      further progression to other life stages. Future studies should explore if sleep 
      problems in young adults also persist in later life stages and identify the
      factors supporting the continuity of sleep problems.

AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurs throughout a relatively large proportion of
      early development, and normal REM activity appears to be required for healthy
      brain development. The eye movements (EMs) observed during REM sleep are the most
      distinctive characteristics of this state. EMs are used as an index of
      neurological function postnatally, but no specific indices of EM activity exist
      for fetuses. We aimed to identify and characterize EM activity, particularly EM
      bursts suggestive of REM periods, in fetuses with a gestational age between 24
      and 39 weeks. This cross-sectional study included 84 normal singleton
      pregnancies. Fetal EMs were monitored using real-time ultrasonography for 60 min 
      and recorded as videos. The videos were manually converted into a time series of 
      EM events, which were then analyzed by piecewise linear regression for various EM
      characteristics, including EM density, EM burst density, density of EMs in EM
      bursts, and continuous EM burst time. Two critical points for EM density, EM
      burst density, and density of EMs in EM bursts were evident at gestation weeks
      28-29 and 36-37. Overall EM activity in human fetuses increased until 28-29 weeks
      of gestation, then again from 36-37 to 38-39 weeks of gestation. These findings
      may be useful for creating indices of fetal neurological function for prognostic 
      purposes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sleep is a physiological state of self-regulation. The
      international classification of sleep disorders now includes as a new category
      those occurring during pregnancy. Regular physical activity is known to improve
      the quality of life, one aspect of which is sleep quality. During pregnancy,
      physical activity is decreased but should not be eliminated, as studies have
      reported a high correlation between sleep disorders and the absence of physical
      activity. Regular physical exercise during pregnancy, whether performed in water 
      or out of it, provides greater control of gestational weight gain. Furthermore,
      the reduced weight gain during pregnancy, as a result of physical exercise, is
      associated with greater physical resistance to the demands of childbirth, combats
      the fatigue caused by pregnancy and reduces back pain. All of these outcomes tend
      to enhance sleep quality, among other beneficial effects. OBJECTIVE: To determine
      whether, in pregnant women, there is an association between moderate-intensity
      physical activity in an aquatic environment and sleep quality. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: A randomised clinical trial was conducted with a sample of 140 pregnant 
      women aged 21-43 years, divided into two groups; Intervention Group and Control
      Group. The women were recruited in the twelfth week of gestation and took part in
      the [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy programme from week 20 to week 37.
      Sleep quality was evaluated in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, using
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. RESULTS: The Mann-Whitney U
      test showed that the results obtained were statistically significant (p<0.05). In
      the Intervention Group, 44 of the women (65.67%) were classified as "poor
      sleepers" versus 62 women (92.54%) in the Control Group. CONCLUSIONS: The [Study 
      of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy method improves the quality of sleep in pregnant 
      women, both subjectively and in terms of latency, duration and efficiency.

TI  - [Sleep apnea in pregnancy].
PG  - 1816-1820
AB  - Snoring, chronic rhinitis and fragmentation of sleep are common symptoms in
      pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. The prevalence of obstructive sleep
      apnea is also increased in pregnant women and can be associated with pregnancy
      induced hypertension, preeclampsia and diabetes mellitus. The fetus is as well
      exposed to a higher risk of prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction.
      Given the lack of adequate screening tool, the diagnosis of obstructive sleep
      apnea is a challenge for the physician and a high degree of clinical suspicion is
      necessary in order to identify the patients at risk and propose an appropriate
      management.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to reveal the cross-sectional and longitudinal
      association of sleep with depression and anxiety among Chinese pregnant women.
      Pregnant women were recruited in Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan
      Maternal and Child Care Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Self-rating depression scales
      (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scales (SAS) were used for evaluating depression
      and anxiety status at each trimester; corresponding sleep quality and duration
      were reported by pregnant women. Ordinary or multilevel linear and logistic
      regression model were used to estimate the cross-sectional or longitudinal
      association of sleep with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates were
      35.64, 24.23, and 26.24% for depression and 22.57, 17.41, and 21.04% for anxiety 
      at 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd trimester (T3), respectively. Controlling for
      potential confounders, it revealed significant cross-sectional and longitudinal
      associations of sleep with depression and anxiety status. In cross-sectional
      analysis, women who slept less than 8 h/day had higher risk of depression (T1: OR
      (95%CI) = 1.75 (1.39, 2.20); T2: 1.52 (1.26, 2.05); T3: 1.60 (1.18, 2.05)) and
      anxiety (T1: 2.00 (1.57, 2.55); T2: 1.86 (1.37, 2.54); T3: 1.33 (0.99, 1.79)). In
      the longitudinal analysis, multilevel model revealed that women with subjective
      "fair" or "bad" sleep quality had elevated risk of depression (OR ranging from
      1.54 to 3.71) and anxiety (2.38 to 7.53) during pregnancy. Prenatal depression
      and anxiety status were prevalent in pregnant women. Sleep quality was associated
      with depression and anxiety status in both cross-sectional and longitudinal
      analyses, implying that improving sleep quality should benefit for mental health 
      of pregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine GHB levels in breast milk of women taking sodium oxybate 
      (Xyrem) for treatment of narcolepsy and cataplexy. METHODS: Two women with
      narcolepsy and cataplexy treated with sodium oxybate before pregnancy collected
      breast milk for analysis of GHB concentration after resuming sodium oxybate
      postpartum. One woman collected samples across two consecutive nights (doses: 3.0
      gm and 4.5 gm twice per night) five months after delivering her first child; the 
      other collected samples on three separate days (doses: 2.25 gm and 3.0 gm twice
      per night) nine months after the births of her first two children. GHB
      concentration was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS:
      Milk GHB levels before sodium oxybate ranged from 5.81 to 7.60 muM. Levels were
      2-4 times higher four hours after the first sodium oxybate dose (10.44-23.58 muM)
      and 3-5 times higher four hours after the second dose (ie, eight hours after
      first dose; 14.60-34.01 muM). GHB levels returned to endogenous levels 6-10 h
      following the second dose, however variability was observed between patients and 
      pregnancies. Higher breast milk GHB levels were observed with higher doses for
      both patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium oxybate is transmitted to breast milk. Despite
      its short half-life, GHB concentrations remained two-to-five times higher than
      endogenous levels four hours after both nighttime doses. To avoid excess GHB
      exposure, breastfeeding mothers who take sodium oxybate should consider
      expressing and discarding their morning milk. Future work should examine milk GHB
      levels after chronic sodium oxybate and determine whether levels change as milk
      composition changes across the postpartum period.

TI  - The Perfect Storm of Trauma: The experiences of women who have experienced birth 
      trauma and subsequently accessed residential parenting services in Australia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There appears to be a chasm between idealised motherhood and reality,
      and for women who experience birth trauma this can be more extreme and impact on 
      mental health. Australia is unique in providing residential parenting services to
      support women with parenting needs such as sleep or feeding difficulties. Women
      who attend residential parenting services have experienced higher rates of
      intervention in birth and poor perinatal mental health but it is unknown how
      birth trauma may impact on early parenting. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims 
      to explore the early parenting experiences of women who have accessed residential
      parenting services in Australia and consider their birth was traumatic. METHODS: 
      In-depth interviews were conducted with eight women across Australia who had
      experienced birth trauma and accessed residential parenting services in the early
      parenting period. These interviews were conducted both face to face and over the 
      telephone. The data was analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: One
      overarching theme was identified: "The Perfect Storm of Trauma" which identified 
      that the participants in this study who accessed residential parenting services
      were more likely to have entered pregnancy with pre-existing vulnerabilities, and
      experienced a culmination of traumatic events during labour, birth, and in the
      early parenting period. Four subthemes were identified: "Bringing Baggage to
      Birth", "Trauma through a Thousand Cuts", "Thrown into the Pressure Cooker", and 
      "Trying to work it all out". CONCLUSION: How women are cared for during their
      labour, birth and postnatal period impacts on how they manage early parenthood.
      Support is crucial for women, including practical parenting support, and
      emotional support by health professionals and peers.

TI  - In-utero exposure to antihypertensive medication and neonatal and child health
      outcomes: a systematic review.
PG  - 2123-2137
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0000000000001456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although medication is generally avoided wherever possible during
      pregnancy, pharmacotherapy is required for the treatment of pregnancy associated 
      hypertension, which remains a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and
      mortality. The long-term effects to the child of in-utero exposure to
      antihypertensive agents remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
      was to systematically review published studies on adverse outcomes to the child
      associated with in-utero exposure to antihypertensive medications. METHODS: OVID,
      Scopus, EBSCO Collections, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases
      were searched for relevant publications published between January 1950 and
      October 2016 and a total of 688 potentially eligible studies were identified.
      RESULTS: Following review, 47 primary studies were eligible for inclusion. The
      Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was used to assess study quality.
      Five studies were of excellent quality; the remainder were either mediocre or
      poor. Increased risk of low birth weight, low size for gestational age, preterm
      birth, and congenital defects following in-utero exposure to all antihypertensive
      agents were identified. Two studies reported an increased risk of attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder following exposure to labetalol, and an increased 
      risk of sleep disorders following exposure to methyldopa and clonidine.
      CONCLUSION: The current systematic review demonstrates a paucity of relevant
      published high-quality studies. A small number of studies suggest possible
      increased risk of adverse child health outcomes; however, most published studies 
      have methodological weaknesses and/or lacked statistical power thus preventing
      any firm conclusions being drawn.

TI  - Childhood stress and birth timing among African American women: Cortisol as
      biological mediator.
PG  - 32-41

AB  - Preterm birth (PTB) occurs among 1:11U.S. white women and 1:7.5 African American 
      women and is a significant driver of racial disparities in infant mortality.
      Maternal stress is the most common clinical phenotype underlying spontaneous PTB.
      Specific patterns of stress and biological mediators driving PTB remain unclear. 
      We examined the effect of childhood stress on birth timing among African American
      women and evaluated maternal cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. A
      prospective observational design was employed, with a single study visit at 28-32
      weeks gestation and medical record review. The Stress and Adversity Inventory was
      administered, which provides a comprehensive estimate of childhood stress, stress
      in adulthood, and five core characteristic subscales (interpersonal loss,
      physical danger, humiliation, entrapment, role disruption). Venipuncture was
      performed between 11:00am and 4:00pm and plasma cortisol quantified by ELISA.
      Analyses controlled for stress in adulthood. Among a final sample of 89,
      cumulative childhood stress predicted birth timing (p=0.01). The association was 
      driven by stress related to interpersonal loss and physical danger, with support 
      for maternal cortisol as a biological mediator (ab=0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.045];
      ab=0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.043], respectively). Results were similar, overall, in 
      sub-group analyses among spontaneously laboring women (n=53); however, role
      disruption arose as an additional predictor, as mediated by cortisol elevations
      (ab=0.03, 95% CI [0.005, 0.074]). Of note, cortisol was no longer supported as a 
      mediator linking physical danger to birth timing after adjusting for sleep
      quality and hours awake prior to venipuncture (ab=0.02, 95% CI [-0.0001, 0.046]).
      We provide preliminary evidence that, independent of stress in adulthood,
      childhood stress of specific core characteristics may shape birth timing, with
      cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. Further investigation is warranted
      and may bolster the development of biologically-informed screening tools for the 
      prediction and targeted prevention of stress-related PTB.
