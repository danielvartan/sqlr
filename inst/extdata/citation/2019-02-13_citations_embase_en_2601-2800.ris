N2  - The timing and continuity of sleep in healthy individuals is regulated by the synchronous function of the sleep homeostasis and the endogenous circadian rhythms. Multiple factors affect these two processes and the way they interact. Sleep disorders may manifest differently in men and women and these differences are particularly notable during pregnancy, lactation, and menopause. Insomnia may occur relatively commonly during pregnancy and in the postpartum, and may be the result of either a primary sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), movement disorders such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), or sometimes depression, especially in the postpartum period. Obstructive sleep apnea may contribute to a higher risk of hypertension during pregnancy and doubles the risk for preeclampsia and preterm birth. Snoring, a frequent symptom of OSA, increases in frequency during pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome is more common in pregnant women, is more frequent in the third trimester of pregnancy, and tends to improve dramatically after delivery. Factors associated with increased RLS in pregnancy may be related to iron and folate metabolism. Risk for OSA increases after menopause and presentation with insomnia can delay the diagnosis of OSA. Various treatment options for sleep disorders in women are discussed. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a group of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or abnormal gas exchange during sleep. The most common type of SDB, especially among young obese women, is obstructive sleep apnea. SDB has clearly been linked to poor sleep and impaired daytime function, but there are also data linking SDB to other health outcomes, principally cardiovascular and metabolic disease. SDB symptoms are common in pregnancy, and pregnancy itself has been associated with an increase in the prevalence of SDB symptoms. Although a link between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes appears to be biologically plausible, data exploring this relationship are only now emerging, and large prospective studies in which the authors use objective measures of sleep are lacking. Until we know more about the epidemiology and the impact of SDB in pregnancy, screening efforts for SDB in pregnancy should be focused on identifying very symptomatic patients because treatment of these individuals often leads to improved sleep quality and daytime functioning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - To improve control measures against malaria, Tanzania has increased the distribution of free and subsidized insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. However, data on knowledge, attitudes and practices of these women regarding malaria are scarce. This study was carried out to describe knowledge, attitudes and practices towards malaria, mosquito net ownership and use among women seeking antenatal care at Iringa Regional Hospital in south-western Tanzania. The study involved women attending the antenatal clinic of the hospital. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was applied to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, mosquito net ownership and use, as well as knowledge, attitudes and practices about malaria and its control. Among the 222 pregnant women included, 173 (78%, 95%CI, 72-84.2) owned a mosquito net, and 150 (68%, 95%CI, 61-75) reported to sleep always under a mosquito net. The use of mosquito nets was mentioned by 142 (64%, 95%CI, 56.2-72). Of the 46 women who did not own a mosquito net, seven (15.2%) reported cost as the main obstacle for owning one. About 53% (95%CI, 44-62) preferred to use mosquito nets they bought rather than the one provided for free. Several factors such as gravidity, fearing of getting malaria, knowledge on the cause, marital status, and ways used to prevent malaria were significantly associated with mosquito net ownership (all P<0.001). Education level and gravidity were associated with the behaviour to sleep always under mosquito nets (P<0.002). Multigravidae (2-4 pregnancies) (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-4.8) and married women (OR, 1.9, 95%CI, 1.2-5.2) were more likely to own a net, as compared to primigravidae and single women. In conclusion, reported ITNs ownership and use among pregnant women was good and they preferred to use the nets they bought themselves.

N2  - To determine the relationship between the working situation (full-time housewife, stopped working during pregnancy, or currently employed) and the lifestyle factors, reasons for stopping work during pregnancy, and effects of working conditions in order to identify the factors that are related to the continuation of employment among pregnant Japanese women. In a cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to pregnant women who visited an obstetrics clinic in a Tokyo suburb for an outpatient medical check-up during July and August 2004. The data of 530 healthy pregnant women were analyzed. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy had lower mental health scores than the full-time housewives and employed pregnant women. In each trimester, the employed pregnant women reported a shorter daytime sleep duration than the pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy and the full-time housewives. The reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were categorized as somatic symptoms due to pregnancy, working conditions, and a sense of values or social reasons. The employed women in the third trimester more often reported the availability of, and access to, a rest area in their company, compared to those in the first and second trimesters. The lifestyle factors of the pregnant women were different, based on their work situation. In particular, the employed pregnant women had a shorter daytime sleep duration. The pregnant women who stopped working during their pregnancy could have benefited from mental health support. In addition, the reasons for stopping work during pregnancy were different in the three trimesters. A flexible system is needed for working women that adapts to the physical changes that occur during pregnancy. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - In humans many biochemical, physiological and behavioral processes occur in a rhythmic manner. Accumulating experimental and epidemiological evidence indicate that disturbances in biological rhythms could lead to unfavorable alterations in body function, thus exerting negative health impact. In industrialized countries, it is estimated that between 15 and 30% of the working population is involved in some kind of permanent night work and rotating shift work. Today, shift work is regarded as a significant occupational stressor which has marked negative effects on both health and well-being. This review surveys data on association between shift work and health problems, including sleep disorders, cardiovascular disease, peptic ulcer, metabolic syndrome, breast cancer and undesirable pregnancy outcome.

N2  - Depression is common among women of childbearing age, and they are often prescribed antidepressants. Although most of these drugs do not appear to increase the risk for congenital malformations, fear of taking them in pregnancy is common. Meanwhile, untreated depression has been associated with poorer maternal and infant outcomes and the increased risk of suicide attempts. Abrupt discontinuation of antidepressants can cause withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, women who discontinue these drugs during early pregnancy have increased risk for depressive relapse during pregnancy and post-partum depression. Therefore, appropriate treatment of depression during pregnancy is essential. Many studies have evaluated maternal first trimester antidepressant use and the prevalence of congenital defects. Since 2005, several studies have proposed a possible association between a significantly increased risk of congenital heart defects, mainly VSD or ASD, and exposure to paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy. Cardiac malformation is recognized in approximately 1% of all births, and these studies have suggested that the use of paroxetine may be associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of cardiac malformation. However, some other studies did not demonstrate this association. A case-control study reported an increased risk of PPHN associated with maternal use of SSRIs in late pregnancy. In this study, there was no case of death among the SSRI-exposed infants with PPHN. PPHN is estimated to occur in 1-2 per 1,000 live births and absolute risk with SSRI exposure is less than 1%. Infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy should be closely monitored after birth. Epidemiological studies have documented that 10-30% of neonates exposed to SSRIs near term had poor neonatal adaptation syndrome. This is characterized by self-limiting symptoms such as irritability, jitteriness, tremor, respiratory distress, difficulty feeding, diarrhea, hypotonia and sleep disturbances; these symptoms typically appear within the first 48 hours after birth. Most of these symptoms are the result of a withdrawal effect, and can also be attributed to serotoninergic hyperstimulation.

N2  - Background: Women with mood disorders are at elevated risk of developing postpartum depression (PPD) after giving birth and remain at high risk of PPD recurrence with subsequent pregnancies. Differential regulation of neuroactive steroids (NAS) during the perinatal period in animals has been associated with the development of postpartum-syndrome through their interaction with ã-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and the abrupt fall in NAS plasma levels associated with parturition may trigger PPD in at-risk women. Few studies have investigated the role of GABA and NAS in high risk women. We investigated the antenatal and postpartum levels of GABA and NAS in two cohorts of perinatal women and prospectively evaluated depression, anxiety, sleep, social support and quality of infant bonding. Postpartum depressed women and healthy postpartum women underwent 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify GABA levels in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and occipital (OCC) cortices. Preliminary MRS data has been presented here. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study evaluated 31 subjects of 18-40 yrs. of age during pregnancy (i.e. at 26-30 and 34-36 weeks gestation) and in the postpartum (i.e. o36 hours after parturition and 3-10 weeks). Two cohorts were studied: healthy control subjects (HCS) (n=4; mean age: 30±3.16) and those at high-risk for developing PPD (n=6; mean age: 30.83±5.56). Serial plasma NAS and GABA measurements and mood and psychosocial assessments were completed at each of 4 study visits. High-risk subjects who developed unipolar PPD were examined crosssectionally in comparison to the HCS postpartum cohort using 1H MRS. MRS data was acquired with 3.0T Philips Achevia wholebody MR system using phased-array receiver SENSE Head coil (Philips Health-Care, the Netherlands). Diagnostic high resolution anatomical brain MRI was performed on all subjects to exclude the existence of any pathology and to be used for MRS voxel localizations. Edited MRS spectra were acquired using MEscher- GArwood Point-REsolved Spectroscopy Sequence (MEGA-PRESS) (TE=68 msec and TR=2000 msec). This frequency selective technique enabled us to detect the GABA peak of the spectra by eliminating the signal due to Creatine (Cr). Two MRS runs were performed with each subject: Voxels positioned at the ACC (3.0-3.0-2.0 cm3) or at the OCC (3.0-3.0-3.0 cm3) regions. The data processing and fitting were done by code written using Matlab (The Mathworks, MA, USA). The difference-edited GABA signal at 3 ppm and the Creatine peak from unsuppressed PRESS signal was fit with a Gaussian models (r40.95) and the area under these fits were calculated to have GABA to total creatine (GABA/ tCr) ratios. We did two-sample t-test, with the assumption of equal variances, to compare GABA/Cr ratios between HCS and PPD patients. We performed Pearson's correlation to investigate the relationship between the GABA/Cr ratios and age. Results: This ongoing feasibility study has limited power to detect significant differences due to the small sample sizes analyzed. In the OCC, the GABA/Cr ratios for the HCS are 2.4% higher than PPD subjects, but this difference is not significant (range of ratios- HCS: 0.12-0.16; PPD: 0.10-0.15). In the ACC, the GABA/Cr ratios are lower in both groups compared with the ratios in the OCC. Although the GABA/Cr ratios are 6.1% lower for the HCS compared with PPD subjects, this difference is not significant (range of ratios- HCS: 0.05-0.14; PPD: 0.08-0.11). In addition, there is no significant difference between the group populations in terms of age; however we observe a difference in the GABA/Cr trend as a function of age. For ACC, the GABA/Cr ratios increase with age in HCS (r=0.91, p=0.09). We do not observe this trend for PPD subjects (r=-0.42, p=0.40). Additional data on grey and white matter segmentation within the MRS voxels, to ensure the same contributions for each group, will be presented. Discussion: There are no significant differences in GABA/Cr ratios in the OCC and ACC between healthy postpartum and postpartum depressed women. There is a trend for GABA/Cr ratios to increase with age in HCS compared to no change with age in PPD subjects. If this is replicated in a larger sample, then age may be an important consideration in further MRS investigations. Given the pilot nature of this feasibility study, further studies will need larger sample sizes to detect potential differences in GABA/Cr ratios among our cohorts. Analysis of plasma GABA and NAS is underway to investigate the potential role for NAS and GABA in the pathophysiology of PPD.

N2  - Rapid weight gain during the first three years of life predicts child and adult obesity, and also later cardiovascular and other morbidities. Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult, the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care. This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded "Well Child" care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and support in addition to "Well Child" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life; the Sleep group which receives at least 3 extra parent contacts over the first 6 months of life with a focus on prevention of sleep problems and then active intervention if there is a sleep problem from 6 months to 2 years; or the Combination group which receives all extra contacts. The main outcome measures are conditional weight velocity (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months) and body mass index z-score at 24 months, with secondary outcomes including sleep and physical activity (parent report, accelerometry), duration of breastfeeding, timing of introduction of solids, diet quality, and measures of family function and wellbeing (parental depression, child mindedness, discipline practices, family quality of life and health care use). This study will contribute to a prospective meta-analysis of early life obesity prevention studies in Australasia. Infancy is likely to be the most effective time to establish patterns of behaviour around food, activity and sleep that promote healthy child and adult weight. The POI.nz study will determine the extent to which sleep, food and activity interventions in infancy prevent the development of overweight. Clinical Trials NCT00892983.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the different features of body movements for females before and after parturition. Body movement signal was measured by a piezoelectric sensor board which was deployed on the abdominal position beneath a mattress during sleep to monitor pressure changes around abdominal area. Body movement epochs were detected by an innovative algorithm based on Hilbert transform. Data were collected from two healthy pregnant females during sleep for 7 weeks before parturition and 6 weeks after parturition. The pressure signal was used to determine the duration and time interval of maternal movements. Characteristics of the detected body movements before and after parturition were investigated through their proportion. The results showed that before and after parturition, the body movement which features as 0~1 min in interval and 0~6 sec in duration has significant difference statistically. It is considered that these differences are highly correlated with the prenatal activities.

N2  - Background: The physiological changes in peripartum may affect symptoms of depression and impact diagnostic judgments in the peripartum and influence which symptoms discriminate depressed and non-depressed women. Second, the sharp fall in cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone after childbirth suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis characteristics of postpartum depression are different from melancholic depression the latter being characterized by high cortisol levels. Methods: Amodified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID) was used to assess symptoms of depression and melancholic and atypical subtypes in pregnancy and the postpartum period. In a second study, we investigated the diurnal output of saliva cortisol in women with symptoms of depression postnatally in 21 depressed and 30 nondepressed women at 7.5 weeks postpartum and 21 non-perinatal controls, collected saliva at waking, 30 min, and 3 and 12 hours post-waking. Results: The antenatal symptom pattern (n=892 women) was different from the postnatal. The sensitivity of the symptoms ranged from 0.7% to 51.6% and specificity from 61.3% to 99.1%. The best discriminating symptoms were motor retardation/agitation and concentration antenatally and motor retardation/agitation, concentration, and fatigue postnatally. In a subgroup of this sample (n=449), 17% of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depression at least once in pregnancy, melancholic depression (2.4%), atypical depression (4.4%), and non-specified depression (10.2%). Mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood, and sleep pattern discriminated between the two groups. Also, there was a significant difference in diurnal pattern of cortisol between postnatally depressed and non-depressed women, due to differences at waking and +30 min. Discussion: These findings suggest that perinatal depression has different associated symptoms from depression at other times. The cortisol pattern in the postnatally depressed women is similar to that reported for post-traumatic stress disorder and atypical depression and may reflect a response in vulnerable women to the marked cortisol withdrawal that occurs after delivery.

N2  - This study investigated the effects of maternal changes during pregnancy in diet, exercise, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight parameters at birth and 6 months. In overweight/obese (OW/OB; n = 132) mothers, greater % kcal from sweets early in pregnancy was the strongest, independent predictor of higher weight for age (WFA) (beta = 0. 19; P = 0. 004), higher odds of macrosomia (OR = 1.1 (1.01.2); P = 0. 004) andWFA 90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.11.3); P = 0. 002) and higher WFA at 6 months (beta = 0. 30; P = 0. 002). In normal weight (n = 153) mothers, higher intake of soft drinks was the strongest predictor of higher offspring WFA at birth (beta = 0.16; P = 0. 04) but not at 6 months. Prenatal physical activity, depressive symptoms, and sleep-related variables did not significantly predict offspring weight outcomes. Mothers eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in OW/OB mothers, may have a lasting effect on child weight. Copyright © 2011 Suzanne Phelan et al.

N2  - Introduction: Advanced paternal age (APA) is a risk factor for nonaffective psychosis (NAP) in the offspring, although the mechanism(s) of this association are not clear. The aim of this study was to examine whether later childbearing can be explained by parental schizophrenia, and in doing so, further evaluate the "de novo mutation" hypothesis for the association between APA and NAP. Methods: Using binary logistic regression, the association between APA and parental history of schizophrenia in the offspring, considering maternal and paternal history separately, was examined in 1) all persons with NAP born in Finland between 1950 and 1969 (Finnish NAP Cohort, n = 13,712), and 2) members of the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966, n = 10,224), a general population birth cohort. Results: In the Finnish NAP Cohort, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA (Odds Ratio [OR] for linear trend = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.29, p < 0.01). In the NFBC 1966 sample, having a mother with schizophrenia was associated with APA at the trend level (OR = 1.14, 0.99-1.31, p = 0.07). By contrast, there was no association between having a father with schizophrenia and APA. Discussion: In both a general population cohort and a birth cohort of subjects with nonaffective psychosis, APA was associated with maternal, but not paternal, schizophrenia. These findings suggest that increased genetic risk from the mother may explain the association between APA and nonaffective psychosis, and argue against the "de novo mutation" hypothesis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to use objective methods to assess the association between maternal smoking and body composition in offspring. Methods: A total of 2508 grade 4 school children were enrolled; all underwent lifestyle disease and passive smoking screening. Children were classified into four groups according to their urinary cotinine level and maternal smoking status during or before pregnancy. Items measured on lifestyle disease screening were compared among the four groups. Results: Only degree of obesity (DO) and body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy. The prevalence of both DO >20% and DO >30%, and BMI >22% and BMI >25% was highest in children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy. These children had a tendency toward shorter height and increased weight although it was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences between maternal smoking status and lipid profile among groups. Confounders such as food, exercise and sleep were able to be eliminated Conclusion: Maternal smoking during pregnancy may be an independent risk factor of changing body composition in offspring, that is, shorter height and increased weight. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Times of hormonal change affect mood, cognition and the sense of well-being in many women of childbearing age. There has been increasing recognition of the clinical significance and need for treatment of disorders that occur both premenstrually and during perimenopause. The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with physical changes as well as increases in irritability, anxiety, depression and sensitivity to stress. Four percent to 9% of women suffer premenstrual dysphoric disorder in which significant symptoms impact functioning in areas of work, relationships or study. Recent treatment approaches include the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and newer oral contraceptives. As women enter the early years of perimenopause, physical and emotional symptoms emerge. Hot flashes, sleep disturbance and perceived disturbances of memory, concentration and mood are frequently reported. A risk of depression increases during this time. The effect of physical symptoms on emotional well-being has been a topic of research with implications for treatment. This presentation focuses on recent research findings which may affect assessment and treatment of these gender specific disorders. At the conclusion of this presentation, the participants should be able to demonstrate an understanding of recent research/ clinical advances in the diagnosis and treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and perimenopause/menopause.

The most common causes are endocrine - particularly primary aldosteronism, renal (renal parenchymal and renovascular) hypertension, sleep apnea syndrome and hypertension in pregnancy. Patients with secondary hypertension often have very high blood pressure. With regard to the possibility of permanent cure / improved control of hypertension is appropriate for patient with suspected secondary form of hypertension to be examined in a specialized center.

N2  - Circadian clock controls several physiological processes such as cell proliferation. Extravillous trophoblast proliferation is a tightly regulated function playing a fundamental role in maternal vessel remodeling. We recently demonstrated that clock genes Per2 and Dec1 as well as the clock-controlled genes Dbp and Vegf are rhythmically expressed in human extravillous trophoblast-derived HTR-8/SVneo cells. Analyzing the time course of HTR-8/SVneo cell proliferation, a circadian variation in cell number was found. Moreover, we showed a rhythmic expression of mRNAs for Wee1 and stathmin, two genes involved in cell cycle progression. We suggest that circadian clockwork may orchestrate the functionality of the several factors involved in the control of human trophoblast functions that are fundamental for a successfully pregnancy outcome. © 2011 Japan Human Cell Society and Springer.

N2  - Introduction: Several drugs can cause galactorrhea and it's etiology needs to be differentiated from other local or neuroendocrinological causes. All conventional antipsychotic drugs block D2 receptors on lactotroph cells and thus remove the main inhibitory influence on prolactin secretion. Tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are less frequent causes. There is evidence that serotonin may stimulate prolactin release directly via postsynaptic 5-HT receptors in the hypothalamus or indirectly via 5-HT mediated inhibition of tubuloinfundibular dopaminergic neurons. However, galactorrhea due to antidepressants is not consistently associated with elevated prolactin levels, which may suggest still unexplained mechanisms of antidepressant-induced galactorrhea. We report a case of euprolactinemic galactorrhea in a woman with generalized anxiety disorder while on treatment with fluoxetine. Case Report: A 29-year-old woman visited a psychiatric outpatient clinic with complaints of excessive and uncontrollable worry about minor life events, feeling restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, tiring easily, and poor sleep that started 8 months prior to admission. She had no history of endocrine or reproductive pathology or psychiatric problems. She was diagnosed as having generalized anxiety disorder according to the DSM-IV criteria and was started on fluoxetine 20 mg per day. After 4 weeks of medication, her symptoms diminished. However, she developed unilateral galactorrhea (the nonpuerperal discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast). She had no history of galactorrhea. She first noticed the discharge on treatment day 21 and described it as white-creamy and from the right nipple. She did not notice any bloody, greenish, or foul-smelling discharge, nor did she report any sexual dysfunction. She consulted her gynecologist, who recommended a mammogram and breast ultrasonography. The pregnancy test was negative. The results of these tests and breast examination were normal. Serum prolactin level on treatment day 28 was 18.18 ng/mL (reference range: 2.5-29 ng/mL). Because her galactorrhea developed after the initiation of fluoxetine, her medication was discontinued. Buspirone 5 mg/day was started and gradually raised to 20 mg/day. Eight days after stopping fluoxetine, the patient reported reduction and cessation of galactorrhea. At the 3 month follow-up visit, the patient was well maintained on buspirone and there was no re-emergence of galactorrhea. Discussion: Although galactorrhea caused by the use of fluoxetine has been reported earlier, the commonly perceived cause is hyperprolactinemia. Fluoxetine has been shown to potentiate elevation of prolactin levels from other stimuli, including insulin, fenfluramine, and 5-HT. However, hyperprolactinemia is not the only mechanism responsible for the development of SSRI-induced galactorrhea. The exact mechanism of galactorrhea remains unknown in many cases. Our patient developed galactorrhea without hyperprolactinemia after beginning fluoxetine therapy. The strict temporal relationship between the use of the drug and the onset of galactorrhea, as well as the resolution once treatment was discontinued, suggests a causal link between the two phenomena. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report an association with fluoxetine use and galactorrhea without elevated prolactin levels. Clinicians should consider fluoxetine as a possible cause of galactorrhea even with normal prolactin levels. Future research should investigate the precise mechanisms of antidepressant-induced normoprolactinemic galactorrhea.

N2  - Animal studies can contribute to addressing the issue of possible greater health risk for children exposed to 50-60 Hz extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MFs), mostly in terms of teratological effects and cancer. Teratology has been extensively studied in animals exposed to ELF MFs but experiments have not established adverse developmental effects. Childhood leukaemia has been the only cancer consistently reported in epidemiological studies as associated with exposure to ELF MFs. This association has been the basis for the classification as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2002. Animal experiments have provided only limited support for these epidemiological findings. However, none but one study used an animal model for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the main form of childhood leukaemia, and exposures to ELF MFs were not carried out over the whole pregnancy period, when the first hit of ALL is assumed to occur. Moreover, there are no generally accepted biophysical mechanisms that could explain carcinogenic effects of low-level MFs. The radical pair mechanism and related cryptochromes (CRY) molecules have recently been identified in birds and other non-mammalian species, as a sensor of the geomagnetic field, involved in navigation. The hypothesis has to be tested in mammalian models. CRY, which is part of the molecular circadian clock machinery, is a ubiquitous protein likely to be involved in cancer cell growth and DNA repair. In summary, we now have some clues to test for a better characterization of the interaction between ALL and ELF MFs exposure. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - The prehistoric art discovered in Eurasian caves, created from 37,000 to 12,000 years ago, has fascinated and perplexed historians and scientists. These caves were uninhabited, devoted to art, the first art galleries. A psychoanalytic interpretation of these extraordinary works, this paper addresses the motives of the Paleolithic artists, the meanings of their art, and the relationship of the art and the artists to the cave. While nonanalytic formulations are considered, from a psychoanalytic perspective, the interpretation of the cave is symbolic of the womb, the birth canal, and the primal cavity of self-object relationship. Art was created in identification with pregnancy and birth; art endured as reassurance against permanent darkness and death. Entering and leaving the cave could also represent coitus but, a on a deeper level, attachment and separation. The cave had magical and developmental significance, a transitional space between internal and external, fantasy and reality, death and rebirth. The creation of art and music, and the invention of intentional, controlled fire, marked the arrival of Homo sapiens, differentiated from all preceding and parallel primates. The painted cave might also have represented a cephalic container with illuminated imagery suggestive of dreaming sleep. © 2011 The International Federation of Psychoanalytic Societies.

N2  - Auditory perception and learning take place during the third trimester of gestation. Fetuses and newborns who lack typical auditory experience can go on to develop typical socioemotional attachment and language, given a supportive environment. For hospitalized preterm infants in developmentally sensitive neonatal intensive care units, detrimental effects of deviant early auditory experience may be remediated by later experience, but much is unknown about the causes of language deficits of prematurity. Prenatal auditory stimulation programs that incorporate audio speakers against the maternal belly should be discouraged because of possible overstimulation effects on the developing auditory system and sleep/wake state organization. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a disease whose etiology remains unclear. Numerous socioeconomic, environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors have been related to ITP, however their presence is variable and their relationship to ITP is not well understood. A questionnaire was created to study these relationships, to better understand what causes ITP and to relate this information to the course of disease, including response to treatment. Method: A literature search, 60 ITP patient interviews and multiple reviews by project coordinators, nurse practitioner, Platelet Disorder Support Association (PDSA) members, hematologists, and patients were performed to design a questionnaire. A pilot study was then conducted where 55 ITP patients from Cornell completed the questionnaire with the aim to further improve it. The next step will be to post a final version on the PDSA web site for 1,000 patients to complete it so that a database can be created. The questionnaire will also be given to a non-ITP patient population to serve as controls. Result: A 30 minute 93 item questionnaire that encompasses both children and adult patients was developed. The questionnaire documents factors that correlate with ITP and were present prior to diagnosis with the disease. It documents whether any of these factors changed and the effect of this change on ITP symptoms (worsening or improving). Among the factors addressed are nationality; country where the patient grew up; income; occupational hazards; neighborhood (e.g. Urban, Suburban, etc.); changes in job/school (e.g. remodeling or building damage); exposure to environmental hazards; travel history; medications taken; accidents; animal bites; pets; diet (e.g. increase/decrease in daily caloric intake, eliminating a type of food); allergies; exercise; sleep; stress level/stress reduction activities; alcohol consumption; smoking; drug abuse; consumption of certain foods (e.g. tonic water, sugar substitutes); vitamin deficiencies; vaccinations; general health state and medical history; pregnancy; infections; past history and family history of blood diseases, bone marrow diseases, inflammatory diseases, malignancies, autoimmune disorders and platelet production disorders; and past surgeries/procedures/hospitalizations. A few quality of life factors are also documented, among these are: the patient's understanding of the disease and treatment options, resources, support network and side effects to ITP treatment. Finally, the questionnaire documents the severity of ITP symptoms, treatments received for ITP and the patient's response to these treatments. Conclusion: This questionnaire is meant to capture a snapshot of different factors that correlate with ITP and treatment responses. It attempts to understand whether a patient's response to different treatment modalities relates to the presence or absence of any of these factors. The questionnaire will also be given to a control group to see whether these socioeconomic, environmental, life-style and genetic factors are over-represented in ITP patients, when their prevalence is compared to a non-ITP population. This tool is meant to be broad in order to identify multiple significant factors that could be further investigated in more detail, and including molecular studies.

N2  - OBJECTIVE - To explore relationships among sleep disturbances, glucose tolerance, and pregnancy outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Four validated sleep questionnaires were administered to 169 pregnant women at the time of 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during the second trimester. Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in 108 women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). RESULTS - Of the participants, 41% had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] >8); 64% had poor sleep quality; 25% snored frequently; 29% had increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); 52% experienced short sleep (SS); 19% had both increased SDB risk and SS (SDB/SS); and 14% had daytime dysfunction. Reported sleep duration inversely correlated with glucose values from 50-g OGTT (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). Each hour of reduced sleep time was associated with a 4%increase in glucose levels. Increased likelihood of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was found in subjects with increased SDB risk (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.2-7.4]), SS (2.4 [1.0-5.9]), SDB/SS (3.4 [1.3-8.7]), and frequent snoring (3.4 [1.3-8.8], after adjustment for BMI). Among NGT subjects, preterm delivery was more frequent in those with increased ESS (P = 0.02), poor sleep quality (P = 0.02), and SS (P = 0.03). Neonatal intensive care unit admissions were associated with increased ESS (P = 0.03), SDB/SS (P = 0.03), and daytime dysfunction (P < 0.01) in mothers. CONCLUSIONS - Pregnant women experience significant sleep disturbances that are associated with increased risk of GDM and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women with increased SDB risk, frequent snoring, and sleep duration of <7 h/night have increased risk of developing GDM. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbance is a significant health issue in pregnant women. Although previous studies contribute to an understanding of the multifactorial nature of pregnancy-related sleep disturbance, objective measures of sleep were not included, and so data may be subject to recall and potential participant self-report bias. OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to identify sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors associated with poor sleep quality in women during their third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This prospective study included 30 nulliparous women who wore a wrist actigraph to objectively monitor sleep for 7 consecutive days and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Fifteen women (50%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score of >5, indicating poor sleep quality. Mean actigraphic sleep efficiency was only 80.05% ± 6.27%. There were significant differences (p < .01) in sleep offset time and total nocturnal sleep time between weekdays and weekends. Later sleep onset time was associated with poorer sleep, including longer sleep latency, and reduced total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency. Discussion: Nulliparous women experience both objective and subjective sleep disturbances, and their sleep patterns differ between weekdays and weekends during their third trimester of pregnancy. Results suggest that maternal sleep pattern may be improved by maintaining a regular and earlier bedtime so women have more opportunity to obtain sufficient nocturnal sleep and improved sleep quality.

N2  - Study Objectives: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major public health priority and the most common adverse pregnancy outcome. Several risk factors have been identified, but a gap in the understanding of the underlying etiology of PTB persists. Poor sleep quality is a correlate of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, we evaluated whether sleep quality during pregnancy was a clinically relevant risk factor for PTB. Design: Observational Measurements and Results: Participants included 166 pregnant women (mean age = 28.6 ± 5.5 years). Self-report questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), were administered at 14-16, 24-26, and 30-32 weeks gestation. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate whether sleep quality was associated with preterm delivery. Poor sleep quality was a predictor of preterm birth, with the largest effects in early pregnancy (14-16 weeks) (OR: 1.25 95% CI [1.04-1.50], P = 0.02) and more modest effects in later pregnancy (30-32 weeks) (OR: 1.18 95% CI [0.98-1.42], P = 0.07). With every one-point increase on the PSQI, the odds of preterm birth increase 25% in early pregnancy and 18% in later pregnancy. Conclusions: Poor sleep quality, in both early and late pregnancy, is associated with an increased risk of delivering preterm. Currently the specific pathway(s) through which disturbed sleep contributes to PTB are unknown. We suggest that poor sleep may contribute to increased risk for PTB both independently, as well as in conjunction with other established risk factors, such as stress.

N2  - Introduction: The objective of this study is to investigate the morphology of the common iliac artery (CIA) and vein (CIV) comparing right and left sides in females versus males. Pregnant women favor lying on one side. The reason for this may be due to morphology and orientation between the CIA and CIV. Virtually all women during their pregnancy suffer from lower limb (LL) swelling. This study will provide an anatomical explanation for the propensity to lie consistently on one side and LL swelling and offer prevention measures. Method: Literature search was conducted on texts, journals and websites regarding the morphology and orientation of the right and left CIA and CIV. Measurements from 30 dissected cadavers was conducted on the right and left CIA and CIV. Results: Literature search revealed no studies investigating the morphology and orientation between the right and left CIA and CIV. Cadaver results revealed a relatively direct anterior to posterior orientation between the right CIA and CIV, but a relative oblique lateral to medial orientation between the left CIA and CIV. Discussion. Third trimester pregnant women tend to lie on their left side regardless previous sleep habits and suffer from LL swelling which manifests as toe, ankle and sacral edema. The arterial system is left sided, while the venous system is right sided. This leads to an interesting CIA and CIV orientation within the pelvis. As the uterus and fetus grow anterosuperiorly, they compress the CIA, which in turn collapses the CIV posteriorly on the right side more so than the left side due to different orientation. Conclusion: This study suggests an explanation why women lie on their left side when resting and sleeping during the third trimester due to the clinically relevant anatomy between the CIA and CIV.

N2  - Background Varying work schedules are suspected of increasing risks to pregnant women and to fetal wellbeing. In particular, maternal hormonal disturbance arising from sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm disruption might impair fetal growth or lead to complications of pregnancy. Two independent meta-analyses (from 2000 to 2007) reported a small adverse effect of shift work on the risk of preterm delivery (PTD). However, these reviews were based on few high-quality studies. Objectives To provide an updated review of the associations of shift work with PTD, low birthweight (LBW), small-for- gestational-age (SGA) infants and pre-eclampsia. Search strategy and selection criteria We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE using combinations of keywords and MeSH terms. Data collection and analysis For each relevant paper we abstracted standard details, used to summarise design features and rate methodological quality. We calculated pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) in random-effect meta-analyses. Main results We retrieved 23 relevant studies. The pooled estimate of RR for PTD was 1.16 (95% CI 1.00-1.33, 16 studies), but when five reports of poorer methodological quality were excluded, the estimated RR decreased to 1.03 (95% CI 0.93-1.14). We also observed increased RRs for LBW (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93-1.74) and for SGA (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.22), which varied little by study quality. Little evidence was found on pre-eclampsia. Conclusions These findings suggest that overall, any risk of PTD, LBW, or SGA arising from shift work in pregnancy is small. © 2011 The Authors BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology © 2011 RCOG.

N2  - Tumor necrosis factor is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine and TNF receptor p55 (TNFRp55) mediates most of the TNF effects. Pregnancy, either with or without signs of infection, show elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in maternal serum and fetal membranes when parturition is imminent. How this inflammatory milliu could impact on the maternal synovial membrane has not been investigated. Our objective was to study the consequences of TNFRp55 deficiency on the interleukine(IL)-17 and progesterone (Pg) levels in the joint of C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and TNFRp55-/- (KO) mice. IL-17 and Pg were determined by ELISA and RIA, respectively. We found elevated levels of IL-17 at the end of pregnancy in WT mice compared to diestrous stage. Moreover, IL-17 levels were lower in KO than WT mice at the end of pregnancy (p<0.01). Interestingly, this cytokine exhibited a circadian profile in the joint of WT which was abolished in the deficient mice. On the other hand, Pg also showed a circadian rhythm in both strains. The rhythm acrophase was advanced in the KO mice. Although, there was no difference in the levels of this hormone at the end of pregnancy, we found lower levels of Pg in KO mice at the diestrous (p<0.01). These results suggest that TNFRp55 signaling plays a key role in the inflammatory process that constitutes normal-term labour as well as in its circadian modulation.

N2  - Gestational lead exposure (GLE) produces supernormal scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) in children, monkeys and rats, and a novel retinal phenotype characterized by an increased number of rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells in adult mice and rats. Since the loss of dopaminergic amacrine cells (DA ACs) in GLE monkeys and rats contributes to supernormal ERGs, the retinal DA system was analyzed in mice following GLE. C57BL/6 female mice were exposed to low (27. ppm), moderate (55. ppm) or high (109. ppm) lead throughout gestation and until postnatal day 10 (PN10). Blood [Pb] in control, low-, moderate- and high-dose GLE was ≤ 1, ≤ 10, ~ 25 and ~ 40 μg/dL, respectively, on PN10 and by PN30 all were ≤ 1 μg/dL. At PN60, confocal-stereology studies used vertical sections and wholemounts to characterize tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and the number of DA and other ACs. GLE dose-dependently and selectively decreased the number of TH-immunoreactive (IR) DA ACs and their synaptic plexus without affecting GABAergic, glycinergic or cholinergic ACs. Immunoblots and confocal revealed dose-dependent decreases in retinal TH protein expression and content, although monoamine oxidase-A protein and gene expression were unchanged. High-pressure liquid chromatography showed that GLE dose-dependently decreased retinal DA content, its metabolites and DA utilization/release. The mechanism of DA selective vulnerability is unknown. However, a GLE-induced loss/dysfunction of DA ACs during development could increase the number of rods and bipolar cells since DA helps regulate neuronal proliferation, whereas during adulthood it could produce ERG supernormality as well as altered circadian rhythms, dark/light adaptation and spatial contrast sensitivity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy results in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Despite our increasing knowledge of the magnitude and breadth of abnormalities associated with FASD, little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms. We have established a C57BL/6J mouse model of developmental ethanol exposure that shows FASD-related behavioural phenotypes. In particular, we have shown that that ethanol treatment representing binge-like doses during synaptogenesis (third human trimester equivalent) results in spatial learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze. Using this model, we have also identified genome-wide changes in brain gene expression associated with neurodevelopmental alcohol exposure, both immediately following treatment (4 h postinjection) as well as long-term changes (postnatal day 60). Differentially- expressed genes were extracted (1.5-fold, FDR\0.05) and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology annotations for biological function, pathway, or interactions. Results revealed that the acute response to ethanol (4 h) included significant alterations in inflammatory, cell survival, and, interestingly, circadian rhythm-associated gene pathways. Long-term, persistent gene expression changes were more subtle but affected a number of pathways with wider biological roles. This included significant disruption of cadherin gene family cell adhesion molecules and neurotransmitter-associated pathways (glutamatergic, GABAergic, and serotonin systems were all identified). These data suggest that immediate cell survival mechanisms may induce long-term changes in critical cell-communication mechanisms, which may mediate the effects of ethanol exposure during synaptogenesis and its effects into early adulthood. These genes and pathways have relevance to FASD pathogenesis, and the identification of genome-wide changes in neurodevelopmental genetic programming may facilitate our understanding of the permanent behavioural and neurocellular consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Background: We examined the extent to which combinations of 4 modifiable prenatal and infant risk factors predict obesity risk at age 7 y. Methods: In 948 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, we estimated risk of obesity according to maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. Outcomes at 7 y were child obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile), BMI z-score, and DXA %fat. To estimate probabilities or means of the outcomes for each of the 16 combinations of the 4 risk factors, we ran logistic or linear regression models with all 4 factors plus maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. Results: In pregnancy, 8.8% of mothers smoked; 58% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 71% breastfed <12 m; 31% slept <12 h/day. At age 7 y, 10.8% were obese. Estimated risks of obesity ranged from 0.04 in 7-year-olds with favorable levels of all 4 risk factors to 0.31 with adverse levels of all 4. Including potentially mediating variables sugary drink intake, fast food, screen time, and physical activity at age 7 hardly changed this range: 0.03-0.33. Favorable-adverse range for BMI-z was 0.07-0.79; for DXA %fat it was 23.2-26.5%. Conclusions: Healthful levels of 4 early developmental risk factors predicted much lower risk of obesity, and adiposity levels, at age 7 than did adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have large impact on childhood obesity prevention.

N2  - Introduction: Methylxanthines and doxapram have been widely used for the treatment of apneas of prematurity. Both substances have effects on the central nervous system. While there are data available concerning the use of caffeine (the methylxanthine used at our NICU) even proposing a positive effect on neurodevelopmental outcome of very preterm infants, there are data which suggest a negative effect of the central stimulants doxapram on longterm outcome. Nevertheless, only scarce data are available concerning the effect of these medications on brain activity of very preterm infants until now. Aim: The aim of this study was the assessment of the effect of stimulating substances on brain activity of preterm infants born below 30 weeks of gestation. Methods: Brain activity was measured by one-channel amplitudeintegrated EEG (aEEG). The first aEEG measurement was performed without caffeine and/or doxapram medication. At least 1 h of brain activity was registrated. The second measurement was done at least 24 h after the start of caffeine and/or doxapram treatment. The percentage of different background patterns, the occurrence and duration of sleep-wake-cycling, and the occurrence and duration of seizures was assessed and analysed. Neurodevelopmental outcome will be assessed at one and 2 years of corrected age by assessment of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II and standardized clinical neurological examination. Summary: Doxapram therapy lead to significantly more continuous patterns as well as to more seizure activity in preterm infants below a gestational age of 30 weeks.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition contributing to oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to ascertain if there is any connection between OSA and novel oxidative stress-related markers. Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), soluble receptors for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) were measured. Further biochemical markers were evaluated. Material/Methods: Fifty-one men suspected for OSA indicated for night polygraphy were included. Apnea/hypop-nea index (AHI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), mean blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO2) and time of blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation below 90% (SpO2 <90%) were measured. Morning venous blood samples were taken. Results: For body mass index (BMI) we found strong positive correlation with levels of Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fbrinogen, and negative correlation with sRAGE. Concerning ventilation parameters, we found positive correlation of ODI and SpO2 <90% with markers MMP-9 and hsCRP. sRAGE level correlated with AHI and ODI negatively. SpO2 correlated negatively with Cu, MMP-9, hsCRP and fbrinogen. There was no correlation between ventilation parameters and markers MMP-2, PAPP-A and Zn. Compared to severity of OSA, there was signifcant difference in levels of hsCRP and Cu between patients with AHI ≤5 and AHI ≥30 independent of BMI. Conclusions: MMP-9, hsCRP, sRAGE and Cu seem to be strong predictors of oxidative stress in OSA patients. The strong correlation between oxidative stress-related markers and OSA is elucidated by connection of these to BMI, which is probably a primary condition of oxidative stress, but OSA is an additive condition. © Med Sci Monit.

N2  - Background: Treatment of schizophrenia frequently includes prolonged benzodiazepine administration despite a lack of evidence of its use. It is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines because of the development of dependence. We aim to assess if melatonin can facilitate the withdrawal of prolonged benzodiazepine administration in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the association of benzodiazepine dose reduction with the following clinically important variables: sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life.Methods/Design: Randomized, blinded, two-armed, parallel superiority trial. We plan to include 80 consenting outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 18-55 years of age, treated with antipsychotic drug(s) and at least one benzodiazepine derivative for the last three months before inclusion. Exclusion criteria: currently under treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, aggressive or violent behavior, known mental retardation, pervasive developmental disorder, dementia, epilepsy, terminal illness, severe co morbidity, inability to understand Danish, allergy to melatonin, lactose, starch, gelatin, or talc, hepatic impairment, pregnancy or nursing, or lack of informed consent. After being randomized to prolonged-release melatonin (Circadin®) 2 mg daily or matching placebo, participants are required to slowly taper off their benzodiazepine dose. The primary outcome measure is benzodiazepine dose at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include sleep, psychophysiological, and neurocognitive measures. Data are collected at baseline and at 6 months follow-up regarding medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, sleep, laboratory tests, adverse events, psychopathology, social function, and quality of life. Data on medical treatment, cognition, psychophysiology, adverse events, social function, and quality of life are also collected at 2 and 4 months follow-up.Discussion: The results from this trial will examine whether melatonin has a role in withdrawing long-term benzodiazepine administration in schizophrenia patients. This group of patients is difficult to treat and therefore often subject to polypharmacy which may play a role in the reduced life expectancy of patients compared to the background population. The results will also provide new information on the association of chronic benzodiazepine treatment with sleep, psychophysiology, cognition, social function, and quality of life. Knowledge of these important clinical aspects is lacking in this group of patients.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials NCT01431092. © 2011 Baandrup et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Arterial hypertension is a common worldwide disease with a prevalence of approximately 26%. Secondary cause is known in 5-10% of patients with hypertension. We should think of secondary hypertension in all patients with resistant hypertension, in patients with sudden deterioration in the control of hypertension and in patients with laboratory and clinical signs of diseases associated with secondary hypertension. It is important to distinguish between secondary hypertension and pseudo-resistance (noncompliance to treatment, white coat syndrome). Secondary causes of hypertension can be divided into endocrine (primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma, hypercortisolism, hyperparathyreoidism), renal - renovascular and renal parenchymal hypertension, and other causes as sleep apnoe syndrome, hypertension in pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta and intracranial tumors.

N2  - Introduction: It is thought that upper airway obstruction during sleep may develop during pregnancy, with negative outcomes for the mother and foetus. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy is often investigated using self-report questionnaires which have been validated in predominantly male, middle-aged populations. It is not known how accurate these questionnaires are in identifying women at risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). This study examines the predictive value of two commonly-used questionnaires administered at two time points in a group of pregnant women. Methods: Thirty-six pregnant women completed the Multivariate Apnea Risk Index (MAPI) and the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) in the 2nd trimester (20-24 weeks, T2) and again at 37 weeks gestation (T3) at the time of having an overnight polysomnogram (PSG). Results: (i) PSG: AHI ≥ 5 was found in 10 out of 36 (28%) women. (ii) BQ: At T2, the BQ identified 24 women as having a high risk for OSA. The sensitivity and specificity of the BQ in T2 for AHI ≥ 5 were 90% and 42% respectively, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 38% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 92%. The predictive ability of the BQ did not improve if completed at T3; sensitivity 90%, specificity 27%, PPV 32% and NPV 88%. (iii) MAPI: At T2, the predictive ability of the MAPI for AHI ≥ 5 using the area under an ROC curve was 0.74. This increased to 0.79 after removing gender, age and BMI from the model. The predictive ability of the MAPI did not improve if completed at 37 weeks; the area under the ROC curve fell to 0.63. The area under the ROC curve increased to 0.72 if gender, age and BMI are again removed from the model. Discussion: The Berlin Questionnaire is useful to rule out pregnant women without OSA, but is not able to identify those with OSA. Hence, utilising self-report measures alone in studies ofSDBin pregnant women is likely to result in significant inaccuracy in prevalence estimates and relationships to other outcomes. The predictive ability of both questionnaires was better at an earlier stage of pregnancy; this is promising if earlier detection can result in effective intervention. The predictive ability of the MAPI was improved with removal of BMI from the model, suggesting that BMI is a less important predictor of OSA in pregnancy compared to the general population.

N2  - Fetal movement is an index of fetal well-being. We have developed a record-analysis system for fetal movement during maternal sleep at home using a new sensor (FMAM: Fetal Movement Acceleration Measurement). Pregnant women who previously experienced stillbirth or neonatal death have high anxiety when facing another pregnancy. This study looked at the use of long-term home monitoring of fetal movement in high-risk pregnant women in order to reduce their anxiety. Methods: Subjects were ten normal pregnant women (range: 29 yr-39 yr) and two high-risk pregnant women (33 yr and 38 yr) who previously experienced stillbirth or neonatal death. All subjects gave written informed consent to the study. We provided FMAM recorders to the subjects. In addition, midwives visited the homes of the two women at risk to check their health. All subjects used the FMAM recorder once every four weeks. One sensor was placed on the abdomen to record fetal movement, and the other was placed on the thigh to record their own movement. All women recorded fetal movement during sleep by themselves. Results: Median (and range) numbers for fetal movement per hour during sleep for the normal pregnant women were 116 (56-206), 110 (42-173), 108 (68-152), and 99 (31-146) at 24, 28, 32, and 36 gestation weeks respectively. There were large individual differences in fetal movement. The numbers for fetal movement for the woman who previously experienced stillbirth were 53 and 47 at 34 and 36 weeks respectively. The numbers for fetal movement for the woman who previously experienced neonatal death were 52, 81, 94, and 93 at 24, 29, 34, and 37 weeks respectively. Conclusion: The number of fetal movements per hour during sleep for the two women who experienced stillbirth or neonatal death was similar to those for the normal pregnant women. Knowing weekly variation of fetal movement at night contributed to reducing anxiety in the pregnant women at risk. Interviews were also useful for reducing their anxiety.

N2  - Sleep is involved in apprehension and depression, and has both physical and psychologocal effects. Thus, sleep is thought to be useful in improving minor symptoms during pregnancy. This study was therefore conducted for the purpose of identifying the correlation between sleep and minor symptoms during pregnancy. Methods: Aquestionnaire survey was conducted on 239 complicationfree pregnant women. The contents of the survey consisted of the frequency at which the time of going to bed or waking up varying by more than 2 hours during pregnancy and the occurrence of minor symptoms (including constipation, stiff shoulders, drowsiness, lower back pain, lazy, easily, fatigued, irritability, light sleep, depression and stomach discomfort). These minor symptoms were scored by determining the product of the frequency and degree of each symptom. The total of these scores was defined as overall minor symptom score. The subjects were analyzed by categorizing into a regular bedtime/wakeup group, in which changes in bedtime/wakeup time did not vary or only varied 1 or 2 times a month, and an irregular bedtime/wakeup group, in which changes varied daily or 1 to 2 times a week, and the two groups were compared for the occurrence of minor symptoms during pregnancy. Results: As a result of comparing the two groups, with respect to bedtime, the regular group demonstrated significantly lower overall minor symptom scores as well as scores for stiff shoulders, lazy, easily fatigued, irritability, light sleep and depression (p < .05). With respect to wakeup time, the regular group demonstrated significantly lower overall minor symptom scores as well as scores for easily fatigued and depression (p < .05). Conclusion: A definite correlation was observed between sleep regularity and the occurrence of minor symptoms during pregnancy.

N2  - PURPOSE: Snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes and cesarean deliveries. The purpose of this study was to assess whether excessive daytime sleepiness assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) increases the risk of these complications further. METHODS: Following IRB approval and informed consent, english-speaking women in the immediate postpartum period were systematically selected and recruited. Women answered a survey that includes questions regarding symptoms of sleep disordered breathing using the multivariable apnea prediction index, and excessive daytime sleepiness using ESS. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were collected by review of medical records. ESS > 10 was used as a cut off (sleepy group). Standard statistical analysis with multivariable logistic regression was performed. RESULTS: A total of 939 women were recruited in 18 months. Mean age was 29.1 +/- 6.0 years. The majority of women were white, non-Hispanic (69.3%). Mean BMI pre-pregnancy was 26.1 +/- 6.2 and 22% of women had BMI >/= 30. Snoring women who underwent cesarean delivery were more likely to have higher ESS scores, OR 1.08 (1.01-1.15) even after adjusting for birth weight and multifetal pregnancies. Snorers with gestational diabetes tended to have higher ESS scores, OR 1.07 (0.99-1.14), p=0.09. There was no statistically significant difference in gestational hypertension, gestational age at birth or birth weight among sleepy snorers and non sleepy snorers. CONCLUSIONS: Higher ESS scores appear to add to the association of snoring with cesarean delivery. However, abnormal ESS scores did not add to the risk of gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm birth or growth restriction CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Excessive daytime sleepiness may have some prognostic implications in pregnant women who snore.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring is indicative of increased upper airway resistance and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and is a cause of hypertension and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the non-pregnant population. Snoring and SDB increase during the course of pregnancy and is associated with pregnancy induced hypertension, gestational diabetes and possibly adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. Aim: To objectively measure the increase in snoring and SDB throughout pregnancy and to examine its association with blood pressure. Methods: Thirty women were recruited from Fertility First following confirmation of pregnancy. All subjects had a series of at home all night sleep studies at regular intervals during the pregnancy using the SonoMat™ system to detect snoring and SDB. Blood pressure was measured immediately prior to and following the sleep study. The women also completed a questionnaire including questions about current snoring and general health. Results: Snoring increased markedly as the pregnancy progressed. At 6 weeks gestation mean snoring was 7.3 ± 10.8% of the night, and this rose to 25.1 ± 23.4% of the night (P < 0.0005) during the 3rd trimester. The number of women with significant snoring (> 20% of night) also rose with only 10% at 6 weeks increasing to 47% of women during the 3rd trimester. Those who snored > 20% of night in the 3rd trimester had significantly higher blood pressure, and had a larger rise in BP over the duration of the pregnancy. (Table presented) Conclusion: An increase in snoring during pregnancy is temporally associated with an increase in blood pressure.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring, a sign of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), is associated with gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes and small for gestational age (SGA). A few studies suggest that in pregnancy, SDB is a risk factor for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. We have previously shown that women with pre-eclampsia have an increase in arterial blood pressure during sleep that is induced by upper airway flow limitation, a form of obstructed snoring. In contrast, arterial blood pressure (BP) typically falls during sleep i.e. 'nocturnal dipping', in healthy people. Aim: To examine the relationship between snoring and overnight BP during pregnancy. Methods: Snoring and SDB were recorded overnight in the woman's home using a SonoMat™ device, a thin mattress overlay with sensors that measure breath sounds, breathing movements, heart sounds, and body movement. Overnight arterial blood pressure (BP) was recorded using a SpaceLabs™ device which uses an arm cuff that inflates every 30 min during sleep time, and every 20 min during wake time. Fifty five pregnant women had overnight monitoring of snoring and BP measurements, and 38 also had sufficient recordings of blood pressure during wakefulness which allowed comparison between wake and sleep BP. Results: The occurrence of snoring was associated with an increased overnight BP. When women were grouped according to the amount of overnight recorded snoring, there was a significantly higher average and maximum BP in women with more than 30% of 'sleep time' spent in snoring compared with those who snored for < 20% of 'sleep time'. Women with < 20% snoring also had more blood pressure dipping i.e. average systolic and diastolic BP were lower during the night than in women who snored for ≥ 30% (P = 0.02 and 0.04 respectively), but there were no significant differences in the change from wake to sleep in the maximum BP. Conclusion: Overnight snoring of 30% or greater of 'sleep time' is associated with an increased arterial blood pressure and loss of the expected nocturnal dipping. Pregnant women who snore should have greater and more regular clinical attention to their arterial blood pressure and be investigated for gestational hypertension.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a symptom of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Several studies have found that SDB during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. Aims: To determine the relationships between reported snoring and several measurements known to be associated with SDB i.e. blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference and daytime sleepiness. Method: Two thousand two hundred and sixty-two pregnant women answered a questionnaire which included 'Do you snore?' among the questions. Blood pressure was recorded, current height and weight were used to calculate BMI and their pre pregnancy weight which was used to calculate pre pregnancy BMI and change in BMI from pre pregnancy to trial entry, neck circumference was measured, and the Epworth questionnaire for daytime sleepiness was administered. The data from women who answered 'Yes' to the snoring question were compared to that of women who answered 'No'. Results: Blood pressure at time of questionnaire was higher in women who reported snoring (P < 0.0001 for systolic and 0.0007 for diastolic), pre pregnancy BMI, current BMI and the increase in BMI from pre- pregnancy to current were all highly significantly increased in the women who reported snoring (P < 0.0001, < 0.0001 and 0.003 respectively). The Epworth sleepiness score (ESS), calculated from the Epworth questionnaire, was significantly higher i.e. more daytime sleepiness, and the neck circumference measurements were significantly higher in women who reported snoring (P < 0.0001 for ESS and neck circumference). Conclusions: Women who report snoring during pregnancy have higher blood pressure, pre pregnancy and current BMI, increase their BMI more during pregnancy, have larger neck circumference and are more sleepy during the day. Snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome such as hypertension and gestational diabetes. Therefore women who intend to become, or are pregnant, should be encouraged to reduce their BMI and maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective, cross-sectional study is to explore whether multiparity in females is associated with an increased prevalence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: Study questionnaire (on demographic, obstetrical, and gynecological history) and salient polysomnographic indices from overnight polysomnography were obtained from female patients presenting for evaluation of suspected sleep disordered breathing from December 2010-April 2011. Summary statistics, prevalence, and severity of obstructive sleep apnea were determined and compared among nulliparous /uniparous and multiparous subjects. RESULTS: Data from 100 females, age 18-86 years (Mean: 50.6years), with 0-12 pregnancies (15%nulliparous, 16%uniparous and 69%multiparous), BMI 19.2 to 64.6(Mean: 35.5) and ESS of 0 to 23 was reviewed. Nulliparous subjects had sleep efficiency 21.5-91%(Mean70.6%), AHI 0-96/hour(Median:4.9),REM AHI 0- 85.2/hour (Median:9.7) and 8 (50%) were diagnosed with OSA . Uniparous subjects had sleep efficiency 28-93.7 %( Mean70.1%), AHI 0-104.2/hour (Median: 6.0), REM AHI 0-31/hour (Median: 9.7) and 9 (56.25%) were diagnosed with OSA. Multiparous subjects had sleep efficiency 36.6-97.3 %( Mean78.9%), AHI 0- 95/hour (Median: 9.0), REM AHI 0-129.7/hour (Median: 17.8) and 55 (76.38%) were diagnosed with OSA. Mean AHI for nulliparous/uniparous vs. multiparous patients was 19.6/hour vs. 17.3/hour (p=0.06). Mean REM AHI for nulliparous/uniparous vs. multiparous patients was 12.9/hour vs. 27.8/hour (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher prevalence of REM-related OSA in multiparous patients compared to uniparous and nulliparous patients. We speculate that this could be related to structural/functional changes in the upper airway induced by repetitive exposure to the hormonal milieu of pregnancy. Such changes may be most likely to manifest themselves during the atonia of REM sleep. Larger studies are necessary to confirm this finding. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Identifying multiparity as a risk factor for OSA would allow for earlier diagnosis and intervention in this group of patients and possibly prevent the long term sequelae of OSA.

N2  - Introduction: There is little data on the fetal outcomes of polysomnographically confirmed obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in pregnancy. We wished to investigate whether OSA was associated with evidence of acute or chronic fetal compromise. Hypothesis: That OSA may be associated with; 1 Acute fetal compromise, as evidenced by fetal heart decelerations on continuous fetal cardiotocography during periods of maternal hypoxia, hypercapnia and sympathetic activation. 2 Chronic fetal compromise, as evidenced by a fall in fetal growth trajectory on serial third trimester ultrasound examinations, and altered cord blood levels of fetal growth regulators. Methods: Preliminary questionnaires identified women as potential OSA cases and controls. The fetal growth trajectory across the third trimester was determined by performing serial ultrasound examinations, and a fall of ≥ 30% from 32 weeks to birth was considered significant. At 37 weeks' gestation, a sleep study with synchronised fetal heart rate monitoring was performed, and cord blood collected at delivery. Results: Thirty-six women have completed the study, nine of whom had confirmed OSA. Acute Compromise: one case of an abnormal CTG occurred in a woman with OSA and a growth-restricted fetus. In most women, no fetal heart rate abnormalities were detected, despite moderate OSA associated with significant maternal oxygen desaturation. Chronic compromise: we observed that women with OSA were more likely to demonstrate an impaired growth trajectory during the third trimester than women without OSA (33% versus 4%, P < 0.05). In addition, insulin growth factor-II (IGF-2), a key endocrine regulator of fetal growth was significantly lower in the cord blood of infants whose mothers had OSA compared with BMI-matched controls (P < 0.05). Conclusions: We have confirmed that OSA may be associated with acute and chronic fetal compromise. Given the established link between obesity and stillbirth, it is intriguing to consider whether OSA may be an important intermediary. That there is therapy for OSA available in the form of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is particularly exciting, but further study with larger numbers is needed to confirm these results.

N2  - Introduction: Changes in sleep are common across pregnancy and the postpartum period, with poor sleep potentially contributing to postnatal distress. Previous findings have reported differences between objective and subjective measures of sleep, subjective sleep being a better predictor of postpartum mood in healthy women than objective sleep, thus suggesting that subjective sleep is an indicator of overall wellbeing. Sleep differences have also been observed in first-time (FM) and experienced mothers (EM), however subjective and objective measures of sleep have not been compared as a function of parity. Methods: During the third trimester of pregnancy (Time-1) 36 FM and 35 EM completed measures on mood and sleep, and wore actigraphs for 7 days. Among these participants, 30 FM and 31 EM completed the same procedure within 2 weeks postpartum (Time-2). Mood scales included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. Subjective sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Analyses confirmed previous findings that both objective and subjective sleep worsen from late pregnancy to the postpartum period. During T-2 both Mood and objective sleep were significantly better in EM than in FM; however, no differences were observed in subjective sleep. Regression analyses revealed an overall significant association between subjective sleep and mood. Comparisons of regression coefficients between FM and EM showed a significantly stronger relationship of subjective sleep and postpartum stress in FM, no significant differences were observed in other variables. Conclusion: Discrepancy between FM and EM in objective sleep may indicate more effective strategies to cope with sleep disruption in EM. Results support the notion that subjective sleep might reflect psychological wellbeing rather than actual sleep, especially in the case of postnatal stress levels in FMs.

N2  - Undernutrition during pregnancy is known as one of the crucial risk factors of low birth weight (LBW) caused in infants. LBW accompanied by catch-up growth (CUG) are increased risk for type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Type 2 diabates elicit various of sleep disorders caused by alternation of sleep architecture and quality. However, it remains unclear whether the LBW accompanied by CUG would affect higher brain function including sleep, anxiety and/or depression. We developed a mouse model of LBW with CUG by caloric restriction (CR) to pregnant female mice. We selected the CR rate for 0% (control), 20% and 50%. Pregnancy was dated with vaginal plugs (day 0.5), then pregnant female mice were performed CR from days 12.5 to 18.5. After the parturition, dams were assigned to ad libitum chow. We performed sleep recording, behavioral test to evaluate anxiety and depression in the LBW model and control mice (8-14 weeks of old). In this study, we found that 50% CR mice showed LBW and a marked increase in anxiety and depression compared with control mice. Meanwhile, 50% and 20% CR mice showed a remarkably low activity compared with control mice during dark period. Furthermore, in 50% CR mice, NREM sleep during dark period tended to be increased. These results indicate that LBW with CUG by CR during pregnancy would be a crucial risk factor of anxiety, depression and other behavioral abnormality.

N2  - There are sex differences in sleep behavior with women reporting more sleep problems and a poorer sleep quality than men across a wide age range. Women are at 40% greater risk than men for developing insomnia. The poorer self-reported sleep quality in women appears to relate in part to psychosocial factors, such as depression and anxiety, which are more common in women. In contrast to subjective reports, polysomnographic recordings show that women have better sleep efficiency, with less Stage 1 sleep and fewer awakenings than men across a wide age range, suggesting that objective and subjective assessments are tapping into different constructs of sleep. Women also have more slow wave sleep (SWS) and slow wave activity (SWA, delta, 0.5-4Hz) within the sleep electroencephalograph (EEG) as well as larger amplitude evoked K-complexes than men. This sex difference in slow waves seems to be driven by more than just anatomical differences affecting signal conduction, since women have thicker skulls, smaller intracranial volumes, and smaller absolute volume of cortical gray matter than men. Within women, fluctuating sex steroids during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause transition, impact sleep architecture. The most dramatic change in sleep across the menstrual cycle is increased spindle frequency EEG activity in the luteal phase, when progesterone is high, compared with the follicular phase. SWS and SWA, however, do not change across the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle influences REM sleep, which is marginally reduced in the luteal phase. Higher progesterone and estrogen levels correlate with a longer latency to REM sleep and less REM sleep, implying a role of these hormones in the REM sleep changes. Women with premenstrual syndrome report a poorer subjective sleep quality in the symptomatic luteal phase yet show similar menstrual-related changes in sleep architecture as controls suggesting that sleep-independent factors such as mood impact their perception of sleep quality. Sleep in women, therefore, is impacted by both biological and psychosocial factors.

N2  - Infant sleep problems are among the most prevalent problems presented to pediatricians and other child-care professionals. The consolidation of sleep during the night, which is referred to as sleeping through the night, is a rapid maturational process during the first year of life. However, surveys show that as many as 20% to 30% of all infants and toddlers do not succeed in achieving this goal and their sleep continues to be fragmented, as manifested by multiple and/or prolonged night wakings, which are considered to be the most prevalent sleep problems during early childhood. If not treated, these night-waking problems are persistent and can last well into adulthood. Other studies indicate that childhood sleep disturbance may have effects that linger into adulthood, such as increased risk for depression. This last decade, numerous studies have been done in Europe to gather normative data on parentreported child sleep and investigate what factors could influences it, such as, foreign origin, family situation, parents age and education, prenatal and perinatal factors, night feedings, child temperament and psychological trauma. These studies have been done with structured interviews, questionnaires, sleep diary logs, internet surveys but also with objective actigraphy sleep measures. Longitudinal studies have given normative data for sleep characteristics in children in Western societies. Cross-sectional survey have pointed the disparities between the different countries in Europe due to sociocultural and climate differences. The sleep disturbances induce repercussions on children behavioral symptoms but also on physical growth already in infants less than 6 months. Maternal sleep-related cognitions during pregnancy have also a great influence on the infant sleep. During this presentation, we will also report our experience on 500 newborns followed from birth to 2 years of life with questionnaires and polysomnographic recordings every 6 months.

KW  - Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders
N2  - Background: The applicability of the symptom criteria for diagnostic mood and anxiety disorders has in recent times been questioned for women in the perinatal period, due to the overlap of diagnostic symptoms with normal symptoms due to the physical changes of pregnancy or postpartum, (e.g., sleep difficulties). Method: 118 women in their second or early third trimester of pregnancy participated in a telephone interview that included the depression and anxiety modules of the MINI diagnostic interview, and an attributional probe question asking the woman whether endorsement of a symptom was due to the physical changes of her pregnancy or due to her mood or worries. Results: 66% of pregnant women who met criteria for major depression reported that a sufficient number of their symptoms were due to the normal physical changes of their pregnancy, such that they would no longer meet criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. Attributional probing resulted in the rate of major depression falling from 6.8% to 1.7%. The impact on anxiety disorders appears to be less. Limitations: An important issue is whether women's attributional perceptions are valid, though the face validity of some of their responses means that credence should be given to the findings. In addition, it would be useful from a validity perspective to undertake the same attributional probing with other populations where symptom presence is most likely due to mood, such as unemployed or recently separated adults without physical complaints. Conclusion: Rates of depressive disorders in pregnancy, using DSM symptom criteria, are significantly over-estimated due to the natural occurrence of many of the symptoms as a result of the pregnancy. Rates of anxiety disorders are also inflated, but to a lesser degree. This means that the validation of self-report mood measures, typically done against DSM diagnoses, is likely to have produced erroneous findings (e.g., optimum cut-off scores). It is probable that a similar finding would be obtained for the postpartum period. Thus future use of DSM symptom criteria for depression and anxiety in perinatal mental health work should use some form of attributional probing question to more accurately understand the applicability of symptoms to a diagnosis in this population. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective: to explore the strategies used by Jordanian women to manage heartburn during pregnancy. Design: an exploratory descriptive study. Participants and setting: 235 Jordanian women from the three regions of Jordan, aged between 18 and 54 years, who were pregnant at the time of the study or had previously had at least one full-term pregnancy. Findings: a number of strategies were used by Jordanian women in the sample for the alleviation of heartburn of pregnancy, including non-pharmacological strategies such as diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatments such as antacids, and the use of home remedies such as drinking cold milk, 'baking powder' in liquid form or herbs, eating cucumber, lintel seeds, or dry tea leaves. Women aged 40 years and older, who had lower income, and were not employed were more likely to use home remedies to manage heartburn in pregnancy than the other groups. Overall, women rated their chosen strategy as useful. Key conclusions and implications for practice: heartburn can be very uncomfortable and can affect food intake and appetite, daily routine and even sleep. Heartburn during pregnancy is at risk for being poorly managed given that birth is the cure. As a health-care provider, it is important to prepare women and their families to manage heartburn during pregnancy effectively. Midwives should encourage women to seek help from care providers when they need it, and continue to assess heartburn and the strategies used to manage symptoms during pregnancy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Hypnotic effects of melatonin and melatoninergic drugs are mediated via MT1 and MT2 receptors. They differ fundamentally from GABAergic hypnotics. Melatoninergic agonists enhance sleep initiation and reset the circadian clock to phases allowing persistent sleep. Ramelteon is rapidly taken up, reaching Tmax between 0.75 and 0.94 h. Its half-life in the circulation amounts to about 1 to 2 h which is much longer than that of melatonin (20-30 min). The metabolite M-II has a half-life 2 to 5 h longer can reach concentrations that are 20- to 100-fold higher than ramelteon. Ramelteons effects on sleep in insomnia patients has been shown in subjective and objective sleep parameters (polysomnography) in short and long term studies. At doses of 4 or 8 mg it reduces sleep onset latency, improves total sleep time and sleep efficiency/sleep quality. This has been demonstrated in several double-blind, placebo controlled studies on a total of more than a thousand adult or elderly subjects with primary chronic insomnia. All the effects were statistically significant, but the improvements of sleep maintenance remained moderate. No further improvements are obtained with 16 and 32 mg. However, due to the high affinity for both receptors, higher long life, and the long term effect of the M-II metabolite, the effect on sleep maintenance is better than that of other melatonergic drugs. Ramelteon does not cause next-day hangover, sedation, withdrawal effects, insomnia rebound, tolerance or dependence, and cognitive impairment. It does not induce behavioural changes, as sometimes observed with non-benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. Taken during the daytime it causes drowsiness and therefore should be taken at the right circadian time at evening/night. In COPD patients with insomnia it does not affect respiratory parameters and improves sleep efficiency and number of nocturnal awakenings. Despite otherwise good tolerability, its use in children, adolescents, and during pregnancy has not been studied enough, and should be avoided. It should not be applied in patients with immunological diseases. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 may raise ramelteon levels.

N2  - Restrictions are required for outpatients after I131 therapy for thyrotoxicosis. However there is little guidance on modifying restrictions, e.g calculating work restrictions for particular jobs or travel restrictions at later times. We have developed a web site, currently under beta test, to help explain the restrictions. The website has two separate sections designed specifically for patients and for professionals, and fully explains all restrictions and doses (pregnancy, breastfeeding etc). The background to all the restrictions is also explained as well as relevant aspects of radiation dose and risk. In addition, we have written three dose calculators for sleep, travel, and work and home restrictions. The calculators (JAVA) are designed for ease-of-use but have flexibility and provide detailed daily doses if required (e.g. teaching/training). The calculators for sleeping and travel restrictions are based on published measured data. Two general calculators are currently available elsewhere but are based on dose-rate models only, which can be conservative. Also, one uses fixed median dose-rates and the other is very complex. For example, for sleeping restrictions, our calculator (based on measured data as in UK Guidance Notes) gives 4 days restriction (for 600MBq) whereas median dose-rate models give 10 days. Published travel restrictions generally only cover travel home from the department, not e.g. holiday travel at later dates. Our calculator provides this information, based on measured data. Our third calculator is however based on dose-rate models, mainly for work/home restrictions. It is designed to have simple model entry with photo-aids and has flexibility of use. These calculators are available for professionals on the website (to be announced).

N2  - It has been widely documented that most patients with insomnia first consult a general practitioner. Thus, various kinds of hypnotics are prescribed mainly by general practitioners or non-sleep-medicine expert physicians. A study using Japanese insurance data revealed that about 70% of hypnotic prescriptions were made by non-specialists. However, most general physicians seem to be unaware of both the potential morbidity associated with insomnia and the importance of sleep health. In addition, most people having sleep problems do not tell their primary physicians about the problems. Thus, we carried out a project to establish a comprehensive consensus report on the management of insomnia aiming at standardization of optimal treatments in general practice. In 2009, board members (BMs), consisting of 3 sleep medicine experts and 3 other non-sleep medicine expert physicians, conducted a survey to explore the information that clinicians actually need in the clinical practice of insomnia. Based on the survey, the board members selected the 10 most important topics and asked 11 expert clinicians (topic investigators: TIs) with different specialties to review and establish the statement for each topic. In December 2009, the BMs, the TIs and other specialists gathered to discuss and determine the contents of the consensus report. Professor Phyllis C. Zee joined the meeting as an advisor. After a peer review by specialists outside the panel, the consensus report was finally confirmed by the BMs in July 2010 and submitted to a journal. A comprehensive index summary as a synopsis of the final statements is as follows: 1) Significance of insomnia treatment, 2) Insomnia to be treated, 3) Goal of the insomnia treatment, 4) Appropriate sleep hygiene education, 5) Strategy for hypnotics treatment, 6) Drug therapy for insomnia in the elderly, pregnant women and children/adolescents, and 7) Diagnostic and therapeutic strategy of insomnia in general practice. We expect that this review paper will contribute to the advancement of the management of insomnia in general practice.

N2  - PURPOSE: Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is a common sleep disorder that has been described in several medical conditions including end stage renal disease, iron deficiency, sickle cell anemia, pregnancy, chronic lung disease, myelopathies and neuropathies. Sleep disturbances are common in cancer patients. The contribution of PLMD to sleep disturbances in cancer patients has not been established. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective chart review of 1015 patients who underwent nocturnal polysomnography at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center between October 2006 and February 2011. Results are as below and are expressed in percentages and as group means. RESULTS: Of the 1015 patients, 43 (4.8%) had a diagnosis of RLS and 147 (16%) had a diagnosis of PLMD (PLM index of 5/hour of sleep by AASM scoring criteria). 71 patients were male and the mean age was 61 years(y) with 44% of PLMD patients above 65 y. The most common malignancies were breast cancer (24.5%), hematologic malignancies (16%), lung cancer (10.8%), prostate cancer (9.5%) and melanoma (4.7%). 30(20%) patients had known exposure to platinum based or taxane chemotherapeutic agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy. Mean ESS score was 10.9. Mean PLMD index and PLMD arousal index in these patients were 49 and 8.9 respectively. Diabetes mellites and renal disease were co-morbid in 39 (26.5%) and 8 (5.4%) patients respectively. The mean ferritin level was 203; 33% of the patients had a low ferritin value (< 50 ng/milliliter). 61 (41.4%) patients were on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Mean sleep efficiency was 79 % and stage N3 was decreased at 2.6 % of total sleep time (median age of the study group was 62 y). Sleep disordered breathing was comorbid in 74.8% of the patients with a mean AHI of 25. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first time a study has been undertaken to describe PLMD in cancer patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Recognition of presence of PLMD and its causes may have significant implications in the understanding of sleep disturbances in cancer patients.

N2  - Background: The objectives of the present study were to explore whether maternal psychosocial factors, mental health and work stress around delivery, are related to the behavior of 2-year-old children. Methods: In a prospective cohort study design, pregnant women attending the National Taiwan University Hospital for delivery and post-partum care from April 2004 to January 2005 were recruited and their children were observed at 24 months. A total of 186 mother-term-born child dyads completed the measurement. The five-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5) self-report data of maternal psychosocial factors were selected from the Taiwanese version of the short form 36 (SF-36). The Child Behavior Checklist for age 1-5 (CBCL/1-5) was completed by the parents when the child was 2 years old. Results: The mean score of mental health around delivery was 68.11. The proportion of mothers with work stress seldom and always was 61.8% and 24.7%, respectively. The mean of the total CBCL score, and internalizing, externalizing behavior and sleep problems scores was 45.95, 11.89, 15.59 and 4.23, respectively. After adjusting for the potential confounders, maternal work stress around delivery was found to have a significant effect on the total CBCL and externalizing, attention and aggressive, behavioral problems of 2-year old children. Maternal mental health around delivery, however, did not show significant effects on child behavior. Conclusions: Work stress around delivery seems to aggravate children's externalizing behavior problems at 2 years old. It is therefore important to improve the psychosocial health and reduce the stress of pregnant women. © 2011 Japan Pediatric Society.

N2  - PURPOSE: Complete upper airway collapse is generally expected to occur in obese subjects with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), resulting in more apneas over hypopneas. Observations with polysomnography (PSG) led us to hypothesize that extremely obese patients manifest OSAHS with a preponderance of hypopneas over apneas. METHODS: Retrospective review of 96 consecutive adult patients with OSAHS by PSG, comparing 2 groups: Group A with BMI < 35 and group B with BMI 45. Exclusion criteria: age <18 years, pregnancy, central apnea >5/hr and BMI between 35 and 45. Primary outcome measure: hypopnea-apnea ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive (OAI) and central apnea indices (CAI), hypopnea index (HI), SpO2 nadir, PetCO2 (baseline, peak) and % sleep time with PetCO2 > 50 torr (%PetCO2>50). Statistical methods included the 2-tailed student t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results are expressed as group mean ± standard deviation and p < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Group A (n = 48): age = 55±12.5 yrs, BMI = 29±3.6, AHI = 20.7±16.5. Group B (n = 48): age = 44.4±12.2, BMI = 55.9±8.1, AHI = 36.9±40. Group B had more women (60% vs 31%, p = 0.004). HAR was significantly higher in B (53.7±54 vs 17.5±30 in A, p = 0.0001), as was the HI (32±35 in B vs 14.6±10.3 in A, p = 0.0017). Significant differences were also noted between the 2 groups in age, BMI, SpO2 nadir (lower in B, p = 0.003) and %PetCO2>50 (higher in B, p = 0.03). A post -hoc analysis was performed after the groups were age and gender matched. The HAR was again significantly higher in B (41.3±51.6 in B vs 10.6 ±16.6 in A, p = 0.0002) along with HI (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Very obese patients manifest OSAHS with a higher ratio of hypopneas to apneas, even when matched for age and gender. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Different mechanisms may underlie generation of apneas (static obstruction) and hypopneas (dynamic obstruction), with a distinct pathophysiology in the very obese.

N2  - Background: There is a gap in the knowledge of longterm outcome of mild to moderate prematures compared to the extreme prematures or very low birth weight infants. Aim: Determine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems in (pre-)school age children born at 32 to 36. weeks' gestation. Study design: A descriptive cohort study in a non-Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatment and social economic status (SES) were analyzed. Study tools were the TNO-AZL Preschool Quality of Life (TAPQoL) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Subjects: 362 children born between 32 and 36. weeks' gestation who had a follow-up evaluation at 2?5. years of age. Outcome measure: Health-related quality of life and the occurrence of emotional and behavioral problems. Results: Main characteristics (mean ± SD) were: gestation 34.7 ± 1. weeks and birth weight 2360 ± 444. g. Most families were two-parent middle-class households with parents employed at their educational level. Questionnaire response rate was 62.7%. The 12-item TAPQoL showed significantly lower scores for stomach and liveliness, while scores for behavior, communication and sleep were significantly higher compared to the general population. The TAPQoL subscale score for lung problems was significantly lower for children who had received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CBCL scores were within the validated normal range although the study-population scored higher on emotionally reactive, somatic complaints and attention problems compared to their full-term peers. Conclusion: Children born at 32 to 36. weeks' gestational age do not experience an overall lower HR-QoL at 2 to 5. years of age. CPAP results in lower HRQoL scores for lung problems. The overall occurrence of behavioral and emotional problems does not differ from the general term-born pediatric population. Several subitems need further attention. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of farming management on the total locomotor activity (TLA) behaviour in dairy cattle. We recorded 24 h/day TLA in five not pregnant Holstein Friesian cows during parts of the lactation and dry periods, by means of an activity monitoring system (Actiwatch mini®) for seven days in each period. During mild lactation (period 1) animals were milked and fed twice a day. During the dry (period 2) they were kept to graze all day. In both periods hay and water were available ad libitum. Differences between the photophase and the scotophase were evaluated with a Student t-test. One-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine a statistical significant effect of time. A trigonometric statistical model was used to describe the main rhythmic parameters: mean level, amplitude, acrophase and robustness of rhythm.Our results showed a circadian rhythm of daily TLA in both periods, with different percentages of robustness, and acrophase in the middle of the photophase. The different patterns of activity in the two periods were attributed to the management practise during milking period. These results could be taken in consideration during farming management for the evaluation of such systems used in livestock, with respect to production and welfare. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Introduction: The CDC estimates 2 million babies per year are exposed to cigarette smoke (CS), a complex, carcinogenic mixture, during early development. CS is known to alter histone modifications and the methylation patterns of DNA. CS exposure during the delicate periods of fetal and neonatal development may change the expression of critical genes. Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 5 mg/m3 mainstream CS for 3 hrs/day, 5 days/week until birth. For postnatal exposures, 4 day old mice were exposed to 5 mg/m3 ETS for 3 hrs/day, 5 days/week, until day 21 post-partum. Mice were sacrificed at 23 days and 11 weeks of age. Microarrays were used to analyze differential gene expression and results confirmed using RT-RT PCR. Global methylation was analyzed with a microplate based kit. Histone modifications potentially important for the altered gene expression were examined using chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR. Results: Upregulation of a DNA repair gene growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gamma 45, a glucose regulating gene glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic, and an important gene in the circadian rhythm pathway, aryl hydrocarbon receptor like, was found in both exposures at 23 days and 11 weeks of age. Global methylation analysis revealed hypomethylation in the prenatal exposure but hypermethylation in the postnatal exposure at 23 days, but no difference was seen at 11 weeks. Discussion: Early developmental exposures to CS alter gene expression patterns, however, epigenetic effects of the exposure vary depending on the developmental period in which the exposure occurred.

N2  - It is described how an unhealthy lifestyle, via causation of chronic systemic low grade inflammation leads to insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome and eventually its associated diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, pregnancy complications and fertility problems. Homo sapiens' sensitivity for the development of insulin resistance traces back to our rapid brain growth in the past 2.5 million years. Our brain ranks high in the energetic hierarchy. When threatened by a glucose deficit, such as during pregnancy and infection, we respond with an inflammatory reaction that causes insulin resistance and is followed by, amongst others, a functional reallocation of energy-rich nutrients and a change in the serum lipoprotein composition. During inflammation the latter aims at the redistribution of lipids, modulation of the immune response and active inhibition of reverse cholesterol transport for damage repair. With the advent of the agricultural revolution and with increasing paste since the industrial revolution, we have introduced numerous false inflammatory triggers in our lifestyle that took us into a state of chronic systemic low grade inflammation. Eventually, this condition leads to the above mentioned typically Western diseases via an evolutionary conserved interaction between our immune system and metabolism. The triggers can roughly be subdivided into an abnormal dietary composition, abnormal microbial flora, insufficient physical activity, stress, insufficient sleep and environmental pollution. The current decrease of the number of life years without chronic disease is rather due to 'nurture' than 'nature', since less than 5% of our chronic diseases are directly attributable to heritable genetic factors. Resolution of the conflict between environment and our ancient genome is the only effective manner to arrive at 'healthy aging' and for this we should return to the balance of the Paleolithic era, as translated to the culture of the 21st century. Clinical chemists are pre-eminently capable to play an important role in the increasing attention for 'lifestyle', because lifestyle factors can at least in part be mapped by analyses of markers in blood and urine.

N2  - Primates show slow life history traits, such as small litter size, long gestation, long lactation, and long life span. The low growth rate of primates may be caused by a negative association between mortality rates and growth rates, and the juveniles' vulnerability to food shortage and predation may shape their life history traits. Primates may be adapted to the low mortality rates prevalent in their ancestral habitat (tropical forests), since other arboreal mammals such as bats also have low mortality rates. Primates living in the more unpredictable habitats have higher birth rates and earlier age at first reproduction. The great apes (Hominidae: orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees) that are strictly distributed in and around the tropical forests have the slowest life history traits among mammals. Modern humans also exhibit slow life history traits, while having high birth rate and short inter-birth interval. The presence of childhood, adolescent sterile, and menopause are unique to human life history. High predation pressure, bipedal walk, and encephalization may have promoted such human specific traits outside the tropical forests. Not hunting abilities, but hunted situations (increased mortality), increased human fecundity by reducing the period of lactation. Establishment of bipedalism prior to encephalization shaped the patterns of somatic and brain development. Brain uses a lot of energy for maintenance and development. Human children attain a large brain by decreasing body growth rate until puberty. High expenditure of brain development may cause the adolescent spurt in body growth. Such situations may have increased dependency of human children on their parents and led the human ancestors to communal breeding. Social adaptations to open lands may have resulted in the creation of human family and the unique patterns of human sleep. From the common feature of sleeping in individual beds among the great apes, human ancestors established communal sleeping without individual beds, which guarantees cooperation and security.

N2  - Purpose: A 56-year-old male smoker with hypertension and hyperlipidemia was seen in the GI clinic (July 2010) for 6 weeks of new onset crampy, watery diarrhea without blood or mucus and regardless of food. His diarrhea occasionally awakens him from sleep; he has lost 20 lbs and is fatigued. The differential included infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune diarrhea and celiac disease. He was repeatedly hospitalized (at one point over 60 days continuously) September 2010-January 2011 following diverticulitis requiring colostomy. He was empirically placed on a gluten-free diet with no improvement. His post-colostomy output was up to 30 L/day lasting for weeks. The cause was elusive. During this time, he required TPN, aggressive resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, and meanwhile, an extensive work-up yielded normal results with no evidence of infection, autoimmunity, or hormonal abnormalities (TTG, anti-EMA, metabolite derangement, hormone/enzyme abnormality, or dietary deficiency/excess). ESR, CRP, and pancreatic polypeptide were mildly elevated; DQ2 was positive and DQ8 was negative. In addition, he had multiple endoscopies with small and large bowel biopsies that ultimately led to the diagnosis of celiac disease with crisis. With the diagnosis of celiac crisis finally made, he was aggressively treated with high dose IV steroids and he dramatically improved. He thus continued on gluten-free diet and steroids. Discussion: Celiac Crisis (which can include severe diarrhea, dehydration, metabolic disturbances, neurologic and renal dysfunction, hypoproteinemia, and weight loss) is the fulminant form of celiac disease. It is rare and difficult to diagnose, but should be considered in cases of significant diarrhea of uncertain cause. The etiology is unclear; however, it is likely a combination of mucosal inflammation, immune mediation, and disruption of the normal patterns of motility. Crisis is often precipitated by infection, surgery, pregnancy, or other immune mediating event (surgery in this case). Our patient responded well; he is an outpatient on a slow taper of prednisone, complying with a gluten-free diet, and has normal colostomy output and electrolytes - Crisis Averted.

N2  - Background: One of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases is the presence of arterial hypertension. Treatment of hypertensionwith both lifestyle measures and medication can prevent cardiovascular events,such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Nowadays, low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) forms a cornerstone in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, particularly because its inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation. It is generally believed to have no effect on blood pressure. However, recent studies have demonstrated that time-dependent administration has different effects on blood pressure. But there are still no enough evidences to get clear and definite conclusion. At present, the main regulators of blood pressure behave according to circadian rhythms in the aspirin time-dependent lower BP. The renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) is more active during early morning hours as a response to the nocturnal fall in blood pressure and renal perfusion pressure. Aspirin given at night may decrease this nocturnal rise of RAAS activity and concomitantly attenuate the nocturnal drop in NO production. Objectives: To quantify the effects of low-dose aspirin at different time on blood pressure in hypertensive patients and to verify if administration of low-dose aspirin before bedtime could lower blood pressure. Methods: Search strategy: Pubmed, Cochrane library and EMBASE were searched with “low-dose aspirin or low-dose acetylsalicylic acid” AND “hypertension or blood pressure” AND “timedependent”. All relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were checked. Selection criteria: All randomized controlled trials have logical design, include at least two groups, aspirin on awakening and aspirin before bedtime, and can extract or calculate the difference between baseline and end-of-treatment systolic and diastolic BP in intervention and control groups and number of patients. Studies on preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension are excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data from text and tables. Data were collected on the following outcomes and analyzed where appropriate: number of patients, the systolic and diastolic pressure before and after treatment. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the Inverse Variance with mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Random-effects model in the RevMan5. Results: Six RCTs were found, including 1245 hypertensive patients, randomly divided into three groups: nonpharmacological hygienicdietary recommendations (HDR) 375 patients, the same recommendations and ASA (100 mg/day) on awakening 463 patients, or the same recommendations and ASA before bedtime 471 patients. Blood pressure wasmeasured every 20 min during the day and every 30 min at night for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention. After 3 months, Aspirin intake on awakening comparedwith HDR (4 studies) has no significant effect on blood pressure (SBP mean difference: 0.05mmHg, 95%CI: (-1.47,1.57);DBPmean difference:-0.57 mmHg, 95%CI: (-2.71, 1.56)). Aspirin intake before bedtime compared with HDR (4 studies) reduced systolic blood pressure by-3.85 mmHg (95% CI: -6.88 to-0.83), diastolic blood pressure by-2.74 mmHg, 95%CI: (-4.93, 0.55). Compared to aspirin on awakening, aspirin intake before bedtime has a significant effect on lowering SBP (mean difference: -6.29mmHg, 95%CI: (-8.01, -4.58)), and DBP (mean difference: -2.26mmHg, 95%CI: (-4.95, 0.43)). The reduction in nocturnal blood pressure mean was double in non-dippers (11.0/7.1 mmHg) compared with dippers (5.5/3.3 mmHg; P<0.001) in Hermida RC 2005. Conclusions: The available evidence demonstrates that time-dependent administration of low-dose aspirin has different effect on blood pressure according to activity-rest principle and we can conclude from 6 trials that administration of aspirin before bedtime could significantly reduce blood pressure. However,we haven't observed if baseline blood pressure is associated with response to low-dose aspirin because number of studies is few. More and more randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the conclusion.Meantime, more close attention should be paid to bleeding risk on low-dose aspirin therapy of hypertensive patients.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: Gestational diabetes (GDM) occurs in 2-9% of pregnancies increasing the risk of perinatal morbidity. While diabetes is associated with snoring and sleep disorders, this case-control study explores whether GDM is associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances in pregnant women. Materials and Methods: One night of home complete polysomnography (PSG) is performed in cases and controls selected among healthy women screened for GDM by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 24 and 32 wks of gestation. Subjective sleep quality is assessed via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which includes self-reported snoring and sleep time (RST). Results: To date, we have studied 13 cases (age=31.1±5.7 y; pre-pregnancy BMI=25.8±3.5 kg/m2; primiparous=92%) and 11 controls (age=31.5±3.4 y; pre-pregnancy BMI=27.1±4.3 kg/m2; primiparous=91%). 27% of cases and 20% of controls reported snoring ≥;3 times/wk with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) values of 2.6±2.3/h and 4.5±3.1/h respectively. Minimal O2 saturation was 85.8±18.4% in cases and 86.4±6.7% in controls, while the desaturation index was 1.9±2.4/h in cases and 1.0±1.0/h in controls. Recorded total sleep time (TST) by PSG was 6.4±0.7 h and 6.8±1.2 h, while reported RST in the PSQ was 7.3±1.6 h and 7.3±1.2 h in cases versus controls respectively. Snoring, AHI, minimal O2 saturation and desaturation index, TST, RST, sleep efficiency, and total PSQI scores were not significantly different between groups. Pre-pregnancy BMI but not gestational weight gain since the beginning of the pregnancy was negatively correlated with RST (r=-0.4; p=0.04). Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest no significant differences in either sleep-disordered breathing or other objective or subjective measures of sleep quality, between women with versus without GDM.

N2  - Background: During pregnancy, women are at particular risk for sleep deprivation and snoring because of the physiologic and hormonal changes of pregnancy. There is limited evidence for the association between sleep patterns in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes. We examined the association of sleep duration and snoring in late pregnancy with the risk of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. Methods: We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort "Rhea" study in Crete, Greece 2007-2009. The analysis included 1091 women with singleton pregnancies, providing complete data on sleeping habits at the third trimester of gestation and birth outcomes. Fetal growth restriction was based on a customized model, and multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to adjust for confounders. Results: Women with severe snoring were at high risk for low birth weight (relative risk = 2.6 [95% confidence interval = 1.2-5.4]), and fetal-growth-restricted neonates (2.0 [1.0 -3.9]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI). Women with sleep deprivation (≤5 hours sleep) were at high risk for preterm births (1.7 [1.1-2.8]), with the highest risk observed for medically indicated preterm births (2.4 [1.0-6.4]) after adjusting for maternal age, education, parity, smoking during pregnancy, and prepregnancy BMI. Conclusions: These findings suggest that women with severe snoring in late pregnancy have a higher risk for fetal-growth-restricted neonates; and women with sleep deprivation have a higher risk for preterm births. The mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy and are currently regarded as one of the most important factors determining pregnancy outcome. Detailed research of sleep features during pregnancy is obviously essential. In the present review recent data concerning changes in sleep structure and regulation in pregnant women and rats - main subjects of experimental sleep research, are given, including surmised mechanisms underlying such changes. The importance of women's sleep integrity preservation during pregnancy for the viability and normal development of the fetus is emphasized and possible ways of pathological influence of sleep disorders during this period are discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a cholestatic disorder characterized by pruritus, elevated aminotransferases and fasted bile salts which is in contrast to other pruritic disorders of pregnancy associated with an increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. We have recently identified increased autotaxin activity in women with ICP. Here, we studied whether serum autotaxin could distinguish ICP from other diagnoses. Methods: Autotaxin activity, bile salts and transaminases were measured enzymatically in sera of pregnant women with ICP (n = 43), other pruritic disorders of pregnancy (n = 15), HELLPsyndrome and (pre-)eclampsia (n = 17), pregnant (n = 44) and healthy controls (n = 219). Results: ATX activity was increased in women with ICP (p < 0.0001) compared to other pruritic disorders of pregnancy, HELLP-syndrome, pre-eclampsia, and pregnant controls. With a cut-off value of 30.0 nmol/ml∗min, autotaxin had a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 93% in diagnosing ICP from other pruritic disorders and a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 85% from HELLP-syndrome and preeclampsia. Longitudinal studies revealed that autotaxin activity strongly rose in the third trimester of pregnancy. Autotaxin displayed no circadian rhythm and was not influenced by oral food intake. Conclusion: Autotaxin activity represents a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool in distinguishing ICP from other disorders of pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by collapse of the upper airway in sleep, resulting in sleep fragmentation, and hypoxemia. The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and respiratory disturbance index (RDI) are two measures used to quantify OSA severity. Affecting an estimated 11% of premenopausal women, studies show this condition may alter menstrual cycles and lower levels of estradiol, progesterone and 17 hydoxyprogesterone. Consequently, some have speculated this may affect fertility. Miscarriage, the abrupt spontaneous loss of a pregnancy usually before 12 weeks of pregnancy, is estimated to occur in 12-24% of pregnancies. Frequently, the cause is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess whether OSA would increase the risk of having a miscarriage. Materials and Methods: 70 Female patients under the age of 52 years with at least one pregnancy referred to the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Center Sleep Disorders Clinic were assessed with a retrospective chart review. Clinical history was obtained regarding demographic information and a history of miscarriages. All women included also completed an overnight polysomnography. Women were divided into two groups; those with a history of miscarriages and those without; results were analysed to determine whether those women with a history of at least one miscarriage would have a higher frequency of sleep disordered breathing events as measured by RDI and AHI. Results: Using a t-test, there was no significant difference in RDI for women with a history of miscarriage (n=35) compared to those without miscarriages (n=35, p=0.41). Results showed that while there was a slight trend towards a higher AHI in patients with a history of miscarriage, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.18). Conclusion: The study suggests that OSA may not be strongly associated with miscarriages. The small sample size and the retrospective nature of the research, however, limits the generalisability of these findings.

N2  - We employed accepted, validated symptom-based screening measures to discern attributable risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to adverse pregnancy outcomes, taking into account potential maternal confounders. Commonly employed OSA screening measures (Berlin and Epworth scales) were performed in the second and third trimesters; maternal and neonatal outcome data were thereafter obtained. The relationship between OSA and outcomes of interest were explored in stratified and multivariate models controlling for potential confounders. The overall prevalence of OSA was 25.4%. Given a nonlinear increase by body mass index (BMI) strata (8.9%, 46%; p<0.0001), stratified multivariate analysis was subsequently performed. Among nonobese (BMI <30) gravidae, frequency of preeclampsia was significantly higher among women with OSA (adjusted odds ratio=6.58, 95% confidence interval=1.04, 38.51; p=0.035). Among the obese (BMI 30) gravidae, infant birth weight ratio (or birth weight by gestational age) was higher with OSA+screening than OSA(1.099 versus 1.035; p=0.04), and this association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (p=0.05). OSA prevalence increases significantly among obese gravidae, raising concerns for the overall validity of commonly employed screening measures in pregnancy. Nevertheless, OSA status continues to exert an independent influence, as obese and nonobese gravidae are at increased risk for a limited number of adverse perinatal outcomes in multivariate models.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects around 25% of women during pregnancy. No safe treatment options are available. Ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®) is approved in Switzerland for treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy. The objective of this open-label non-controlled exploratory double centre study is to assess the effect of an infusion of Ferinject® in pregnant women with RLS and iron deficiency. Materials and Methods: Pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-severe RLS (IRLS > 20) with iron deficiency (Ferritin <35μg/l) or anemia (Hb <11g/dl) can be included in this study. Depending on Hb, iron substitution is performed with an infusion of 500-900mg of ferric carboxymaltose. Assessment of treatment effects is done by questionnaires (international RLS Study Group questionnaire (IRLS), fatigue severity scale, Epworth sleepiness scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index), blood tests (iron, Ferritin, CRP) at the screening visit, 28 days after therapy, as well as 2 weeks and 6 weeks after ferric carboxymaltose delivery. Foot actigraphy is additionally performed 1 week before and 1 week after the treatment. Results: So far 11 patients were included. All but one patient reported from the first night following a marked decrease in RLS. Four weeks after treat ment the RLS score was reduced from 25±5 to 7±6 (p<0.01). A reduction in PLMS was also documented in 7 out of 11 patients (from 34±22 to 25±19) (p<0.02). Ferritin levels increased from 16±10μg/l to 75±50μg/l. Ferric carboxymaltose was well tolerated without severe adverse. Conclusion: Preliminary results of this ongoing study suggest that infusion of ferric carboxymaltose is (rapidly) effective in improving moderate-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anemia.

N2  - The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) utilized by pregnant women influence fetal neurobehavioral development. In this observational study we investigated developmental milestones of fetal behavior during the pregnancy of women with psychiatric disorders who took SSRIs throughout gestation (medicated group; n96) or who had discontinued medication early in gestation or before conception (unmedicated group; n37). Healthy unexposed fetuses of women without mental disorders comprised the control group (n130). Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior were made three times in pregnancy (T1-T3). Effects of SSRIs were studied over a wide range of dosages (low, standard, or high) and for different drug types. Fetuses exposed to standard or high SSRI dosages compared with control, unmedicated, or low-medicated fetuses showed significantly increased motor activity at the beginning (T1) and end of the second trimester (T2). They particularly exhibited disrupted emergence of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM; quiet) sleep during the third trimester, characterized by continual bodily activity and, thus, poor inhibitory motor control during this sleep state near term (T3). The SSRI effects on the fetus were dose related, but independent of SSRI type. The results demonstrate changes in fetal neurobehavioral development associated with standard and high SSRI dosages that are observable throughout gestation. A first-choice SSRI type was not apparent. Bodily activity at high rate during non-REM sleep in SSRI-exposed fetuses is an abnormal phenomenon, but its significance for postnatal development is unclear. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: Patients with sleep apnea syndrome exhibit cerebral morphological changes. Aquaporins are membrane proteins responsible for the transport and the balance of water content in the brain. Changes in aquaporin 1 expression in the cerebellum have been reported in pregnancy. Little attention has been dedicated to the role of aquaporins in sleep apnea-related brain alterations. The present study aims to quantify aquaporin 1 levels in mouse hippocampus and cerebellum as well as to determine the brain water content. Materials and Methods: We exposed C57BL/6 mice to 35 days of intermittent hypoxia (IH; n=17) or sham intermittent hypoxia (SIH; n=18), alternating 30 seconds of progressive hypoxia to a nadir of 6% FIO2 with 30 seconds of room air insuflation. During 8 hours of the light period, the rodents underwent a total of 480 cycles of hypoxia/reoxygenation, equivalent to an apnea index of 60/hour. Brains of 6 HI and 6 SHI animals were dissected, weighted while wet and placed in an oven at 95°C during 48 hours. Percent brain water content was calculated. Levels of aquaporin 1 were measured using an ELISA test. Results: The mean brain wet weight and brain water content were higher in the IH group (respectively 0.48±0.004 g and 79.7±0.11%) than the SIH group (respectively 0.46±0.008 g and 76.8±0.52%; p<0.01). The average aquaporin 1 level in the cerebellum was higher in the SIH group (4.5±0.79 ng/mL) than in the IH group (3.9±0.48 ng/m; p=0.01). No significant difference was found between the two groups for the aquaporin 1 in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Exposure to intermittent hypoxia during 35 days in a mice model of sleep apnea increases wet weight and water content of the brain while reducing cerebellar aquaporin 1 levels. The relationship between sleep apnea and central nervous system structural alterations may involve downregulation of aquaporin 1 activity.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: This study was to explore the correlation of prenatal beliefs about infant sleep with postnatal nighttime sleep practices, during the first 3 months after birth. Materials and Methods: 347 eligible women were enrolled at approximately 34 weeks of pregnancy; after delivery 260 healthy infants meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled as study subjects. Prior to delivery, all expectant mothers completed a questionnaire on attitudes towards four aspects of infant sleep. Following delivery, sleep diaries were administered over 3 consecutive nights starting at 10 and 28 days and 2 and 3 months postnatally. Results: On prenatal survey, 79% of women expressed a preference for the child to sleep in a separate crib in the same room with an adult and 11% anticipated co-sleeping with the child. On post-natal survey, only 38% reported their child slept in an independent crib, whereas 57% reported co-sleeping (prenatal to post-natal kappa = 0.06). Regarding sleeping position, 55% preferred the supine position and 36% preferred putting the infant on the side; postnatally, the respective proportions were 71% and 29% (kappa = 0.16). On when to put the child to sleep, 63% indicated this should happen when the child was drowsy but not yet asleep, whereas 31% indicated the infant should be fully asleep; postnatally, 31% put the child to sleep when drowsy, whereas 64% waited until he/she was fully asleep (kappa = 0.02). Regarding night awakenings, 65% stated they should wait a few minutes before taking action while 33% anticipated taking immediate action; postnatally, the proportions reversed with 76% taking immediate action and only 18% waiting a few minutes before action (kappa = 0.00). Conclusion: With the one favorable exception of sleep position practices, we conclude that prenatal beliefs are poor predictors of postnatal sleep related practices and that opportunities exist for educational interventions to improve postnatal sleep practices among primiparous Chinese women.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: Circadian rhythm disturbances have been implicated in etiopathogenesis of bipolar disorder. Chronotype is an important concept in field of sleep medicine. The chronotype of an individual is indicative of his/her predilection for an “early bird” or “night owl” circadian preference, which correlates with physiological measures of circadian phase like core body temperature minimum. There is paucity of literature on circadian preference in bipolar patients. This study aimed at investigating if the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) Score has any correlation with the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) Score and age. Materials and Methods: Adult inpatients with a well established diagnosis of Bipolar disorder (type I, II and NOS) were identified over a period of 5 months and recruited into an IRB approved study. Patients with pregnancy, cognitive impairment, affective instability impairing questionnaire completion and age <18 years were excluded. A total of 43 consecutive patients were eligible for analyses. Chronotype preferences were assessed with the MEQ. MEQ scores >58 correlate with morningness, and <42 correlate with eveningness. Scores outside of these ranges indicate neutral preference. Out of 43 patients, 40 also completed the MDQ, a screening instrument for bipolar disorder. Results: Out of 43 patients, based on MEQ scores, 11 (25.6%) were eveningtypes, 24 (55.8%) were neither-types and 8 (18.6%) were morning-types. In our study population, the MEQ Score frequency formed a normal “bellshaped” distribution curve. On bivariate analyses, MEQ score was not found to have any correlation with MDQ score (Spearman coefficient, rho (P) = 0.06, p-value= 0.7). A modest but statistically significant correlation was found between age and MEQ score (Spearman coefficient, rho (P) = 0.31, p-value= 0.04). Conclusion: MDQ score does not correlate with MEQ score. Statistically significant correlation of age with MEQ suggests that morningness tends to increase with age in bipolar patients as in healthy individuals without bipolar disorder.

N2  - Clock genes drive circadian rhythms in a range of physiological processes both centrally and in peripheral tissues such as the liver. The aims of this study were to determine whether the two functionally-distinct zones of the rat placenta (junctional and labyrinth) differentially express clock genes and, if so, whether these exhibit circadian patterns. Rats were sampled from d 21 of pregnancy (term = d 23) and from diestrus I of the estrous cycle. Adult liver (all animals), fetal liver, and placental zones (pregnant animals) were collected at 0800, 1400, 2000, and 0200 h. Both zones of the rat placenta expressed all seven canonical clock genes (Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, and Cry2), but there were marked zonal differences and, unlike in maternal liver, circadian variation in placentawaslimited. Similarly, placental expression of Vegf varied withzonebut not time of day. Pregnancy also led to marked changes in hepatic clock gene expression, with peak levels of Per1, Cry1, and Cry2 all reduced, Per3 increased, and circadian variation in Clock expression lost. All clock genes were expressed in fetal liver, but there was less circadian variation than in maternal liver. Similarly, fetal corticosterone levels remained stable across the day, whereas maternal corticosterone showed clear circadian variation. In conclusion, our data show that the rat placenta expresses all canonical clock genes in a highly zone-specific manner but with relatively little circadian variation. Moreover, pregnancy alters the expression and circadian variation of clock genes in maternal liver, possibly contributing to maternal physiological adaptations.

N2  - Introduction: Significant advances in neonatal care have improved survival in preterm infants. However chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD) continues to be a significant problem. There is very limited data in literature describing the cardiorespiratory variables at 35-36 weeks of infants who are born preterm. Aim: To collect sleep pattern and normative cardiorespiratory data in preterm infants born under 31 week's gestation at corrected gestation of 35-36 weeks. (We present the cardiorespiratory data). Methods: Using an inhouse polysomnography system prospective data on respiratory effort using effort bands, pulse oximetry, actigraphy and visual scoring of sleep using video camera were collected in a cohort of preterm infants under 31 weeks gestation over a 6-10 hour period continuously. We analyzed the heart rate, oxygen saturations from the data collected on the pulse oximetry channel. The respiratory rate was derived using the Labchart software. We are presenting heart rate, oxyhaemoglobin saturation and respiratory rate profile on 25 preterm infants. Results: The mean heart rate with 5,95th centiles was 155 (129-181). The mean oxyhaemoglobin saturation with 5, 95th centiles was 94.7 (85.9-98.8). The respiratory rate had significant variability between awake and sleep with the range between 34100/ min. The average respiratory rate was in the 50s for this group of infants. Cumulative frequency curves constructed with the heart rate and oxyhaemoglobin data provides us with reference ranges for this specific group of preterm infants. Conclusion: The description of reference ranges for cardiorespiratory variables would provide us with objective data in management of CNLD infants and ascertaining home oxygen requirement.

No significant difference was found between the two groups for the aquaporin 1 in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Exposure to intermittent hypoxia during 35 days in a mice model of sleep apnea increases wet weight and water content of the brain while reducing cerebellar aquaporin 1 levels. The relationship between sleep apnea and central nervous system structural alterations may involve downregulation of aquaporin 1 activity.

N2  - One of the most significant demographic changes seen in Europe in recent decades has been the right shift in age at first birth. In UK, for example, in 2009, 47% of women and 64% of men became parents for the first time beyond age 30. Given the failure of evolution of the female reproductive lifespan to keep up with this trend towards deferral of pregnancy, it is more important than ever to advise men and women of the risks of deferral and on strategies to defer loss of fertility where possible. Most of the methods available to delay loss of fertility are well rehearsed: Avoidance of smoking, recreational drugs or excess alcohol, possibly also maintenance of a normal body weight and regular exercise. However it is difficult to quantify the extent of the benefits that can be gained from such lifestyle changes and many younger people seem to over-estimate the impact of a 'healthy' lifestyle on their future fertility. In vitro fertilisation is frequently seen as a means of 'rescuing' a woman's fertility if she is too old to conceive naturally although the chances of successful pregnancy after IVF for those over 40 are low and have not improved significantly over the last 20 years. It seems that the biological clock can be accelerated, most strikingly by chemotherapy and less so by smoking and exposure to environmental toxins, but it cannot currently be slowed. Recent developments in methods for assessment of ovarian reserve combined with improved survival of oocytes following vitrification now permit an individualized measurement of ovarian reserve to be followed in some cases by oocyte freezing. The advantages of this approach over the current widespread utilization of donor oocytes by older women who wish to become parents are obvious, and this may become a commonplace strategy in the future. Further longitudinal studies are required in order to validate use of measurements of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC), possibly in combination with genetic testing, to identify the optimal age at which to recommend oocyte freezing to an individual. It seems likely that this age will vary considerably from one woman to the next. For example, those who have a strong family history of early menopause, low AMH and AFC will be advised to consider oocyte cryopreservation at an earlier age than those who have polycystic ovary syndrome and high AMH and AFC.

N2  - Background: The physiological changes in peripartum may affect symptoms of depression and impact diagnostic judgments in the peripartum and influence which symptoms discriminate depressed and non-depressed women. Second, the sharp fall in cortisol and CRH after childbirth suggests that the HPA axis characteristics of postpartum depression are different from melancholic depression the latter being characterized by high cortisol levels. Methods: A modified version of the SCID was used to assess symptoms of depression and melancholic and atypical subtypes in pregnancy and the postpartum period. In a second study we investigated the diurnal output of saliva cortisol in women with symptoms of depression postnatally in 21 depressed and 30 non-depressed women at 7.5 weeks postpartum, and 21 non perinatal controls, collected saliva at waking, 30 minutes, and three and twelve hours post waking. Results: The antenatal symptom pattern (n=892 women) was different from the postnatal. The sensitivity of the symptoms ranged from 0.7% to 51.6%, and specificity from 61.3% to 99.1%. The best discriminating symptoms were motor retardation/agitation and concentration antenatally, and motor retardation/agitation, concentration and fatigue postnatally. In a subgroup of this sample (n=449) 17% of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depression at least once in pregnancy, melancholic depression (2.4%), atypical depression (4.4%), and non-specified depression (10.2%). Mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern discriminated between the two groups. Also, there was a significant difference in diurnal pattern of cortisol between postnatally depressed and non-depressed women, due to differences at waking and +30 minutes. Discussion: These findings suggest that perinatal depression has different associated symptoms from depression at other times. The cortisol pattern in the postnatally depressed women is similar to that reported for PTSD and atypical depression, and may reflect a response in vulnerable women to the marked cortisol withdrawal that occurs after delivery.

N2  - Objective: Giving an review of risk factors for postpartum psychopathology in women with bipolar disorder. Methods: Presenting a review of the literature of risk factors associated with postpartum psychopathology and presentation of a starting research project, studying the influence of sleep disturbance and other risk factors during pregnancy and perinatal period on postpartum psychopathology. Results: In the postpartum period hospital admission is strongly increased. Among the different risk factors it is suggested that sleep disturbance may be 'the final common pathway' to postpartum psychopathology. Conclusion: Sleep disturbance is an important risk factor for postpartum psychopathology in women with a bipolar disorder. If the underlying mechanism is better understood, we could possibly improve prevention strategies for postpartum psychopathology in women with bipolar disorder.

N2  - Objective: Quetiapine and haloperidol are antipsychotic medications with different safety profiles. The authors proposed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine versus haloperidol in patients with delirium. Methods: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand. This study was approved by the institution ethics committee. All participants were delirious patients who were consulted to psychiatric department between June 2009 and January 2011. The DSM-IV diagnosis of delirium was confirmed by using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Inclusion criteria were hospitalization and aged between 18 and 75 years old. Exclusion criteria were alcohol and benzodiazepines withdrawal delirium, allergy to quetiapine or haloperidol, pregnancy or lactation, currently received antipsychotic drugs, severe medical instability (e.g., renal failure or hepatic failure), and unlikely to receive written informed consent from a relative within an hour. After providing the full information of the study, a relative of the patient meeting those criteria was requested to give written informed consent. The primary efficacy outcome was evaluated using the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) [1]. The secondary efficacy outcomes were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) rating scale and hours of night sleep. The extrapyramidal side effects were assessed by using the Modified (9-item) Simpson-Angus Scale (MSAS). All measures were applied daily. The data analyses were performed on an intention-to-treatment basis using last-observation-carried-forward analysis. Results: A total of 38 patients (27 males and 11 females) were randomized to quetiapine and haloperidol groups. Mean (SD) ages of the quetiapine and haloperidol groups were 57.2 (11.4) and 54.7 (10.1) years, respectively (p = 0.264). Numbers of male patients in the quetiapine and haloperidol groups were 11 (64.7%) and 16 (76.2%), respectively (p = 0.491). Baseline DRS-R-98 scores of the quetiapine and haloperidol patients were 28.2 (4.8) and 29.5 (4.6), respectively (p = 0.174). Baseline CGI scores of the quetiapine and haloperidol patients were 5.9 (0.9) and 6.0 (0.8), respectively (p = 0.524). Baseline hours of night sleep of the quetiapine and haloperidol patients were 1.2 (2.1) and 1.1 (1.7), respectively (p = 0.920). Mean (SD) doses of the quetiapine and haloperidol groups were 34.0 (12.8) and 0.9 (0.5) mg/day respectively. After 7 days of treatment: i) the DRS-R-98 scores of the quetiapine and haloperidol decreased to 9.2 (9.7) and 9.4 (10.8), respectively (p = 0.659), ii) the CGI scores of the quetiapine and haloperidol groups were 1.7 (1.5) and 1.7 (1.5), respectively (p = 0.633), iii) hours of night of the quetiapine and haloperidol patients were 7.8 (1.8) and 6.9 (3.5), respectively (p = 0.852), and iv) MSAS scores of the quetiapine and haloperidol patients were 0.29 (0.83) and 0.21 (0.68), respectively (p = 0.861). Conclusions: Both low doses of quetiapine and haloperidol are equi-effective and well-tolerated for delirious patients. In addition, both medications have very low propensities to induce extrapyramidal side effects. Further large sample sizes are warranted.

N2  - Background: Melancholic depression is a type of depression that is characterized by the inability to find pleasure in positive things. Additional symptoms can include psychomotor disturbances, anorexia or weight loss, excessive guilt, and early awakening from sleep. Melancholic patients may exhibit treatment responses and outcomes that differ from those of non-melancholic patients. Duloxetine is a relatively balanced dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, but it can also boosts dopamine in prefrontal cortex. Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in improving depressive mood, premature awaking, psychomotor retardation and weight loss in patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Episode Severe with melancholic features. Methods: A group of 25 patients, 13 male and 12 female, 35-55 years of age (mean age 40.2), diagnosed with Major Depressive Episode Severe with melancholic features according to DSM IV-TR criteria, were evaluated for 24 weeks. Patients were evaluated using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI)-severity every week during the first month and every month to endpoint. Inclusion criteria: male or female between 18 and 65 years of age meeting DSM IV-TR criteria for Major Depressive Episode Severe with melancholic features, HAM-D ≥ 25 (mean value 27.2) and CGI-severity score ≥5 (mean value 5.4). Exclusion criteria: personal history of Axis I disorders, other than Major Depressive Episode Severe with melancholic features, axis II comorbidity, somatic comorbidity, pregnancy or breast feeding. Each patient received a dose of duloxetine 60-120mg per day (mean dose 86.5mg/day). The safety of duloxetine was measured by recording adverse events, vital signs and by assessing laboratory measurements (haematology, chemistry and electrolytes) at weeks 0, 12, 24. Results: Patients significantly improved during the 24 weeks of treatment; HAM-D decreased more than 50% (52.2%) after 8 weeks and and the long term efficacy was also good till endpoint, paralleled by decrease of CGI severity more than 2 (-3.1 to baseline after 8 weeks and -4.2 at endpoint). Duloxetine improved sleep by the end of first week in correlation with HAM-D item 6; no evidence for rebound of delayed insomnia was found. The symptom of psihomotor retardation (HAM-D item 8) decreased progressively corelated with depressed mood (HAM-D item 1). Onset of antidepressant response was observed at week 2 (decreasing HAM-D's item 1) and improved further up to the endpoint. The adverse events correlated with duloxetine that patients reported were: dizziness in 2 cases, headache in 2 cases and nausea in 1 case. There were no significant changes in laboratory measurements and vital signs during the study. Duloxetine was well tolerated with no dropout due to adverse events and were no differences between men and women. Conclusion: Efficacy and safety of the treatment with duloxetine in patients with Major Depressive Episode Severe with melancholic features were observed and maintained during 24 weeks. Psychopharmalogical profile of duloxetine may be linked to efficacy in treating melancholic depression due to secondary action of boosting dopaminergic neurotransmission in prefrontal cortex by initial norepinephrine transporters blockade in this part of cortex.

N2  - Objective: to show possibilities of individuated approach based on genetics during familial-genetic counseling of families of patients with bipolar affective disorders (F31.8 according to ICD-10). Methods: Materials and methods: we studied family of a proband with BAD with the help of developed by us technology of managing the familial health. Results: psychological-genetic and social-familial block included classical clinical-genealogical investigation with composing the proband's genealogy that has not revealed among relatives of the proband hospital forms of mental disorders. However we have identified relatives of I and II degrees of relationship with peculiarities of personality, mood, behavior, life path typical for affective psycho- pathology. They had middle and high values of motivation of achievement and reward with small values according to scales of attitude toward the success, meaning significance of the activity and positive attitude toward him/her with rigid frames and control of family adaptation and unity (middle- balanced type). Proband had middle scores of motivation of achievement and low with reduction of positive attitude toward him/herself in motivation of reward. Sociogram has shown dependent, not differentiated interrelationships with relatives. Biological-genetic block of the technology included investigation of apoptosis at cellular (lymphocytes and neutrophils) and receptor levels (CD95) that has shown increased values. Molecular-genetic testing with identification of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of gene-serotonin transport 5-HTT (presence or absence of short S-allele or long L-allele) as well as polymorphism G703 of gene tryptophan hydroxylase (presence of G-allele or T-allele) has identified genotypes of proband and his/her parents: SS GT-genotype in proband, LS GT-genotype in mother and LS GG-genotype in father. Proband is homozygote carrier of S-allele that increases duration of serotoninergic activity, heterozygote carrier of polymorphism of trypto- phan hydroxylase. Thus, mental health of affective range in proband is determined by many factors: inherited peculiarities of neuro-chemical processes (SS GT-genotype, clinical-genealogical regularities); organic background (age of the mother during pregnancy and delivery, pathology of pregnancy and delivery? craniocerebral injury, arachnoiditis, vaccination); peculiarities of motivational domain of the personality; specific family interrelationships. It has been recommended: observance of strict regime of work, rest (study, sleep and other activities) with the aim of strengthening of processes of inhibition in central nervous system; exclusion of inflammatory diseases, rationalization of nutrition trypto- phan diet for fight against ketonemia, exclusion of dysbacteriosis with application of probiotic products of nutrition; preparations noben, co-enzyme Q, karnitin; dynamic observation in Family-Genetic Prevention Center of proband and his/her relatives entering the risk group. Conclusion: During carrying out the genetic counseling group of biological risk and individuated risk for asymptomatic carriers of mutant gene are identified. This gives the possibility for early revealing, initiation of preventive treatment and prevention of disease manifestation.

N2  - Aim and objective: This study was intended to avaluate the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with neuropathic pain and concomitant medication. Material and methods: Investigator-initiated, prospective multicenter study, open-label, uncontrolled conducted in 10 pain units from Catalonia hospitals. Pregabalin was consecutively prescribed at the physicians' discretion to avoid selective bias. Inclusion criteria were: outpatient, age >18 years, admission diagnosis as "neuropathic pain" and informed consent. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or cognitive disorders. Protocol scheduled five study visits: at baseline, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months of treatment. Titration of pregabalin doses was pre-specified. We recorded: age, sex, type of neuropathic pain (pure or mixed), VAS (baseline, 15 days, 1 month, 2 and 3 months), MOS sleep scale (baseline and third month), concomitant drug treatment and adverse effects episodes. Patients were divided into three groups: pregabalin + NSAID + tricyclic antidepressants (NSAID+TCA), pregabalin + NSAID + anxiolytics (NSAID+ANX), pregabalin + NSAID + opioids (NSAID+OPI). A parametric Student's t test and non-parametric Wilcoxon test for paired data of quantitative variables were performed. Results: 578 patients were recruited and 472 (81.66%) completed the study. 98.8% of patients were treated with politherapy. Pain relief: mean reduction by -3.6 (± 1.9) (p < 0.0001) points. By type of pain: mixed pain -3.7 (± 1.7) (p < 0.0001); pure neuropathic pain -3.4 (± 2.2) (p < 0.0001). By adjuvant medication, the NSAID + TCA group -3.1 (± 1.9) (p = 0.0002); NSAID + ANX -3.4 (± 2.0) (p < 0.0001); NSAID + OPI -3.7 (± 1.9) (p < 0.0001). Sleep improvement: mean reduction by -1.9 (± 6.4) (p < 0.0001) points. By type of pain: mixed pain -3.1 (± 7.0) (p < 0.0001); pure neuropathic pain -1.1 (± 4.2) (p < 0.0001). By adjuvant medication, NSAID+OPI -2.1 (± 6.0) (p < 0.0001); NSAID + TCA and NSAID + ANX groups both - 1.0 not statistically significant (p = 0.1250 and p = 0.4063 respectively). 90 patients (15.6%) discontinued the study due to adverse effects. Conclusions: Treatment with pregabalin induces a fast and significant relief of neuropathic pain, improves sleep and shows a low drug interaction profile. © 2011 Sociedad Española del Dolor.

N2  - The primary purpose of this study was to examine pathways from prenatal cigarette exposure to physiological regulation at 2. months of age. Specifically, we explored the possibility that any association between prenatal cigarette exposure and infant physiological regulation was moderated by fetal growth, prenatal or postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. We evaluated whether exposed infants who were also exposed to ETS after birth, were small for gestational age (SGA) or had mothers with higher depressive symptoms during pregnancy had the highest levels of physiological dysregulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was obtained from 234 (166 exposed and 68 nonexposed) infants during sleep. As expected, cigarette-exposed infants had significantly lower RSA than nonexposed infants. This association was not moderated by prenatal or postnatal ETS exposure, or maternal depressive symptomatology during pregnancy. However, small for gestational age status did moderate this association such that nonexposed infants who were not small for gestational age had a significantly higher RSA than nonexposed small for gestational age infants and exposed infants. These findings provide additional evidence that prenatal cigarette exposure is directly associated with dysregulation during infancy. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Two aspects of physiology frequently altered during pregnancy are sleep and inflammation. The relationship and timing between these two is important to evaluate since they are individually, as well as jointly associated with adverse health outcomes. To date, few studies have described sleep and inflammation in early gestation. We present preliminary data in order to begin to address this important research area. Subjective- and actigraphy-assessed sleep and plasma cytokine data on 69 women collected three times between 10-20 weeks gestation are described. Sleep quality was poor in 25% of participants. Diagnostic criteria for insomnia were met by 10%. Cytokine levels (IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) were relatively low and did not change across time. However, the top quartile had greater levels at each assessment compared to the lower quartile: IL-6 (0.36-0.50 vs. 0.04-0.06 pg/ml); TNFa (0.64-0.71 vs 0.21-0.28 pg/ml); INFc (13.9-23.1 vs 1.56-3.42 pg/ml). Sleep quality and depressive symptoms were variably correlated with IL-6 at each time (PSQI: r's = .18, .03 and 0.24) (diary-quality: r's = .40, 0.35, and 0.15) and (IDS: r's = .34, 0.29 and 0.17). This examination of sleep and cytokines during early pregnancy indicate that a subset of women have clinically relevant sleep disturbances and high inflammatory cytokine levels. We hypothesize that this subgroup of women may have an increased risk of having an adverse pregnancy event.

N2  - Disturbed sleep is common during pregnancy. It can dysregulate immunological pathways which may translate into increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Although parturition is an inflammatory event, premature parturition/birth (PTB) is linked with exaggerated cytokine levels. Since the etiology in over 50% of PTB is unknown, we explored associations among sleep, cytokines, and PTB. We examine whether disturbed sleep may increase risk of PTB via an exaggerated inflammatory response. Subjective sleep and biological marker (plasma IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and cortisol) concentrations were assessed in pregnant women (N = 212) at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation. Delivery was preterm (<36.6 weeks') or term (>37.0 weeks'). Insomnia at 20 weeks' was associated with higher plasma cortisol (r = .24, p = .003), while poor sleep continuity and efficiency, and short sleep duration were associated with higher IL-6 (r's = .16-0.24, p's < 0.05). At week 30, poor sleep continuity and efficiency, and short sleep duration were associated with higher IL-6 and TNF-α (r's = 0.15-18, p's < 0.05). There were no significant associations among the cytokines/cortisol and PTB. Although inconclusive, we maintain that in a subgroup of women disturbed sleep is likely to increase adverse pregnancy outcomes via an exaggerated inflammatory response. The current results may partially lay with the fact that maternal plasma cytokines are not necessarily indicative of the milieu at the maternal-fetal interface.

N2  - Background: Sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression are common during pregnancy. Both are independent and interrelated risk factors for adverse outcomes. It is unclear the degree to which sleep differs between depressed and nondepressed pregnant women. We sought to (1) describe and compare sleep disturbances in depressed pregnant and nondepressed pregnant women, (2) determine the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) treatment on sleep, and (3) evaluate whether sleep at 20 weeks is associated with increased depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) in later pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (N = 240) were recruited in the second trimester (20 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 59) and nondepressed (N = 181) groups based on a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement was administered at 20, 30, and 36 weeks gestation from which the sleep variables were obtained. Results: Depressed women had more fragmented sleep at each assessment (P values ≤ .05). However, the frequency of insomnia symptoms was greater for depressed women only at 20 weeks gestation. SSRI use, regardless of MDD status, did significantly affect several sleep variables. Among the nondepressed women, those with short or longer sleep duration, symptoms of insomnia and long periods of nocturnal waketime had higher Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale with Atypical Depression Supplement scores later in pregnancy (P values ≤ .05). Conclusions: At 20 and 30 weeks gestation sleep was more disturbed in depressed pregnant women compared to nondepressed pregnant women. At 36 weeks, sleep was disturbed regardless of depression status or SSRI use. Among the nondepressed women, disturbed sleep in conjunction with SSRI use was associated with higher depressive symptoms. Depression and Anxiety, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - In this study, the relationship between sleep quality and type and duration of labour has been evaluated. A total of 88 pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire three times during their last 3 weeks of pregnancy at their prenatal visits and once postpartum. A mean score of >5 was considered as poor-quality sleep. Duration of labour, type of delivery and weight of the newborn at delivery was considered. Of the study population, 56.2% were categorised as the good-quality sleep group and 43.8% as the poor-quality sleep group. The reported sleeping time per day was 8.47 ± 1.86 hours for the good-quality sleep group and 6.45 ± 2.07 hours for the poor-quality sleep group. The poor-quality sleep women were 20% more likely to undergo caesarean section and had a longer labour duration. Gestational age at delivery and mean gravidity was respectively 38.53 ± 1.17 weeks and 1.91 ± 1.03 in the good-quality sleep group and 38.36 ± 1.59 weeks and 1.86 ± 1.07 in the poor-quality sleep group. Thus, it was found that women with sleep problems experience longer labour duration and are more likely to undergo a caesarean section. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  - Background: Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. Recent evidence suggests that women with gestational hypertension have a high rate of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Using laboratory-based polysomnography, we evaluated for the frequency of SDB in women with gestational hypertension compared to healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods: In this single-center cross-sectional study, women with the diagnosis of gestational hypertension were screened in the Fetal Assessment Unit and Antepartum ward. Healthy subjects were recruited by local advertising. Subjects completed a series of questionnaires addressing sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, followed by full night polysomnography. The primary outcome was frequency of SDB (defined as a respiratory disturbance index ≥ 5) in the gestational hypertension and healthy groups. Results: A total of 34 women with gestational hypertension and singleton pregnancies and 26 healthy women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies consented to participate in the study. The mean ages and gestational ages, but not the body mass indices, of the 2 groups were similar. The frequencies of SDB in the more obese gestational hypertension group and the healthy group were 53% and 12%, respectively (P < 0.001). Interpretation: Women with gestational hypertension may have a significantly higher frequency of SDB than do healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies of similar gestational age. The relative causal contributions, if any, of SDB and obesity remain to be determined.

N2  - To investigate the possible role of inflammation factors in the pathogenesis of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with concurrent obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in pregnant women. Twenty-five pregnant women with IGT and concurrent OSAHS and 35 pregnant women with IGT but not OSAHS were monitored for all night polysomnography (PSG), and the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and the lowest pulse oxygen saturation (LSpO2) were recorded. The body mass index, glycated serum protein (GSP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured in these women. IL-6 and TNF-α levels increased significantly in women with IGT and OSAHS as compared with those in women without OSAHS. AHI showed significant positive correlations to GSP, IL-6 and TNF-α, whereas LSpO2 was inversely correlated to GSP, IL-6 and TNF-α. IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly correlated to GSP, with correlation coefficients of 0.510 and 0.476, respectively. The inflammatory factors may play important roles in IGT complicated by OSAHS in pregnant women, and as a potential risk factor, OSAHS may contribute to the occurrence of progression of IGT.

N2  - Background: Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) has been shown to resolve diabetes in 64-100% of cases and resolve hypertension in 25-100%. Due to long traveling distances often means follow up data is incomplete. Aims: To assess the improvement in diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnoea, PCOS and employment for patients undergoing RYBG using patient reported outcomes via a postal questionnaire. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to all patients who underwent a RYGB between April 2007 and July 2010. A reminder was sent to non-responders at 2 weeks. Weight loss data was collected prospectively. Patients were questioned on their pre and postoperative diagnosis and management of the following comorbidities: diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea and infertility related to PCOS. Results: 280 RYGB were performed with 63%(177/279) of patients returning questionnaires. Mean BMI was 52. There was 1 death 5 months post op. At a mean follow up of 18 months the mean percentage excess weight loss at 1yr was 64%. 62 patients reported diabetes pre-operatively of which 82% (51/62) claimed their diabetes management had improved. 62% (13/21) of patients requiring insulin pre op no longer require insulin and 33%(7) no longer require any diabetic medication. 66%(20) of 30 patients requiring oral hypoglycaemic agents pre operatively were able to stop them. 78% (28) of 36 patients using CPAP for sleep apnoea pre operatively no longer require it. 19 patients reported PCOS pre operatively with 10 reporting improved symptoms post operatively. 13 of these patients complained of fertility issues and despite advice to the contrary 4 patients reported falling pregnant post operatively. 77 patients required anti hypertensive medication preoperatively. Post operatively 36% (28) stopped all medication and of the remaining patients the dose and number of different tablets was reduced in 96% (47/49). Prior to surgery 47% (83/177) patients were unemployed. 42% (35) claimed this was due to obesity related health issues. Since surgery 31%(11) have been able to find employment post operatively. However of the 93 patients working prior to surgery 2 have not yet returned to work. Discussion: Within the limits of a patient reported outcome study with short follow up our data has confirmed benefit of RYGB for our population. With surgery 2/3 of insulin dependant diabetics stop insulin, with 1/3 no longer requiring any treatment for diabetes. 2/3 non-insulin dependant diabetics come off hypoglycaemic agents. CPAP can be stopped in 80% of cases. Anti hypertensive medications were stopped by 36% of patients and dose/number of tablets reduced in 96% of the remainder. With nearly 1/3 of obesity related unemployment returning to work at short term follow up, further work is needed to fully illicit the economic benefits of long term comorbidity improvement and employment against costs of surgery and complications.

N2  - An invitation to the University of California at Los Angeles in 1977 to take up a post as Chest Physician allowed this early interest in OSA in infants to extend into adult patients with the very first reports of OSA causing hypertension, and of oximetry as a natural diagnostic tool. In 1985 Dr Williams became tenured Professor of Medicine at UCLA and co-director of the UCLA Sleep Laboratory. As Sleep Medicine gelled as a specialty, Dr Williams was one of the first to take the Board exams in 1989 to become an accredited polysomnographer and later member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. In 1994 Dr Williams returned to London where he established the Sleep Disorders Centre at St. Thomas' Hospital. He has published extensively on Sleep Disorders including more than 100 peer reviewed original scientific papers and more than 80 other published papers including chapters and books. Dr Williams is a Diplomat of the American Board of Sleep Medicine, a founding member of The British Sleep Foundation, the Sleep Medicine Section of the Royal Society of Medicine as well as the RLS UK Group, and was recently appointed Professor of Sleep Medicine, King's College London. Sleep complaints are among the commonest in medical practice and can be simply categorised as: <disturbances of getting to sleep or staying asleep, or unrefreshing sleep, that is insomnia, <excessive daytime (or more properly wake-time) sleepiness, that is, hypersomnia; and <things that disturb the individual's sleep commonly said to be “things that go bump in the night”, or parasomnias. Although insomnia and parasomnias are prevalent, the hypersomnias are considered more prominently because of the potential impact on the household and on society Conditions that will produce excessive wake-time sleepiness are also relatively few, specifically <insufficient sleep, <interrupted sleep such as might be caused by Restless Legs with Periodic Limb Movements or breathing problems, and <intrinsic sleepiness or narcolepsy and its equivalents. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) common with a general prevalence of 3e4%. It is a waking complaint easily diagnosed by history (discomfort usually in the legs, occurring at rest, relieved by movement and confined mostly to the evening), associated 80% of the time with periodic limb movements in and disturbing sleep which might result in sleep complaints such as insomnia or hypersomnia. RLS may be secondary to renal failure and occurs in pregnancy and is promoted by anti-dopaminergis medicines such as the antihistamines. RLS is highly heritable and the genetic associations have recently been identified. The diagnosis of periodic limb movements in sleep usually requires polysomnography, although we have recently reported pulse rate variability on oximetry to be very useful. Treatment of both with a licensed dopa-agonist is common and second line treatment with codeine derivatives or clonazepam possible. Breathing problems are ubiquitous, the common form being snoring with obstructive sleep apnoea which affects some 5% of the population. The hallmark symptoms are snoring, witnessed apnoeas and excessive sleepiness with resulting sleep related vehicle accidents. Medical consequences include cardiovascular disease particularly hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke, along with neurocognitive abnormalities such as poor concentration, depression. Diagnosis is by history supplemented by a sleep study, often oximetry. When associated with symptoms such as sleepiness treatment with continuous positive airway pressure is usually advised along with weight loss in the obese. An alternative therapy would be an oral appliance for mandibular advancement. Both are successful mechanical treatments aimed at making the collapsing pharyngeal airway more patent. Surgery is rarely used.

N2  - Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is characterized by excellent response to treatment, if diagnosed correctly. Lifestyle advice is an integral part of the treatment of JME; it should include recommendations on avoidance of common triggers such as sleep deprivation and alcohol excess and emphasis on the importance of compliance with medication. The drug of first choice in the treatment of JME is sodium valproate, which has a response rate of up to 80%. Valproate should be avoided in women of childbearing age because of significantly increased risks of fetal malformations and neurodevelopmental delay. Levetiracetam or lamotrigine are alternative first-line options if valproate is contraindicated. With limited data from trials to support either of these drugs, the choice should take into account comorbidity factors and patient priorities. Because of its low side effect profile, excellent tolerability, and lack of interactions with other drugs, levetiracetam is our preferred alternative first-line agent. Lamotrigine is another first-line option but may exacerbate myoclonus. The failure of valproate or failure of two first-line antiepileptic drugs suggests that combination therapy is indicated. Drug interactions and the patient's gender, age, and comorbidities need to be considered. Levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and valproate are suitable adjuncts, with a synergistic effect reported from the combination of valproate and lamotrigine. Clonazepam is a useful adjunct for myoclonus and can be used in combination with lamotrigine to avoid lamotrigine's myoclonic effects. In women of childbearing potential, valproate should be considered if levetiracetam and lamotrigine have failed to control seizures at this stage. Topiramate is a cost-effective alternative monotherapy, but because of its poor tolerability, we recommend it as add-on treatment only. Zonisamide should remain a second-line adjunct in the treatment of JME, owing to the lack of supportive data. Phenobarbital is the most cost-effective drug and can be used to control the seizures of JME when antiepileptic drugs are limited or too costly. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin can exacerbate absences and myoclonus and are therefore contraindicated, although they can improve control of tonic-clonic seizures when these are refractory to other medication. Gabapentin, pregabalin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin are contraindicated and can worsen seizures. (Tiagabine and vigabatrin have been reported to induce absence status epilepticus.) Surgical alternatives in refractory cases are rarely contemplated but may include vagus nerve stimulation and callosotomy. Deep brain stimulation is an experimental technique that may prove useful in managing refractory cases of JME. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Late preterm infants, born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation, have significantly higher morbidity than neonates born at full term, which may be partly related to reduced sensitivity of the arterial baroreflex. The present study assessed baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in near-term fetal sheep at 123 ± 1 days gestation. At this age, although fetuses are not fully mature in some respects (term is 147 days), sleep-state cycling is established [between high-voltage, low-frequency (HV) and low-voltage, high-frequency (LV) sleep], and neural myelination is similar to the term human infant. Fetal sheep were instrumented to record blood pressure (BP), HR (n= 15) and RSNA (n= 5). Blood pressure was manipulated using vasoactive drugs, phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. In both HV and LV sleep, phenylephrine was associated with increased arterial BP and decreased HR. In HV sleep, phenylephrine was associated with a fall in RSNA, from 124 ± 14 to 58 ± 11% (P< 0.05), but no significant change in RSNA in LV sleep. In contrast, the fall in BP after sodium nitroprusside was associated with a significant increase in HR during LV but not HV sleep, and there was no significant effect of hypotension on RSNA. These data demonstrate that in near-term fetal sheep baroreflex activity is only partly active and is highly modulated by sleep state. Critically, there was no RSNA response to marked hypotension; this finding has implications for the ability of the late preterm fetus to adapt to low BP. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Aim: There is uncertainty about the best method of withdrawing supplemental oxygen in babies with chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD). Some authors advocate withdrawal of oxygen in the day, but continuing supplementation during sleep, based on early work suggesting that oxygen saturations are lower during sleep, which did not accord with our clinical impression. We re-examined the hypothesis that babies have lower saturations while asleep. Methods: We studied infants with CNLD during the day, while awake and asleep. We recorded video with simultaneous real-time capture of oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate and plethysmographic waveform from pulse oximetry. Behavioural state was scored using observation and video and classified as awake (feeding, active or quiet) or sleep. Results: Thirteen infants had analysable data, although one had strikingly lower SpO2 values while awake and was excluded from analysis. The infants had a median gestation of 26 weeks and were studied at a median (range) postmenstrual age of 66 (37-130) weeks, for 229 (89-330) min. Mean SpO2 was 97.6% during sleep and 97.0% awake (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Babies with CNLD have lower oxygen saturation while awake. There is no physiological justification for increasing oxygen during sleep, or withdrawing selectively during the daytime, although larger studies are needed to confirm this finding. © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta Pædiatrica.

N2  - Lead (Pb) exposure alters the temporal organization of several physiological and behavioural processes in which the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus plays a fundamental role. In this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic early Pb exposure (CePbe) on the morphology, cellular density and relative optical density (OD) in the cells of the SCN of male rats. Female Wistar rats were exposed during gestation and lactation to a Pb solution containing 320ppm of Pb acetate through drinking water. After weaning, the pups were maintained with the same drinking water until sacrificed at 90days of age. Pb levels in the blood, hypothalamus, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were significantly increased in the experimental group. Chronic early Pb exposure induced a significant increase in the minor and major axes and somatic area of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and vasopressin (VP)-immunoreactive neurons. The density of VIP-, VP- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive cells showed a significant decrease in the experimental group. OD analysis showed a significant increase in VIP neurons of the experimental group. The results showed that CePbe induced alterations in the cells of the SCN, as evidenced by modifications in soma morphology, cellular density and OD in circadian pacemaker cells. These findings provide a morphological and cellular basis for deficits in circadian rhythms documented in Pb-exposed animals. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Non-technical summary: Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone are commonly given to women at risk of preterm labour. While they significantly improve survival of the prematurely born infant, their effects on preterm brain activity is surprisingly unclear. We found that, in sheep, a conventional clinical course of maternal dexamethasone treatment was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity of the fetal EEG. This activity reflected a striking shift to less-frequent but higher amplitude EEG waveforms, and unexpectedly, EEG waveforms whose duration and pattern were highly consistent with seizure activity. After resolution of hyperactivity, the EEG showed changes consistent with maturation of sleep architecture, and reassuringly there was no histological evidence of brain injury 5 days after first exposure. The long-term implications are uncertain, but these effects may contribute to improved neonatal outcomes. Maternal treatment with synthetic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (DEX) significantly reduces neonatal morbidity and mortality, but its effects on the fetal brain remain unclear. In this study we evaluated the effects of DEX on EEG activity in preterm fetal sheep. Ewes at 103 days gestation received two intramuscular injections of DEX (12 mg, n= 8) or saline vehicle (n= 7) 24 h apart. Fetal EEG activity was recorded from 6 h before until 120 h after the first injection (DEX-1). DEX-1 was associated with a marked transient rise in total EEG power, maximal at 12 h (P < 0.001), with a relative increase in delta and reduced theta, alpha and beta activity, resolving by 24 h. Continuous EEG records showed a shift to larger but less frequent transient waveforms (P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, evolving epileptiform activity, consistent with electrographic and clinical seizures, developed from 178 ± 44 min after DEX-1. Similar but smaller changes were seen after the second injection. Following the injections, total power returned to control values, but the proportion of alpha activity progressively increased vs. controls (P < 0.001), with reduced interburst interval duration and number (P < 0.001). No histological neural injury or microglial activation was seen. In summary, exposure to maternal dexamethasone was associated with dramatic, evolving low-frequency hyperactivity on fetal cortical EEG recordings, followed by sustained changes consistent with maturation of fetal sleep architecture. We postulate that these effects may contribute to improved neonatal outcomes. © 2011 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2011 The Physiological Society.

N2  - Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of vigilance and regulation of motor activity but their hyperactivity may contribute to anxiety disorders. Using a rat model, we tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE. Male rat pups received 2.625. g/kg of alcohol (AE group) intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy. Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD12-14, they received daily injections of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20. mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V) during the lights-off period. On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test. On PD17, their motor activity was monitored in a novel environment. The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest HR latency were higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE-V than in S-V rats (p=0.0009-0.03). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE-SB and either S-SB or S-V rats. Motor activity in AE-V rats was significantly higher than in S-V (p=0.003), S-SB (p=0.007) or AE-SB (p=0.02) rats, with no difference between S-SB and AE-SB group. Our findings suggest that excessive activity of ORX neurons contributes to motor hyperactivity and impaired HR acquisition following perinatal AE and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to measure sleep quality during pregnancy and to determine its corresponding factors that affect sleep quality. Materials and methods: Our study was conducted on 100 healthy pregnant women who apply Ahmet Necdet Sezer Hospital of Afyonkarahisar Kocatepe University. Data was collected using face-to-face method. A standard questionnaire (Appx: 1) was used to record sociodemographic properties and status of their pregnancy. Sleep quality was evaluated by Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (Appx: 2), sleep apnea by Berlin Questionnaire (Appx: 3), and sleepiness status by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Appx: 4). Results: Sleep quality was determined as poorer in 86% of women. It is found that sleep quality is related to age, obesity, applying to a doctor, and other illnesses affecting pregnancy.

N2  - Study Objectives: To evaluate the success rate of adding continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (EFM) during full night polysomnography (PSG), in women with both gestational hypertension (GH) with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies. Method: As part of a larger study evaluating for the presence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in women with GH compared to women with uncomplicated pregnancies, continuous EFM was added to usual polysomnography. Results: Forty-eight EFM studies (26 with GH and 22 with uncomplicated pregnancies) were evaluated. EFM studies were categorized by the percentage of time that inter-prétable tracings were obtained: < 25% of the time; 25-50% of the time; or > 50% of the time. We deemed > 50% of the time to be ideal, but under the test conditions 25-50% of the time to be acceptable. For women with GH, 71% of women had ideal or accept-able overnight EFM tracings compared to 82% for women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Of those women who were diagnosed with SDB, 77% had an acceptable or ideal EFM tracing. Conclusions: Adding EFM to conventional polysomnography is feasible and safe. It may prove an important adjunct as interest in sleep disorders of pregnancy continues to expand.

N2  - Postpartum weight retention affects many women and increases the risk of becoming overweight. The research objective was to study modifiable factors contributing to weight change at one year postpartum. In this prospective cohort, postpartum behavior, such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, and intake of total energy, total fat and saturated fatty acids of 118 Dutch women were assessed in 2003/2004 by self-report at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months postpartum. Mean postpartum scores were computed for the behavioral measures. In linear regression models it was determined which factors were associated with average weight change from before pregnancy to one year postpartum. Furthermore, factors associated with substantial postpartum weight retention (≥ 5 kg) were also studied in logistic regression models. At one year postpartum, the average weight of participants had increased by 0.9 kg (SD 4.4). Moreover, 20% of the women retained ≥ 5 kg. Women who perceived themselves more physically active than others were almost ten times less likely to retain ≥ 5 kg than women who perceived themselves equally active (OR = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.02 - 0.66). Exceeding the guideline for saturated fatty acid intake (OR = 3.40, 95%CI: 1.04 - 11.11), total gestational weight gain (OR = 1.14/kg, 95%CI: 1.01 - 1.27), and not having completed post high school education (OR = 5.13, 95%CI: 1.66 - 15.90) increased the odds of retaining ≥ 5 kg. Since one in five women had substantial weight retention postpartum, effective interventions for the prevention of weight retention are much needed. Future studies should evaluate whether interventions focusing on the identified modifiable postpartum factors are successful in reducing weight retention after childbirth.

N2  - Functional impairment of the adult brain can result from deficits in the ontogeny of GABAergic synaptic transmission. Gene defects underlying autism spectrum disorders, Rett's syndrome or some forms of epilepsy, but also a diverse set of syndromes accompanying perinatal trauma, hormonal imbalances, intake of sleep-inducing or mood-improving drugs or, quite common, alcohol intake during pregnancy can alter GABA signaling early in life.The search for therapeutically relevant endogenous molecules or exogenous compounds able to alleviate the consequences of dysfunction of GABAergic transmission in the embryonic or postnatal brain requires a clear understanding of its site- and state-dependent development. At the level of single synapses, it is necessary to discriminate between presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations, and to define parameters that can be regarded as both suitable and accessible for the quantification of developmental changes. Here we focus on the performance of GABAergic synapses in two brain structures, the hippocampus and the superior colliculus, describe some novel aspects of neurotrophin effects during the development of GABAergic synaptic transmission and examine the applicability of the following rules: (1) synaptic transmission starts with GABA, (2) nascent/immature GABAergic synapses operate in a ballistic mode (multivesicular release), (3) immature synaptic terminals release vesicles with higher probability than mature synapses, (4) immature GABAergic synapses are prone to paired pulse and tetanic depression, (5) synapse maturation is characterized by an increasing dominance of synchronous over asynchronous release, (6) in immature neurons GABA acts as a depolarizing transmitter, (7) synapse maturation implies inhibitory postsynaptic current shortening due to an increase in alpha1 subunit expression, (8) extrasynaptic (tonic) conductances can inhibit the development of synaptic (phasic) GABA actions.

N2  - In blood pressure during pregnancy and its close monitoring is a vital component. Antenatal, natal and postnatal periods. Gestational hypertension and its advancement towards preeclampsia is a threat to feto-maternal life and provide a ground for strict follow-up with treatment, if required. The aim of this study was to measure the patterns of blood pressure among pregnant Chinese with categorization of normal ladies and ladies with established pregnancy induced (PrH). This study was conducted at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China over a period of 1 year from 2010 to December 2010. A total of 1324 systematically sampled blood pressure readings were taken by method. All women were in their child bearing age with a mean of 21 ∗ 13 years. BP was for 48 h interval with a gap of 1 month. Out of the total, 96 ladies were pregnant without related complications, 42 were cases of pregnancy induced hypertension and 17 were established of pre-eclampsia. All these pregnant ladies were in their third trimester of pregnancy. Blood readings with complications and baseline investigatory data was obtained and analped by 15. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results showed that there was a significant circadian pattern in systolic and diastolic blood for all groups of pregnant ladies {P < 0.05}. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant {P < 0.05}. Circadian characteristics between women who later developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these two groups in circadian mean is statistically significant in the second trimester for systolic (P = 0.023) but not for diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.12). In the third trimester the difference in circadian mean is highly statistically significant for both variables (P < 0.02). Conclusions: Changes in the circadian pattern of blood pressure with advancing gestational age between healthy and complicated pregnancies offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic intervention.

N2  - Aim: To determine the possible risk factors for inadequate gestational weight gain. Methods: A population-based cohort study was carried out in Sri Lanka from May 2001 to April 2002. Pregnant women were recruited on or before 16 weeks' gestation and followed up until delivery; the sample size was 710. Trimester-specific exposure status and potential confounding factors were gathered on average at the 12th, 28th and 36th weeks of gestation. Maternal weight was measured at the first antenatal clinic visit and at delivery. Inadequate weight gain was defined as weight gain below the Institute of Medicine recommendations in 2009. Multiple logistic regression was applied and the results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: The risk factors for inadequate weight gain were low per-capita monthly income (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.03, 2.58), multiparity (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.34, 2.87), sleeping <8 h/day during the second, third, or both second and third trimesters (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.05, 2.46), standing and walking ≥5 h/day during the second trimester (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.15), and the newborn being of the male sex (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04, 2.16), controlling for the effect of body mass index and gestational age. Conclusions: Risk factors for inadequate gestational weight gain were low income, being multiparous, sleep deprivation, physical activity in terms of standing and walking, and the male sex of baby. © 2011 The Authors.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) describes a number of disorders that are characterized by abnormalities of respiratory pattern. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common of such disorders and is characterized by episodes of airflow limitation that lead to frequent, intermittent hypoxia. The average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep is the apneahypopnea index (AHI) with >5 events being diagnostic. The prevalence of OSA is estimated to be 5-11% among pre-menopausal women but the occurrence of SDB among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is unknown. We hypothesized that women with GDM would have SDB that resolved postpartum. Participants (n=30; all diagnosed with GDM) in this study (aged 32±4 (mean±SD) years) wore a portable sleep recorder in their home at 30-34 weeks gestation and 2-3 months post-partum. Table 1 shows that 40% of the women had SDB. The current BMI of those with SDB was higher. (Table presented) Complications appear to be more related to the presence of GDM than SDB. At follow-up (64±10 days post-partum), SDB had resolved for 4 individuals. This indicates that for approximately 15% of the women, SDB appeared to have developed during pregnancy. Whether those with non-resolving SDB represent a group with a very early propensity for the development of type 2 requires follow-up. These preliminary results indicate that SDB is a frequent co-morbid condition of GDM.

N2  - Aim: To determine the socio-demographic correlates of poor sleep quality in middle-aged Australian women. Methods: For this cross-sectional study data on 3692 mothers were taken from the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (MUSP) at 21 year follow-up, a large birth cohort study of mothers and children enrolled in Brisbane, Australia beginning in 1981. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Candidate socio-demographic correlates of poor sleep quality including age, employment status, ethnicity, marital status, level of education, children residing at home, level of engagement in social networks and housing tenure were assessed. Correlates associated with poor sleep quality were included in subsequent multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: Unemployment, not living with a partner, lower level of education, non-house ownership, no children at home, poor social network and lower family income were found to be related to poorer sleep quality. After controlling for recent anxiety, depression and menopausal symptoms the association between these factors, excepting family income and poor sleep quality remained significant. Better sleep quality was associated with being employed, tertiary level of education, home ownership and good social networks. Conclusion: The association of low family income with poor sleep quality may possibly be mediated by anxiety.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the association of short sleep duration among women in the first year postpartum with inflammation at 3 years postpartum. We studied 479 women in Project Viva, a prospective cohort. At 6 months and 1 year postpartum, women reported the number of hours they slept in a 24-hour period, from which we calculated a weighted average of daily sleep. We used multivariable median regression analyses to predict the independent effects of short sleep duration (≤5 vs >5 h/d) on markers of inflammation, for example, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein at 3 years postpartum. Women's mean (SD) hours of daily sleep in the first year postpartum was 6.7 (0.96) hours. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, excessive gestational weight gain, and gestational age at delivery, we found that postpartum sleep ≤5 h/d was associated with elevated IL-6 (β, 0.25 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.43) compared with >5 h/d. Although postpartum sleep ≤5 h/d appeared to also be associated with elevated C-reactive protein (β 0.15 mg/dL; 95% confidence interval, -0.08 to 0.52), these results did not reach statistical significance. Short sleep duration in the first year postpartum is associated with elevated levels of the proinflammatory marker, IL-6, at 3 years postpartum. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective:Several lines of evidence indicate that nutrient restriction during perinatal development sensitizes the offspring to the development of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in adulthood via the programming of hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. Given the link between the circadian clock and energy metabolism, and the resetting action of food on the circadian clock, in this study, we have investigated whether perinatal undernutrition affects the circadian expression rhythms of genes regulating food intake in the hypothalamus and energy metabolism in the liver.Design:Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ad libitum either a control (20% protein) or a low-protein (8% protein) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At weaning, pups received a standard diet and at 17 and 35 days of age, their daily patterns of gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR experiments.Results:17-day-old pups exposed to perinatal undernutrition exhibited significant alterations in the circadian expression profile of the transcripts encoding diverse genes regulating food intake, the metabolic enzymes fatty acid synthase and glucokinase as well as the clock genes BMAL1 and Period1. These effects persisted after weaning, were associated with hyperphagia and mirrored the results of the behavioral analysis of feeding. Thus, perinatally undernourished rats exhibited an increased hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic peptides agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y. Conversely, the mRNA levels of the anorexigenic peptides pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine and amphetamine-related transcripts were decreased.Conclusion:These observations indicate that the circadian clock undergoes nutritional programming. The programming of the circadian clock may contribute to the alterations in feeding and energy metabolism associated with malnutrition in early life, which might promote the development of metabolic disorders in adulthood. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - Insomnia, defined as difficulty in falling asleep and/or staying asleep, short sleep duration, or poor quality sleep, is a common sleep disorder affecting 30-40% of adult population. We have conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test if anesthesia is therapeutically beneficial in patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. We have assessed the efficacy and safety of propofol-induced sleep in these patients. This study comprised of 103 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia (including 59 non-pregnant, non-lactating women; 28-60 years) and the participants were randomized to receive either physiological saline (placebo) (n = 39) or 3. 0 g/l propofol (n = 64) in a 2-h continuous intravenous infusion for five consecutive nights. The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire was used for the subjective assessment of sleep, and polysomnography was used for the objective measurement of sleep architecture and patterns. The assessments were done prior to and at the end of the 5-day treatment and 6 months after treatment period. The adverse effects of the treatment were also recorded. A 2-h continuous intravenous infusion of 3. 0 g/l propofol for five consecutive nights improved the subjective and objective assessments of sleep in 64 patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. This improvement occurred immediately after the therapy and persisted for 6 months. No serious adverse events were noticed during the period of drug administration or 6 months after the treatment. Propofol therapy is an efficacious and safe choice for restoring normal sleep in patients with refractory chronic primary insomnia. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether snoring, sleep position, and other sleep practices in pregnant women are associated with risk of late stillbirth. Design: Prospective population based case-control study. Setting Auckland, New Zealand Participants: Cases: 155 women with a singleton late stillbirth (≥28 weeks' gestation) without congenital abnormality born between July 2006 and June 2009 and booked to deliver in Auckland. Controls: 310 women with single ongoing pregnancies and gestation matched to that at which the stillbirth occurred. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors. Main outcome measure: Maternal snoring, daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep position at the time of going to sleep and on waking (left side, right side, back, and other). Results: The prevalence of late stillbirth in this study was 3.09/1000 births. No relation was found between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the previous night (before stillbirth or interview) were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who slept on their left side (adjusted odds ratio for back sleeping 2.54 (95% CI 1.04 to 6.18), and for right side sleeping 1.74 (0.98 to 3.01)). The absolute risk of late stillbirth for women who went to sleep on their left was 1.96/1000 and was 3.93/1000 for women who did not go to sleep on their left. Women who got up to go to the toilet once or less on the last night were more likely to experience a late stillbirth compared with women who got up more frequently (adjusted odds ratio 2.28 (1.40 to 3.71)). Women who regularly slept during the day in the previous month were also more likely to experience a late stillbirth than those who did not (2.04 (1.26 to 3.27)). Conclusions: This is the first study to report maternal sleep related practices as risk factors for stillbirth, and these findings require urgent confirmation in further studies.

N2  - Introduction: Majority of women is worried about labor pain during pregnancy and it leads to their interest in cesarean section. Today, different medical and non-medical treatments are used to decrease labor pain. This research was conducted to investigate the effect of different positions on the intensity of labor pain in women who were in active phase of labor. Methods: This clinical trial was done on 400 women who were selected by purposive sampling method and were in the active phase of labor. First a questionnaire was filled for them based on demographic characteristic and then they were requested to sit down and sleep in supine position intermittently every15 minutes. Severity of pain in abdomen and back was determined by pain scale and recorded data was analyzed by SPSS 11 software and student t-test and Chi-square test. Results: In most of women back pain and abdominal pain was lower in sitting position and by changing position from sitting to supine, intensity of pain sensation increased. Significant relation was observed between back pain and abdominal pain in active phase (p=0.000). Conclusion: Sitting position can decrease pain sensation in back and abdomen and therefore, change in severity of pain from severe to moderate and moderate to mild in active phase of labor.

N2  - Objective: To compare the outpatient in gynecology department with health screening women in aspects of general condition, bearing, livelihood, economics and family, and to analyze the factors that relate to premature ovarian failure (POF) and diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Method: To survey 178 outpatients of gynecology department and health screening women visited from January to December of 2007, and to investigate the possible related factors through a questionnaire including the condition of basic information (e.g. age, marital status, occupation and education), menstruation, pregnancy and delivery, contraception, health, livelihood, economics, psychology, society, family and so on. The data were analyzed with SPSS 13.0 software. Results A total of 45 POF patients, 83 DOR patients and 50 healthy women were included. The results of questionnaire showed that the physiological factor was the main reason for the occurrence of POF and DOR; the menstrual disorders, autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), malignancy cancer, pelvic surgery, smoking and drug abuse, and lack of sleep were closely related to POF and DOR; the social and psychological factors were other main reasons to cause POF and DOR. Conclusion The onset of both POF and DOR is caused by many factors, such as physical, social and psychological factors. The effective prevention and treatment for these diseases should be conducted positively in accordance with these three aspects. © 2011 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

N2  - In Finland every fourth young adult (25 to 34 years of age) has experience with the use of cannabis and in younger people (15 to 24 years) about 10% have used it during the previous year. The majority (about 90%) neither becomes addicted nor develops significant psychiatric symptoms, but in some individuals regular cannabis-use can cause a variety of problems (health, emotional, behavioural, social, legal). If problems have not yet developed or are still minor, patient's cannabis-use may be addressed by brief intervention in a primary care setting. Also, treatment of uncomplicated cannabis withdrawal as well as of minor symptoms from smoking (bronchitis, sleep disturbances), can be treated in community health centres. Children and adolescents, pregnant individuals or those with psychiatric symptoms should be treated by services with expertise in addiction medicine.

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether reduced sleep is associated with differences in body composition and the risk of becoming overweight in young children. Design: Longitudinal study with repeated annual measurements. Setting: Dunedin, New Zealand. Participants: 244 children recruited from a birth cohort and followed from age 3 to 7. Main outcome measures: Body mass index (BMI), fat mass (kg), and fat free mass (kg) measured with bioelectrical impedance; dual energy x ray absorptiometry; physical activity and sleep duration measured with accelerometry; dietary intake (fruit and vegetables, non-core foods), television viewing, and family factors (maternal BMI and education, birth weight, smoking during pregnancy) measured with questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for multiple confounders, each additional hour of sleep at ages 3-5 was associated with a reduction in BMI of 0.48 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.96) and a reduced risk of being overweight (BMI ≥85th centile) of 0.39 (0.24 to 0.63) at age 7. Further adjustment for BMI at age 3 strengthened these relations. These differences in BMI were explained by differences in fat mass index (-0.43, -0.82 to -0.03) more than by differences in fat free mass index (-0.21, -0.41 to -0.00). Conclusions: Young children who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk of becoming overweight, even after adjustment for initial weight status and multiple confounding factors. This weight gain is a result of increased fat deposition in both sexes rather than additional accumulation of fat free mass.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep duration is recognized as a potential contributor to adverse health conditions. While there is a growing literature describing a relationship between short sleep duration and morbidity, the evidence regarding the consequences of long sleep duration on health outcomes is limited. The data are even further limited when evaluating the relationship in pregnant women, since they are excluded from most studies. We sought to evaluate whether sleep duration in early gestation (15 weeks) is associated with increased circulating concentrations of inflammatory cytokines across pregnancy. Methods: Participants were 85 pregnant women with a history of preeclampsia enrolled into an exercise intervention study at 15 weeks gestation. Self-reported sleep duration and blood samples were obtained concurrently at 15, 24 and 36 weeks gestation. Plasma samples were assayed for the inflammatory cytokines IL-2, -6, -8, IFNγ, TNFα, GMCSF and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, -5, and -10 using Luminex technology. A ratio of pro-to-anti-inflammatory cytokines was calculated using multiples of the median (MOMs) for each relevant cytokine type to normalize the data for comparison. Data were analyzed using repeated measures mixed models. Results: Women with long sleep (> 8 hours) at 15 weeks gestation, had higher IL-6 concentrations throughout gestation than women who were average sleepers, however this was only significant in early gestation (p < .01). No other cytokine or the ratio of pro-to-inflammatory cytokines differed between groups. No interaction of group by time were significant. Conclusion: The tendency to sleep for more than 8 hours in early pregnancy may contribute to increased low-grade inflammation as evidenced by higher circulating concentrations of IL-6. This may initiate the pathophysiological changes associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. While our data are only speculative at this time, further investigation is warranted to determine whether this association increases risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Nearly 50% of women report sleep disturbances during pregnancy. The present study sought to determine whether pregnancyspecific sleep disturbances differentiate those who meet DSM-IV criteria for Insomnia Disorder from those who do not. Methods: Sixty-three women at different stages of pregnancy completed the Duke Interview for Sleep Disorders, the Insomnia Severity Index, and demographic information. Forty-seven of these women also completed questions about pregnancy-related symptoms interfering with sleep (e.g. hip pain). A series of t-tests and Chi-square analyses compared participants with and without insomnia disorder on a variety of demographic information and endorsement of pregnancy-specific sleep disruptions. Results: Fifty-four percent of the sample met criteria for current Insomnia Disorder, with a mean Insomnia Severity Index score of 14.3 (sd = 3.5), statistically larger than the score of the women without Insomnia Disorder (4.6; sd=3.4). While hip pain and sleeping position were more likely to disrupt sleep in those with Insomnia Disorder (p's < .08), baby movements, breast tenderness, contractions, breathing difficulties, hot flashes, hunger, indigestion, restless or cramping legs, nausea, pelvic pain, and urination, and worry did not. Groups did not differ in the number of previous episodes of insomnia either during or outside of pregnancy. Conclusion: Reliance on the presence of pregnancy-related sleep disruptions alone is insufficient for determining whether a given pregnant woman is suffering from a sleep disorder. Screening insomnia in pregnant women requires the use of reliable screening measures, such as the Insomnia Severity Index (cut-off score of 11 or higher in pregnant women), followed by a clinical interview.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. The extent to which SDB occurs and impacts GT in pregnancy has not been well characterized. We explored sleep quality and SDB, in relationship to GT and pregnancy outcomes in 169 women undergoing a 50gm OGTT, typically at 24-28 weeks of gestation. The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Berlin questionnaire to evaluate SDB risk were administered. On average, sleep quality was poor with a mean +SD PSQI of 7.4+4.0 (normal<5). Mean ESS was 8.0+4.6 (normal<8), reflecting daytime sleepiness. 29% were at increased risk for SDB, 92% had interrupted sleep and 52% reported sleeping <7hr/night (short sleep [SS]).116 women(69%) had a normal 50g OGTT (NGT), and 26 (15%) had GDM. Sleep disturbances predicted an increased likelihood of GDM with an odds ratio of 3.0(95% CI 1.2-7.4) for high SDB risk (p<0.05), 2.4(95% CI 1.0-5.9) for SS (p=0.06), 3.4(95% CI 1.3-8.7) for the combination of high SDB risk and SS (SDB+SS) (p=0.01), and 3.4(95% CI 1.3-8.8) for snoring >3-4 night/week (p=0.01, BMI adjusted)Fifteen GDM women had an overnight polysomnography, 11(73%) of whom had an apnea-hypopnea index>5, the cutoff for SDB. Ten NGT women matched for age, BMI and ethnicity served as controls. Compared to the NGT group, GDM women had lower total sleep time (393+75vs.447+44 min, p<0.05), more fragmented sleep as reflected by a higher microarousal index (24.7+10.3vs.17.2+5.3, p=0.05) and an increased incidence of SDB (90%vs.40%, p=0.06).Pregnancy outcomes were analyzed in 134 women (108 NGT, 26 GDM). The GDM group had a higher prevalence of gestational hypertension (23%vs.5%, p<0.01); as expected, fetal birth weight was higher (3666+597vs.3232+413 gm, p<0.01), and NICU admission more frequent (46%vs18%, p<0.01). After adjustment for GT status, preterm delivery was more frequent in those with an increased PSQI (p=0.06), SS (p=0.05) and SDB+SS (p=0.06). NICU admissions were associated with higher ESS (p=0.05) and SDB+SS (p=0.03). Primary C-section was more frequent in subjects who reported snoring (p=0.02).Summary: Pregnant women experience significant sleep disturbances, which are associated with increased risk of GDM and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. GDM women have a higher prevalence of SDB and poor sleep quality, independent of BMI. These findings suggest that sleep disturbances contribute to the risk of diabetes in pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnant women are at risk for short sleep duration because of the physical changes of pregnancy. Few research has examined the correlates of short sleep duration during pregnancy and its effects on maternal and fetal outcomes. The purpose of the present study examined the role sleep duration during pregnancy plays in maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods: In a prospective cohort pilot study (n=31), women aged 14 to 40 years old at 6 to 14 weeks of gestation were recruited from the obstetrics clinic at the Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. Sleep duration was measured with actigraphy as follows for 7 consecutive days at each interval: 1) 5 to 20 weeks; 2) 21 to 28 weeks; 3)30 to 36 weeks. Sociodemographic information and birth outcomes were collected through survey questionnaires and medical record abstraction. The exposure was sleep duration per 24 hours during pregnancy. Outcomes of interest included preterm delivery, small for gestational age (SGA), preeclampsia, and gestational weight gain. Binary Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Being African American, higher BMI, self-perceived poor coping, and lack of social support increased the odds of short sleep duration during pregnancy. Using sleep as a continuous measure, each additional hour of sleep per 24 hours in late pregnancy decreased the odds of SGA (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.81) whereas one hour increase in sleep in mid pregnancy decreased the odds of preeclampsia (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.97). Each hour increase in sleep per 24 hrs in early pregnancy was also associated with less gestational weight gain (OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.99). Conclusion: Sleep duration during pregnancy may be associated with maternal and fetal outcomes. More studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm the study findings.

N2  - Introduction: Studies have indicated that symptom-based screening questionnaires have functioned poorly in identifying pregnant women at risk for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We sought to investigate the role of physical measurements, including the Mallampati score-a measure of airway crowding, in improving SDB identification in an obese pregnant population. Methods: Participants in an observational cohort of obese pregnant women (BMI >30 kg/m2) underwent overnight sleep studies for SDB using a portable home monitor (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA), recording nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, snoring, and head movement, and measurement of body composition using air displacement plethysmography (Pod Bod). Physical morphometric measurements, Mallampati scoring and sleep assessment took place at the gestational ages 13-20 weeks of gestation. Data were analyzed utilizing chi square, t-test, Mann Whitney U test and multinomial logistic regression. Results: The sample consisted of 110 women. Nine had an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) > 5. Those with and without SDB had similar race distributions (African American race 56 vs. 60 %, p=0.8), prevalence of diabetes (24 vs. 29%, p=0.9) and hypertension (62 vs. 42, p=0.3). The SDB group was older (33±7 vs. 28±6 years, p=0.04), had a higher BMI (45 vs. 39 kg/m2, p=0.03), and a wider neck (41 vs. 37 cm, p=0.002), but a similar waist to hip ratio (0.96±0.07 vs. 0.97± 0.13, p=0.4) and percent body fat (44±6 vs. 45±7%, p=0.9). The SDB group had a higher median Mallampati score:(2[2-3] vs. 1[1-2], p=0.02). After controlling for BMI, increasing neck circumference, per centimeter increase (OR 1.8 [1.1-3.3]), but not a Mallampati score of 3 (OR 0.9 [0.07-13]) was predictive of SDB. Conclusion: Among obese pregnant women, even after adjusting for BMI, SDB is associated with an increased neck circumference. SDB was also associated with upper airway crowding as shown by the elevated Mallampati score. The latter, however was associated with BMI. Thus, adiposity that results in a larger neck circumference is associated with SDB in pregnancy, perhaps through effects on airway patency. Further research on the utility of neck and airway measurements in the screening for SDB in pregnancy may lead to fruitful approaches for identifying this disorder.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, full overnight polysomnographic (PSG) studies are labor-intensive and challenging to perform in pregnant women, particularly in late gestation. The Watch- PAT device is a simple, wrist-worn device approved for diagnosis of SDB. We examined levels of agreement between key variables obtained from full ambulatory PSG and Watch-PAT in pregnant women. Methods: Women in their third trimester were recruited from obstetric clinics to undergo full overnight PSG at home using the MediPalm system as well as the Watch-PAT200 device. PSGs from the MediPalm were scored by an experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria; the Watch-PAT was scored automatically with its proprietary software. Results: A total of 17 pregnant women have been studied. Mean age was 30.6±6.5 years and mean BMI was 31.0±7.2 kg/m2. Good correlations were found between the two devices for total sleep time (r=0.91, p<0.001), AHI (r=0.95, p<0.001), respiratory disturbance index (RDI; r=0.92, p<0.001), mean SpO2 (r=0.70, p=0.002), and SpO2 nadir (r=0.79, p<0.001). Paired t-tests showed no significant differences between the MediPalm and Watch-PAT for mean AHI (7.8 vs. 10.6), mean SpO2 (95.8% vs. 95.5%), or SpO2 nadir (90.6% vs. 90.9%). However, total sleep time was longer (342.6 mins vs. 370.1 mins; p=0.01) and RDI higher (8.6 vs. 14.7; p=0.008) when measured by the Watch-PAT. Six of 7 women with a MediPalm AHI>5 had a Watch-PAT AHI>5. However, 7 of 10 women with a MediPalm AHI<5 were found to have a Watch- PAT AHI>5. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that results from the Watch-PAT and full home PSG are similar for key SDB-variables in pregnancy. However, the Watch-PAT may be more sensitive to, or exaggerate, respiratory disturbances.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to validate a portable recorder, the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) Unicorder (Watermark Medical, FL), with polysomnography (PSG) for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. The ARES is validated in non-pregnant adults, but we hypothesized that facial edema during pregnancy could affect ARES oximetry and change performance of the device in pregnant women Methods: We recruited pregnant patients referred for a sleep study for clinical suspicion of OSA. PSG was scored using standard criteria to determine PSG apnea/hypopnea index (AHI). ARES data were processed using ARES software, which applies automated algorithms to identify SaO2 changes, pulse rate, head movements, and snoring and combines these factors to calculate an ARES AHI. We examined ARES AHI determined with 4% and 3% desaturations. We used AHI≥5 events/hour as the cutoff for OSA diagnosis for all methods. We computed sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa coefficients to assess diagnostic consistency between PSG and ARES. Results: Fifteen women (mean age±SD = 29.6+5.5 years; mean gestational age = 29.1±6.3 weeks, range= 17 to 38 weeks; mean BMI 44.8±7.3 kg/m2, range=30.3 to 61.2 kg/m2) had concurrent data collection with the ARES Unicorder and laboratory PSG. Eight women had OSA diagnosed with PSG: AHI range=6.8 to 113 events/hour. The ARES AHI 4% algorithm had sensitivity=0.63, specificity=1.0, and Kappa=0.61, p=.01. The ARES AHI 3% algorithm had sensitivity=0.75, specificity=0.71, and Kappa=.46, p=.07. Two patients with PSG AHIs of 8.4 and 8.9 events/ hour were not identified with either ARES algorithm. Conclusion: The ARES Unicorder demonstrated reasonable consistency with PSG in this small, heterogeneous sample of pregnant women. The ARES algorithm with higher sensitivity (ARES AHI 3%) should be utilized in pregnancy because of potential adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with untreated sleep-disordered breathing.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing is known to cause an increase in both nocturnal and daytime systemic blood pressure. Prior studies have shown snoring and flow limitation during pregnancy may be associated with blood pressure elevations. However, relatively little is known about the effects of sleep disordered breathing and more subtle breathing abnormalities during pregnancy. Inspiratory flow limitation is commonly observed in pregnancy. In addition, saturation values above 95% are typically recommended although the data underlying this recommendation are somewhat unclear. We hypothesized that pregnant women with subtle breathing abnormalities would have higher nocturnal blood pressure. Methods: Twenty-five women admitted into our hospital in their third trimester of pregnancy participated in a sleep study using an unattended portable monitoring device. Following informed consent, participants were given subjective sleep questionnaires. Blood Pressure was acquired upon admission and during the night as part of usual care by nursing staff. Subjects' sleep was recorded for roughly 10 hours. We then scored the sleep recordings using modified Chicago criteria(2 and 3 percent desaturation); an automated flow limitation marker was also used and verified visually(Embla Software). Results: To date, we have enrolled 25 women with ages ranging from 18-48 years, with pre-pregnancy BMI 17-45 kg/m2 and 8 having preeclampsia and 17 pregnant controls. We observed minimal sleep apnea using either a 2 or 3 percent desaturation criterion(RDI ranging from 0-6/h). Using a Spearman Correlation test, we found that flow limited breathing was a predictor of raised blood pressure as measured during the middle of the night. Among women without pre-eclampsia, we observed that an increase in the flow limitation index(from 1- 27%) predicted an increase in blood pressure with a mean nocturnal blood pressure of 104±13/63±10. We further observed that borderline hypoxemia during the middle of the night(saturations below 95%) were predictive of blood pressure as measured during the night(p value .04). Conclusion: Pregnant women had relatively subtle breathing abnormalities as manifest by flow limitation and saturations below 95%. Based on nocturnal blood pressure measurements, we observed some predictive value of flow limitation as well as sub-clinical hypoxemia. These data suggest that subtle breathing abnormalities may be important in pregnant women. Further research is clearly required.

N2  - Introduction: The Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) are commonly used to screen for sleep apnea (SA). While these screening tests have a high sensitivity and specificity in non-pregnant individuals, these tools may not be as accurate during pregnancy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the BQ and ESS in screening for SA during pregnancy, and to determine whether a simpler screening method would be more accurate. Methods: High-risk women (women with chronic hypertension, pregestational diabetes, obesity, and/or a prior history of preeclampsia) were recruited to complete a sleep survey, comprised of the BQ and ESS, and to participate in an overnight sleep evaluation with the Watch- PAT100 (WP100), a wrist-mounted, ambulatory device designed to diagnose SA. The presence of SA was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥5. In addition to evaluating the BQ and ESS, we assessed the performance of a 2 question approach in which patients were considered to be screen positive if their pre-pregnancy BMI was ≥25 and they reported snoring. The performance of the BQ, ESS, and a two-question approach (BMI and snoring) were assessed through the use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Complete sleep survey and WP100 data was available for 86 women. Area under the curve (AUC) data from the ROC for the BQ, BQ+ESS and the two-question approach are shown in the Table. The two-question approach performed better than the BQ, the BQ+ESS combined, and performed better than the null hypothesis (AUC=0.5). The sensitivity and specificity of the BQ were 35% (95% CI 17%, 57%) and 69% (95% CI 55%, 79%), respectively. The two-question approach had a much better sensitivity 74% (95% CI 51%, 89%) without sacrificing much specificity 59% (95% CI 46%, 71%). Conclusion: Standard screening tools for SA are not adequate in pregnancy. A simpler approach, using pre-pregnancy BMI and self-reported snoring, yields better results. Further studies are needed to design and test the most appropriate screening tool for SA in pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep durations of more or less than 7-8 h in a 24-h period are associated with depression in the general population. Antepartum depression is associated with negative fetal/obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. However, little is known between sleep duration during pregnancy and antepartum depression. This study aimed to examine sleep duration during pregnancy and its effects on maternal mental well-being. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The study sample included pregnant women from states where optional modules of inadequate sleep was surveyed (n=214). The exposure was the self reported average sleep/24 hours. The outcome, maternal mental well-being, was the number of days women reported having poor mental health including depression during the past 30 days (0 days, < 10 days, ≥10 days). A logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Out study included pregnant women who were mostly White, married, college graduates with normal weight and a mean age of 31. The average sleep time pregnant women reported was 7.5 (SD=1.80) hours per 24 hours. In our study sample, the average days of reported poor mental health in the past 30 days was 2.5 days with 9% of women reported having 10 or more days of poor mental health in the past 30 days. Using sleep as a continuous measure, one hour increase in sleep/24 hours reduced the likelihood of having ≥10 days of poor mental health during pregnancy by 29% (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.96) after controlling for maternal age, BMI, and income level. Conclusion: Sleep duration during pregnancy may be associated with maternal mental health, even though the direction of effect is unclear. This finding could have clinical implications for intervention and prevention antepartum depression.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are common and associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. However, few studies have validated sleep questionnaires for use during pregnancy. Therefore, we aimed to assess the validity and reliability of Multivariable Apnea Prediction questionnaire (MAP), including four subscales (MAP1: apnea symptoms, MAP2: difficulty sleeping, MAP3: daytime sleepiness, MAP4: narcolepsy symptoms) for use during pregnancy. Methods: In first trimester 195 women and in third trimester 105 women completed MAP, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) which was previously validated in pregnancy (its subscales; PSQI1: sleep quality, PSQI2: sleep latency, PSQI3: sleep duration, PSQI4: sleep efficiency, PSQI5: sleep disturbance, PSQI6: daytime dysfunction) and Epworth Scale (ESS) and underwent full polysomnography. Concurrent validity of MAP was assessed with subjective and objective sleep measures, using a random-effects regression model, adjusted for trimesters. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal reliability. Results: The overall questionnaire had an acceptable internal consistency as measured by Cronbach's alpha reliability (0.70 in first and 0.77 in third trimester). MAP1 showed significant correlations with total-PSQI (β=0.55(SE=0.27); p=0.04), PSQI5 (β=0.27(0.05); p=0.001), apneahypopnea index (β=1.30(0.2); p=0.03) and borderline significance with ESS (β=0.65(0.4); p=0.07). MAP2 was significantly correlated with ESS (β=1.08(0.3); p=0.001), total-PSQI (β=1.41(0.2); p=0.001) and all PSQI subscales (β=0.1(0.05) to (β=0.3(0.04); all p≤0.01). MAP3 was significantly correlated with ESS (β=3.02(0.3), p=0.001), total- PSQI (β=0.71(0.3), p=0.001), PSQI5 (β=0.12(0.05); p=0.001), PSQI6 (β=0.40(0.06); p=0.001) and apnea-hypopnea index (β=10.01(3.6); p=0.001). MAP4 was significantly correlated with ESS (β=0.93(0.3); p=0.02), total-PSQI (β=1.11(0.4); p=0.001) and all PSQI subscales except for PSQI4 (β=0.19(0.09) to β=0.21(0.09); all p<0.04). Conclusion: The results showed moderate concurrent validity and internal consistency indicating that MAP is reasonably valid and reliable to measure sleep disturbances frequency during pregnancy. Further evaluation of the MAP, including factor analysis, is warranted.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring is common among pregnant women affecting up to 46% of women during the third trimester. Previous studies investigating the effect of maternal snoring on fetal growth have revealed conflicting results. Therefore, our objective was to examine the effect of maternal snoring on fetal growth. Methods: Women of singleton uncomplicated full-term pregnancies were recruited during labor. All participants together with their sleep partners completed a designated questionnaire that included information regarding BMI, age, smoking, medication use, pregnancy complications, snoring before and during the current pregnancy, sleep pauses and daytime sleepiness using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Subjects with frequent snoring (> 4 nights a week) were considered habitual snorers. Birth weights were obtained following delivery. Birth weights percentiles were calculated for gender and gestational age. Results: Two hundreds and fifty women were recruited. 49% of women reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Of those, 26% were chronic snorers (snored before pregnancy) and 74% were new-onset snorers (began to snore during the current pregnancy). There were no differences in maternal age (30.9±4.1 vs. 31.1±4.7 years), BMI at the beginning of the pregnancy (27.4±3.3 vs. 26.5±3.8 kg/m2) and maternal weight gain percentage (23.7±9.6 vs. 21.7±9.3%) between snorers and non snorers. No differences were found in gestational age (39.4±1.0 weeks vs. 39.3±1.1 weeks) between snorers and non snorers. No differences were found between neonates born to snorers and non-snorers in Apgar scores (Apgar 1: 8.9±0.4 vs. 9.0±0.5; Apgar 5: 9.9±0.3 vs. 9.9±0.4, respectively, p=NS) and in birth weight percentiles (59.2±24.6 vs. 60.3±25.2, respectively, p=NS). Conclusion: In this prospective cohort maternal snoring did not affect fetal growth.

N2  - Purpose: Identify sexual and urinary complaints in pregnant women and assess the impact of urinary incontinence in their quality of life. Relevance: Urinary dysfunctions, especially incontinence, as well as sexual complaints, may affect the quality of life and self-esteem during pregnancy. The physiotherapeutic treatment of the perineum should encompass its urinary containment and sexual functions, in addition to its role in the childbirth. Participants: The sample consisted of 45 pregnant women with a mean age of 25.3 years (SD±7.1), of which 64.4% considered themselves white. The average body mass index (BMI) of the sample before pregnancy was 22.7 kg/m2 (SD±5.06), with 14.0% of the women underweighted, 72.1% at the ideal weight, 7.0% were over weighted and 7.0% were obese. Methods: The women were interviewed to fill out a personal data and pregnancy evaluation form, the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and the Female Sexual Quotient (SQ-F) questionnaire. The KHQ is scored by domains. Scores range from zero to 100 and the higher the score the worse the quality of life related to that domain. The QS-F is a questionnaire with 10 questions that assesses domains of sexual activity (desire, arousal, orgasm and their psychophysical correlates). It presents an overall score ranging from 0 to 100, the greater the score the better the sexual performance/satisfaction. Analysis: The sample was characterized using descriptive statistics and data from the questionnaires was clustered in categories according to their proposed interpretation. Results: As for the pregnancy data, 48.9% of the pregnant women were in the first pregnancy, 33.3% were in the second, 6.7% in the third and 11.1% were in fourth or more pregnancies. Furthermore, 73.4% were in the third quarter of pregnancy, while 13.3% were in the second and another 13.3% in the first trimester. As for urinary symptoms, 20% experienced urinary incontinence, 22.3% urgency and 26.7% urge-incontinence. The domain scores evaluated by KHQ were: Health Perception 33.1±17.5; IU Impact 30.1±31.5; Physical Limitations 25.8±29.5; Social Limitations: 19.7±14.3; Personal Relationship 38.2±19.8; Emotion 6.5±9.6; Sleep and Energy 28.0±29.0; Severity Measures 31.7±21.5. As for the QS-F, 4.4% indicated “poor” to “weak” sexual performance, 17.8% “unfavorable” to “regular”, 35.6% “fair” to “good” and 42.2% believed their sexual performance ranged from “good” to “excellent”. Conclusions: In this study young pregnant women reported changes in their sexual performance, as well as complaints of urinary loss and urgency. The impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life was greater on the “Personal Relationship” and “Severity Measures” domains, reinforcing the perception of urinary loss as a serious issue that interferes with personal relationships. Implications: The identification of sexual and urinary symptoms in a young population has social and economic merit, as it allows the proposal of preventive and corrective measures to eliminate symptoms and to avoid further complications in the following stageswomen's life, such as the next pregnancy, menopause and aging. It is suggested that further studies be conducted with larger sample.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure causes significant structural and functional damage to the brain. Despite warnings to reduce alcohol abuse during pregnancy, prenatal alcohol exposure remains a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. The activity-dependent neuroprotective peptide NAPVSIPQ (NAP) has been shown to prevent alcohol-induced fetal teratogenesis, growth deficits, and postnatal behavioral impairments in a mouse model of heavy binge alcohol exposure via maternal intraperitoneal alcohol injection. The goal of the current study was to determine whether maternal consumption of an alcohol liquid diet alters behavior (locomotor activity and spatial learning) in adult offspring, and whether prenatal NAP co-administration improves behavioral outcomes. On gestational days 7-16, C57BL/6 dams were given either an ad lib chow diet, 4.8% (v/v) ethanol liquid diet, or were pair fed an isocaloric control diet. The adult offspring (∼90 days) were tested in an open field in daily 10- min sessions on two consecutive days. Locomotor activity was monitored with computerbased video tracking and the distance traveled and time spent in designated regions of the open field was measured. The mice were then given 10 consecutive days of training on a place-learning task in the Morris water maze (127-cm tank). Each daily training session consisted of four trials (3-min intertrial interval) in which the mouse was given up to 60 sec to swim to find a 9-cm diameter escape platform submerged in a designated location. Measures of acquisition learning, obtained via computer-based video tracking, included path lengths and latencies to reach the platform. On days 5 and 10, an additional 60-sec probe trial was given in which the platform was removed and the search pattern was quantified as the amount of time spent within 27 cm of the center of the target location. NAP treatment in the alcoholexposed group was associated with less total distance traveled in the open field. There were no alcohol treatment effects on place learning acquisition measures. The alcohol + NAP group showed increased time searching within the target location than the alcohol group not given NAP, consistent with improved spatial memory in the NAP-treated group. The control groups were not significantly affected by the NAP treatment. NAP treatments may improve some behavioral functions affected by prenatal alcohol exposure.

N2  - Introduction: In high income countries, stillbirth occurs in approximately one percent of pregnancies and rates have been static in recent decades. Modifi able risk factors need to be identifi ed so that strategies can be implemented to reduce this tragic pregnancy complication. Aim: To identify modifi able risk factors for late (greater or equal to 28 weeks' gestation) stillbirth, specifi cally we hypothesised that maternal sleep practices would be associated with third trimester stillbirth. Method: A case control study was conducted in Auckland, New Zealand July 2006-June 2009. Eligible participants were women who had a singleton late stillbirth without congenital abnormality. Two controls were randomly selected at the same gestation as each case. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounding factors. Results: 155 (72%) cases and 310 (72%) controls consented. Women with a late stillbirth were more likely to be overweight or obese, parity >3, Pacifi c ethnicity, live in the lowest decile area and smoke, on univariate analysis (p<0.05). After adjusting for BMI and demographic factors, maternal sleep position the night before the stillbirth/interview (not left side vs left side, adjusted OR=2.0 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3) was found to be an independent risk factor for late stillbirth, with a PAR of 37%. Conclusion: This is the fi rst study to report maternal sleep position as a risk factor for stillbirth. Further research is required to confi rm these fi ndings. If confi rmed, encouraging women to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy has the potential to reduce late stillbirth.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but methods to screen large numbers of pregnant women for SDB risk have not been studied adequately. A history of snoring is robustly associated with objectively assessed SDB in non-pregnant adults. We examined the extent to which this association can be demonstrated in pregnant women. Methods: Women were recruited from obstetric clinics during their last trimester of pregnancy to complete several sleep questionnaires. Habitual snoring (HS) was defined as snoring ≥3 nights/week. Participants also underwent full overnight home polysomnography using the MediPalm system. Polysomnograms were scored by an experienced technologist using AASM 2007 criteria. SDB was considered present if the apnea/ hypopnea index (AHI) was ≥5. Results: Thus far 27 pregnant women have been studied, 11 with HS and 16 controls without HS. Mean age was 29.8±6.0 years and mean BMI was 30.8±7.2 kg/m2. Total recorded sleep time was 341.3±91.5 mins and 347.6±107.0 mins in HS and controls respectively (p=0.87). The mean AHI in women with HS compared to those without was 10.3±12.1 vs. 3.6±3.6 (p<0.05) and nadir SpO2 was 89.5±3.9 vs. 91.5±2.7 (p=0.1). In total, 8 of 11 women (73%) with HS were found to have objective evidence of SDB, compared to 3 of 16 (19%) without HS (Chi square p=0.015). The sensitivity and specificity of the screening question (HS) for SDB was 0.73 and 0.81 respectively Conclusion: Our preliminary findings suggest that self-reported HS during pregnancy helps to predict the presence of objectively-defined SDB. This simple screening tool may be useful in research and, perhaps with a less stringent and more sensitive criterion for habitual snoring, in obstetric practices.

N2  - Introduction: The term sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) describes a group of disorders characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns or quality of ventilation during sleep, resulting in hypoxia and nocturnal arousals. In non-pregnant populations SDB has been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic morbidities and mortality. Few studies have examined the relationship between SBD in pregnancy and adverse obstetrical outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the association between SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO). Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Using ICD-9 codes, we queried our medical records database to find women who had a delivery as well as an in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG) done at our institution between January 2000 and June 2009. Charts of identified patients were reviewed and data regarding patient demographics, sleep study results, and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted. The first pregnancy with outcome information was selected for those with more than one pregnancy. The primary outcome was an APO composite compromised of: pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), gestational diabetes (GDM), and early preterm birth (ePTB, ≤34 week). Absence of SBD was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) of <5, mild to moderate SDB as an AHI of 5-14.9, and severe SDB as an AHI ≥15. Chi-square test for trend was used to assess the associations between SBD and APO. Results: 150 women who had undergone a PSG as well as a delivery were identified. 61% (91/150) were nulliparous at the time of their first documented delivery at our institution. 72% (108/152) had undergone PSG within 3 years of their delivery. 86.7% of the cohort was overweight or obese (BMI≥25) at delivery. APO by SDB category are presented in the table. SDB was associated with an increased risk of APO. Women with severe SDB had the highest incidence of APO. The increased prevalence of APO seen in women with SDB was principally driven by an increased incidence of GDM and ePTB. Conclusion: Pregnancies complicated by SDB are at increased risk for APO. Further prospective studies are needed to assess the independent impact of SDB on maternal and neonatal health.

N2  - Introduction: It is well known that sleep curtailment leads to neurobehavioral comorbities during pregnancy such as perinatal depression and maternal fatigue. However, the effects of sleep restriction over motherinfant relationship still warranted further investigation. This study assessed the effects of sleep restriction during pregnancy over maternal behavior and maternal aggression. Methods: Eighteen pregnant rats were distributed in 2 groups: 1) Control (n=9): not subjected to any manipulation during the gestation, and 2) Sleep restriction (n=9): submitted to sleep restriction during pregnancy through modified multiple platform method during 18h per day (from 04:00 PM to 10:00 AM). At post-partum day 5, female rats were submitted to behavioral tests to evaluation of maternal behavior. The tests were: 1) resident-intruder paradigm (introduction of a naive male rat in the home-cage of the female rat and its respective litter to behavioral observation), and 2) latency test (time to retrieve the first and eighth pup after 5 minutes of maternal separation). Results: At the resident-intruder paradigm, sleep-deprived dams displayed grooming in lower frequency and duration, and with higher latency when compared with control animals. Parameters related to maternal aggression and maternal behavior were equivalent between groups. Conclusion: Considering the maintenance of maternal behavioral, the inhibition of grooming seems to exert an adaptive mechanism, enabling sleep-restricted rats to display a proper parental behavior. These results corroborate previous theoretical framework by evidencing behavioral changes during lactation due to sleep disruption during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: This study aimed to analyze the impact of postpartum stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in quality of life of primiparous women. Background: Lower urinary tract symptoms, namely SUI, often appear for the first time during pregnancy and after delivery. Childbearing also gives rise to physical and emotional consequences, which largely affect primiparous women. However, the impact of stress urinary incontinence on quality of life in postpartum women is nearly unknown. Some authors (1) described a worsening of quality of life of postpartum women that could be due to other causes of morbidity that were not linked to SUI. Study design: A longitudinal cohort study including primigravid women was undertaken to evaluate the impact on quality of life of SUI 2 years after delivery. Women were invited to participate when they came to give birth to our hospital, although the ones in active phase of labour that were affected by the pain of uterine contractions were initially excluded. We also considered the following exclusion criteria: Multiple pregnancies, gestational age less than 37 weeks, and previous urogynecological surgery or malformations. Assessment of the impact of urinary symptoms on quality of life was evaluated with the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ). Data were collected at inclusion and 2 years after delivery. At inclusion women were prompted to complete the questionnaire considering their symptoms before pregnancy. The KHQ is a self-administrated and condition specific questionnaire that allows measuring the impact of urinary symptoms on quality of life. Spanish version of this questionnaire has been validated (2). This questionnaire is scored from “0”: not at all to “100”: a great deal. Statistical analyses were used for mean comparison (T-test paired). Results: We included 249 pregnant women who completed both pregestational and postpartum King's Health Questionnaire. Mean age was 31.2 years (range: 21-43) and mean BMI was 23.4 (range: 16.6- 40.8). From the total, 148 (59.4%) women had a spontaneous vaginal delivery, 68 (27.3%) women delivered by instrumental vaginal delivery and 33 (13.3%) women had a cesarean section. Stress urinary incontinence was reported by 80 (32.12%) women 2 years after first delivery. The results of the analysis of the impact of postpartum SUI on quality of life of primiparous women are shown in Table 1. We observed that 2 years after delivery women with SUI symptoms had an overall score of 10.2 in the KHQ, whereas the corresponding score before pregnancy was 3.1. The questions measuring general health and overall health related to urinary symptoms showed a higher score in postpartum period, indicating a clear worsening of quality of life after delivery. The worsening also included role limitations domain, physical limitations, social limitations and personal relationship domain besides of emotions and sleep domains. In summary, women with SUI had a lower quality of life 2 years after delivery in comparison with pregestational period. Conclusions: Women who suffer postpartum SUI had a worsening in their quality of life from pregestational period showed in all the domains of the KHQ questionnaire. (Table presented).

N2  - The misalignment between our internal timing system and the external world is usually associated with major health problems, such as an increased risk of cancer, or metabolic syndrome. Another important issue lies in the higher occurrence of subfecundity concerns in women working at night. However, the causal link between the biological clock ticking and the fine regulation of non-24 hour hormonal rhythms involved in reproduction remains puzzling.A number of studies have shown that the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is under circadian control. Indeed, both surgical ablation of the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus, or mutation of the molecular circadian clockwork, provoke irregular estrous cyclicity and absence of coordinated LH surge. However, the circadian system may also interfere with the female reproductive function through prolactin secretion, as suggested by shortened pseudo-pregnancy in homozygous Clock/Clock circadian mutants. We thus decided to address further the potential link between circadian timekeeping and the lactotroph axis.We first observed that pups nourished by circadian clock-deficient Cry1-/- Cry2-/- dams have a severely reduced body growth, although they manage to reach weaning. This prompted us to investigate the functionality of the lactotroph axis of lactating Cry1-/- Cry2-/- mice:- At the peripheral level, we noticed a dramatic atrophy of mammary glands from lactating Cry1-/- Cry2-/- females, as compare to controls. The histology of these glands revealed a nearly total absence of alveolar differentiation.- At the pituitary level, we identified figures of parapoptosis in PRL-containing cells within the gland of lactating Cry1-/- Cry2-/- mice, which might be related to an overproduction of dopamine.- At the hypothalamus level, we noticed that tubero-infundibular neurons (TIDA) that regulate prolactin secretion undergo a dramatic plasticity in control females from the virgin to lactating states, whereas this plasticity does not occur in Cry1-/- Cry2-/- mice, neither at the functional nor at the morphological levels.Altogether, these results provide the first evidence for impaired lactation in circadian clock mutant mice, and reveal that a functional circadian clockwork is required for undergoing the plasticity of the lactotroph properly.

N2  - Background: There is an increasing interest in the role of obstructive sleep apnoea in children and subsequent heath outcomes. There is some evidence relating preterm birth and childhood sleep apnoea. Aim: To investigate the relationship between perinatal risk factors and sleep apnoea in childhood using population health longitudinally linked data from NSW. Methods: All live births recorded in NSW between 2000 and 2004 were extracted from the Midwives data collection, and followed up to the age of 6 years for all NSW hospitalisations recorded in theAustralian PatientData Collection.Exclusions included those births identified with major congenital anomalies, any births with birthweight outliers, and any deaths in the first year of life. Birth weights were adjusted for sex and gestational age using national centile charts. Sleep apnoeawas identified using the (International Classification ofDiseases) ICD- 10 code G47.3 and the procedure codes for polysomnography and adenotonsillectomy. Results: We identified 4145 (1.0%) children with sleep apnoea diagnosed > 1 year old, mean follow-up was 5.03 years. Mean age at first diagnosiswas 3.6 years, 86%had adeno/tonsillectomy and 36%had polysomnography. After adjusting for gestational age, year of birth, baby's sex,maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, number of previous pregnancies, we found an increased risk for children to be diagnosed with sleep apnoea if they were born at < 32 weeks [Odds ratio (OR) 2.50; 95% CI 2.0, 3.2], or those born to mothers with any pregnancy hypertension [OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.1, 1.3], or those born by caesarean section [OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.1, 1.3]. There was no significant association between birthweight, adjusted for gestational age, and sleep apnoea. Conclusion: These results suggest that some perinatal factors are related to an increase in the risk of childhood sleep apnoea. Obstructive sleep apnoea in adults has been related to hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes and depression.

N2  - Introduction: Although gender specific changes in sleep have been widely examined during periods of significant hormonal change, such as puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, there is less known about gender differences in sleep quality that emerge during late adolescence, a tumultuous period of profound biopsychosocial change. Methods: 1125 students ages 18 - 24 from an urban Midwestern university completed an extensive online survey that included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Profile of Mood States, and other questions about health and behavior. Gender differences were compared with t-tests, and stepwise regression analyses to predict sleep quality were conducted separately for males and females. Results: Although there were no significant differences between genders in total sleep time or self-rated sleep quality, female students had higher levels of daytime sleepiness and fatigue, and reported more sleep disturbances due to nightmares, early morning awakening, and stress (for all cases, t = <-2.5, p < .01). In males, tension and morningnesseveningness were significant predictors of sleep quality, accounting for 25% of the variance in the PSQI score. In contrast, in females depression was the primary predictor of sleep quality, accounting for 21.5% of the variance in PSQI score, with the variables tension, morningnesseveningness, anger, and sleep schedule accounting for another 7%. Exercise, caffeine and alcohol use were not significant predictors of sleep quality in either sex. Conclusion: In general, college women show more stress and mood induced sleep disturbances than men do. Because insufficient and poor quality sleep exacerbate vulnerabilities in mood, anxiety and substance abuse disorders, all of which show gender differences in diagnoses, health care providers should work toward managing the psychological factors that disrupt sleep in young women.

N2  - Introduction: Circadian rhythm disturbances are frequently encountered among patients with bipolar disorder. In particular, circadian dysrhythmias have been observed within various physiological functions such as cortisol release and thermoregulation. Therapies that promote stability in circadian rhythms show promise with respect to affective stability, as demonstrated by reports that have utilized Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy. In addition, CLOCK gene polymorphisms are being increasingly recognized in bipolar disorder. The chronotype of an individual is indicative of his/her predilection for an “early bird” or “night owl” circadian preference, which correlates with physiological measures of circadian phase (core body temperature minimum). Previous studies have proposed that bipolar patients predominantly exhibit evening chronotypes, exemplified in part by a delayed sleep phase. We sought to further explore this contention. Methods: Adult inpatients with a well established diagnosis of Bipolar disorder (type I, II and NOS) were identified over a period of 1 month and recruited into our IRB approved study. Only those who were affectively stable enough to accurately complete the questionnaires were included. Pregnancy, active substance use, cognitive impairment and age <18 years were exclusion criteria. 10 consecutive inpatients were eligible for analyses. Chronotype preferences were assessed with the Horne-Ostberg Morningness- Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Higher MEQ scores (>58) correlate with morningness, and lower scores (<42) correlate with eveningness. Scores outside of these ranges indicate a neutral preference. Results: Out of 10 patients, 5 (50%) patients had scores <42 and 5 (50%) had scores between 42-58. Discussion: Our preliminary data demonstrate an absence of morning chronotypes and a 50% frequency of evening chronotypes. An evening chronotype may predispose to or be an accompanying feature of bipolar disorder. A morning chronotype may afford protection against the development of this condition. Future studies involving larger populations need to explore these relationships further. A more sophisticated understanding could lead to enhanced screening methods for bipolar disorder and, potentially, more refined circadian-based treatment interventions.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may be associated with gestational hypertension (GHTN), a leading cause of maternal morbidity. Both GHTN and SDB are more common in African-American women than Caucasians. Therefore, we hypothesized that an excess frequency of SDB in African-Americans may explain the higher prevalence of GHTN in this population. Methods: Third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from obstetric clinics and invited to complete several sleep questionnaires. Women who were normotensive at study entry were enrolled and high risk for SDB was defined as habitual snoring ≥3 nights/week. Diagnoses of GHTN/pre-eclampsia were obtained from medical records. Results: Among 1171 participants (mean age 29.6±5.6 years, mean BMI 26.1±8.6kg/m2), 194 (17%) were African-American, 241 (21%) had GHTN, and 403 (34%) had high SDB risk. The prevalence of GHTN was similar in African-Americans and Caucasians (23% vs. 20%, p=0.42), as was SDB risk (37.5% vs. 35.5%, p=0.14). SDB was more common in women with GHTN than in those without (48% vs. 34%, p<0.001). The prevalence of GHTN was greater in women with high SDB risk than in those without high risk (27% vs. 17%), and the odds ratio (OR) for GHTN and high SDB risk was 1.8. The OR for GHTN and SDB risk was higher in Caucasians than African-Americans (OR 1.9, vs. OR 1.4). In a logistic regression model including race, body mass index (BMI), age, and parity, SDB status was independently associated with GHTN (OR=1.3, 95%CI 1.01-1.75). Race was not independently associated with GHTN. Conclusion: A significant proportion of pregnant women are at risk for SDB regardless of racial background, and SDB risk is associated with GHTN. Nearly half of women with GHTN had high risk for SDB. Neither SDB risk nor GHTN were more common in African-Americans. These findings require confirmation by objective measures, but suggest that all pregnant women should be screened for SDB, especially in the setting of GHTN.

N2  - Introduction: Prior research has linked postpartum sleep duration and fragmentation to poor daytime outcomes. In the general population, sleep schedule variability and circadian shifting have also been linked to poor daytime functioning, but have not been investigated in postpartum women. This study investigates how postpartum women's sleep schedules vary, if women are more likely to extend their total sleep time by advancing their bedtime or delaying their final morning wake time, and if these behaviors increase total sleep time. Methods: Participants included 10 postpartum mothers (M = 23.1 years; 70% unmarried; 80% multiparous; 100% low SES) with a history of smoking who were participating in an intervention to remain smokefree. Actigraphic data corroborated by sleep diaries from postpartum weeks 1 and 7 were used to measure sleep onset/offset and nocturnal total sleep time. Standard deviations were used to measure variability of sleep start and end times. Results: Variability of sleep start time was negatively correlated with nocturnal total sleep time: (r = -.511, p = .025). Women were more likely to extend their total sleep time by waking after 8 am (53.3%) than by going to sleep before 11 pm (19.7%). Participants significantly increased their sleep duration by either going to sleep before 11 pm or waking after 8 am (M = 367.67 min, SD = 107.14) or by doing both (M = 520 min, SD = 82.45) as compared to women who did neither (M = 299.23 min, SD = 80.83): F (121) = 28.1, p < .001. Conclusion: This study documents late bedtimes (M = 12:02 am) and wake times (M = 8:17 am) for mothers in the first seven weeks postpartum, which may represent a shift from pre-pregnancy sleep schedules. Future studies should investigate a possible early postpartum circadian shift and whether poor daytime outcomes result from such a shift.

N2  - Introduction: Mild soft tissue enlargement is sometimes noted in late pregnancy, perhaps related to placental GH (pGH) production. We report a unique case in which excess pGH caused severe soft tissue enlargement with airway compromise, and was associated with hirsutism and marked hyperandrogenism. The soft tissue changes altered the management and course of pregnancy, and rapidly regressed after delivery.Case: A 30-year old woman, 27 weeks pregnant, presented with non-pitting soft tissue enlargement of hands, feet and facial features and progressive difficulty with breathing at night. Her tongue was enlarged and she noted increased facial hair. Six years prior, she had similar changes during pregnancy that resolved after delivery. Her renal, thyroid and cardiac function were normal. Laboratory tests showed low serum hGH of 0.07 ng/mL (N<0.5), markedly elevated IGF-1 >1600 ng/mL (N=100-500), IGF-BP3 8140 ng/mL (N=2878-9000), IGF-BP1 12 ng/mL (N=50-250), serum GH-binding protein 573 pmol/L (N=686-2019), testosterone 627 ng/dL (N=14-76) and DHEA 2.03 ng/mL (N=1.3-7.8). Her ovaries were enlarged (10 cm) with multiple thin-walled cysts, consistent with hyperreactio luteinalis. A sleep study showed obstructive sleep apnea and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) was initiated. At 29 weeks, pGH was 54 ng/mL (N<25).At 31 weeks, she had continued enlargement of her extremities and shortness of breath, despite use of CPAP. Lab results showed low hGH of 0.18 ng/mL, pGH 79.3 ng/mL, IGF-1 2163 ng/mL, IGF-BP3 11,200 ng/mL, placental lactogen 10.6 mcg/mL (N<12.8), testosterone 1030 ng/dL, SHBG 83 nmol/L (N=30-135), hCG 134,000 mIU/mL (N<50,000). Pituitary MRI was normal. Due to progression of airway obstruction, she had a cesarean section at 32 weeks with delivery of an unvirilized 3275-gram girl. After delivery, soft tissue swelling decreased and breathing improved. 7 days later pGH was <0.05 ng/mL and IGF-1 was 145 ng/mL. 21 days post-partum, serum testosterone was 20 ng/dL. Ultrasound 2 months post-partum showed normal ovaries with no cysts.Conclusion: We describe a new syndrome of gestational acromegaly due to abnormally high concentrations of pGH. In addition to soft tissue changes and airway obstruction, hirsutism and hyperandrogenism due to hyperreactio luteinalis was seen, possibly driven by elevated serum IGF-1 and hCG. Early cesarean section was needed to reverse this syndrome, which rapidly improved after delivery.

N2  - Objectives: To describe clinical characteristics of headache in patients with clinical and polysomnographic criteria of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) Background: OSAS is a disorder that affects young and older people. This syndrome has relationship with secondary headaches (10.1.3 Sleep apnoea headache according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders - ICHD II) and with primary headaches group in which it has been proposed as a factor that can facilitate chronification. Methods: 136 adult patients suspected of OSAS, were assessed through 12 hours polysomnography. Those with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) higher than 5 were selected and classified into headache and non-headache sufferers. Demographic and polysomnographic characteristics were determined in both groups, including Epworth score. Classification of headache patients was performed according to ICHD II determining also the prevalence of medication over use and morning headache. We excluded patients with abnormal neurological examination and those with suspicion of inmunosupresion or pregnancy. Results: 121 patients were analyzed, 64 males, mean age: 65(±15.4) and 57 females, mean age: 57(±14.9). 62.8% complained of headache with mean frequency: 12.8 (±10.1) days/month, in this group 48 patients were classified as follow: tension type headache 47.9%, migraine 45.8%, Primary stabbing headache 41.6%, Hypnic headache 2.1%, Trigeminal and other headaches of the group IV 0%. Morning headache was found in 56.3% with a mean duration of 2.6±1.3 h. Polysomnographic characteristics (O2 saturation, AHI, REM sleep percentage, sleep efficiency) did not show significant differences comparing headache and non-headache sufferers. In the multivariate analysis there was not correlation between headache and the same polysomnographic variables. Conclusions: In addition to morning headache, OSAS has a high prevalence of migraine, stabbing and tension type headache. No pathophysiologic correlation could be proposed based on the polysomnographic data found in this study.

N2  - Introduction: As part of an ongoing, multi-center longitudinal study we report here, initial findings on the correlation of prenatal beliefs about infant sleep with postnatal nighttime sleep practices, during the first 3 months after birth. Methods: From 10 Maternal and Child Hygiene hospitals in nine cities in China, 347 eligible women were enrolled in the study at approximately 34 weeks of pregnancy; after delivery 260 healthy, full-term infants met inclusion criteria and were enrolled as study subjects. Prior to delivery, all expectant mothers completed a questionnaire on attitudes towards four aspects of infant sleep: sleep location, sleep position, state of infant's consciousness at the time of being put to sleep, and dealing with nocturnal wakes. Following delivery, sleep diaries were administered over 3 consecutive nights starting at10 and 28 days and 2 and 3 months postnatally. The correlation of prenatal beliefs to postnatal infants' sleep practices was analyzed by Kappa consistency check. Results: On prenatal survey, 79% of women expressed a preference for the child to sleep in a separate crib in the same room with an adult and11% anticipated co-sleeping with the child. On post-natal survey, only 38% reported their child slept in an independent crib, whereas 57% reported co-sleeping (prenatal to post-natal kappa = 0.06). Regarding sleeping position, 55% preferred the supine position on prenatal survey and 36% preferred putting the infant on the side; postnatally, the respective proportions were 71% and 29% (kappa = 0.16). On when to put the child to sleep, 63% indicated this should happen when the child was drowsy but not yet asleep, whereas 31% indicated the infant should be fully asleep; postnatally, 31% were putting the child to sleep when drowsy, whereas 64% were waiting until he/she was fully asleep (kappa = 0.02). Regarding night awakenings, 65% of the prenatal sample stated they should wait a few minutes before taking action while 33% anticipated taking immediate action; postnatally, the proportions reversed with 76% taking immediate action and only 18 % waiting a few minutes before taking action (kappa = 0.00). Conclusion: With the one favorable exception of sleep position practices, we conclude that prenatal beliefs are poor predictors of postnatal sleep related practices and that opportunities exist for educational interventions to improve postnatal sleep practices among primiparous Chinese women.

N2  - Background: Tobacco , Women ,and Cancer: facts and figures of tobacco related diseases that is common among women Preamble: As early as 1939, Franz Hernan Muller, a German researcher had observed a relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Dr Morton Levin also made a similar observation eleven years later and published his findings in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). Despite these findings and that of other notable researchers such as Ernst Wynder and Evarts Graham, the tobacco industry continued to raise doubts about the methodology adopted in these works until the landmark work of Doll and Hill published in the British Medical Journal in 1954 which provided the evidence of a dose-response relationship between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. This prompted the setting up of an Advisory Committee and a full-scale investigation by the Surgeon General of the United States, Dr Luther Terry which culminated in the Surgeon-General's report on smoking and health published in 1964 stating that cigarette consumption is a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action. Methods: Cancer Smokers are at increased risk of developing cancer. Common cancers related to smoking include cancers of the mouth, throat, pharynx, larynx (voice box), oesophagus (food pipe), lungs, pancreas, kidney and cervix. Lung disease An estimated 85 per cent to 90 per cent of lung cancer is attributable to smoking. Smoking has also been known to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as emphysema, bronchitis and asthmatic bronchitis. Heart disease Smokers are at increased risk for both stroke and cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure and heart attack. Gastrointestinal disease There appears to be a link between smoking and the development of some stomach and digestive system disorders. Peptic ulcers (holes in the stomach or digestive tract) and Cohn's disease (inflammation of the digestive tract) tend to be more common among smokers than nonsmokers. Results: Effects on women's health Reproduction and fertility Smoking may have harmful effects on a woman's reproductive system and her ability to become pregnant. Women who smoke and use oral contraceptives (birth control pills) are at risk of developing serious cardiovascular side effects such as blood clots, heart attack or stroke. Smoking can lead to women having problems with becoming pregnant, and pregnant women who smoke are more likely than non-smokers to havea miscarriage or premature birth. Smoking may affect menstruation. Monthly periods can stop or be disrupted, and there is some evidence that smoking may destroy eggs in the ovaries, even in young women. Women who smoke are more likely to go through menopause early, meaning that their menstrual cycle, and therefore their ability to become pregnant, may end at an earlier age. Women who smoke are at increased risk of developing osteoporosis, a condition in which the bones become thin and weak. There is some evidence that women are more likely than men to develop lung cancer and other respiratory diseases after the same levels of exposure to cigarettes. Women who smoke are more likely to develop cervical cancer than women who do not smoke. Women who smoke are at increased risk of developing cataracts. Effects during pregnancy There is no known safe level of tobacco consumption. It is not clear whether a child's health problems are caused directly by a mother's use of tobacco during pregnancy or in combination with other factors including poor nutritional habits alcohol consumption using other drugs using more than one drug sleep problems a mother's general health prior to pregnancy genetics how much alcohol, tobacco or other drugs are consumed during pregnancy at what stage in the pregnancy a substance is consumed the length of time over which a substance is consumed The effects of tobacco use have been difficult to study because these other factors also affect pregnancy. However, it is safest to avoid alcohol, tobacco and other drugs during pregnancy. Nicotine and its metabolite, cotinine, are metabolized much more quickly by pregnant women than by nonpregnant women. This could mean that women who continue smoking into pregnancy may smoke more, thereby exposing the fetus to the dangerous health effects of tobacco more often. Effects on the fetus Carbon monoxide, nicotine and other chemicals in tobacco smoke enter the mother's bloodstream and pass into the baby's body. This affects the supply of food and oxygen a baby needs to grow. Therefore, a common effect of smoking during pregnancy is low birth weight of the infant. Having a small baby does not mean labour and delivery will be easier. On the contrary, a smaller baby is not strong enough to help in its delivery, making the labour more difficult. Low-birth-weight infants are also more likely to suffer health and developmental complications throughout life, including delayed speech, cerebral palsy, visual and hearing difficulties, learning disabilities and respiratory problems. Other increased risks for babies exposed to tobacco before birth include premature labour and delivery placenta abnormalities such as low-lying placenta or premature separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus; each of these conditions can be serious for both mother and baby increased risk of spontaneous abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth and early infant death increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, or crib death) Effects on breastfeeding The nicotine in tobacco transfers into breast milk. This may affect the way breast milk smells and tastes, and may decrease the amount of milk produced by a nursing mother. Although nursing mothers who use tobacco should not be deterred from breastfeeding, quitting tobacco (and therefore eliminating nicotine from the mother's breast milk) is best for both the baby and mother. Effects on child development Effects on long-term development Children exposed to tobacco before birth may experience the negative effects of that exposure for years after theyare born. Studies show that children are at increased risk for developmental and behavioural problems such as immature, aggressive, and oppositional or defiant behaviour inattention and impulsivity reduced lung functioning poor performance at school disruptive or impulsive behaviour depression and anxiety decreased motor, memory, language, creativity or reasoning skills developing alcohol or other drug problems as they get older Evidence suggests that children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy are at increased risk of developing tobacco dependence later in their lives. Also, the transition from initial to daily use of cigarettes was more rapid for women who were exposed prenatally to tobacco.There is also growing evidence that children whose fathers smoked before conception are at risk of developing childhood leukemia as a result of genetic damage caused by tobacco exposure.This risk is higher for children whose mothers also smoked before conception, and children who are also exposed to second-hand smoke after birth. Second-hand smoke Second-hand smoke contains higher levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide than inhaled cigarette smoke. Exposure to second-hand smoke, also called passive smoking, can cause problems during and after pregnancy Effects on women Women exposed to significant amounts of secondhand smoke during pregnancy are more likely to give birth to low-birth-weight babies. Women, even if they do not smoke, are at risk of developing lung cancer and coronary heart disease when exposed to second-hand smoke. Smokeless tobacco Mothers who use smokeless tobacco during pregnancy are at risk of pre-term delivery and decreased infant birth weight, even at full gestational age. There are indications that using smokeless tobacco is just as harmful to fetal health as cigarette smoking. Nicotine replacement therapy It is not yet known whether nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is safer for a fetus than tobacco exposure. Tobacco cessation as early as possible in a pregnancy is healthiest for both the mother and her fetus, but more research is needed to determine the effects of NRTs on an unborn child. Conclusion: Tobacco cessation Some people think that withdrawal from tobacco may be harmful to fetal health. However, quitting tobacco is healthiest for both the mother and infant, at any stage or time during pregnancy. Withdrawal is temporary; smoking, on the other hand, even just one cigarette a day, constantly exposes the mother and child to dangerous health risks. It is never too late to quit using tobacco products. Studies show that infants of women who quit smoking in the first trimester have weight and body measurements similar to those among infants of mothers who never smoked during pregnancy. The negative health effects that may be caused by using smokeless tobacco, smoking or being exposed to second-hand smoke eventually disappear after quitting tobacco or eliminating exposure to second-hand smoke.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common in the third trimester of pregnancy. In this case-control study, 22.5% of 211 women had RLS. The RLS cases had a history of growing pains (GP) more frequently than controls (P = 0.042). A family history of GP (P = 0.025) and RLS (P = 0.018) was more frequent among cases than controls. RLS in pregnancy is predicted by family history of RLS and GP, and by childhood history of GP. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Introduction: Postpartum depression (PPD) is experienced by up to 20% of women. Sleep difficulties are common in PPD and its treatment may improve both sleep and mood disturbances for childbearing women. In an open label pilot study, we evaluated the effects of cognitive- behavioral therapy for insomnia adapted for postpartum women (CBTI-PP) on sleep and mood. Methods: Six women with PDD (age = 27 ± 5, mean infant age = 33 ± 16 weeks) who also reported chronic insomnia participated in 5 weekly sessions of CBTI-PP. Three women received concurrent treatment for MDD (medication plus psychotherapy). Modifications to CBTI-PP, based on feedback obtained from focus groups of women with PPD, included: education regarding sleep and mood; addressing circadian factors related to caring for the infant; tips to help the infant sleep better; flexibility with sleep restriction; and ways to enlist support of their partner. Results: All participants completed 5 sessions of treatment. Paired-sample t-tests were used to evaluate pre- and post-treatment changes. Sleep diaries showed improvements in sleep efficiency (75 ± 9 to 91 ± 4, p = .004) and total wake time (98 ± 38 minutes to 37 ± 18 minutes, p = .008). Insomnia Severity Index score decreased from 18 ± 5 to 7 ± 3 (p = .008). Clinician-rated depression severity (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, excluding sleep items) declined from 17 ± 3 to 9 ± 4 (p = .03), and self-reported depression severity (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, excluding sleep items) declined from 13 ± 3 to 8 ± 4 (p = .048). Conclusion: In this small, open pilot intervention for insomnia in women with PPD, CBTI-PP was associated with improvements in subjective reports of sleep, insomnia severity, and mood. We are continuing to refine this treatment in anticipation of a larger, randomized controlled trial.

N2  - Introduction: In the general population, 15-20% of women report insomnia. Rates of insomnia documented in medical records of active duty servicewomen are higher (180 per 10,000) than rates for active duty servicemen (129 per 10,000). There is increasing emphasis on sleep complaints among active duty military, yet insomnia among women Veterans who receive VA healthcare has not been studied. Our objective was to estimate rates of insomnia among women receiving care within one VA healthcare system and to describe women Veterans with insomnia. Methods: A postal survey addressing all ICSD insomnia diagnostic criteria was sent to a random sample of 333 women veterans (mean age=49.4 years; range=23-95 years) who had received care at one VA medical center within the past 24 months. Women meeting diagnostic criteria for insomnia were compared to those who did not meet criteria on potentially important predictors of sleep disturbance. Results: 124 surveys (37%) were returned. Responders had more recent clinic visits (p=.003), but were similar in age (p=.94) vs. non-responders. 79% of responders reported difficulty with sleep quality (ICSD Criterion A); 86% reported adequate circumstances for sleep (ICSD Criterion B); 86% endorsed daytime consequences of poor sleep (ICSD Criterion C); 65% reported sleep problems lasting >3 months. 54% of respondents (20% of the total survey sample) met all diagnostic criteria for insomnia. Women with insomnia were more likely to take prescription and over-the counter medications for sleep (p's<.02), and were more likely to report sleep difficulties related to pain, menopausal symptoms, stress, and nightmares (p's<.03). There were no differences in age, time since last healthcare visit, shift work or pregnancy (p>.20) between those with vs. without insomnia. Conclusion: We found high rates of insomnia among women Veterans which appears unrelated to age, but may be related to comorbid psychiatric and medical issues including PTSD and pain. Further research is needed to establish national prevalence estimates and to identify effective treatments for women Veterans with insomnia.

N2  - Background: Widespread bed net distribution in Africa has the potential to significantly decrease malaria mortality and morbidity, especially for children and pregnant women. However, evidence suggests even in households possessing bed nets, there are barriers to proper use. Healthy Child Uganda (HCU) is a child health promotion program in southwest Uganda. Objectives: The primary objective was to compare bed net use patterns between HCU and control communities. A secondary objective was to examine associations between proper bed net use and demographic and socio-economic factors, malaria knowledge, recent febrile illness or treatment with anti-malarials. Design/Methods: Beginning in 2006, HCU trained volunteer community health workers in 175 intervention villages. These volunteers provided comprehensive health education, including about malaria and bed net use. In 2007 and 2008, a one-time bed net distribution provided nets to all intervention households with young children and pregnant women. In 2009, a household survey of mothers with children under two years old assessed bed net use in randomly selected villages (20 intervention, 19 control). Results: Six hundred and six intervention and 486 control mothers were surveyed, with no major demographic differences identified. A higher proportion of intervention households reported bed net possession (75.9% vs. 52.9%; OR=2.81, 95% CI=1.74-4.52, p<0.01) and had the bed net hanging (47.4% vs. 31.5%; OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.23-3.10, p<0.01). Of intervention households surveyed, only 34.0% had a properly hanging bed net without holes and 29.0% used a properly hanging bed net without holes the previous night for the youngest child. There were no significant associations between proper bed net use and any demographic or socio-economical factors considered, or malaria knowledge, recent febrile illness or treatment with anti- malarials. Conclusions: Bed net distribution and malaria education increased bed net possession and use. However, important barriers remain between bed net distribution, possession and 'proper' use. In addition to emphasizing the importance of possessing and hanging a bed net, education programs should target the need to hang nets properly, repair holes and ensure young children sleep beneath the nets to maximize the impact of bed nets on malaria morbidity and mortality.

N2  - Introduction: Consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (AE) include motor hyperactivity, disrupted sleep and cognitive deficits. Hypothalamic orexin (ORX)-synthesizing neurons are important for the maintenance of wakefulness and facilitate motor activity but may also contribute to anxiety disorders. We tested whether ORX plays a role in behavioral consequences of prenatal AE in a rat model. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rat pups received 2.625g/kg of alcohol intragastrically twice daily on postnatal days (PD)4-9, a developmental period equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy (AE group). Control pups were sham-intubated (S group). On PD12-14, rats received daily injection of either the ORX-1 receptor antagonist, SB-334867 (SB; 20mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (V). On PD16, they were subjected to the homing response (HR) test, an established measure of early learning. Nestseeking trials were repeated up to 10 times until HR acquisition was achieved (4 successful nest findings within 60s in 5 consecutive trials). On PD17, motor activity was monitored for 10min in a novel environment using infrared light beams. All SB/V injections and tests were conducted during the lights-off phase (8-12 PM). Results: The percentage of tests in which HR acquisition was not achieved, the shortest HR latency, and the number of trials needed to reach the shortest latency were all higher, whereas the percentage of successful trials was lower, in AE-V than in S-V rats (p=0.0009-0.03; N=12 and 13/group). In contrast, these measures were not significantly different between AE-SB and S-SB rats (N=13/group). Motor activity in AE-V rats (1003±97(SE) beam crossings) was higher than in S-V (578±85; p=0.003), S-SB (563±110; p=0.007) or AE-SB (654±105; p=0.02) rats (S-SB and AE-SB groups not different). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that motor hyperactivity and cognitive deficits following perinatal AE are secondary to increased ORX activity and that these symptoms may be alleviated by systemic antagonism of ORX-1 receptors.

N2  - Introduction: Our previous study presented a high prevalence of complaints of nocturnal awakening with headache (NAH) in women, 50-59 years old, in the population of São Paulo city (Brazil). Sleep disturbances are very frequent in menopausal transition and postmenopause. Headache is also a common symptom in women in this period. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the influence of the menopausal status in the complaint of NAH and the association with sleep disorders in the female population of this city. Methods: We used a population-based survey with a representative 3-stage cluster sample. All participants (N=1042) answered a sleep questionnaire and underwent polysomnographic recording. The women (N=576) had hormonal measures taken. They also filled out a gynecologic questionnaire in order to be classified in premenopause, perimenopause or postmenopause period. Perimenopausal (N=15) and pregnant (N=2) women were excluded from the sample. Results: The presence of NAH at least once a week in the population studied was 8.4%. Among the women evaluated (55.3% of the total sample), 12.9% (N=75) had NAH [OR (CI 95%): 4.5 (2.9-7.4) as compared to men]. Premenopausal women represented 63% of the female sample and 34% were in postmenopause. We found no significant difference in the prevalence of NAH in premenopausal or postmenopausal women (12.4% vs. 11.7%, respectively). Moreover, we found no complaint of NAH in postmenopausal women under hormone therapy or using isoflavone. Insomnia and nightmares were highly frequent in women with NAH, but the association with restless legs syndrome (RLS) was only observed in the premenopausal women who presented NAH. Conclusion: The frequent complaint of waking up during the night with headache in the population of São Paulo had a great predominance in women (four times higher) and was associated with insomnia, nightmares and RLS. We found no influence of the menopausal status, but interestingly no women in postmenopause under treatment complained about NAH.

N2  - Introduction: The upper airways exert an important influence on breathing. In addition to participating in fetal lung growth, in the successful transition towards air breathing at birth and in the maintenance of optimal lung ventilation thereafter, the larynx is also involved in swallowing and protection of the lower airways. Furthermore, neural immaturity in the newborn is often responsible for reflexes originating from the laryngeal region, the laryngeal chemoreflexes, which are inhibitory to cardiorespiratory function. This short review will use phylogenetic and ontogenetic background to introduce a few aspects of postnatal upper airway function related to apneas, laryngeal chemoreflexes and swallowing-breathing coordination. Phylogeny: upper airways and respiration: A pharyngeal pump and a laryngeal closing valve for initial airbreathing in vertebrates: Early lungfishes acquired the ability to use environmental air to fulfill their metabolic requirements more than 370 million years ago. As bimodal breathers, they were capable for the first time of ventilating a primitive lung intermittently, in addition to water breathing. The simultaneous appearance of a closing valve, the primitive larynx, was critical to this evolutionary step to protect the lungs from flooding during feeding and water breathing. Amphibians were the first to become dependent on air breathing. Air breathing was accomplished by filling the oral cavity with air through the nares by passive recoil of the pharyngeal wall, then forcing air into the lungs by pharyngeal muscle contraction and holding air in the lungs by laryngeal closure, much as the lungfish. With evolution, modern amphibians acquired a well-developed larynx homologous to those of higher vertebrates, with a cartilage skeleton and strong, paired dilator muscles in addition to muscles that close the glottal aperture [1]. Disappearance of pharyngeal pump mechanism for breathing with vertebrate evolution: A significant problem with the pharyngeal pump mechanism of filling the lungs is that tidal volume is constrained by the size of the pharynx. Evolution towards vertebrates with large bodies and small heads such as reptiles was only made possible by adding a thoracic aspiratory system, i.e., inspiratory thoracic muscles. Contraction of the latter, especially the diaphragm, has remained of crucial importance for lung breathing in mammals. Still, while the pharyngeal contraction phase has disappeared from the breathing cycle, active laryngeal closure remains prominent in today's vertebrates in certain conditions. Indeed, though absent in most adult terrestrial mammals, active post-inspiratory laryngeal closure remains a basic component of the breathing cycle in many lower vertebrates and in diving mammals, even on land [2]. In addition, active post-inspiratory laryngeal closure represents a mechanism of major importance for early postnatal breathing in terrestrial mammals (see below). Ontogeny: from fluid-filled airways to aerial breathing: While the nasal airway originates from invagination of the ectoderm, the skeleton and muscles of the mouth, pharynx and larynx develop from pharyngeal arches and clefts in the embryo. Following anatomical and functional development, the pharynx and larynx are actively engaged in swallowing and breathing movements in the fetus. Respiratory function of the larynx in fetal life: In the fetal mammal, the larynx is actively closed when fetal breathing movements are absent, reminiscent of the lungfish during diving. Fetal lung growth relies heavily on the high pressure present in the liquidfilled airways generated by this glottal closure, which opposes continuous secretion of lung liquid by the airway epithelium. In addition, coordinated contraction of pharyngeal/laryngeal dilator muscles and diaphragm is observed during bursts of fetal breathing movements [3]. However, these fetal breathing movements do not entrain amniotic liquid into the trachea. Indeed, when necessary, laryngeal constrictor muscles contract to defend the entrance of the trachea against influx of amniotic fluid filled with debris (lanugo, vernix caseosa) via reflex glottal closure. Such laryngeal chemoreflexes are due to laryngeal receptors sensitive to the lower chloride concentration of the amniotic fluid [4]. Finally, breathing-swallowing coordination develops in the fetus, allowing oral feeding around 35 weeks of gestation in the newborn infant born prematurely. Respiratory function of the upper airways at birth and in the early postnatal period: At birth, complete, active glottal closure throughout the very first expirations is vital for establishing an end-expiratory lung volume of air, i.e. the initial functional residual capacity. In the first hours and days after birth, an active post-inspiratory laryngeal closure is frequently observed. By decreasing lung emptying, this expiratory airflow braking mechanism defends functional residual capacity against low lung compliance present at that age [5]. The muscular pharyngeal tube, which is so important for glossopharyngeal respiration in amphibians, however does not retain any respiratory advantage in mammals after birth. On the contrary, its collapsible characteristics render phasic contraction of pharyngeal dilator muscles necessary just before diaphragm inspiratory contraction to prevent unwanted pharyngeal narrowing secondary to decreased intraluminal pressure [6]. Upper airways and apneas: Premature infants born before 27 weeks are virtually all affected by apneas of prematurity, which are responsible for bradycardia and desaturation and carry the potential of neurological sequelae. - Complete, active laryngeal closure during central apneas in the newborn. Our group has shown that complete, active glottal closure with maintenance of a high apneic lung volume throughout apneas was consistently noted during periodic breathing [7], as well as during most post-sigh apneas in preterm lambs. Such observations were concordant with previous reports in dog pups, newborn opossums and human newborns. Maintenance of a high lung volume during central apneas increases alveolar O2 stores and limits post-apneic arterial O2 desaturation [8]. Such active inspiratory breath-holding has phylogenetic and ontogenetic correlations (see above) and is not related to reflexes originating from laryngeal receptors, e.g., laryngeal chemoreflexes. Of note, while prominent in newborns, closure of the laryngeal valve during central apneas has also been observed in adult humans. - Passive pharyngeal collapse during central apneas. Loss of central respiratory drive induces passive pharyngeal narrowing during central apneas. Insufficient pharyngeal dilator muscle contraction at breathing resumption can cause pharyngeal closure, i.e., a mixed apnea. The latter is frequently seen in newborns, as well as in older children and adults with obstructive sleep disordered breathing. In fact, pharyngeal lumen size during breathing results from interaction between anatomical and neural mechanisms. Any anatomical imbalance between soft tissue volume (increased with macroglossia, peripharyngeal fat pads, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, . . . ) and bony enclosure size (decreased with microretrognathia, syndromic malformations, orthodontic anomalies, . . . ) favors pharyngeal closure. In addition, any neural imbalance between the collapsing force of inspiratory thoracic muscle contraction and dilating force of pharyngeal dilator muscles (decreased by prematurity, REM sleep, sedation, . . . ) favors pharyngeal closure [9]. Laryngeal chemoreflexes: Laryngeal chemoreflexes represent another prominent manifestation of the original, protective valve function of the vertebrate larynx. Laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are triggered by the contact between liquids - especially acid or with low chloride content - and receptors of the laryngeal mucosa in mammals. These lung protective reflexes consist primarily of swallowing, coughing and arousal in mature mammals, thus limiting larynx penetration and tracheal aspiration [4]. However, in the immature, newborn mammal, LCR are composed of both a vagal component, which includes laryngospasm, apnea, oxygen desaturation and bradycardia, and a sympathetic component, which includes systemic hypertension and redistribution of blood flow to vital organs [4]. Clinical relevance of LCR stems from the observation that they are often triggered by gastric reflux, bottle-feeding or oral intake of liquid medications in preterms. In addition, they can be responsible for apparent life-threatening events and probably some cases of sudden infant death syndrome [10]. Abnormal conditions, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection in young infants or laryngopharyngeal reflux during sleep in older children, exacerbate the potentially dangerous cardiorespiratory components of the LCR. Swallowing and breathing activity: the dangerous liaisons: The pharynx was involved in feeding long before the emergence of air breathing in lungfishes. With air breathing, however, breathing and swallowing became competing functions at the pharyngeal level. Swallowing activity involves the coordinated contraction of more than 25 pairs of upper airway muscles in a sequence designed and coordinated by the brainstem swallowing center. In addition, a precise swallowing-breathing coordination, which includes an obligatory respiratory pause, is a necessity to prevent both prolonged apnea and tracheal aspiration [11]. Thus, while forceful contraction of pharyngeal constrictor muscles propels the food bolus into the esophagus, the tensor and elevator veli palatini and the laryngeal constrictor muscles contract to prevent entry of food into the nasopharynx and the trachea respectively. In humans, phonation modifies upper airway anatomy and adds further complexity to breathing-swallowing interaction [1].

N2  - Introduction: There is evidence in the literature that OSA patients have impaired functional capacity compared to controls. Our previous study in lean subjects showed similar functional capacity in OSA and control groups. However, it is known that obesity may impair exercise performance. Therefore, the role of OSA and obesity in exercise capacity is still unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the exercise performance, blood and echocardiographic parameters in obese, sedentary OSA patients compared to matched controls. Methods: Fifty obese subjects (25 OSA patients) were selected from database of Sleep Institute of Sao Paulo city, Brazil. The control group was matched by age, gender and BMI. Inclusion criteria were: both gender, age between 35 and 65 years, BMI > 30 and < 40 Kg/m2 and sedentarism. Severe systemic disease, pulmonary or cardiac disease, smoking, pregnancy and patients receiving treatment for OSA were excluded. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, polysomnography, a maximum limited symptom cardiopulmonary exercise test 2D-transthoracic echocardiography, spirometry and blood withdraw. Satistical Analysis: One- Way ANOVA, Repeated measures ANOVA, Chi-Square; p≤0.05 Results: There were no differences in baseline characteristics between groups. The mean age were 48.6 ± 6.8 years in OSA patients and 48.7 ± 6.9 years in controls (p=0.9) As expected, there were statistical differences in the AHI (33.6 ± 24.4 events/h vs. 3.2 ± 1.4 events/h; p < 0.01), arousal index (25.6 ± 20.6 events/h vs. 11.7 ± 7.2 events/h; p < 0.01), minimal oxygen saturation (82.1 ± 8.7 % vs. 89.8 ± 3.1 %; p < 0.01), and saturation time below 90% (43.6 ± 85.9 min vs. 0.51 ± 0.9 min; p < 0.01) in the obese OSA patients and obese controls. There were no differences between obese OSA and control groups in the peak oxygen consumption (28.6 ± 10.0 ml/Kg/min vs. 25.9 ± 7.7 ml/Kg/min; p=0.3), anaerobic threshold (21.9 ± 6.9 ml/Kg/min vs. 19.9 ± 6.4 ml/Kg/min; p=0.4), respiratory exchange ratio (1.03 ± 0.2 vs. 1.03 ± 0.1; p=0.9), and, blood pressure and heart rate behavior. In a similar fashion, echocardiographic and blood samples variables were not different between groups. Conclusion: OSA did not significantly affect exercise cardio-respiratory function, and blood and echocardiographic parameters in obese patients.

N2  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a relatively rare, life-threatening, and lifelong multisystem disorder characterized by autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which mostly manifests as failure to maintain ventilatory homeostasis during sleep. Infants with CCHS have inadequate sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep and in some cases during wakefulness, leading to persistent apnea. This article reports a case of CCHS in a 38-week-gestation infant who presented on day of life 2 with persistent apnea. Diagnosis of primary pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, neurologic disease, or injury was excluded before the diagnosis of CCHS was made. The diagnosis was confirmed by a PHOX2B sequence analysis. A tracheotomy was performed and the infant was discharged home on a home ventilator with outpatient follow-up. The clinical presentation of CCHS, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies, is reviewed. Copyright © 2011 National Association of Neonatal Nurses.

N2  - Aims: The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends the car seat challenge (CSC) is performed when discharging babies of <37 weeks from neonatal units as they are at risk of apnoeas, bradycardias and desaturations when seated in infant car safety seats. This test is not routine in many units. We present the results of our 18-month experience. Methods: Babies <2.5 kg or <37 weeks gestation on discharge, or with underlying respiratory or neuromuscular problems undergo a CSC pre-discharge. Baseline observations are monitored lying flat in a cot (30-min) then seated in their car seat (60-min). Desaturation, bradycardias, apnoeas, sleep state, colour and respiratory effort are noted. Babies who fail are rechallenged after repositioning or treatment of the underlying problem. Results: Results: of 181 babies challenged over 18-months were retrospectively analysed for various variables including sex, and gestational age and weight at birth and testing. 4/181 (2.2%) failed the initial challenge and a further three (total 3.8%) only passed after removal of a chair cushion. All failures were male, birth-weight 1731-4202 g, gestation 31-40 weeks; age at testing 35-45 weeks; weight 2182-5045 g. One was on anti-reflux medication and another had a neuromuscular problem. All 4 babies passed after repositioning. Six babies discharged on home oxygen, and 13 on anti-reflux medication passed first time. Conclusion: The CSC, although time consuming, is well received by parents. Only a few babies failed initially. In our experience, it is useful in identifying babies who may have problems when in an upright position, allowing treatment prior to discharge.

N2  - Introduction and Aim of the Study: The aim of this observational-descriptive study is to assess, through the review of results, the efficiency of the treatment of urinary incontinence (UI) in women - stress incontinence, urge incontinence and mixed incontinence(stress and urge incontinence) - compared to the subjective perception of disability. Materials and Methods: A total of 170 women patients suffering from UI underwent a rehabilitation treatment in the period from August 1999 to January 2009. These patients were divided into three groups: 76 patients suffering from stress incontinence, 37 suffering from urge incontinence, and 57 with mixed stress/urge incontinence. The treatment included an informative group meeting, 10 Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) sessions and Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), where prescribed. All the patients were assessed through a pubococcygeus muscle test (PC test) and were given a Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) test to quantify the subjective perception of discomfort. The patientswere also asked to complete the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) to assess the quality of life before and after the end of treatment. The biweekly treatment sessions included 20 min of PFMT and, in all patientswith PC test = 0 at inclusion , 20min of FES. Graph Presented Inclusion criteria: women affected by UI that was not a consequence of another condition treated with conservative therapy. Exclusion criteria: dementia or non-compliance with the treatment, pace-maker, pregnancy, IUD. Results: The datawere gathered in tables broken down by type of incontinence and subsequently analyzed using the SPS Statistics program. The parameters under evaluation were the mean values and the standard deviations of the KHQ, of the VAS and of the PC Test. In stress incontinence cases, all the KHQ items showed an improvement (P-value = 0.000). In urge incontinence and in mixed incontinence, some of the items did not achieve significant results. The PC and VAS Tests for all three types of incontinence showed a significant improvement (P-value = 0.000). Interpretation of Results: In urge incontinence cases, there was an improvement in all the items of the KHQ (Pvalue = 0.000) with the exception of item no. 6 (personal relations - P-value = 0.170) and itemno. 8 (sleep and energy - Pvalue = 0.096) that were not significant, and of item no. 9 (severity level - P-value = 0,050) which reached a borderline value. In MIXED stress/urge incontinence cases, there was an improvement in all the KHQ items (P-value = 0.000), with the exception of itemno. 8 (sleep and energy) (P-value = 0.608). In stress incontinence cases, all the KHQ items showed an improvement (P-value = 0.000). The PC and VAS Tests for all three types of incontinence also showed an improvement (P-value = 0.000). Conclusions: These results lead to the conclusion that functional rehabilitation is an effective therapy in the treatment of urinary incontinence not resulting from other conditions, and in stress incontinence in particular.

N2  - Vitamin D deficiency is an emerging problem in children with recurrent wheezing. Aim of this study was the evaluation of the occurrence of vitamin D deficiency in preschool wheezing infants aged <3 years, in order to assess the relationship between vitamin D levels and respiratory function. 38 children (age range 5-27 months) with almost two wheezing episodes were studied with anamnestic questionnaire, lung function evaluation and serum vitamin D level (25-OH-D), PTH, calcium and phosphorus dosages. Respiratory function was evaluated by Tidal Breathing Flow Volume Loop analysis (TBFVL) during sleep, before and after 200 mg of salbutamol. The ratio between Peak Tidal Expiratory Flow Time and Expiratory Time (tPTEF/tE) and tidal volume (VT) were measured. 22/38 children (58%) had insufficient (<30 ng/ml) vitamin D levels and 10/22 (45%) showed levels <20 ng/ml. Our data showed a seasonal fluctuation in the levels of vitamin D: 19/22 children with insufficient values of vitamin D (86%) were evaluated during the fall/winter period; 3 (14%) during the spring; none during the summer. No statistically significant correlation was found between the type of lactation (breast milk or formula) and the levels of vitamin D. A statistically significant correlation was found between values of 25-OH-D and the use of vitamin supplements during pregnancy (p = 0.012). No correlation was found between the values of vitamin D and the tPTEF/tE, while a statistically significant correlation emerged between vitamin values D and tidal volume (TV) (5.87±1.34 ml/kg in patients with vitamin D <30 ng/ml vs 7.84±2.8 ml/kg in patients with vitamin D >30 ng/ml; p = 0.001). No correlation was found between post-bronchodilator positive response and vitamin D levels. This study shows that vitamin D levels are well correlated with tidal volume (VT) rather than tPTEF/tE, measure of airway obstruction.This may reflect how vitamin D is primarily involved in respiratory mechanics rather than in the pathogenesis of bronchial obstruction. The reduction of tidal volume may be the expression of a “rachitic lung”, with a respiratory function compromised by a pliable rib cage and muscle weakness. These data confirm that vitamin D plays an important role in the growth and development of the lung and in the acquisition of an adequate respiratory function.

N2  - Some say that being lesbian is 'clean and safe' from HIV/AIDS and STIs since only women who sleep with men or men who have sex with men are at risk from those. This myth is believed by most of lesbians and it leads to another misperception about HIV/AIDS and STIs. This study tries to describe sexual behavior among lesbians and how vulnerable they are to HIV/AIDS and STIs. Becoming a lesbian is considered 'trend' among young women in Legian Kuta, Bali. Some considered it 'contagious' when they shifted from heterosexual into lesbian due to peer-group influence. Some wanted to keep virginity and avoid pregnancy. While few admitted that they became lesbian since little. Lesbian sex is not so different from heterosexual sex, except no penis or dildo involved. The main tools are fingers and tongues. Some of them said that dildo feels hurt. While the rest said that dildo will ruin their virginity. Perception of having sex with fellow women is clean, makes these lesbians certain that they are safe. What they do not aware or do not know is that their partners sometimes engaged with men and practically makes both vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and STIs. Even if they are aware, most of lesbians do not want to go to doctor or gynecologist due to some reason, either shamed or afraid of being stigmatized because of their sexual preferences. This study shows that sexual health knowledge is mostly framed by myth and stigma due to lack of education and information.

N2  - In veterinary medicine, the characterization of a drug's pharmacokinetic properties is generally based upon data that are derived from studies that employ small groups of young healthy animals, often of a single breed. In Part I of the series, we focused on the potential influence of disease processes, stress, pregnancy and lactation on drug pharmacokinetics. In this Part II of the series, we consider other covariates, such as gender, heritable traits, age, body composition, and circadian rhythms. The impact of these factors with respect to predicting the relationship between dose and drug exposure characteristics within an animal population is illustrated through the use of Monte Carlo simulations. Ultimately, an appreciation of these potential influences will improve the prediction of situations when dose adjustments may be appropriate. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: Positional torticollis (PT) is a common pediatric condition, increasingly prevalent with parental adoption of “Back to Sleep” campaign guidelines. Parents are often instructed in a corrective program of home exercises. However, currently, few comprehensive tools with information about PT exercises exist. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a new Torticollis Intervention Booklet (TIB) on torticollis resolution, treatment adherence and satisfaction. Relevance: The evaluation of the TIB generates evidence regarding treatment options for torticollis clientele. Furthermore, it serves as a guide for less experienced physiotherapists. Participants: 50 infants referred for PT were recruited and randomized during their initial visit. The inclusion criteria were: age <6 months at initial visit, ≥37 weeks gestation at delivery, active or passive range of motion (ROM) limitation. Exclusion criteria were: congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) with fibrosis, craniosynostosis, APGAR scores <7 at 1 minute, and confirmed diagnosis of a syndrome or neurological condition. Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at the Montreal's Children Hospital (MCH) Physiotherapy Department over 18 months. Ethical approval was obtained from the MCH Institutional Review Board and recruitment was conducted on a voluntary basis. The infant's physiotherapist explained study procedures and obtained written consent. Patients were randomized to an experimental group (Physiotherapy + TIB) or a control group (Physiotherapy + Standard Exercise Sheet). Blinded evaluators assessed the infants 1 and 3 months after their initial visit, prior to their regular treatment session. Patients received standard physiotherapy treatment and verbal instructions delivered by the same therapists. Outcomes measured were ROM, motor development and satisfaction. Analysis: Intention to treat analysis was performed. Descriptive statistics were performed for each group. A repeated measures analysis of variance(ANOVA)was used to compare outcomes between groups. Results: The group of infants receiving the TIB showed greater passive rotation at 1 month (p = 0.046) but not at 3 months post initial visit (p = 0.331). Parents receiving the TIB reported greater satisfaction with the rehabilitation experience than those receiving standard care. Conclusions:Athorough and well illustrated booklet accompanying verbal instructions for home exercises in the treatment of positional torticollis leads to greater satisfaction with intervention and may lead to earlier restitution of ROM. Implications: Infants with PT are primarily treated by pediatric physiotherapists but a growing number receive physiotherapy interventions from less experienced physiotherapists working in settings traditionally devoted to adults with musculoskeletal problems. Our new TIB was designed to improve the standard of care and effectiveness of treatment for infants with PT both in our institution and in the surrounding community.

N2  - The purposes of this study were to explore postpartum stress and breast symptoms in postpar-tum breastfeeding of parturient mothers as well as to identify the factors influencing the breast symptoms in breastfeeding women after cesarean section delivery. A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A total of 162 breastfeeding women after cesarean section delivery were recruited from five hospitals in Taiwan. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data. The five highest postpartum stress comes from the flabby flesh of maternal belly, the baby getting sick suddenly, interrupted sleep, insufficient breast milk, and discomfort due to breast engorgement. The most two common breast symptoms in breastfeeding encountered by subjects in this study were breast engorgement and breast hardening, whereas the least common one was nipple bloody discharge. Cesarean section women with early suckling on the operating table had more breast symptoms in postpartum breastfeeding; and the higher the postpartum stress of them, the more the breast symptoms. Breastfeeding in a comfortable condition is a key factor of precipitating breast milk secretion, so early suckling on the operating table may result in discomfort and stress of the woman and interfere with the secretion or production of breast milk. Additionally, it is a crucial factor of the success in breastfeeding that the nursing personnel can provide women help in maintaining breast milk production and secretion, taking care of a baby, and reminding women's families (especially their husbands) of giving their assistance, encouragement and praises to relieve women's postpartum stress. © 2011 Korean Society of Nursing Science.

N2  - Background: Nowadays, rapid increasing in the world population is the most essential impediment of socioeconomic development in the country that shows the importance of attention to reproductive controlling and family planning. Vasectomy is a simple and effective method of contraception. No-scalpel vasectomy has been done since 2001 in Isfahan province. Due to lack of information about vasectomy, this study was conducted to assess the complication, satisfaction and failure rate of vasectomy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The samples were 188 men that had been done vasectomy in Ebnesina, mollahadi sabzevari, Navvab safavi and khaneh Isfahan health centers of Isfahan city in 2005. Vasectomy was done according to standard protocol by trainer doctor. In each center, samples (47 men) were selected by systematic random sampling. The questionnaires were completed by face to face or telephone interview and available data of completed forms at the time of vasectomy. Demographic characteristics and developed complication after vasectomy were asked. The questions of questionnaire were designed according to reported complication in the literature review. Data were analyzed by SPSS 15 software and descriptive statistics. Finding: The mean age of men was 37.82 ± 5.54 years. The most common reported complication was pain (6.9%). Other reported complications were: sexual dysfunction (2.1%), urinary problem (2.1%), allergic reaction to local anesthesia (1.6%), testis infection (0.5%) and renal stone (0.5%). Sleep disturbance and being repentant were reported in 2.1% and 0.5%, respectively. Vasectomy failure rate was zero and satisfaction rate was 94.7%. Conclusion: With attention to this point that reported complication was low and vasectomy failure rate was zero, it seems that technique of vasectomy has good quality. On the other hand, for decreasing the dissatisfaction rate due to occurring unwanted pregnancy and being repentant due to tendency to have child after vasectomy, good counseling before doing vasectomy is necessary.

N2  - Background: To achieve a child mortality reduction according to millennium development goal 4, it is necessary to considerably reduce neonatal mortality. We report stillbirth and early neonatal mortality risks as well as determinants of perinatal mortality in Eastern Uganda. Methods: A community-based prospective cohort study was conducted between 2006 and 2008. A total of 835 pregnant women were followed up for pregnancy outcome and survival of their children until 7 days after delivery. Mother's residence, age, parity, bed net use and whether delivery took place at home were included in multivariable regression analyses to identify risk factors for perinatal death. Results: The stillbirth risk was 19 per 1,000 pregnancies and the early neonatal death risk 22 per 1,000 live births. Overall, the perinatal mortality risk was 41 [95%CI: 27, 54] per 1,000 pregnancies. Of the deaths, 47% followed complicated deliveries and 24% preterm births. Perinatal mortality was 63/1,000 pregnancies among teenage mothers, 76/1,000 pregnancies among nulliparous women and 61/1,000 pregnancies among women delivering at home who, after controlling for potential confounders, had a 3.7 (95%CI: 1.8, 7.4) times higher perinatal mortality than women who gave birth in a health facility. This association was considerably stronger among nulliparous women [RR 8.0 (95%CI: 2.9, 21.6)] than among women with a previous live birth [RR 1.8 (95%CI: 0.7, 4.5)]. All perinatal deaths occurred among women who did not sleep under a mosquito net. Women living in urban slums had a higher risk of losing their babies than those in rural areas [RR: 2.7 (95%CI: 1.4, 5.3)]. Conclusion: Our findings strengthen arguments for ensuring that pregnant women have access to and use adequate delivery facilities and bed nets. © 2011 Nankabirwa et al.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women exposed to traffic pollution have an increased risk of negative birth outcomes. We aimed to investigate the size of this risk using a prospective cohort of 970 mothers and newborns in Logan, Queensland. Methods. We examined two measures of traffic: distance to nearest road and number of roads around the home. To examine the effect of distance we used the number of roads around the home in radii from 50 to 500 metres. We examined three road types: freeways, highways and main roads. Results: There were no associations with distance to road. A greater number of freeways and main roads around the home were associated with a shorter gestation time. There were no negative impacts on birth weight, birth length or head circumference after adjusting for gestation. The negative effects on gestation were largely due to main roads within 400 metres of the home. For every 10 extra main roads within 400 metres of the home, gestation time was reduced by 1.1% (95% CI: -1.7, -0.5; p-value = 0.001). Conclusions: Our results add weight to the association between exposure to traffic and reduced gestation time. This effect may be due to the chemical toxins in traffic pollutants, or because of disturbed sleep due to traffic noise. © 2011 Barnett et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) are neurological disorders characterized by abnormal legs movement in sleep. They cause an impaired quality of sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness in theirs developed forms. RLS has two forms, idiopathic and secondary related to other medical conditions such as iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Periodic limb movements occur in 80 % patients with RLS, they are characterized by stereotypic, periodic legs movement during sleep. The diagnosis is based on polysomnography or actigraphy. The dopaminergic therapy is the most efficient treatment of these diseases.

N2  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene and review of the clinical history. SIDS is one of the leading causes of infant mortality and occurs from the first month, until the first year of life for newborns and infants. The aim of this review was to identify and examine risk factors responsible for causing the sudden infant death and to propose certain measures in order to protect newborns and infants from sudden death. The potential factors that contribute to the occurrence of SIDS include inadequate prenatal care, low birth weight (<2499gr), premature infants, intrauterine growth delay, short interval between pregnancies and maternal substance use (tobacco, alcohol, opiates). Moreover, factors related to infant's sleep environment such as the prone or side sleeping position and thick coverlet increase the risk of sudden death in infants. Also, the combination of risk factors such as that of prone sleeping position and soft bed mattress are linked to a 20-fold increased risk of death. Finally, polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), viral respiratory infections, long Q-T (responsible for the presence of fatal arrhythmia) are related to the SIDS. Literature review indicates that each individual risk factor contributes to the appearance of SIDS and the establishment of certain protective measures for parents and health professionals has reduced its prevalence. But the precise identification of the SIDS causes and how these contribute to the occurrence of sudden death in neonates and infants, remains a challenge for health professionals.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder with a prevalence in Europe ranging from 5% to 10%. The disease is characterized by an imperative urge to move the legs associated with an unpleasant sensation in the lower limbs, typically occurring at rest in the evening and during the night. RLS can lead to disturbances of sleep and an impaired quality of life. It is diagnosed clinically by means of four internationally recognized criteria that summarize the main characteristics of the disorder. The disease exists in forms classified as idiopathic and secondary. Iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy are well established secondary causes of RLS. Several neurological disorders are also associated with RLS. Iron and dopamine play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. RLS is a complex genetic disorder, although no disease-causing gene has yet been identified. Dopaminergic therapy is currently the most effective treatment for this disease.

N2  - To investigate the effects of short-term sleep deprivation on the sleep pattern during pregnancy, cortical and hippocampal EEG and locomotor activity were recorded within 24-hours in a "disk-over-water" paradigm in 18 Wistar rats. Rats were adapted to experimental situation and were able to move across the rotating disk without falling in water. Then a polysomnogram was recorded for 3 sequential days in the control group 1 (n = 12) without disk rotation. On the next day non-pregnant rats (experimental group 1, n = 6) were subjected to the sleep deprivation procedure with a pre-set program of disk rotation from 11:00 to 14:00 during 3 sequential days. Other 6 rats (experimental group 2) were subjected to sleep deprivation on the 5-7th day of pregnancy. EEG and locomotor activity were also constantly recorded during the sleep deprivation procedure. In control group 2 (n = 6, without sleep deprivation), a polysomnogram was recorded on the 5-7th day of pregnancy. As compared to non-pregnant rats, sleep intensity of pregnant rats increased during the first hours after the deprivation, and a considerable rebound of REM sleep took place. Sleep pattern during the off-light 12 hours remained unchanged. The results suggest that homeostatic compensation of sleep deprivation effects in rats on the first week of pregnancy is more efficient than in control non-pregnant animals.

N2  - Background: Stable circadian rhythm is important for both maternal and fetal health. This retrospective analysis of women in a semiconductor factory evaluated the effect of shift work exposure on childbearing and birth weight. Methods: Records of 440 female employees (initial mean age: 28.4 years) including 111 mothers who had 158 live births during the period of observation (1997-2007) were reviewed. The data analyzed included maternal age, general health condition, highest educational level, life-style and occupational factors, as well as newborn gender, birth weight, birth order and gestational age. Results: The childbearing rates of female workers on three different work schedules (consistent daytime work (CDW), intermittent (i-) or persistent (p-) rotating shift works (RSW)) were 32.1%, 20.0% and 25.4%, respectively (P=0.047). After controlling for potential confounding factors, childbearing rates among women with CDW exceeded those of shift workers (odds ratio (OR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-3.0). The birth weights of newborns from mothers on the three work schedules (CDW, i-RSW and p-RSW) were significantly different (3271.7±395.4, 3251.3±460.9, and 2998.5±381.2 g, respectively (P<0.01). Newborns within the lightest birth weight quintile were significantly more likely to be born to mothers with exposure to p-RSW (OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.1-16.8). Conclusions: Rotating shift work exposure was significantly associated with decreased childbearing and lighter birth weight in women working in this semiconductor manufacturing factory. Work schedules should be carefully planned for female employees who are pregnant or preparing for pregnancy. Prenatal evaluations for mothers with persistent day-night rotating shift work exposures are especially necessary. © 2011 Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objective and background: Snoring is common among pregnant women and early reports suggest that it may bear a risk to the fetus. Increased fetal erythropoiesis manifested by elevated circulating nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs) has been found in complicated pregnancies involving fetal hypoxia. Both erythropoietin (EPO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mediate elevation of circulating nRBCs. The intermittent hypoxia and systemic inflammation elicited by sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) could affect fetal erythropoiesis during pregnancy. We hypothesized that maternal snoring will result in increased levels of fetal circulating nRBCs via increased concentrations of EPO, IL-6, or both. Methods: Women of singleton uncomplicated full-term pregnancies were recruited during labor and completed a designated questionnaire. Umbilical cord blood was collected immediately after birth and analyzed for nRBCs, plasma EPO and plasma IL-6 concentrations. Newborn data were retrieved from medical records. Results: One hundred and twenty-two women were recruited. Thirty-nine percent of women reported habitual snoring during pregnancy. Cord blood levels of circulating nRBCs, EPO and IL-6 were significantly elevated in habitual snorers compared with non-snorers (p=0.03, 0.005 and 0.01; respectively). No differences in maternal characteristics or newborn crude outcomes were found. Conclusions: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is associated with enhanced fetal erythropoiesis manifested by increased cord blood levels of nRBCs, EPO and IL-6. This provides preliminary evidence that maternal snoring is associated with subtle alterations in markers of fetal well being. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: The anatomical and physiological changes of pregnancy often result in many women experiencing abnormal sleep patterns during their pregnancies. Indeed, fatigue and insomnia are among the five most commonly reported symptoms of pregnancy. In situations where a patient fails to respond to standard sleep hygiene techniques, pharmacotherapy for the management of insomnia may need to be considered. Accepted pharmacologic therapy includes the use of benzodiazepines, Cyclopyrrolone derivative, and sedative antihistamine. Moreover, the sedative properties of tricyclic antidepressants have been used off-label for the treatment of insomnia. Many patients may also resort to self-treatment by purchasing over the counter herbal remedies containing melatonin or valerian root extracts. Objective: To review the safety of the above named medications for insomnia during pregnancy. Methods: Medline and Embase were searched for studies examining the fetal safety of the use of benzodiazepines, zopiclone, diphenhydramine/dimenhydrinate, tricyclic antidepressants, melatonin and valerian during pregnancy. Results: The use of benzodiazepines in the first trimester does not appear to increase the overall risk of malformations; however, case control studies suggest a twofold-increased risk of oral cleft. Zopiclone, tricyclic antidepressants, as well as the use of occasional sedative antihistamine do not appear to be teratogenic. Although the use melatonin and valerian have not been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, there are no adequate, well-controlled safety human data. Conclusions: When a pregnant patient fails to respond to the standard sleep hygiene techniques, occasional use of antihistamine for break-through sleep disturbances is acceptable. Zopiclone may also be used for sleep disorders in pregnant women. In situations where benzodiazepines are administered in first trimester, patients should be counselled on the potential increased risk of oral cleft. Tricyclic antidepressants, melatonin, and valerian are not considered first line therapy for the management of insomnia in pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Maternal cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) might lead to health benefits on perinatal outcomes (e.g., glucose tolerance, hypertension, fetal growth). Information on factors predictive of maternal CRF can be used for public health counselling. Objectives: To explore sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors predictive of fitness in pregnant women. Methods: Standard measures of CRF using a treadmill exercise (VO2 peak, blood pressure, heart rate) were assessed at 15-17 weeks of gestational age, as well as anthropometric measures (muscular strength, skin folds, weight, body mass index(BMI)), physical activity (PA) before and during pregnancy, sociodemographic characteristics, sleep and quality of life (QOL) in the month before the test. The relationship between predictors and CRF (VO2 peak) was addressed by univariate and multivariate linear regression. Results: 65 pregnant participants were included (29.9 ± 4.5 y., 32% overweight, 57% primipare). PA levels decreased from pre-pregnancy to the second trimester of pregnancy, especially in the area of sport and exercise activities, but 68% women reported to achieve >2.5 hrs/wk of sports/exercise of moderate intensity or greater in the month before the test. Women who exercised before pregnancy tended to exercise in the second trimester of pregnancy (r=0.60, p<.0001). Predictors of CRF in early second trimester of pregnancy included higher levels of sports and exercise before or during the month preceding the treadmill test, and lower maternal prepregnancy BMI, muscular strength, QOL physical score, and employment. Conclusions: This new information regarding the relationship between PA and CRF in early pregnancy will be used to determine their role on perinatal outcomes.

N2  - Objective: To determine the epidemiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnant Nigerian women. Background: The RLS is a common movement disorder characterised by an irresistible and distressing need or urge to move the leg. Despite the many decades since its first description, it is still poorly recognised. It is thought to be due to iron deficiency and seen in conditions such as diabetes with peripheral neuropathy.We present for the first time the epidemiology of RLS amongst pregnant women in south western Nigeria. Methods: The study was carried out in two participating antenatal clinics in south western Nigeria. Pregnant women who gave informed consent had a structured questionnaire administered on them. RLS was diagnosed according to the four basic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Diagnosis of definitive RLS was made if a study participant fulfilled all four criteria and probable RLS if three out of the four criteria were met. Iron levels were not determined. Results: Two hundred and fifty-nine pregnant women participated in the study with 105 being primigravida. None had symptoms of RLS prior to conception. The mean age was 30 years while the mean gestational age was 29 weeks. The frequency of definitive RLS was 5.4 % and that of probable RLS was 5.8 %. Of the women with definitive RLS, 57 % was in the third trimester of pregnancy and two- thirds of them had significant sleep interruption (p=0.00).. There was no correlation of the final diagnosis with maternal age, gestational age or parity with r being 0.006, 0.053, and 0.024, respectively. Conclusions: Restless legs syndrome is not uncommon in pregnancy. Definitive RLS has significant negative impact on sleep.

N2  - Background: Poor sleep quality, dysregulation of hormones and increased inflammatory cytokines are all associated with the risk for postpartum major depression (PPMD). We evaluated change over time in sleep quality and hormones during the first 17 weeks postpartum, as well as a single cytokine measure, and their association with PPMD recurrence. Methods: Participants were pregnant women (N = 56), with past histories of MDD/PPMD but not depressed in their current pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and blood samples were collected 8 times during the first 17 weeks postpartum. Estradiol, prolactin and cortisol, and a single measure of IL-6 were assayed. Recurrence was determined by two consecutive 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores ? 15 and clinician interview. Results: In the analyses of time to PPMD recurrence, poor sleep quality, but none of the hormones, was associated with PPMD recurrence (p < .05) after controlling for medication assignment. With every one point increase in PSQI scores across time, a woman's risk for recurrence increased by approximately 25% There was no significant association between PSQI scores and IL-6 concentrations in early postpartum (χ2 = 0.98, p = .32). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality across the first 17 weeks post-delivery increases the risk for recurrent PPMD among women with a history of MDD. Changes in the hormonal milieu were not associated with recurrence. Further exploration of the degree to which poor sleep contributes to hormonal and cytokine dysregulation and how they are involved in the pathophysiology of PPMD is warranted. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background/aim: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) affects 10-20% of women during pregnancy. Treatment options are very limited. Ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject®) is approved in Switzerland for treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. The objective of this openlabel non-controlled exploratory double centre study is to assess the effect of an infusion of Ferinject® in pregnant women with RLS and iron deficiency. Patients/Methods: Pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy with moderate-severe RLS (IRLS >20) with iron deficiency (Ferritin <35 μg/l) or anaemia (Hb <11 g/dl) can be included in this study. Depending on Hb, iron substitution is performed with an infusion of 500-900 mg of ferric carboxymaltose. Assessment of treatment effects is done by questionnaires (international RLS Study Group questionnaire (IRLS), fatigue severity scale, Epworth sleepiness scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index), blood tests (iron, ferritin, CRP) at the screening visit, 28 days after therapy, as well as 2 weeks and 6 weeks after ferric carboxymaltose delivery. Foot actigraphy is additionally performed 1 week before and 1 week after the treatment. Results: So far 10 patients were included. All but one patient reported from the first night following a marked decrease in RLS. Four weeks after treatment the RLS score was reduced from 25 ± 7 to 8 ± 5 (p < 0.01). A reduction in PLMS was also documented in 7 out of 10 patients (from 34 ± 22 to 25 ± 19) (p < 0.02). Ferritin levels increased from 17 ± 10 ug/l to 73 ± 25 μg/l. Ferric carboxymaltose was well tolerated without severe adverse. Conclusions: Preliminary results of this ongoing study suggest that infusion of ferric carboxymaltose is (rapidly) effective in improving moderate-severe RLS in pregnant women with iron deficiency or anaemia.

N2  - Purpose: In Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), nocturnal acid reflux is associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic sleep arousals, leading to disordered sleep. Acid reflux in patients without GERD but with various types of insomnia (restless legs syndrome (RLS), narcolepsy, periodic limb movement (PLM), idiopathic insomnia (IdI)) have not been reported. The purpose of the study is to quantify nocturnal acid and nonacid reflux in patients with sleep disorders as previously diagnosed during polysomnography. Methods: 31 patients were studied: (A) 9 patients with a polysomnographic diagnosed sleep disorder (RLS, PLM, narcolepsy), (B) 12 patients with IdI and unrevealing polysomnography and (C) 10 control patients without disturbed sleep. Patients with history of GERD, obstructive sleep apnea, pregnancy, hypnotic use, substance abuse, history of PPI or H2 blocker use, prior esophageal or gastric surgery, or esophageal stricture/ hiatus hernia were excluded. All patients underwent physical exam and 24 hour transnasal pH and impedance monitoring to detect acid and non-acid reflux. Non-parametric, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon test were used to analyze results. All data collected was compared to control patients. Results: Patients with disturbed sleep (IdI and polysomnographic diagnosed sleep disorder) had significant recumbent acid exposure (>1.2 % of time) as compared with control patients (33% versus 0%). When disturbed sleep patients were divided into two groups, 17% of IdI patients and 55% patients with a polysomnographic diagnosed sleep disorder had significant recumbent acid exposure. Thus, nocturnal reflux was most common in patients with diagnosed sleep disorders compared to controls (p=0.031).The mean nocturnal acid exposure time (percent) was significantly higher for patients with disturbed sleep as compared to control, 2.8 ± 1.0% (mean ± SEM) vs. 0.09± 0.1%, p=0.016. The mean number of recumbent acid reflux events was significantly higher for patients with disturbed sleep as compared to controls, 5.1 ± 1.4 vs. 0.4 ± 0.3, p=0.004. The mean number of recumbent nonacid reflux events was not significantly higher for patients with disturbed sleep as compared to controls, 2.7±0.9 vs 1.1±0.4, p=0.801. Conclusions: This study indicates that patients with disturbed sleep have prominent nocturnal acid reflux. Acid reflux is most increased in patients with polysomnographic findings of disturbed sleep as compared to patients with IdI; while non acid reflux is increased minimally in these patients. We suggest that acid reflux may be a cause or result of disturbed sleep and may be an important indication for acid suppression therapy.

N2  - The relationship between overweight/obesity and asthma remains unclear, even overweight/obesity has been associated with poor asthma control, increased healthcare utilization, and overall decreased quality of life. This study proposes increased risk of overweight/obesity with asthma and sleep disturbances in adults, independently of other known risk factors. Sleep disturbances due to wheezing are proposed as partial mediating those relationships. Research Design and Methods: The study is a cross-sectional analysis of a stratified multistage probability sample of adult civilian non-institutionalized individuals enrolled by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (CDC) from 2005 to 2008 in two cycles: 2005-2006 and 2007-2008. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy status at the time of data collection (due to possible changes in sleep physiology during pregnancy). Sample weights analyses used the Taylor Series Linearization approach and the assumption of nonrandom missing data. Weighted logistical regression modeling was performed to verify the relationship between overweight/obesity and asthma after adjusting for confounders. Setting: Computer assisted personal interviews in the participants' home using survey questionnaires, physician examination and laboratory components collected by 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 NHANES. Participants: 11791 adults (18 years and older) within a cohort of 20497 individuals. 874 participants were reporting as having current asthma. Results: Multivariate logistic regression models were adjusted for socio-economic characteristics including age, gender, race, income, education, marriage status, health related behavior risk factors including sedentary lifestyle, alcohol, caffeine, smoking, self-reported health status, depression, and for dry nocturnal cough. Both asthma [OR=1.5, 95% CI (1.2-1.8)] and insomnia with short habitual sleep time less than 7 hours [OR=1.4, 95%CI (1.1-1.8)] were significantly associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity. However, the significance of both described associations disappeared after adding “self-reported nocturnal wheezing disturbing the sleep in the last year”Poor controlled nocturnal wheezing may disturb the sleep quality and quantity, and partially mediate the relationship between overweight/obesity and asthma. Conclusion: Further longitudinal studies should address the role of poor sleep, including poor control wheezing and/or untreated insomnia as a potential mediator of the relationship between overweight/obesity and asthma in adults.

N2  - Our study wants to assess the relationship between Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). Methods used:we compare 580 pediatric patients with OSAS(346 M,234 F),who underwent a polysomnograpyc evaluation,and 1030 control children(537 M, 493 F) from the general population,whose parents were asked about the exposure to tobacco smoke with a questionnaire. Results of the study:exposure to secondhand smoke in the control population was equivalent to 17.1%,lower than the Italian average(equal to 27.6% between 0 and 14 years of age).In the population with OSAS we found:mild OSAS in 292 cases(50.3% of the total),moderate OSAS in 158(27.2%),severe OSAS in 130(22.4%). In OSAS children the minimum percentage of oxygen saturation was of 80+/-8,3% (80,1+/-8%in children not exposed,80+/-8,6%in exposed),an average percentage of oxygen saturation of 94,9+/-3,9%(94,7+/-4,3% in not exposed children,95+/-3,5 % in exposed ones);AHI of 10,8+/-9,7%(10,5+/-9,3 in not exposed,11,3+/-10,2 in exposed ones).We found no differences between polysomnographic parameters in children exposed to passive smoke and not exposed.OSAS subject exposed to passive smoke were 274(47,3%):severe OSAS were 31%(85),moderate OSAS were 23,4%(64) and mild OSAS were 45,6%(125). OSAS children not exposed to passive smoke were 52,7%(306 children) and in this group patients with severe OSAS were 17,3%(53),patients with moderate OSAS were 29%(89) and patients with mild OSAS were 52,9%(162).The percentage of children exposed to passive smoke was significantly increased among OSAS patients compared to the control population(p<0.001); moreover the exposed children had more severe forms of OSAS than non exposed(p = 0.06).For 65 children(23.6%)both parents were smokers,for 114(41,9%) the only smoker in the family was the father, while for 61 children(22.1%)was the mother. Only in 34 cases(12,4%of total)smokers were other members of the family.Smokers were used to smoke:on the balcony(74,2% of cases),in the home(16.1%),in the car(38,7%)and the number of cigarettes per day was 14. The 32.2% of children had also a mother who smoked during pregnancy(average of 12.8 cigarettes per day). Conclusion of the study:among OSAS patients the percentage of children exposed to passive smoke was significantly increased;in addition we calculated that the exposed children had more severe forms of OSAS than non exposed.Therefore passive smoke is a risk factor for the development of pediatric OSAS.

N2  - Aims: To document the effect of position on oxygen saturation and changes in oxygen requirement in convalescent preterm infants. Methods: Twelve infants born ≥24 and ≤32 weeks gestation, extubated and without congenital anomaly were studied using nap polysomnography in prone and supine, twice weekly until discharge. Mean oxygen saturation (SpO2), minimum SpO2, mean minimum SpO2 and time with SpO2 < 90% were measured in active sleep. Results: Eight male and four female infants [median gestation 28 (24-31) weeks and median birthweight 1059 (715-1840) g] had 39 studies. For 21 of 39 studies, the infant was on respiratory support. Four infants had chronic lung disease (CLD). SpO2 varied with postmenstrual age (PMA) (p = 0.003) but not with position (p = 0.36), and PMA did not influence the effect of position on SpO2 (p = 0.19). SpO 2 was lower for those with CLD (p < 0.0001) and those on respiratory support (p < 0.001), but there was no effect of position (p = 0.97 and p = 0.67, respectively). From 36 weeks PMA, a change to supine did not increase oxygen requirement. Conclusion: In preterm infants, PMA and residual respiratory disease have greater effects on oxygenation than position. A supine sleep position is not disadvantageous for preterm infants at discharge. © 2011 The Author(s)/Acta PA; Pædiatrica © 2011 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica.

N2  - Background: The physiological changes in peripartum may affect symptoms of depression. Second, the sharp fall in cortisol and CRH after childbirth suggests that the HPA axis characteristics of postpartum depression are different from melancholic depression which is characterized by high cortisol levels. Methods: A modified version of the SCID was used to assess symptoms of unspecified, melancholic and atypical depression in pregnancy and the postpartum. In a second study we investigated the diurnal output of saliva cortisol in women with symptoms of depression postnatally. Results: The antenatal symptom pattern (n=892 women) was different from the postnatal. The sensitivity of the symptoms ranged from 0.7% to 51.6%, and specificity from 61.3% to 99.1%. The best discriminating symptoms were motor retardation/agitation and concentration antenatally, and motor retardation/agitation, concentration and fatigue postnatally. In a subgroup of this sample (n=449) 17% of the cohort met SCID criteria for a depression at least once in pregnancy, melancholic depression (2.4%), atypical depression (4.4%), and non specified depression (10.2%). Mood reactivity, distinct quality of mood and sleep pattern discriminated between the two groups. Also, there was a significant difference in diurnal pattern of cortisol between postnatally depressed and non-depressed women regarding the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Conclusions: These findings suggest that perinatal depression has different associated symptoms from depression at other times. The cortisol pattern in the postnatally depressed women is similar to that reported for PTSD and atypical depression, and may reflect a response in vulnerable women to the marked cortisol withdrawal that occurs after delivery.

N2  - Objective: To assess (+) the frequency of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); and to identify (2) possible factors associated with RLS. Background: RLS is a common neurological movement disorder that is often seen in multiple sclerosis patients. However, the association between RLS and MS is still unclear and RLS is not considered as one of the MS symptoms. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted during January and April 2010. We enrolled a total of 205 patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, who underwent a medical history interview and a neurological examination. Demographic and clinical data was recorded. The diagnosis of RLS was based on the criteria defined by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Results: Of 205 MS patients (164 females, 41 males, mean age 32.86 8.9 years), Fifty-seven patients (27.8%) met the RLS diagnostic criteria. In 90.1% of the patients, the onset of RLS was simultaneous with or followed by MS onset. There was no significant difference between patients with RLS and those without RLS in respect of age, gender, disease duration, and MS pattern. There was an increased incidence of repeated jerking movements before sleep in the group of patients with RLS (P= 0.04). In patients suffering from RLS, there is greater complaint of insomnia (P= 0.03). Body mass index, history of anemia, excessive day-time somnolence, consuming caffeine containing beverages, pregnancy frequency, smoking, and alcohol consumption were not associated with the presence of RLS. Conclusions: There is a significant association between RLS and MS. RLS could be considered as one of the MS symptoms. This condition could affect sleep quality in patients with MS and it should be always checked in these patients to improve management of MS.

N2  - The classical phenotype of GLUT1DS is an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with microcephaly. Other presentations include cognitive impairment without epilepsy, movement disorders, alternating hemiparesis, paralysis, sleep disturbance, headaches, and early onset typical absences. We present a case characterised by five different paroxysmal disorders and learning difficulties. The child, now aged 15, presented at 20 months with global developmental delay. He had been delivered by emergency caesarean for fetal distress after an uncomplicated pregnancy. There were no neonatal complications. Aged 4 he developed typical absence seizures with ataxia, dysarthria and mild pyramidal signs. Later, myoclonic jerks, drop attacks and focal seizures developed. Aged 9 he developed prolonged episodes of confusion, ataxia and vomiting. Complicated migraine was diagnosed. Aged 12 there was deterioration in cognitive and motor abilities. Gait worsened with superimposed paroxysmal episodes which were at different times considered to be ataxic and choreoathetoid. Some attacks were exercise induced. Episodic ataxia type 2 and paroxysmal kinesogenic choreoathetosis were considered. He also developed migraine-like headaches. Extensive investigations, including testing for mutations in CACNA1A were negative. However, fasting CSF:blood glucose ratio was 0.44 and he was subsequently found to be heterozygous for a mutation in intron 5 of SLC2A1. He was started on the ketogenic diet but with little improvement. This case illustrates and enlarges the spectrum of paroxysmal movement disorders which can occur in patients with GLUD1DS. A video will be shown illustrating the child's gait problems and the paroxysmal movement disorder.

N2  - Background: Congenital disorders of glycosilation (CDG) syndromes are genetic diseases due to defects in the synthesis of glycans and in the attachment of glycans to lipids and proteins. Amongst the 42 already described subtypes, RFT1- CDG is classified in the group of CDG-I syndromes and is related to impaired assembly of the N-glycosilation pathway. RTF1-CDG is very rare (six cases reported so far) and always associated with deafness while epilepsy seem to be frequent. The goal of our presentation is to characterize the epileptic syndrome in a new case of RTF1-CDG. Case report: This girl is first child of unrelated Moroccan parents. Pregnancy was characterized by polyhydramnios. She was born at term with generalized edema, axial hypotonia, hypertonia of neck extensors and finger flexors, abnormal eye movements, and brisk patellar reflexes. Brain MRI, EEG, cardiac and abdominal echography were normal but auditory evoked potentials were absent and sialotransferrins electrophoresis was compatible with CDG-I. Because of the presence of deafness, direct sequencing of the RFT1 gene was performed and showed a homozygote mutation p.K152E (c.454A>G). At 3 months, daily seizures occurred. On video- EEG background activity was disorganized and discontinuous in slow sleep, and abundant paroxysmal activity was present. Seizures consisted of sudden tonic contractions of the arms and trunk with associated to paroxysmal fast activity on EEG, corresponding to tonic seizures. Seizures resisted to valproate but were controlled by vigabatrin. Conclusions: This case showed that RFT1-CDG syndrome should be considered in the presence of tonic seizures in infants with congenital hypotonia, developmental delay and deafness.

N2  - Background. Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A (MoCD) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder that is fatal early in life. Affected infants develop irreversible and progressive cerebral damage following toxic sulfite deposition in the brain. Recently, successful treatment of an infant with MoCD Type A with intravenous application of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) has been reported (Veldman A et al., Pediatrics 2010). Here, we present a further case of successfully treated MoCD. Amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) recordings from the first three weeks of life demonstrate pathologic electric pattern development corresponding to the onset of clinical symptoms and their resolution as an effect of early cPMP therapy. Case. The female infant was born to consanguineous healthy parents after uneventful pregnancy with a gestational age of 38 weeks, birth weight 3925 g (75.-90. percentile), and head circumference 37 cm (90.-95. percentile). Postnatal adaptation was uncomplicated (APGAR 9/10/10). Because of myoclonic and jerky movements and deterioration of sucking and drinking with onset at the age of 20 h, she was admitted to the neonatal unit. MoCD was suspected as urine-dipstick was positive for sulfite, and uric acid was abnormally low in plasma. MoCD TypeA was confirmed by increased concentrations of urinary xanthine and S-sulfocysteine, and missing excretion of precursor Z in urine. Mutation analysis confirmed homozygosity for p.R343X in MOCS1. Intravenous Substitution of cPMP was started on day 4 and resulted in negative sulfite dip sticks, normal uric acid values in plasma, and a significant decrease of urinary xanthine and S-sulfocysteine concentrations two days later. At admission, aEEG was only slightly abnormal with lower amplitude values and absent sleep-wake-cycling. Seizure activity was clearly detected a few hours after admission and rapidly progressed to status epilepticus on day 2 and 3. The background pattern rapidly deteriorated into burst suppression pattern at the end of day 2. Seizures were initially treated with phenobarbitone combined with midazolam and fosphenytoin, but persisted when levetiracetam was given. Improvement of aEEG pattern was first noted by longer duration of bursts two days after first cPMP-supplementation. After 5 days of therapy predominant aEEG patterns were continuous and discontinuous normal voltage with incomplete sleep-wake-cycling. This pattern persisted until discharge from hospital at the age of three weeks. Conclusion. Neonatal encephalopathy in MoCD is mirrored by changes of aEEG beginning with near-normal patterns at the onset of clinical symptoms advancing to burst suppression pattern with status epilepticus within hours to a few days. Successful treatment of MoCD with cPMP is reflected by a subtotal normalization of aEEG findings.

N2  - Rationale: This study aimed to verify the possible correlation of respiratory events of asthmatic children with individual and ambient pollutants exposure, sampled using passive method. Methods: Legal guardians for the children (5- to 10-years old) had signed the consent form and had answered questionnaires on demographic, clinical, antecedent data, home environment, and exposure to atmospheric pollutants. The prevalence of respiratory problems was accessed by pediatricians through spirometry measurements. For the sampling of pollutants, filters were exposed during three months in winter in 70 houses, located near primary care units, in Butantan, SP. Children inhabiting these houses also carried filters attached to their backpacks to and from the local school. After exposure, filters employed as markers of NO2 and photochemical O3 were analyzed by spectrophotometry and reflectance, respectively. Results: 64 children were enrolled in the analysis: 27% were diagnosed with asthma, 38% with bronchitis, 50% with current asthma, 33% with pneumonia, 67% had wheezing in the first 12 months of life, and among them: 56% had sleep disturbance, 83% were absent from school due to wheezing, 77% were medicated for wheezing, and 13% had maternal asthma. During the period of this study, 52% of the children were seen in the emergency room, and 13% required hospitalization. The questionnaires revealed that 15% of the children cohabited with smokers at home, 16% had mothers who were currently smokers, 10% of the mothers smoked during pregnancy, and 11% smoked during the first year of the children's life. In a preliminary analysis, pollutant concentration correlated with clinical data obtained on the questionnaires: O3 measured in the filter backpacks was correlated with bronchitis and pneumonia, and indoor O3 and NO2 was correlated with wheezing. The statistical analysis also showed that increased indoors exposure to NO2 was associated with wheezing at least once during their lives (p=0.007), diagnosis of asthma (p=0.008), diagnosis of bronchitis (p=0.003), current asthma (p=0.001), and emergency room attendance due to wheezing (p=0.001). Increased exposure to O3, as detected by the filters in the children's backpacks, was associated with diagnosis of asthma (p=0.043), diagnosis of bronchitis (p=0.05), diagnosis of pneumonia (p=0.043), and wheezing at least once during their lives p=0.001. Conclusion: We concluded that the exposure to NO2 and O3 levels during the winter in São Paulo is an important risk factor in children's respiratory events, and that the passive sampling was a reliable method for children and ambient pollution exposure monitoring.

N2  - LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 1. Recognize hereditary angioedema (HAE) as a cause of recurrent abdominal pain. 2. Review the pathophysiology and treatment of HAE. CASE INFORMATION: A 58-year-old white male with obstructive sleep apnea and recurrent abdominal pain for 2 years presented with 2 days of severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain of sudden onset with nausea and decreased oral intake. He denied fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. Physical exam revealed heart rate of 100 s and diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. His WBC was 26,300 with 82.1% neutrophils and hemoglobin was 20.9 (from baseline 16.5); LFTs were normal. CT abdomen showed ascites, a normal liver, mesenteric fat stranding most prominent in the left abdomen, and a single loop of jejunum dilated at 3.5 cm without bowel wall thickening. The final report was consistent with viral gastroenteritis, although the ascites was of uncertain etiology. He was admitted with the diagnosis of gastroenteritis. Upon further questioning, patient reported a history of recurrent, transient swelling in his arms, face, and throat starting in adolescence. He was diagnosed with hereditary angioedema nine months prior to admission and took danazol for three months, but then did not refill his medication. At time of diagnosis of HAE, labs showed C1 esterase inhibitor of 14 mg/dL (normal range 21-39); C1 inhibitor function of none detected (normal >67%); and C4 of 8.92 mg/dL (normal 16-38). His father had also suffered from undiagnosed swelling episodes. The patient had two recent admissions for abdominal pain, and a CT at that time revealed small bowel thickening and dilatation. EGD and colonoscopy were non-diagnostic. With these data, he was diagnosed with abdominal attack from HAE resulting in hemoconcentration and ascites. His symptoms rapidly resolved with only supportive care, as well as WBC down to 13.2 and hgb to 15.9. He was restarted on danazol by the allergy and immunology clinic; he has had no subsequent admissions for abdominal pain. IMPLICATIONS/DISCUSSION: HAE is a rare autosomal dominant disease, with an incidence estimated from 1/10,000-1/150,000. Type I HAE accounts for 80-85% of cases and is associated with decreased production of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), as in our patient. C1-INH is important for regulating auto-activation of complement; in its absence, the complement cascade and bradykinin production can be triggered by minor trauma or stress, producing transient angioedema of the skin, limbs, GI tract, or airway. Symptoms typically present in the second decade of life. Abdominal pain can occur in 70-80% of patients with HAE; symptoms typically resolve in 24-48 hours. Case reports with CT and ultrasound imaging during acute abdominal attacks demonstrated transient ascites with bowel edema and dilatation. Hemoconcentration, leukocytosis, and even hypovolemic shock can occur. C1-INH concentrate is now available in the US for treatment of acute HAE attacks; up to 96% of patients with an attack have symptom relief within 4 hours of administration. For long-term prophylaxis of attacks, attenuated androgens such as danazol are effective, but are contraindicated in patients with prostate cancer, as well as pregnant or lactating patients; C1-INH concentrate is also indicated for prophylaxis. Abdominal HAE should be included in the differential of recurrent abdominal pain, especially with CT findings of unexplained ascites and nonspecific bowel dilatation. Making the correct diagnosis is key, as patients have undergone unnecessary abdominal surgery for HAE attacks.

N2  - Background: To report the clinical and radiological features in a case diagnosed with rhombenencephalosynapsis (RS) and subsequently GLHS. GLHS or cerebellotrigeminal-dermal dysplasia is a rare neurocutaneous syndrome characterised by a triad of RS, parietal alopecia and trigeminal anaesthesia. Neurological features include developmental delay, stereoptypies, truncal ataxia and corneal opacities. Case: Our case a male infant was born at 38 weeks gestation and was identified to have developmental delay, plagiocephaly and dysmorphic features in infancy. He was showing frequent stereotypies including hand movements and head shaking. At 2 years of age he had 2 generalised tonic-clonic seizures and had a history of frequent daily episodes of 'behavioural arrest'. Neurological examination showed progressive microcephaly, truncal ataxia, generalised hypotonia and hyperlaxity. He has alopecia of the left parietal region and epidermal naevus. A MRI brain showed absence of cerebellar vermis with fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres and the dentate nuclei, consistent with a diagnosis of RS. A genetics review confirmed the diagnosis of GLHS. On array CGH a deletion in short arm of chromosome 2 was found also found in mother, hence thought to be a copy number variant. At 4 years of age he is making progress but continues to have significant developmental delay especially speech delay, some sleep disturbance and continues to have episodes of behaviour arrest. Conclusion: GLHS is a recognisable rare syndrome, to be included in the differential diagnosis of RS or neonatal parietal alopecia, both a consistent finding in all cases with this syndrome.

N2  - Background: Mega corpus callosum with polymicrogyria and psychomotor retardation is a rare cerebral malformation syndrome. It can be associated with megalencephaly and other dysmorphic features. Aim of the study: To describe a case with enlarged corpus callosum, polymicrogyria, abnormal neurological findings, epilepsy, delayed development and mental retardation. Methods: Brain MRI, EEG, screening for inborn error of metabolism, routine chromosomal analysis and neuropsychological testing were performed by conventional methods. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH, Agilent Array-CGH 244K) was also carried out. Results and Conclusion: The patient, a boy was 10 years old at the time of the diagnosis. Pregnancy, labour and delivery were uneventful. His development was delayed. Several secondarily generalized seizures with onset on the left side were observed. On examination a few dysmorphic features, however no cutaneous manifestations were observed. His head circumference percentile was 75<98. He was mentally retarded and showed typical signs of suprabulbar paresis and left spastic hemiparesis. MRI revealed an enlarged corpus callosum and bilateral polymicrogyria, more pronounced on the right side. EEG showed epileptiform discharges over the right hemisphere during sleep. Inborn error of metabolism, chromosomal abnormality or abnormal segmental genomic copy number variation by aCGH were not found. Our patient might have the syndrome delineated recently with mega corpus callosum, polymicrogyria, psychomotor retardation, and with or without megalencephaly.

N2  - Restrictions after 131I therapy are outlined in the Guidance Notes. However there is little guidance on modifying restrictions, or calculating work or travel restrictions. We have written three dose calculators for sleep, travel, and work and home restrictions with corresponding website. The calculators (JAVA) are designed for ease- of-use but have flexibility and provide detailed daily doses if required (e.g. teaching/training). Our calculators for sleeping and travel restrictions are based on published measured data. Two general calculators currently available are based on dose-rate models only, which can be conservative. Also, one has fixed median dose-rates and the other is very complex. For sleeping restrictions, the Guidance Notes (based on measured data) state 4 days restriction (for 600 MBq) whereas dose-rate models give 10 days. Travel restrictions in Guidance Notes are also based on measured data, but only cover travel home, not e.g. holiday travel. Our third calculator does give dose-rate models, mainly for work/home restrictions. It is designed to have simple model entry with photo-aids. These calculators are available to run or download on the website (TBA). The website has two separate sections designed specifically for patients and for professionals, and fully explains all restrictions and doses (pregnancy, breastfeeding etc) and calculators.

N2  - Female infertility is a common problem and the GP should be able to elucidate potential causes by efficient history taking and performing initial investigations as appropriate. Key lifestyle issues such as obesity should be addressed and the patient informed about the impact of such issues on fertility and pregnancy. GPs have the privilege of regular patient review and rapport and can use their position to remind women, once every so often, of their biological clock. It is prudent for the GP to refer an infertile couple to an infertility specialist early to maximise the couple's chance of conception.

N2  - Despite association with lung growth and long-term respiratory morbidity, there is a lack of normative lung function data for unsedated infants conforming to latest European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society standards. Lung function was measured using an ultrasonic flow meter in 342 unsedated, healthy, term-born infants at a mean±SD age of 5.1±0.8 weeks during natural sleep according to the latest standards. Tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL) and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) measurements were obtained from 100 regular breaths. We aimed for three acceptable measurements for multiple-breath washout and 5-10 acceptable interruption resistance (Rint) measurements. Acceptable measurements were obtained in ≤285 infants with high variability. Mean values were 7.48 mL·kg-1 (95% limits of agreement 4.95-10.0 mL·kg-1) for tidal volume, 14.3 ppb (2.6-26.1 ppb) for eNO, 23.9 mL·kg-1 (16.0-31.8 mL·kg-1) for functional residual capacity, 6.75 (5.63-7.87) for lung clearance index and 3.78 kPa·s·L-1 (1.14-6.42 kPa·s·L-1) for Rint. In males, TBFVL outcomes were associated with anthropometric parameters and in females, with maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal asthma and Caesarean section. This large normative data set in unsedated infants offers reference values for future research and particularly for studies where sedation may put infants at risk. Furthermore, it highlights the impact of maternal and environmental risk factors on neonatal lung function. Copyright©ERS 2011.

N2  - The aim of the present work was to investigate if insomnia in late pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology/postpartum depression (PPD). 581 women in their last trimester of pregnancy answered questions/questionnaires about lifetime history of insomnia, current sleep perception, current mood and depressive symptomatology. They were interviewed with the Portuguese version of the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. After delivery 382 (65.7%) mothers participated again in the study. Insomnia in pregnancy was not a risk factor for PPD (DSM-IV or ICD-10) but was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Negative Affect (NA) was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology. Women with higher NA were 4.6 (CI95%. = 1.69-12.74) and 5.3 times (CI95%. = 2.26-12.58) more likely of experiencing PPD (DSM-IV/ICD-10, respectively) than women with lower NA. Lifetime Depression was a significant predictor of postpartum depressive symptomatology and ICD-10/PPD (OR. = 2.6; CI95%. = 1.16-4.38). Positive Affect (PA) showed to be a protective factor for postpartum depressive symptomatology and DSM-IV/PPD (OR. = 1.5; CI95%. = 1.20-2.33). Controlling NA, PA and Lifetime Depression, insomnia lost its predictive role, suggesting these variables might work as mediators. Associations between insomnia, NA, PA and Lifetime Depression should be assessed in pregnancy. This might help to preventively target NA, enhance PA and reduce the likelihood of experiencing postpartum depressive symptomatology. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: While children and young adults had the highest attack rates due to 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza A (2009 H1N1), studies of hospitalized cases noted high fatality in older adults. We analyzed California public health surveillance data to better characterize the populations at risk for dying due to 2009 H1N1. Methods and Findings: A case was an adult ≥20 years who died with influenza-like symptoms and laboratory results indicative of 2009 H1N1. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical records using a standardized case report form. From April 3, 2009 - August 10, 2010, 541 fatal cases ≥20 years with 2009 H1N1 were reported. Influenza fatality rates per 100,000 population were highest in persons 50-59 years (3.5; annualized rate = 2.6) and 60-69 years (2.3; annualized rate = 1.7) compared to younger and older age groups (0.4-1.9; annualized rates = 0.3-1.4). Of 486 cases hospitalized prior to death, 441 (91%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. ICU admission rates per 100,000 population were highest in adults 50-59 years (8.6). ICU case-fatality ratios among adults ranged from 24-42%, with the highest ratios in persons 70-79 years. A total of 425 (80%) cases had co-morbid conditions associated with severe seasonal influenza. The prevalence of most co-morbid conditions increased with increasing age, but obesity, pregnancy and obstructive sleep apnea decreased with age. Rapid testing was positive in 97 (35%) of 276 tested. Of 482 cases with available data, 384 (80%) received antiviral treatment, including 49 (15%) of 328 within 48 hours of symptom onset. Conclusions: Adults aged 50-59 years had the highest fatality due to 2009 H1N1; older adults may have been spared due to pre-existing immunity. However, once infected and hospitalized in intensive care, case-fatality ratios were high for all adults, especially in those over 60 years. Vaccination of adults older than 50 years should be encouraged. © 2011 Louie et al.

N2  - Sleep disturbances are a common complaint of pregnancy.Depression is also frequently observed among childbearingwomen. To date, there is little published data on sleep in pregnantwomen who are depressed. Moreover, there is no data on the sleepin medicated depressed pregnant women. As a result clinicians arenot informed as to whether sleep disturbances are a normal facetof pregnancy or if they are exacerbated among depressed pregnantwomen such that risk of poor outcomes may be increased. Thismay have implications for risk for adverse outcomes. We describeand compare clinician assessed sleep disturbances in 237 (57depressed and 180 not-depressed at 20 weeks) communitydwelling pregnant women. Eligible women were 26.6 (11) yearsand primarily Caucasian. They were given the SIGH-ADS at 20,30 and 36 weeks gestation. Sleep latency, time spent awake atnight, sleep duration, time in bed, sleep efficiency and symptomsof insomnia were derived from the SIGH-ADS. We found thatdepressed women had greater sleep onset latencies and time spentawake at night, while their overall sleep efficiency was signifi-cantly worse (p's <.05). There were no differences on thefrequency of insomnia symptoms. We also evaluated sleepparameters in depressed pregnant women who were activelytaking antidepressant medication compared to those who werenot. Medications did not significantly affect any of the sleepvariables. Evaluation of sleep during the gestational period mayaugment a clinician's ability to identify women at risk for futuredepression.

Wisnerendogenous circadian rhythms during the perinatal period and to testthe hypothesis that circadian rhythm changes are associated withpostpartum depressive symptoms.Method: The study uses a prospective, repeated-measures designto examine circadian phase and mood in women with a history ofdepression (confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview forDSM-IV-TR Axis 1 Disorders) who are not in a current moodepisode at recruitment during 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Wemeasure sleep-wake behavior using continuous ambulatory mon-itoring of activity and light exposure along with sleep diaries forone week during 3rd trimester of pregnancy and one week atpostpartum week 6. At the end of each week, depressive moodsymptoms are assessed with the Inventory of Depressive Symp-tomatology (IDS) and circadian phase is determined using salivarydim light melatonin onset (DLMO).Results: Data collection is ongoing. Preliminary results available inOctober, 2010 will include 3rd trimester and postpartum week 6 moodsymptoms, salivary melatonin profiles, light exposure patterns, andsleep-wake times. Differences between 3rd trimester and postpartummood symptoms (IDS scores), circadian phase (DLMO times), sleeponset, sleep offset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency will be testedusing t-tests with within-subjects factor of week (3rd trimester,postpartum week 6). We will present Pearson correlations thatexamine the association of mood symptoms to changes in circadianphase (DLMO), sleep timing, and sleep duration.

N2  - Disturbed sleep is an emerging risk factor for many adverse health outcomes, including pregnancy complications. It increases risk by dysregulating biological pathways charged with maintaining homeostatic balance and health. Parturition is thought to be an inflammatory event modulated by environmental and physiological processes. Preterm birth (PTB) is an early initiation of normal physiologic events. PTB can have significant consequences for maternal and neonatal health. While infection is the most common initiator of the inflammatory response, the etiology in over 50% of PTB is unknown. Thus, we evaluated associations among sleep, cytokines, and delivery outcomes. Our intent was to provide preliminary evidence as to whether disturbed sleep may increase risk of PTB via an exaggerated inflammatory response. Subjective sleep (including insomnia symptoms, sleep onset latency, nocturnal waketime, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency), immune (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-± , and IFN-3) and stress hormone (cortisol) concentrations were assessed in a cohort of depressed and non-depressed pregnant women (N= 212) at 20 and 30 weeks gestation. Delivery was categorized as preterm ( > 37weeks) or term (e37 weeks). Pearson correlations were run on sleep and cytokines/cortisol at 20 and 30 weeks gestation. Insomnia at 20 weeks was associated with higher plasma cortisol (r=.24, p = .003), while poor sleep continuity and efficiency, and short sleep duration were associated with higher IL-6 (r's .16-.24, p's < .05). At week 30 poor sleep continuity and efficiency, and short sleep duration were associated with higher IL-6 and TNF-± (r's =.15 18, p's < .05). There were no significant associations among the cytokines/cortisol and PTB. We propose that disturbed sleep is likely to increase adverse pregnancy outcomes via an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, evidence for this relationship is lacking. Consistent with previous reports, disturbed sleep is associated with inflammation. On the contrary, plasma cytokines were not correlated with PTB which may be due to the fact that maternal levels are not indicative of the milieu at the maternal-fetal interface.

N2  - Objective: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) occurs in 10-15% ofpregnant women, with over 30% of affected women choosingtreatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SRIs).Previous studies have linked both MDD and use of SRIs to transientneurobehavioral disturbances in the newborn. The purpose of thisstudy was to examine the influence of maternal sleep and anxiety onfetal and infant neurobehavior in infants prenatally exposed to MDDand/or SRIs.Method: Pregnant women (N=158), ages 18 to 40 were enrolled in alarger study of neurobehavioral development of fetuses prenatallyexposed to maternal MDD and/or SRIs. Women were interviewedusing a semi-structured interview (SCID-IV-NP). The timing ofexposure to medication and psychiatric illness was recorded on agraphic timeline. Clinical interviewers also rated maternal symptomsof mood and anxiety using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(HDRS) and the Hamilton Anxiety Inventory (HAM-A). Mothersfilled out self-report measures of mood symptoms (BDI), sleep(PSQI), and anxiety (STAI). Fetal neurobehavior was recorded at 26and 36 weeks gestational age (GA) using ultrasound and fetalactocardiograph monitoring for 60 minutes. Ultrasound video record-ings were played back in the lab and scored for the presence of fetalbehaviors. Newborn neurobehavior was examined in the first weekafter delivery. Analyses were conducted using ANCOVA and MultipleRegression.Results: Women diagnosed with MDD during pregnancy reportedmore sleep disturbance and higher levels of anxiety through the 3rdtrimester than women without MDD, regardless of treatment with SRImedications. Women who were taking SRIs throughout the pregnancyand had MDD remission also reported higher sleep disturbance scoresthan controls. Higher maternal PSQI scores were related to lessoptimal fetal and infant neurobehavioral measures, more infant activesleep and less quiet sleep independent of maternal depression andanxiety scores.Conclusion: Women in this sample who were taking SRIs consis-tently and had remission of mood symptoms still reported significantsleep disturbances during the pregnancy. Although MDD and use ofSRIs both contribute to less optimal fetal and newborn neurobehavior,poor maternal sleep was differentially related to measures of arousaland state control in both the fetus and infant.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is defined as the presence of abnormal breathing in sleep along with daytime symptoms, characterised by episodes of upper airway collapse. These result in sympathetic activation, activation of inflammatory pathways and changes in adipokines, the proposed mechanisms by which OSA results in increased cardiovascular risk. There are little data on OSA in pregnancy. Our hypothesis was that fetal compromise may be observed during periods of hypoxia, hypercapnia and sympathetic activation during a sleep study. Method: Patients identified to be high (cases) or low risk (controls) for OSA on the basis of screening questionnaires were recruited. At 37 weeks' gestation, they had sleep studies with time-synchronised cardiotocography (CTG). The following morning, the data were downloaded, and the CTG examined for abnormalities. The reviewers were blinded to the PSG results. Results: So far, 35 women have consented to the project. 7 subsequently declined or delivered preterm. 21 have completed sleep studies. Of the 11 identified as potential cases based on their questionnaire, only 4 had confirmed OSA. None of the 10 patients identified as being controls had OSA. Successful synchronised overnight CTG monitoring has been obtained in all patients, without CTG abnormalities. OSA patients who had frequent periods of significant desaturation had no detected fetal heart rate abnormalities. Conclusions: Screening questionnaires used to detect patients at high risk of OSA may be less reliable in pregnancy. It is feasible to perform overnight CTG monitoring on patients undergoing sleep studies. We have not found any evidence of acute fetal compromise, as evidenced by abnormal CTG, in patients with significant OSA.
