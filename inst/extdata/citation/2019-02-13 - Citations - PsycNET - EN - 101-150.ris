N2  - New mothers often complain of impaired cognitive functioning, and it is well documented that women experience a significant increase in sleep disturbance after the birth of a child. Sleep disturbance has been linked to impaired cognitive performance in several populations, including commercial truck drivers, airline pilots, and medical residents, though this relationship has rarely been studied in postpartum women. In the present study 13 pregnant women and a group of 22 non-pregnant controls completed one week of actigraphy followed by a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires in the last month of pregnancy (Time 1) and again at four weeks postpartum (Time 2). Pregnant women experienced significantly more objective and subjective sleep disturbance than the control group at both time points. They also demonstrated more impairment in objective, but not subjective cognitive functioning. Preliminary analyses indicated increased objective sleep fragmentation from Time 1 to Time 2 predicted decreased objective cognitive performance from Time 1 to Time 2, though small sample size limited the power of these findings. Implications for perinatal women and need for future research were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The study of some of the characteristics of the female libido and of other features which are exclusive to the female inner world might help us to understand the aetiology of perversion in women. We might then see female perversions not as parallels to the psychopathology found in men, but as having their own separate and distinct causes. There is a dramatic difference in the sense of temporality in males and females. Women have a ‘biological clock’ that is present and evident from the moment they are born. From menarche to menopause, this clock dominates women's lifespan and subjects her to the hope/dread of pregnancy. This grounds women firmly in the reality principle. They not only have a different libidinal development from men but they also experience a sense of pressure provided by this inexorable marking of the passage of time which is exclusive to their sex and is intimately related to their reproductive functions.

N2  - Nowadays, it is well established that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for a transient form of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), and this raises three important clinical issues: the differential diagnosis with other pregnancy-related sensitive symptoms of lower limbs such as nocturnal cramps, sleep positional discomfort, ankle edema, radiculopathy, and venous stasis; the effect of the symptoms and of the possible sleep deprivation on the pregnancy outcome, and overall the therapeutic management of RLS during pregnancy and lactation with the clear safety limitation in using a pharmacological approach.

N2  - To develop an animal model for studies on peri-partum sleep disorders, sleep patterns in female Wistar rats during pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning, were assessed and associated adaptive changes in their anxiety were examined. Adult nulliparous female rats, maintained in standard laboratory conditions with ad libitum food and water, were surgically implanted with electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes under anaesthesia for objective assessment of sleep-wakefulness (S-W). After post-surgical recovery, three control recordings of S-W were taken for 24h before the animals were kept for mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, S-W recordings were acquired during different days of pregnancy, post-partum lactation/nursing days, and also after weaning. Their anxiety levels were tested in the elevated plus maze. During pregnancy, sleep increased primarily due to increase in light non-REM sleep during dark period. There was an increase in non-REM sleep delta power after parturition, though the sleep was fragmented, especially during daytime. Simultaneous behavioural recording showed increased anxiety during third trimester of pregnancy and gradual reversal of it after parturition. This is the first report where diurnal and nocturnal variations in S-W and delta power, along with adaptive changes in anxiety, were studied before, during and after pregnancy. This study also provides an animal model for drug trials and studies on sleep disorders during peri-partum window. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is a serious public health problem as it can affect the health of pregnant women and newborns. However, it is not well studied whether sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy has similar effects on emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring, and if so, the potential cellular mechanisms also remain poorly understood. Methods: In the present study, the pregnant rats were subjected to sleep deprivation for 6 h per day by gentle handling during the first (gestational days 1–7), second (gestational days 8–14) and third trimester (gestational days 15–21) of pregnancy, respectively. The emotional and cognitive functions as well as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were tested in the offspring rats (postnatal days 42-56). Results: The offspring displayed impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, and increased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Quantification of BrdU-positive cells revealed that adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced compared to control. Electrophysiological recording showed that maternal sleep deprivation impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP and reduced basal synaptic transmission, as reflected by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that maternal sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy disrupts the emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring that might be attributable to the suppression of hippocampal LTP and basal synaptic transmission.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep problems and deprivation are common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies are mostly descriptive or focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods: We studied 200 women from a mother–child cohort recruited in 2009–2011 from the French general population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through questionnaires. Results: We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing ( 8 h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working >28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10–0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = −0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion: We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: To determine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with overall sleep duration among pregnant women. Methods: Data from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n = 2951) of childbearing age (18–44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included. Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status. Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results: Total daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [β = −0.03, (−0.07, 0.00)]. Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep duration [β = −0.19, (−0.38, −0.01) and β = −0.20, (−0.33, −0.08) respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional sleep compared to those who did not [β = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep duration. Discussion: Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and other medications as potential confounders.

N2  - Background: Although stress during pregnancy has negative effects on children’s development and pregnant women’s health, no study has assessed stress and its predictors among pregnant Saudi women. The aim of this study was to assess stress and identify its predictors in a sample of pregnant Saudi women. Methods: A correlational study was carried out at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on 438 pregnant women who attended the obstetrics/gynecology clinic. We collected data on their sociodemographic and oral health status. Stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Results: The sample mean age was 30.6±5.4 years, and 33.4% of the sample reported high stress levels (PSS ≥20). The study revealed significantly high stress levels in women with no or low income, chronic disease, sleep deprivation, no teeth brushing, irregular eating patterns, gestational diabetes, and no family support (P P < 0.05). A multiple linear regression model showed that no teeth brushing, chronic disease, sleep deprivation, gestational diabetes, and gingival redness predicted an increase in stress by a score of 3.6, 2.4, 2.1, 1.4, and 1.4, respectively. Conclusion: It was estimated that three in ten pregnant women in King Abdulaziz Medical City reported high stress levels. Our study shed light on the relationship between healthy habits, oral health status, and perceived stress in pregnant women. This research may help health care practitioners who provide care to pregnant women, to educate them in regard to healthy habits, and to develop a program to reduce stress.

N2  - Prenatal psychosocial health has been linked with health behaviors, maternal health, and birth outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a prenatal depression intervention on birth outcomes and maternal physical and psychological status at 42 days postpartum. Three hundred fifty-two high-risk pregnant women exposed to obstetric complications with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) ≥ 9 or a Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) ≥ 60 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 176) and control group (n = 176). The intervention group underwent a six-session couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy (>28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor (p p < .05). A prenatal psychological intervention model for high-risk pregnant women holds potential as a preventive program that addresses maternal health and birth outcomes.

N2  - An intact communication between circadian clocks and the stress system is important for maintaining physiological homeostasis under resting conditions and in response to external stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for a reciprocal interaction between both—from the systemic to the molecular level. Disruption of this interaction by external factors such as shiftwork, jetlag, or chronic stress increases the risk of developing metabolic, immune, or mood disorders. From experiments in rodents, we know that both systems maturate during the perinatal period. During that time, exogenous factors such as stress or alterations in the external photoperiod may critically affect—or program—physiological functions later in life. This developmental programming process has been attributed to maternal stress signals reaching the embryo, which lastingly change gene expression through the induction of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the well-known function of the adult circadian system in temporal coordination of physiology and behavior, the role of maternal and embryonic circadian clocks during pregnancy and postnatal development is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the circadian-stress crosstalk at different periods of development may help to improve stress resistance and devise preventive and therapeutic strategies against chronic stress-associated disorders.

N2  - Sleep disorders are a common problem during pregnancy and may affect quality of life. This study aimed to determine the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant women. This cross‐sectional study was conducted on 565 women recruited using 2‐stage cluster sampling methods. Data were collected using sociodemographic characteristics; quality of life; and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire between March and May 2015. About 6% of the women had a sleep disorder. There were significant correlations between quality of life and total score of sleep quality, subdomains of habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction. Paying attention to the sleep quality as an effective factor of quality of life can promote sleep quality and hence quality of life of pregnant women.

N2  - The letter presents a case report of a 34-year old man suffering from frequent complex partial seizures resistant to antiepileptic drugs.Hewas also affected by chronic hepatitis B and ulcerative colitis (UC) since age 24. Family history for epilepsy and febrile seizures was negative. The pregnancy was reportedly unremarkable; labor and delivery were at term and normal. The authors observed a clear modulation of myoclonus by NREM sleep, mostly after seizure. A boosting post-ictal effect similar to what occurs for IEAs could explain this finding. Alternatively, we might hypothesize a potential role of the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) during NREM sleep; the CAP has been demonstrated to play a gate-control on periodic limb movements during NREM sleep. In the same way, CAP could play a similar facilitating role for myoclonus in our patient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

This retrospective cohort study evaluates DST impact on pregnancy and pregnancy loss rates in 1,654 autologous in vitro fertilization cycles (2009 to 2012). Study groups were identified based on the relationship of DST to embryo transfer. Pregnancy rates were similar in Spring and Fall (41.4%, 42.2%). Pregnancy loss rates were also comparable between Spring and Fall (15.5%, 17.1%), but rates of loss were significantly higher in Spring when DST occurred after embryo transfer (24.3%). Loss was marked in patients with a history of prior spontaneous pregnancy loss (60.5%). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep problems during pregnancy impair maternal health and increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcome. The circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with sleep problems in previous studies. Here, we studied whether evening-type women had more sleep problems during their pregnancy, as compared with other chronotypes, in a sample consisting of 1653 pregnant women from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP Birth Cohort. Chronotype was assessed with a shortened version of the morningness–eveningness questionnaire. Pregnant evening-type women reported more sleep problems, including troubles of falling asleep (OR = 3.4, p p p p p p p p p p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. Our results indicate that eveningness is associated with more sleep problems and unhealthy life habits during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To analyze the relationship among prenatal maternal stress, psychological distress and sleep quality in pregnant women, and to examine the mediating effect of psychological distress between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality. Methods: Totally 213 pregnant women in second trimester were selected. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), and 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) were used to assess the sleep quality, prenatal maternal stress and psychological distress respectively. Results: The average scores of PSQI were (5.3 ± 2.5), and 41.3% of the subjects had sleep problems (PSQI > 5). PSRS scores were negatively correlated with PSQI scores and K10 scores (r = 0.57, 0.26, P r = 0.743, P P < 0.01) and did not include 0, which indicated that psychological distress significantly-mediated the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality. Conclusion: It suggests that pregnant women in second trimester have poor sleep quality. Prenatal maternal stress and psychological distress could affect sleep quality, and psychological distress could mediate the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality.

N2  - How nonhuman primates deal with birth, at the moment of delivery, and during the following days, remains poorly explored because of the unpredictability of this event, particularly for forest‐dwelling arboreal species. Available studies highlight intra‐ and interspecific variation which suggest flexibility of the timing of delivery, of behavior associated with labor contractions and parturition, and the social context and ambient noise surrounding delivery. Here, we present the findings of a two‐decade survey of reproduction in a population of captive Campbell's monkeys. Analysis of 34 births (with a female‐biased sex ratio) showed that deliveries occurred systematically at night and more frequently during week‐ends and in fall (September–November). This suggests the existence of both circadian and infradian biological rhythms. We present the first detailed description of a birth for this species and its short‐term social consequences. In line with previous findings for other monkeys and apes, labor (estimated by unusual stretching postures) and parturition were rapid, and delivery occurred in a clear social and vocal context. During the following days, the new mother became the center of attention of for young (kin and non‐kin) females and rose through the hierarchy. We discuss socio‐ecological factors, notably captivity conditions and the high degree of tolerance in the species’ social system, and confirm the existence of both “rigidity” and “flexibility” in the primates’ adaptive reproductive strategies.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the independent and combined associations of maternal self-reported poor sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation during the third trimester. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1298 pregnant women (between 24 and 28 gestational weeks) attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders. Results: Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of > 5 vs. ≤ 5). Further, the prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.81; 95% CI 1.78–4.45). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.15–1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR = 13.56 95% CI 7.53–24.41) as compared with women without either risk factor. Limitations: This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable. Conclusion: Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation. Our findings support the need to explore sleep-focused interventions for pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: The few existing early-life obesity prevention initiatives have concentrated on abstract nutrition and physical activity, with little examination of sleep. Methods: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802 pregnant women (≥ 16 years, P = .086), but there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P = .027). Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving the “sleep intervention” (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control: odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.82]). No effect was observed for the “FAB intervention” (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80–1.81]). Conclusions: A well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children’s weight status. However, further research on more intensive or longer running sleep interventions is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Daytime sleepiness is a frequent complaint in women during pregnancy. It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor new-onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal outcomes. Objectives: To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics associated with the persistence and new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Design: A longitudinal, prospective cohort design. Setting: One medical center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women’s homes. Participants: A total of 204 pregnant women. Methods: First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep, mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the women were in the second and third trimester. Results: Thirty-one (15.2%) women experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were 2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new-onset daytime sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR = 1.04, p p p = 0.01). Conclusions: Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special attention to nulliparous and employed women.

N2  - Background: Perinatal depression (PND) has an overall estimated prevalence of roughly 12 %. Untreated PND has significant negative consequences not only on the health of the mothers, but also on the physical, emotional and cognitive development of their children. No certain risk factors are known to predict PND and no completely safe drug treatments are available during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sleep and depression are strongly related to each other because of a solid reciprocal causal relationship. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-tested and safe treatment, effective in both depression and circadian/sleep disorders. Methods: In a 3-year longitudinal, observational, multicentre study, about 500 women will be recruited and followed-up from early pregnancy (10–15 gestational week) until 12 months after delivery. The primary aim of the present study is to systematically explore and characterize risk factors for PND by prospective sleep assessment (using wrist actigraphy, polysomnography and various sleep questionnaires) and bloodbased analysis of potential markers during the perinatal period (Life-ON study). Secondary aims are to explore the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudy Life-ON1), to investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treating PND (substudy Life-ON2) and to test whether a short term trial of BLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy Life-ON3). Discussion: The characterization of specific predictive and risk factors for PND may substantially contribute to improve preventive medical and social strategies for the affected women. The study results are expected to promote a better understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and the development of PND and to confirm, in a large sample of women, the safety and efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND.

N2  - Background: Few studies have looked at the relationship between psychological and the mental health status of pregnant women in rural China. The current study aims to explore the potential mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts between negative life events and antenatal depression. Methods: Data were collected in June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, negative automatic thoughts were measured by the automatic thoughts questionnaire, and negative life events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect. Results: The prevalence of antenatal depression was 13.7%. In the logistic regression, the only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the eventual direct and general effects of negative automatic thoughts were 0.39 and 0.51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events. Conclusions: This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts. Pregnant women who had lower scores of negative automatic thoughts were more likely to suffer less from negative life events which might lead to antenatal depression.

N2  - Study Objectives: To examine independent associations of sleep duration with total and abdominal adiposity, and the bidirectionality of these associations, in a young biethnic sample of children from a disadvantaged location. Methods: Child sleep duration (h/day) was parent-reported by questionnaire and indices of total (body weight, body mass index, percent body fat (%BF), sum of skinfolds) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference) were measured using standard anthropometric procedures at approximately 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age in 1,338 children (58% South Asian; 42% White). Mixed effects models were used to quantify independent associations (expressed as standardised β-coefficients (95% confidence interval (CI)) of sleep duration with adiposity indices using data from all four time-points. Factors considered for adjustment in models included basic demographics, pregnancy and birth characteristics, and lifestyle behaviours. Results: With the exception of the sum of skinfolds, sleep duration was inversely and independently associated with indices of total and abdominal adiposity in South Asian children. For example, one standard deviation (SD) higher sleep duration was associated with reduced %BF by -0.029 (95% CI: −0.053, −0.0043) SDs. Higher adiposity was also independently associated with shorter sleep duration in South Asian children (for example, %BF: β = -0.10 (-0.16, -0.028) SDs). There were no significant associations in White children. Conclusions: Associations between sleep duration and adiposity are bidirectional and independent among South Asian children from a disadvantaged location. The results highlight the importance of considering adiposity as both a determinant of decreased sleep and a potential consequence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objectives: To examine the influence of maternal sleep quality and nocturnal sleep duration on risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a multiethnic Asian population. Methods: A cohort of 686 women (376 Chinese, 186 Malay, and 124 Indian) with a singleton pregnancy attended a clinic visit at 26–28 weeks of gestation as part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes mother–offspring cohort study. Self-reported sleep quality and sleep duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). GDM was diagnosed based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test administered after an overnight fast (1999 WHO criteria). Multiple logistic regression was used to model separately the associations of poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5) and short nocturnal sleep duration (<6 h) with GDM, adjusting for age, ethnicity, maternal education, body mass index, previous history of GDM, and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score). Results: In the cohort 296 women (43.1%) had poor sleep quality and 77 women (11.2%) were categorized as short sleepers; 131 women (19.1%) were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality and short nocturnal sleep duration were independently associated with increased risk of GDM (poor sleep, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.76; short sleep, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.66). Conclusions: During pregnancy, Asian women with poor sleep quality or short nocturnal sleep duration exhibited abnormal glucose regulation. Treating sleep problems and improving sleep behavior in pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk and burden of GDM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Pregnancy, particularly late gestation (LG), has been associated with a relatively high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of OSA, could impose significant long‐term effects on somatic growth, energy homeostasis, and metabolic function in offspring. We hypothesized that IH during late pregnancy (LG‐IH) may increase the propensity for metabolic dysregulation and obesity in adult offspring via epigenetic modifications. Time‐pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to LG‐IH or room air (LG‐RA) during days 13–18 of gestation. At 24 weeks, blood samples were collected from offspring mice for lipid profiles and insulin resistance, indirect calorimetry was performed and visceral white adipose tissues (VWAT) were assessed for inflammatory cells as well as for differentially methylated gene regions (DMRs) using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on chip (MeDIP‐chip). Body weight, food intake, adiposity index, fasting insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol levels were all significantly higher in LG‐IH male but not female offspring. LG‐IH also altered metabolic expenditure and locomotor activities in male offspring, and increased number of pro‐inflammatory macrophages emerged in VWAT along with 1520 DMRs (P < 0.0001), associated with 693 genes. Pathway analyses showed that genes affected by LG‐IH were mainly associated with molecular processes related to metabolic regulation and inflammation. LG‐IH induces metabolic dysfunction as reflected by increased body weight and adiposity index in adult male offspring that is paralleled by epigenomic alterations and inflammation in VWAT. Thus, perturbations to fetal environment by OSA during pregnancy can have long‐term detrimental effects on the fetus, and lead to persistent metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

N2  - Postpartum psychosis has long-lasting consequences for mother and child. Beside depression, sleep and eating disturbances, exhaustion, social withdrawal, and anxiety, postpartum depression can also interfere with normal maternal-infant bonding and adversely affect child development. Recent reports show that most affected pregnant women are hesitant about taking antidepressant drugs, with a high percentage discontinuing their use. Some authors suggest that the reluctance of pregnant women to take antidepressant drugs should encourage clinicians to discuss with their patients the use of psychological interventions or alternative forms of treatment. In this article, a case of severe postpartum depression, treated successfully with homeopathic therapy, is presented. Considering the high noncompliance of women suffering from postpartum depression with conventional antidepressant medication, research in safe complementary medical methods is justified. One of these methods should be homeopathy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: Women of child-bearing age are the population at greatest risk for depression. The stress experienced during pregnancy and the associated antidepressant treatments can both affect fetal development. Fluoxetine (FLX) is among the most common antidepressants used by pregnant women. We have previously demonstrated that perinatal exposure to FLX can alter expression of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Here, we examine the combined effects of maternal stress during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to the antidepressant FLX on the circadian behavior of mice as adults. Methods: Mouse dams were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), FLX (E15 to postnatal day 12), a combination of both stress and FLX, or were left untreated. At 2 months of age, male offspring were placed in recording chambers and circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed. Results: Mice exposed to prenatal stress (PS) had smaller light-induced phase delays. Mice exposed to perinatal FLX required more days to re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance of their light–dark cycle. Mice subjected to either perinatal FLX or to PS had larger light-induced phase advances and smaller phase advances to 8-OH-DPAT. FLX treatment partially reversed the effect of PS on phase shifts to late-night light exposure and to 8-OH-DPAT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in mice, perinatal exposure to either FLX, or PS, or their combination, leads to discernible, persistent changes in their circadian systems as adults.

N2  - Background: Poor sleep during pregnancy has been associated with poorer birth outcomes. High body mass index (BMI) is often associated with poor sleep, but little is known about the relationship between gestational weight gain and sleep in late pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships of both gestational weight gain and pre‐pregnancy BMI to objective and subjective measures of sleep during late pregnancy. Methods: Pregnant women (n = 128) were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth classes primarily serving low‐income women. Their sleep (disruption and duration) was objectively assessed in their last month of pregnancy with 72 hours of wrist actigraphy monitoring. Their perceived sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pre‐pregnancy and late pregnancy height and weight were assessed by self‐report and used to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain, which were then grouped into standardized categories. Results: Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was 6.8 ± 3.1 (range 2–16). Sixty percent had excess gestational weight gain and it was associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, but was unrelated to objective measures of sleep duration and disruption. Pre‐pregnancy BMI was unrelated to all sleep parameters. However, analyses of the interaction of pre‐pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain indicated that excess weight gain was associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep disruption, but only among women who were overweight before pregnancy. Conclusion: Pregnancy is an opportunity to promote long‐term women's health with a better understanding of the relationship between weight management and healthy sleep habits.

N2  - It was recently reported that pregnant women were more likely to have minor depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale (PHQ-8), (as reported by Kroenke and Spitzer (Psychiatr Ann 32(9):1–7, 2002), and Kroenke et al. (J Affect 114(1–3):163–173, 2009)) compared to women who were not pregnant (as reported by Ashley et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 19(2):395–400, 2015)). The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of pregnant women (n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant (n = 6754). Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons were based on participants’ responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant. Emotional symptoms such as feeling down and feeling like a failure were less likely to be reported by pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant. Implications for depression screening during pregnancy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world. Natural sources of caffeine include coffee, tea, and chocolate. Synthetic caffeine is also added to products to promote arousal, alertness, energy, and elevated mood. Over the past decade, the introduction of new caffeine-containing food products, as well as changes in consumption patterns of the more traditional sources of caffeine, has increased scrutiny by health authorities and regulatory bodies about the overall consumption of caffeine and its potential cumulative effects on behavior and physiology. Of particular concern is the rate of caffeine intake among populations potentially vulnerable to the negative effects of caffeine consumption: pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescents, young adults, and people with underlying heart or other health conditions, such as mental illness. Here, we review the research into the safety and safe doses of ingested caffeine in healthy and in vulnerable populations. We report that, for healthy adults, caffeine consumption is relatively safe, but that for some vulnerable populations, caffeine consumption could be harmful, including impairments in cardiovascular function, sleep, and substance use. We also identified several gaps in the literature on which we based recommendations for the future of caffeine research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of parenting interventions on parent, infant and parent-infant relationship outcome measures for parents of infants under 12 months old. Parent outcomes examined included competence, and confidence; baby outcomes included infant behaviours of crying, settling, and sleeping problems and parent-infant relationship outcomes included parental responsiveness. Systematic searches of five databases were carried out. In total, 36 randomised controlled trials over the past 35 years were included in the meta-analyses, with a total of 4880 participants. Interventions were carried out either during pregnancy or within the first 12 months after birth and involved teaching specific strategies and provision of information on infant development and behaviour. Mean effect sizes were obtained using a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach to meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was found on parent responsiveness and infant sleep. Potential moderator variables were assessed for these two outcomes using the SEM approach. Results showed that early parenting interventions are effective in improving parental responsiveness (d = 0.77), and improving or preventing infant sleep problems (d = 0.24), but not crying problems (d = 0.27) possibly due to low power. No conclusions could be drawn in regards to parental competence or confidence. Moderator analysis showed that for interventions aimed at improving responsiveness, briefer interventions were more effective than longer ones; and studies published more recently reported smaller effects than older studies. No other moderators influenced the assessed intervention outcomes. The findings of this study provide further evidence for the positive effects of early parenting interventions for infants under 12 months of age, however future research is needed to assess intervention effects on parental competence and confidence.

N2  - Objectives: Infant developmental outcomes may be influenced by a range of prenatal maternal characteristics. While there is some evidence to suggest that maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research and clinical practice. Methods: Five electronic databases were systematically scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2) the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3) they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results: Of the 968 papers identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low quality (< 60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and low quality studies available. Conclusions: Although maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.

N2  - Purpose: A population at great risk is pregnant homeless adolescents and young adult women. Research shows that about 20% of homeless young women become pregnant (Bender, & Thompson, 2007). These pregnant young women are at an increased risk for low birth weight infants and a high infant mortality due to inadequate health care, poor dietary habits, and a knowledge deficit related to maintaining good health during pregnancy and to care of the infant and growing child. A transitional shelter may offer many psychosocial services to assist the women in becoming independent; however, a significant gap exists regarding the medical care of this population. The purpose of this DNP Project was to develop an educational program in a transitional homeless shelter focused on the health care of the pregnant woman and the newborn infant in order to bring awareness of the special needs of this high risk population and to attempt to change unhealthy behaviors. This program was coupled with an In- Service Program for staff members related to Best Practices for the Mother- Infant Dyad. Significance of the project: Knowledge can be empowering and save lives. Through months of interaction and time spent with new mothers in a transitional shelter, the enormous lack of evidence based practices in regards to infant and child care has become evident. This vulnerable population has the highest rate of infant mortality. Education can improve the health outcomes of these women and children. These mothers are eager to learn and want to give their children a chance for a healthy life. They are lacking the information to do so. Methods: The project was implemented in a transitional homeless shelter for women ages 18 to 23 based on a needs assessment. The project implementation contained two parts. Informal education sessions took place with pregnant women and women having recently given birth. 10 Education Intervention Program There were both individual and group sessions. The topics included labor and delivery preparation, diet during pregnancy, care of the newborn, and safety issues related to sleep and feedings. As the infants have grown over the months the sessions have evolved to meet the needs of the growing infant and child. The second part of the project contains a series of learning modules comprising of four hours of narrated lectures and power point presentations developed for the staff. Project Outcomes: The project initiatives were received by all involved wholeheartedly. The project brought to the shelter directors and staff members a new awareness of the crucial need for evidenced based practice in the care of the newborn and mother. Clinical observations have shown a readiness for several of the mothers to follow lessons learned. Significant changes in behaviors related to care of the infant have been observed. A level of trust has developed between the educator and the residents of the shelter. The educator has assumed the role of advocate and mentor. Clinical Relevance: Women head up 90 percent of the families that use shelters. A third of the homeless are women and children, and the numbers are exploding. Through education, advocacy and developing a means of quality health care the lives of these women and children will be made better and healthier. A best practice model for care of the pregnant homeless women and her infant is needed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Overexposure to maternal cortisol in utero has been associated with lower birth weight of offspring. In order to regulate fetal exposure to this hormone, placental expression of 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2, an enzyme that converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone, increases across pregnancy. Because of this increase in 11-βHSD2 activity, measuring maternal cortisol in isolation may not reflect actual fetal exposure to the hormone. Previous work by Hellgren et al. (2016) has shown that maternal serum cortisone:cortisol ratio was a better predictor of offspring birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This paper sought to replicate these results when examining maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio. Data come from 55 pregnant women from Auckland, New Zealand. Cortisol and cortisone were measured in saliva samples collected at waking and prior to going to sleep on two consecutive weekdays between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation. We found that salivary cortisol and cortisone followed the expected diurnal rhythm and that cortisone was higher than cortisol at both times of day. Maternal bedtime cortisone:cortisol ratio was significantly and inversely related to offspring birth weight. However, waking and bedtime cortisol, as well as waking cortisone:cortisol ratio, were unrelated to birth weight. These results show that maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio, like serum cortisone:cortisol ratio, is a more sensitive biomarker for predicting infant birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This ratio could be a valuable, minimally-invasive measurement for future studies interested in understanding the relationship between maternal HPA-axis function and offspring birth weight.

N2  - Purpose: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity. Method: We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Results: Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Conclusions: BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

N2  - Study objectives: Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress. Methods: The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night. Results: We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8% vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5% vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6–5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8–5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men. Conclusions: The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.

N2  - Executive function deficits are among the most frequent sequela of very preterm birth but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity (SWA; 1–4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6–16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 (2.0), 10.0–16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated. Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the term-group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Depression affects up to 23% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse physical/mental health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Depressed pregnant women may be more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. Little is known regarding depressed pregnant women’s perceptions, uses of, and interests in complementary health approaches. Study participants (mean age 28.7 ± 6.8; n = 1032) included pregnant women ≥ 8 weeks gestation who responded to a survey assessing physical and mental health and wellness practices. Of those completing the survey, depressed pregnant women (n = 272) had significantly higher levels of anxiety (P P P P P < .001) compared to nondepressed pregnant women (n = 760). A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.

N2  - Objectives: To assess the associations of perceived financial satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in an unselected pregnant population in early pregnancy. Methods: 750 consecutive pregnant women attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14 were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results: 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906, 0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m², p for linearity = 0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% of unsatisfied women scored EPDS ≥ 10 points suggesting increased risk of depression. Conclusions: Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a common neurological sensorimotor disorder in western countries, has gained more and more attention in Asian countries. The prevalence of RLS is higher in older people and females. RLS is most commonly related to iron deficiency, pregnancy and uremia. The RLS symptoms show a significant circadian rhythm and a close relationship to periodic limb movements (PLMs) in clinical observations, while the pathophysiological pathways are still unknown. The diagnostic criteria have been revised in 2012 to improve the validity of RLS diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested an important role of iron decrease of brain in RLS pathophysiology. Dopaminergic (DA) system dysfunction in A11 cell groups has been recognized long ago from clinical treatment and autopsy. Nowadays, it is believed that iron dysfunction can affect DA system from different pathways and opioids have a protective effect on DA system. Several susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms such as BTBD9 and MEIS1, which are thought to be involved in embryonic neuronal development, have been reported to be associated with RLS. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment are discussed in this review. First-line treatments of RLS include DA agents and α2δ agonists. Augmentation is very common in long-term treatment of RLS which makes prevention and management of augmentation very important for RLS patients. A combination of different types of medication is effective in preventing and treating augmentation. The knowledge on RLS is still limited, the pathophysiology and better management of RLS remain to be discovered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with increased risk for mental health problems both in early adolescence and in adulthood. However, in late adolescence, when circadian rhythm naturally shifts to later, its significance for mental health is not clear. Accordingly, we studied how circadian rhythm estimated both by self-reported chronotype and by actigraph-defined midpoint of sleep was associated with self-reported psychiatric problems based on Youth Self Report (YSR). The study builds on a community cohort born in 1998, Helsinki, Finland. At age 17 years (mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1 years), 183 adolescents (65.6% of the invited) participated in the study. We used the shortened version of the Horne-Östberg morningness–eveningness Questionnaire to define the chronotype, and actigraphs to define the naturally occur circadian rhythm over a 4 to 17 days’ period (mean nights N = 8.3, SD = 1.8). The Achenbach software was used to obtain T-score values for YSR psychiatric problem scales. The analyses were adjusted for important covariates including gender, socioeconomic status, body mass index, pubertal maturation, mother’s licorice consumption during pregnancy, and actigraph-defined sleep duration and quality. Eveningness was associated with higher scores in rule-breaking behavior and conduct problems (as assessed either by midpoint of sleep or by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05), with affective problems (by midpoint of sleep and by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05) and somatic complaints (by self-reported chronotype, p-values < 0.05), as compared to circadian tendency toward morningness. Our results suggest that the association between eveningness and externalizing problem behavior, present in children and younger adolescents, is also present in late adolescence when circadian rhythms shift toward evening.

N2  - Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. In acute hypoxaemia, the human fetus adapts to a lower oxygen consuming state with changes in the cardiotocograph and reduced fetal activity. Recent studies of late gestation stillbirth described the importance of sleep position in the risk of intrauterine death. We designed this study to assess the effects of different maternal positions on FBS in healthy late gestation pregnancies under controlled conditions. Twenty‐nine healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings under standardized conditions in four randomly allocated positions, left lateral, right lateral, supine and semi‐recumbent. Two blinded observers, assigned fetal states in 5 min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Compared to state 2F, state 4F was less likely to occur when women were semi‐recumbent [odds ratio (OR) = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.02, 0.55], and supine (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.07, 1.10). State 1F was more likely on the right (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.11, 5.04) or supine (OR = 4.99, 95% CI 2.41, 10.43) compared to the left. State change was more likely when the mother was semi‐recumbent (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.19, 3.95) or supine (OR = 2.67, 95% CI 1.46, 4.85). There was a significant association of maternal position to mean fetal heart rate. The measures of heart rate variability (SDNN and RMSSD) were reduced in both semi‐recumbent and supine positions. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are likely fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

N2  - Sex-specific effects in the clinical presentation and course of bipolar disorder (BD) in women have important treatment implications for the management of symptoms across the menstrual cycle and reproductive lifespan. Women differ from men in the age of onset, clinical pattern of symptoms, and rates and types of psychiatric co-morbidities. For many women with BD, periods of hormonal fluctuation appear to present a unique risk for affective symptoms, thus making treatment challenging. Women with BD compared to without are particularly vulnerable to premenstrual mood symptoms, menstrual abnormalities, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Treatments may involve both psychotropic and gynecological expertise, and patients benefit from collaborative care among their specialist providers. Management of BD in the perinatal period entails many complex decisions. The postpartum period in particular is a time of greatly elevated risk for mood episodes. Use of psychotropic medication in pregnancy and lactation requires a careful risk-benefit analysis for each patient. While maintenance of mood stability is the primary goal, medications must be carefully selected to minimize risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. Behavioural and social interventions should be targeted to minimize stress and prioritize optimal sleep and regular habits. Lastly, women with BD may be at risk for a worsening illness course during the menopausal transition. Pharmacological approaches to mood stabilization are not greatly different in this population, but the elevated risk for sleep impairments should be recognized and any disruption promptly treated.

N2  - Objectives: Whether racial/ethnic differences in prevalence/reporting of sleep disorders exist in pregnant women/women of child-bearing age is unknown. Study objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15–44 years) in the US. Methods: Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis), prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status, and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % non-pregnant (p p < 0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white women when controlling for amount of sleep. Among pregnant women, these same trends were found. Discussion: Compared to white women, minority women, despite reporting less adequate sleep, are less likely to report trouble sleeping, providing evidence of an important health disparity.

N2  - Aims: A longitudinal birth cohort provides an opportunity to study the impact of childhood conditions persisting into adulthood. This study examines the cross-sectional association of asthma with sleep quality and snoring in the adolescent and young adult population and the extent to which asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years independently predict themselves or each other at 21 years. Methods: Data from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater–University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015 participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 and 21 years. Results: Poor sleep quality and snoring were independently associated with asthma at 14 years and 21 years, with stronger associations evident in women. At 21 years, associations were mediated by asthma symptom severity. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years each strongly and independently predicted themselves at 21 years. Asthma at 14 years predicted snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index. Conclusions: The relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21 years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Recent studies have shown associations between maternal obesity at pre- or early pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopment in children, suggesting in utero effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain development. In this study, we examined whether brain functional connectivity to the prefrontal lobe network is different in newborns from normal-weight or obese mothers. Thirty-four full-term healthy infants from uncomplicated pregnancies were included, with 18 born to normal-weight and 16 born to obese mothers. Two weeks after delivery, the infants underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during natural sleep, which included structural imaging and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Independent component analysis was used to identify the prefrontal lobe network, and dual regression was used to compare functional connectivity between groups. Infants born to normal-weight mothers had higher recruiting (P P in utero may be associated with changes in resting-state functional connectivity in the newborn offspring’s brain.

N2  - Background: Depression during pregnancy is a common and high impact disease. Generally, 5–10 % of pregnant women suffer from depression. Children who have been exposed to maternal depression during pregnancy have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes and more often show cognitive, emotional and behavioural problems. Therefore, early detection and treatment of antepartum depression is necessary. Both psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, first choice treatments in a non-pregnant population, have limitations in treating depression during pregnancy. Therefore, it is urgent and relevant to investigate alternative treatments for antepartum depression. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a promising treatment for pregnant women with depressive disorder, for it combines direct availability, sufficient efficacy, low costs and high safety, taking the safety for the unborn child into account as well. Methods: In this study, 150 pregnant women (12–18 weeks pregnant) with a DSM-V diagnosis of depressive disorder will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms: treatment with BLT (9.000 lux) or treatment with dim red light therapy (100 lux). Both groups will be treated for 6 weeks at home on a daily basis for 30 min, within 30 min of habitual wake-up time. Follow-up will take place after 6 weeks of therapy, 3 and 10 weeks after end of therapy, at birth and 2, 6 and 18 months postpartum. Primary outcome will be the average change in depressive symptoms between the two groups, as measured by the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale—Seasonal Affective Disorder version and the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale. Changes in rating scale scores of these questionnaires over time will be analysed using generalized linear mixed models. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in maternal cortisol and melatonin levels, in maternal sleep quality and gestational age, birth weight, infant behaviour, infant cortisol exposure and infant cortisol stress response. Discussion: If BLT reduces depressive symptoms in pregnant women, it will provide a safe, cheap, non-pharmacological and efficacious alternative treatment for psychotherapy and antidepressant medication in treating antepartum depression, without any expected adverse reactions for the unborn child.

N2  - Pregnancy is a time characterized by vast hormonal and physiologic changes. The dramatic increase in estrogen and progesterone impacts sleep architecture and produces systemic effects that may disrupt sleep. As pregnancy progresses, women experience a progressive increase in both the number and duration of nocturnal awakenings. The awakenings arise from a myriad of causes, including nocturia, nausea, heartburn, pain, and anxiety. Short sleep duration and poor quality sleep during pregnancy have been associated with a multitude of adverse outcomes, including maternal depression, gestational diabetes, prolonged labors, higher rate of cesarean deliveries, preterm birth, and low-birth-weight infants. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are two of the most common sleep disorders during pregnancy. Both of these disorders may cause significant sleep disruption and daytime fatigue. RLS has been associated with an increased risk for maternal depression, preeclampsia, and need for cesarean delivery. Treatment of RLS during pregnancy is focused on repletion of iron stores, elimination of factors that may exacerbate RLS, and management of symptoms with behavioral techniques. SDB may increase the risk for intrauterine growth retardation, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and preeclampsia. CPAP has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for treatment of SDB during pregnancy. By optimizing sleep hygiene, utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy, and employing measures to reduce discomfort, heartburn, and nocturia, clinicians may improve a woman’s sleep. Due to concerns of risk to the fetus, pharmacologic treatment of insomnia during pregnancy is reserved for women with severe symptoms refractory to conservative measures.

N2  - Preconception health refers to the health of males and females at any point in time prior to a potential pregnancy. A goal of preconception health research is to use preventive behaviour and healthcare to optimize the health of future offspring that result from both planned and unplanned pregnancies. This paper briefly reviews evidence of the importance of various preconception health behaviours, and examines the extent to which specific preconception health behaviours have been included in recent studies of such knowledge, behaviours, and intentions. To describe this recent research in highly developed countries, a scoping review of the literature was completed of studies published within the past seven years. A total of 94 studies on preconception health were identified and reviewed: (a) 15 examined knowledge and attitudes, (b) 68 studied behaviours, (c) 18 examined interventions designed to improve knowledge or behaviour, and (d) no studies examined intentions to engage in preconception health behaviours. Over 40% of studies examining preconception health behaviour focussed exclusively on folic acid. Overall, folic acid, alcohol, and cigarettes have consistently been topics of focus, while exposure to harmful environmental substances, stress, and sleep have been largely neglected. Despite strong evidence for the importance of men's health during the preconception period, only 11% of all studies included male participants. Based on existing gaps in the research, recommendations are provided, such as including men in future research, assessing a wider variety of behaviours, consideration of behavioural intentions, and consideration of the relationships between preconception health knowledge, intentions, and behaviour.

N2  - Background: Prenatal maternal obesity has been linked to adverse childhood neuropsychiatric outcomes, including increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing and externalizing problems, affective disorders and neurodevelopmental problems but few studies have studied neuropsychiatric outcomes among offspring born to very severely obese women or assessed potential familial confounding by maternal psychological distress. Method: We evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in 112 children aged 3–5 years whose mothers had participated in a longitudinal study of obesity in pregnancy (50 very severe obesity, BMI ⩾ 40 kg/m², obese class III and 62 lean, BMI 18.5–25 kg/m²). The mothers completed the Conners’ Hyperactivity Scale, Early Symptomatic Syndrome Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examination Questionnaire (ESSENCE-Q), Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess child neuropsychiatric symptoms. Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively. Results: Children exposed to prenatal maternal very severe obesity had significantly higher scores in the Conners’ Hyperactivity Scale; ESSENCE-Q; total sleep problems in CSHQ; hyperactivity, conduct problems and total difficulties scales of the SDQ; higher externalizing and total problems, anxious/depressed, aggressive behaviour and other problem syndrome scores and higher DSM-oriented affective, anxiety and ADHD problems in CBCL. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity remained a significant predictor of child neuropsychiatric problems across multiple scales independent of demographic factors, prenatal factors and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Prenatal maternal very severe obesity is a strong predictor of increased neuropsychiatric problems in early childhood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - We evaluated the psychometric properties of a Mandarin Chinese version of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire‐10 (FOSQ‐10) in pregnant women. A total of 228 first‐trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .85), adequate corrected item‐total correlations (from .40 to .67), and acceptable test–retest reliability over 7 days (ICC = .73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one‐factor structure with item loadings between .49 and .77. Significant associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short‐Form Health Survey 12 version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion‐related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ‐10 is a valid and reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep‐related impairment in Chinese women during pregnancy. Further testing is needed in more diverse pregnant women, such as women with complicated pregnancies and those with sleep disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)
