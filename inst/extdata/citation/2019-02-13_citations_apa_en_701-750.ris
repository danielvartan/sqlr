N2  - Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the limbs accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, leading to disturbed sleep and a poor quality of life. Symptoms usually begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, and are partly or completely relieved by active movement. Symptoms tend to worsen in the evening and at night. RLS is a chronic neurological condition that occurs in two forms, a primary disorder independent of other disorders, and a form that is secondary to other conditions such as pregnancy, iron deficiency, and end-stage renal disease. RLS affects about 5%-10% of the general adult population, but the risk increases in the elderly and in women. It can also affect children and adolescents, and is more common in children with ADHD. In this issue of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment the biopsychosocial aspects of RLS and particularly mental health problems like disturbances of mood and cognition are reviewed.

N2  - Retrospective (questionnaire) and prospective (5-day diary) self-reports of sleep were obtained from 209 women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. On average, the women slept for 465 min, took around 20 min to get to sleep, and were awake for just over 30 min after initial sleep onset having woke 2.6 times on average. Sleep efficiency was around 89%. Significant differences were found between retrospective and prospective reports only on the number of minutes awake after sleep onset and on sleep efficiency. However, these differences were small. Retrospective and prospective reports were only moderately correlated. These results were not markedly different from values reported in much smaller, previous studies of pregnant women using polysomnography, suggesting that the self-reports were valid. The findings suggest that sleep parameters are not as adversely affected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy as is generally believed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Pregnant women have been prescribed bed rest for a variety of reasons: preterm labor, incompetent cervix, high-blood pressure, multiple gestation, placenta previa, and many other patient-specific complications. However, while the prescription of bed rest has become routine, the effectiveness of this potentially harmful treatment is still controversial. Pregnant women that are confined to bed rest are at an increased risk for physical, emotional and economic hardships. By understanding these effects, utilizing appropriate interventions and educating this at-risk population on coping strategies, we as health care providers, can improve the quality of care we give our patients during this life-changing event.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the incidence of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in pregnant women and the effect of the RLS on the sleep quality of the women during pregnancy. Methods: 113 pregnant women were evaluated by using International RLS Scale, PSQI (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Inventory). Results: The prevalence of RLS in pregnant women in the outpatient department was 12.4% (14/113), the percentage of RLS pregnant women with PSQI total score higher than 7 was 28.6%, and that was 10.1% in the pregnant women without RLS (χ² = 3.86, P < 0.05). Other factors such as age, annual income were not related to RLS. Conclusions: The sleep quality of pregnant women with RLS is poor, and the age, annual income have no relation to the incidence of RLS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep disorders are linked with mood disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824 women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances following an induced abortion compared to a birth. The difference was most pronounced in the first 180 days after pregnancy resolution and was not significant after the third year. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This short work describes a phase in the treatment of Tea, a little girl in analysis since three age for serious sleep disturbances, feeding difficulties and problems with excretion. Tea was born during the sixth month of pregnancy after an induced labour. She weighed 600 grams because the placenta was not feeding her. She spent many months in an incubator fighting serious infections which often brought her dangerously close to death. From an organic point of view, she is a healthy child with a lively intelligence and an extremely rich, expressive and appropriate vocabulary. The work discusses some methods of interpretation and their result in the work of smoothing down the little girl's defences: on recommencing after the summer break, she is tending to exercise an inflexible control over the analyst, designed to avoid contact with feelings of fragility, impotence and need which are intolerable for her at the moment.

N2  - We report the case of a 32-year-old woman hospitalized for a brief psychotic disorder with postpartum onset. Gestation proceeded without major problems, delivery occurred at term uneventfully. Breastfeeding was initiated after birth. At day 9 postpartum, the mother presented auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusional ideas. Her behavior was grossly disorganized and her speech incoherent. She was hospitalized with her infant. At admission, she received haloperidol 5 mg and levopromazine 25 mg IM. Olanzapine 20 mg/d was prescribed the same day, levopromazine was required to control anxiety and sleep troubles. On the mother's request and after informed consent, nursing was discontinued the day of admission. Olanzapine was administrated each day at 5:30 PM. Breast milk spontaneously produced was collected by an electric pump twice a day, homogenized, and 7 mL aliquots were kept for analysis. In this case report, olanzapine appears to be excreted into breast milk in relatively small amounts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This research examined the subjective experiences of eight childless women nearing the end of fecundity who had delayed childbearing without consciously choosing to do so. A primary goal was to understand the role that conscious and unconscious psychological forces played in these women's reproductive lives and decisions. Conscious and unconscious conflict toward motherhood and pregnancy were explored via semi-structured interviews and projective cards from the TAT and Pregnancy TAT (Murray, 1943; Knobel & Vigneau, 1967). The author does not take a pronatalist position. Rather, the assumption is that unconscious or unwitting avoidance and postponement of decisions about reproductive choices is an undesirable outcome, one that may lead to strong disappointment and regret once the biological clock runs out. Results yielded a list of common factors that appear to have contributed to reproductive delay. All participants consciously stated a desire to have children, and expressed the feeling that forces out of their control have led to their delay. All participants appeared to externalize the reasons for their delay to the men they have dated or married. The most noteworthy finding was the influence of childhood object relations on childbearing conflict. Specifically, a striking lack of parental nurturance, love, and affection was reported by all subjects. Other findings common among the majority of participants included: a history of significant childhood trauma or loss that was never discussed; disavowal of maternal identification; avoidance of responsibility as adults; pregnancy fears including body image concerns with pregnancy; anger at parents due to childhood treatment; use of defense mechanisms such as repression, denial, and intellectualization to protect against reality that childbearing may not be possible; mis-information about fertility including a belief that women can easily conceive children into their late forties and beyond, being youngest child in family of origin; older childless siblings; and a lack of parental encouragement to have children. While these common factors may ultimately have value in identifying women who are at risk for unwitting or unconsciously delayed childbearing which later results in profound disappointment, future research is needed to clarify and generalize these findings.

N2  - The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and (b) to determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant ( ≤31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had no apparent effect on lactation.

N2  - A huge amount of knowledge about sleep has accumulated during the last 5 decades following the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nevertheless, there are numerous areas of considerable ignorance. One of these concerns the particularities of sleep in women. Most basic and clinical studies have been performed in male subjects, and only very recently research groups around the world have addressed women's sleep in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge on the influence of oestrogens on the brain and on the distinctive changes of sleep across the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and menopause. In addition, studies in female rodents are reviewed as well as the knowledge on female peculiarities regarding the interactions between sleep regulation and age-related changes in circadian rhythms. We also address specific aspects of sleep loss and sleep disorders in women. Finally, very recent studies on the sociology of sleep are summarized and future directions in the field are discussed.

N2  - Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal smoking, sleeping position, sleep state and postnatal age on heart rate changes following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation in infants. Subjects: We studied healthy term infants, 13 of whom were born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Each infant was studied using daytime polysomnography on 3 occasions: (a) 2-3 weeks, (b) 2-3 months and (c) 5-6 months after birth. Nasal air-jet stimulation was presented in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. Results: We found no difference between infants of smoking and non-smoking mothers in any of the parameters measured. Minimum HR (MinHR) following nonarousing trigeminal stimulation was significantly lower in the supine compared to the prone sleeping position at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months of age (p<0.05) in AS, and at all 3 ages in QS (p<0.01). MinHR was significantly lower in QS compared to AS at 2-3 months when infants slept prone and at 5-6 months when sleeping supine (p<0.01). In QS, MinHR became lower with increasing postnatal age in both sleep positions (p<0.01). In AS, there was no maturational effect. The normalized bradycardia (AHR%) was significantly greater in AS than in QS at 2-3 weeks of age (p<0.05) when infants slept supine. Conclusion: Our study has shown that there was a decrease in heart rate (MinHR) following trigeminal stimulation in infants up to 6 months of age and this was affected by sleep position and sleep state, being larger in the supine sleeping position and the QS state.

N2  - Objectives: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants. Design: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone. Setting: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center. Participants: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study. Interventions: None. Results: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. Conclusions: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

These evidence-based practice parameters are complementary to the Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, published in 1999.1 These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitor, and the dopaminergic agonists pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Other dopamine agonists (talipexole, cabergoline, piribidel, and alpha-dihydroergocryptine) and the dopaminergic agents amantadine and selegiline may be effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD, but the level of effectiveness of these medications is not currently established. Lastly, no specific recommendations can be made regarding dopaminergic treatment of children or pregnant women with RLS or PLMD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: In a large unselected population of normal spontaneous pregnancies, to estimate the biologic variation of the interval from the first day of the last menstrual period to start of pregnancy, and the biologic variation of gestational length to delivery; and to estimate the random error of routine ultrasound assessment of gestational age in mid-second trimester. Study design: Cohort study of 11,238 singleton pregnancies, with spontaneous onset of labour and reliable last menstrual period. The day of delivery was predicted with two independent methods: According to the rule of Nagele and based on ultrasound examination in gestational weeks 17-19. For both methods, the mean difference between observed and predicted day of delivery was calculated. The variances of the differences were combined to estimate the variances of the two partitions of pregnancy. Results: The biologic variation of the time from last menstrual period to pregnancy start was estimated to 7.0 days (standard deviation), and the standard deviation of the time to spontaneous delivery was estimated to 12.4 days. The estimate of the standard deviation of the random error of ultrasound assessed foetal age was 5.2 days. Conclusion: Even when the last menstrual period is reliable, the biologic variation of the time from last menstrual period to the real start of pregnancy is substantial, and must be taken into account. Reliable information about the first day of the last menstrual period is not equivalent with reliable information about the start of pregnancy.

N2  - The study estimates the unpredictable disorder (chaos) within the 24 h pattern of sinus R-R intervals (SRRI) in clinically healthy pregnant women (CHPW) and clinically healthy non-pregnant women (CHNPW), in order to evaluate the early gestational changes in neurovegetative cardiac pacing. SRRI were provided by the 24-h Holter ECG of 10 CHPW and 10 CHNPW. SRRI were investigated by descriptive conventional statistics by means of the Time and Frequency Domain Analysis, and subsequently, in their chaotic component by means of entropy analysis. Both the SRRI and entropy were tested via the Cosinor method to better decipher whether or not the periodic disorder in heart rate variability is modified in pregnancy as a result of a gestational tonic resetting of the cardiac sympatho-vagal regulation. Cosinor analysis documented that the circadian rhythm of both the SRRI and entropy were preserved in CHNPW and CHPW. However, the circadian rhythm of SRRI and entropy in CHPW exhibited a significantly decreased 24 h mean. Via the analysis of the rhythmicity of entropy, this study has documented that the chaos in the 24 h pattern of SRRI is less prominent in CHPW than in CHNPW. Such a reduction of level in the deterministic periodic chaos of heart rate variability provides evidence that, in early pregnancy, a tonic elevation of the sympathetic activity regulates cardiac pacing.

N2  - Eighty pregnant women were assessed for depression during mid-pregnancy (Mean gestational age = 25.9 weeks) and shortly after delivery in order to assess the effects of the onset and chronicity of maternal depression on neonatal behavior. The women were classified as reporting depressive symptoms: (1) only during the prepartum assessment; (2) only during the postpartum assessment; (3) during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments; or (4) reporting no depressive symptoms at either the prepartum or the postpartum assessment. Neonates born to mothers reporting symptoms of depression at any time point exhibited greater indeterminate sleep than neonates of non-depressed mothers. Neonates born to mothers reporting prenatal depression spent more time fussing and crying and exhibited more stress behaviors than neonates born to non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression only during the postpartum assessment. Finally, neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments exhibited less optimal Brazelton neurobehavioral assessment scores than neonates of non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers who exhibited symptoms of depression during only the prepartum or only during the postpartum assessments. Taken together these findings suggest that neonatal behavior is influenced not just by the presence but also by the timing and duration of maternal depression symptoms.

N2  - Evaluation of risk factors and short-term outcomes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are essential to identify infants in need of developmental intervention after discharge. This study examined risk factors with the potential to affect short-term neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes in preterm infants born at <31 weeks gestation. Data were obtained in a larger longitudinal randomized study of the effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness on health. Severity of neurological insults and caffeine use predicted poorer neurobehavioral outcomes; and severity of neurological insults, caffeine use, length of hospitalization and ventilator days were associated with altered sleep-wake state organization. There were no significant effects of environmental lighting on the short-term developmental outcomes of preterm infants. Early knowledge of an infant's neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes can provide families and health care providers with important information to target the utilization of early intervention services.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe factors associated with actigraphic and subjective sleep quality in young women. Methods: Participants were 73 regularly menstruating women, 20-40 years old, who were not taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, or shift workers. Women contributed an average of 7 nights of actigraphy data during the luteal menstrual cycle phase, resulting in a total of 595 nights of data. Results: One night of actigraphy data was unreliable for measuring total sleep time, sleep onset, and time in bed (intraclass correlation ≤.15) but was acceptable for measuring sleep efficiency and total wake time (intraclass correlation [ICC]=.52). Going to bed late, medication use, employment, increased daylight hours, longer menstrual cycle length, and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with poorer actigraphic sleep measures. Employment, age, and perceived stress were associated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusion: Multiple factors were associated with sleep quality in these young women who were sleeping at home. However, the associations differed for subjectively versus actigraphically assessed sleep quality. Actigraphy is feasible for measuring sleep, but multiple recording nights may be needed to obtain reliable estimates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Prematurity, delivery prior to 37 weeks gestation, is the primary cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Extensive research on its prevention and management reveals that corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and cytokines play significant roles in the development of preterm labor. These substances also influence sleep, suggesting a possible, but previously unexplored, association between sleep pattern changes and preterm labor. Thus, in order to begin a systematic examination of this potentially important relationship, this study explored subjective sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. The Bi-Dimensional Stress Model, which describes the influence of physiological and psychosocial stress in stimulating the immune and endocrine responses associated with preterm birth, provided the theoretical framework for this study. The design consisted of a convenience sample of 220 subjects participating in a descriptive, prospective, comparative study. Subjects completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) during routine antenatal visits in the second trimester of pregnancy. Delivery outcome data identified those subjects who delivered preterm. Sleep latency, a component of the PSQI and a measure of the period from "lights out" to sleep onset, was longer in those who delivered preterm compared to those who delivered at term. The daytime dysfunction score, a component of the PSQI and a measure of problems with maintenance of alertness, was higher in those who experienced a term delivery. No differences were detected between the preterm and term groups in the total scores of the other primary variables (PSQI, ESS, and PSS), in the other sleep variables measured by the PSQI (sleep efficiency, total sleep time), or in the other component scores of the PSQI. The preterm group reported more cigarette smoking, previous preterm births, and experienced more twin gestations than the term group. However, only previous preterm birth and sleep latency were predictive of preterm birth. This study represents the first investigation to explore the potential relationship between sleep and preterm labor. Outcomes from this research suggest a possible, relationship between sleep onset insomnia and preterm birth. In addition, recommendations for further research are identified.

N2  - This study examined the association between maternal smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during pregnancy and infant heart rate. Participants were 62 mother-infant dyads where mother smoked during pregnancy, 47 dyads where mother did not smoke during pregnancy but was exposed to ETS and 47 dyads where mother did not smoke and was not exposed to ETS. Average heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed at 2-4 weeks of age during sleep. Infants in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than nonexposed infants. Furthermore, boys in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than girls. These results highlight the importance of considering prenatal ETS exposure and infant gender when assessing infant outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Study Objective: Changes in sleep-disordered breathing associated with late pregnancy have not previously been systematically investigated; however, a number of case reports indicate exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea in late pregnancy, often in association with maternal hypertension. We aimed to compare the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state. Design: Case-controlled, longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and postpartum. Study Patients: Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 ± 15 per hour antenatally to 18 ± 4 per hour postnatally (P = .03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 ± 11 per hour to 22 ± 4 per hour (P = .002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was increased from 86% ± 2% antenatally to 91% ± 1% postnatally (P = .01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally. Conclusion: This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.

The convergent and discriminant evidence was analyzed with the domains of COOP-WONCA Charts and The Nottinghan Health Profil: the life satisfaction obtained significant relationship with the indicators of the mental domain and it didn't show significant relation with the physical domain. The items about social domain and then those related to energy, pain and sleep showed statistically significant relations, but lower than those related to the psychological domain.

N2  - Studies based on conventional office blood pressure (BP) measurements concluded that both maternal age and parity have significant effects on BP during pregnancy. Previous results have also indicated predictable trends of BP variability with gestational age. Accordingly, we have evaluated possible differences in the circadian pattern of ambulatory BP as a function of parity, maternal age, and stage of gestation in normotensive women who were systematically studied by ambulatory BP monitoring during their pregnancies. We analyzed 1408 BP profiles obtained from 126 nulliparous and 109 multiparous pregnant women sampled for 48 consecutive h every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery. Data were divided for comparative analysis according to parity (nulliparous versus multiparous), age (≤25, 26-30, 31-35, and ≥36 yrs), and trimester of gestation. Circadian BP parameters established by population multiple-components analysis were compared between groups using a nonparametric test. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern described by a model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12h is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic BP for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (always p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the 24h mean among groups divided by parity at any age or stage of pregnancy. A trend of increasing BP with age was found for diastolic but not for systolic BP. Although statistically significant, differences in the 24h mean of diastolic BP among groups divided by age were always less than 2 mm Hg. Data obtained from systematic ambulatory monitoring in normotensive pregnant women indicate the lack of differences in BP according to parity. The small, although significant, increase in diastolic BP with age may have scarce influence in the proper identification of women with gestational hypertension. Reference thresholds for BP to be used in the early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy could thus be developed as a function of the rest-activity cycle and gestational age only, and independently of parity or maternal age.

N2  - The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness. An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past. Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

N2  - Supplementation during pregnancy forms a vital part of the well-being and development of the unborn child as well as the mother. Very often different brands of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals are taken, without considering the possibility of exceeding the maximum daily allowance, particularly where it concerns fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A. Although many people are aware of the consequences of taking too little vitamin A, this fat-soluble vitamin is stored in the body and over-dosage may occur when taking high doses. In this paper we investigate the effects of hypo- and hypervitaminosis A on craniofacial structures, lungs, hearts, limbs and the kidneys as well as the involvement in foetal nervous system development and post-natal sensorimotor functioning. Furthermore, we discuss how hypo- and hypervitaminosis A may affect the midline and lateral parts of the cerebellum, vermis, flocculi, ganglionic cell layer as well as the suprachiasmatic nucleas of the brain. Changes in the functioning of these areas due to hypo- and hypervitaminosis A, may lead to developmental and learning disabilities involving all forms of motor learning, vestibular functioning, eye and visual system deficits, disrupted sleep rhythms as well as altered mood and emotional processes.

N2  - Our understanding of when the fetus can experience pain has been largely shaped by neuroanatomy. However, completion of the cortical nociceptive connections just after mid-gestation is only one part of the story. In addition to critically reviewing evidence for whether the fetus is ever awake or aware, and thus able to truly experience pain, we examine the role of endogenous neuroinhibitors, such as adenosine and pregnanolone, produced within the feto-placental unit that contribute to fetal sleep states, and thus mediate suppression of fetal awareness. The uncritical view that the nature of presumed fetal pain perception can be assessed by reference to the prematurely born infant is challenged. Rigorously controlled studies of invasive procedures and analgesia in the fetus are required to clarify the impact of fetal nociception on postnatal pain sensitivity and neural development, and the potential benefits or harm of using analgesia in this unique setting.

N2  - Prenatal depression effects include excessive activity in the fetus and unresponsive behavior, low activity levels, indeterminate sleep, low vagal tone, and atypical patterns of frontal EEG activation in the newborn. The fetuses and neonates of depressed mothers differ as a function of their mothers' type of depressive behavior, including withdrawn or intrusive behavior. The different neurotransmitter imbalance in withdrawn and intrusive depressed mothers during pregnancy (elevated norepinephrine, depressed serotonin, and depressed dopamine in withdrawn mothers and elevated norepinephrine, depressed serotonin, but elevated dopamine in the intrusive mothers) may contribute to the differences noted in their fetuses and neonates. Fetal activity is greater in the fetuses of withdrawn mothers than the fetuses of intrusive mothers. By the neonatal stage, the physiological and biochemical profiles of these infants match their mothers' profiles. The differential dysregulation pattern noted at the neonatal period is then compounded by inadequate stimulation and arousal modulation from the depressed mothers, with the intrusive mothers being overstimulating and the withdrawn mothers being understimulating. By preschool, the children of withdrawn mothers are exhibiting internalizing problems and the children of intrusive mothers are showing externalizing problems. This review is uniquely focused on prenatal depression effects, and highlights the need for early identification and intervention for prenatal depression.

N2  - Study Objectives: Recent studies suggest a specific association between intrauterine growth restriction that commonly occurs in preeclampsia and decreased maternal cardiac output. Sleep is associated with marked hypertension in preeclampsia. We therefore aimed to determine how sleep influences other hemodynamic parameters in preeclampsia, specifically to determine if sleep-induced exacerbation of hypertension was associated with reductions in cardiac output. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Setting: King George V, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Patients: Twenty-four women with severe preeclampsia and 15 control nulliparous subjects. Intervention: Full polysomnography including beat-to-beat blood-pressure recording. Stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and ejection duration were derived from the blood pressure waveform. Half of the 24 preeclamptic subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure and the other half to receive no treatment. Measurements and Results: Heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were similar in controls and patients with preeclampsia during wakefulness, while total peripheral resistance was significantly elevated. Sleep induced marked decrements in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output in preeclamptic subjects and resulted in further increments in total peripheral resistance. Cardiac output during sleep was correlated with fetal birth weight (r2 = 0.64, P < .001). When preeclamptic subjects were treated with continuous positive airway pressure, reductions in cardiac output were minimized, while increments in total peripheral resistance were also reduced. Conclusions: These data indicate that sleep is associated with adverse hemodynamic changes in women with preeclampsia. These changes are minimized with the use of continuous positive airway pressure. Reduced cardiac output during sleep may have an adverse effect on fetal development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is implicated in the control of circadian rhythms of gonadal function. Although several structures surrounding the SCN are sensitive to the effects of gonadal steroids, similar effects in the SCN remain unclear. For example, there are conflicting data on whether the SCN is sexually differentiated. This study attempted to determine sex differences in the number of SCN cells generated during late gestation, and if testosterone mediates these differences. Pregnant female rats were treated with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) on gestational day 18 (E18), the day when aromatase activity peaks in the developing rat fetus. These animals were also given injections of oil or testosterone propionate (10 mg/0.1 mL peanut oil) from E15 until parturition. Litters were allowed to survive until adulthood and were killed on postnatal day 60 (PN60). Following fixation, brain sections containing the SCN from these rats were processed for BrdU immunocytochemistry. A second set of SCN sections was processed for immunocytochemistry detecting BrdU and some of the cell groups prevalent within the SCN. Data showed that female rats have a higher number of cells labeled with BrdU in the SCN, particularly in the medial and caudal SCN. This sex difference was abolished in animals treated with testosterone during late gestation. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that BrdU-labeled cells were neurons expressing calbindin-D28K, vasoactive intestinal peptide and, to a lesser degree, vasopressin. Our results unveiled a previously unknown effect of gonadal steroids on the developing SCN, which may contribute to the emergence of gender-specific circadian rhythms.

N2  - Research addressing the effects of maternal cognitive changes during pregnancy has yielded equivocal findings with both confirmatory and negative results appearing fairly equally in the literature. In an attempt to evaluate and further test this phenomena, 45 women where tracked from early pregnancy until postnatal resumption of menses. An age and education matched control group of 45 non-pregnant women were tested concurrently. At each of the five test sessions participants completed a battery of cognitive tests. Results showed no effect of pregnancy on any of the dependent measures, with pregnant women performing no worse than control women on the nine cognitive tasks administered. One possible explanation for this negative finding (and the research ambiguity in this area) could be linked to the sex of the fetus. When fetal sex was considered, a selective and persistent effect on maternal cognitive function was observed. Those women pregnant with sons consistently outperformed women pregnant with daughters on the tests of working memory. On several other cognitive tests fetal sex was unrelated to maternal performance. This effect was evident from the first test session and persisted until the final session and was unrelated to sleep, mood and demographic measures. This result suggests either a fetal-derived factor that differs in type or concentration between male and female fetuses may influence the mothers' cognition both during pregnancy and into the postnatal phase. Or, alternatively, qualities inherent to the mother may be related to both her propensity to deliver a specific sex and her cognitive profile. Both possible explanations are discussed.

N2  - Objectives: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Methods: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). Results: Overall, 9.2% of all women "usually" chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%). Compared to health department prenatal clinic patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep position, adjusted odds ratio=4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92). Conclusions: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs. Providers--especially private providers--should continue to stress the importance of supine sleep position for infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This study examines the prenatal-postnatal relationship. Recent studies have shown that a mother's psychological state and attachment to her fetus affects the infant's regulatory capacities after birth. Ninety women during their 35th to 40th week of singleton, low-risk pregnancies and their infants postnatally participated in this study. The study used the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI) (Muller, 1993), which consists of 21 items and assesses the mother's prenatal attachment to her fetus. The participants charted their prenatal sleep and their 1-week-old and 3-month-old infant's postnatal sleep over a 3-day period using the Sleep/Activity Record (SAR) (Barnard, 1999). Assessed infant sleep characteristics included average number of sleep segments, longest sustained sleep, and total sleep over three 24-hour periods. These scores were then correlated with the PAI score and total maternal prenatal sleep. Correlational analysis revealed that contrary to expectations, PAI scores did not correlate with either infant sleep segments or longest sustained sleep. The study found an inverted correlation between PAI scores and infant total sleep at 1 week. The study also found an inverted correlation between maternal total sleep and infant sleep segments at 1 week and 3 months. Furthermore, 1-week-old infant sleep correlated with 3-month-old infant sleep. The study extends current literature on prenatal to postnatal continuity.

N2  - Interactions exist between progestins and the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A where C₂₁-steroids function as activators. Other interactions between progesterone and neurotransmitter systems include stimulation of dopamine release in striatal tissue, stimulation of GnRH release from hypothalamic neurons and inhibition of opioid receptor binding and activation. Cyproterone acetate increases dopaminergic responses and binds to opiate receptors independently of its classical effect on the androgen receptor. Progesterone substitution in perimenopausal women promotes length and quality of sleep. Progestins also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Migraine symptoms occur predominantly during the perimenstrual stage. Women who suffer from menstrual migraine triggered by premenstrual progesterone loss often benefit from cyclic progesterone administration. Women whose migraine symptoms subside during pregnancy, however, benefit from intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate. Myelination of axons is promoted when progesterone is added to cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. Progestins promote the growth of meningioma as progesterone receptors predominate in meningioma tissue. Progesterone and synthetic progestins should therefore not be prescribed in these patients.

N2  - The signs that characterize motoric, psychosocial and mental development, and temperament of children were selected from the data of mothers and attending physicians in examination of children at the age of 3 and 5 years within the scope of the prospective longitudinal study-ELSPAC. The prenatal and early postnatal exposition of children to cigarette smoke was assessed according to mothers' testimonies about their smoking behavior, which was mapped 6 weeks after child delivery. The followed data was gathered about 3,400 3-year-old and 4,983 5-year-old children: 90.5% of children in both stages of the examination was not exposed to smoking; 7.2% of children had mothers that smoked during the whole pregnancy period. The prenatal expositions of children to passive smoking was related to significantly more frequent absence of skills requiring more complicated motoric coordination, as well as to occurrence of data on absentmindedness, inability to concentrate oneself, hyperactivity, absence of social plays and absence of contacts with other children, and manifestations of aggressive behavior. At the age of 5 years, the exposed group manifested more frequent signals of possible delay in school maturity development. The physicians, in both stage of examination, found in the exposed children-with greater frequency significance-a delayed mental development in the area of vocabulary-expression advancement, concentration, socialization, school maturity, and significant negativisms. Significantly higher was also the frequency of sleep and food disorders in these children, and-on the contrary, the lowest occurrence of the apparent right-hand preference.

N2  - Activity-rest behavior of 20 neonates born vaginally, 18 neonates born by medically planned Cesarean section (C-section), and 19 neonates born by medically required C-section after labor onset (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record and show time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small wristwatch-like Actiwatch® actometers. Nursing/feeding times were recorded by using the actometers' integrated event marker button. Recordings in both C-section groups were performed in the hospital; for neonates born vaginally and for some born by C-section, recordings were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation. Amount of sleep time during daytime, nighttime, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during the daytime and nighttime, were compared. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in women and men, the course of illness tends to be more severe in women. In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.

N2  - Objective: To examine the association between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and physiological measures of regulation, which included heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Methods: Potential mediators and moderators of this association were explored. Participants were 141 mother-infant dyads (77 cocaine exposed and 64 nonexposed) recruited at birth. Average infant HR and RSA was assessed at 4-8 weeks of age during a 15 minute period of sleep. Results: Results indicated a dose-dependent effect of prenatal exposure to cocaine on RSA. There was no evidence that fetal growth or other prenatal exposure to substances mediated this association or that fetal growth or maternal age moderated this association. Regression analyses also indicated that birth weight (BW), but not birthlength (BL), head circumference (HC) or other substance use, mediated the association between prenatal exposure to cocaine and heart rate. Conclusions: These results suggest that cocaine exposure is associated with physiological regulation at 4-8 weeks of age and highlight the importance of considering level of exposure when assessing infant outcomes.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to test whether serum concentrations of leptin in ewes vary with a daily rhythm. For this purpose, we examined 24 h serum leptin profiles of ewes exposed to natural photoperiodic conditions and subjected to two different feeding schedules (regular feeding and fasting). The results show for the first time the existence of daily rhythm of plasma leptin in regularly fed ewes, with a minimum during the light phase and a peak during the dark phase. Daily rhythms of serum leptin persisted after 50 h of fasting, although fasting shifted the peak of the rhythm to the beginning of the light phase and significantly reduced daily leptin production. To gain a better understanding of the role of leptin in the temporal organization of physiological events related to pregnancy and lactation, we measured serum leptin profiles throughout 24 h in ewes either during pregnancy or lactation. Daily leptin rhythms were found to persist during pregnancy and lactation, but both physiological conditions altered leptin concentrations. Maternal serum leptin concentration rose between early and mid pregnancy, then decreased in the late pregnancy and during lactation. Daily serum leptin concentration was significantly lower in nonpregnant, nonlactating ewes, compared either to lactating or to early pregnant ewes.

N2  - Bright light therapy was shown to be a promising treatment for depression during pregnancy in a recent open-label study. In an extension of this work, we report findings from a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. Ten pregnant women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned from April 2000 to January 2002 to a 5-week clinical trial with either a 7000 lux (active) or 500 lux (placebo) light box. At the end of the randomized controlled trial, subjects had the option of continuing in a 5-week extension phase. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version was administered to assess changes in clinical status. Salivary melatonin was used to index circadian rhythm phase for comparison with antidepressant results. Although there was a small mean group advantage of active treatment throughout the randomized controlled trial, it was not statistically significant. However, in the longer 10-week trial, the presence of active versus placebo light produced a clear treatment effect (p = .001) with an effect size (0.43) similar to that seen in antidepressant drug trials. Successful treatment with bright light was associated with phase advances of the melatonin rhythm. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Maternal prenatal stress has been found to be related to over-activity and/or dysregulation of the HPA-system in the offspring. These effects are more readily apparent in response to novel situations. The aim of the present report was to examine whether pregnancy stress predicted HPA-axis reactions of children to the first day of school after the summer break. Children of mothers with more prenatal stress were compared to those of mothers with less stress. Habituation was studied by comparisons between the first school day and a second school day a week later. Finally, cortisol levels at school were compared to those of a weekend day. The participants were 29 mother-child pairs (20 girls and nine boys, mean age 5.31 years, SD = 0.50). The children's cortisol levels were determined in saliva. Multilevel analysis (hierarchical linear modelling) was used to analyze the data. Both prenatal cortisol and pregnancy anxiety were related to the children's cortisol levels as a reaction to the first school day. Children whose mothers had higher levels of morning cortisol during pregnancy, and more fear of bearing a handicapped child showed higher levels of cortisol on school days. In addition, the circadian rhythm of cortisol on school days appeared to have a steeper slope as compared to that of the circadian curve on a weekend day.

N2  - Few studies exist that identify a useful self-report measure of physical activity for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 years. The women wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring, the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r = 49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing can occur during pregnancy due to the development of hormonal changes and respiratory function abnormalities that perturb patency of the upper airways. Habitual snoring has been described in 25 p. 100 of the women during the third trimester of pregnancy. The incidence of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome is unknown due to the lack of longitudinal epidemiological data, and results of the main studies are in favor of upper airway resistance syndrome. However, these sleep-related breathing disorders are more frequently associated with maternal and fetal complications such as maternal hypertension, pre eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. This article points out the importance of such associations because of the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure on the regression of these nocturnal respiratory and vascular complications.

N2  - Context: The precise function of sleep in animals and human beings is still unknown, and any sort of physical, social or psychological variation may change the normal sleep-wake cycle. Purpose: This research aims is to determine the sleep disorders (SD) for each of the three trimesters of the pregnancy comparing them to the pre-pregnancy state (PG). Method: SD were investigated in three hundred pregnant women 11- to 40-years-old through with a brief clinical interview based on directed questions. One hundred pregnant women were considered for each trimester. Results: The rate of pregnant women with insomnia increased by 23% in the 2nd trimester (pnd trimester (prd trimester (prd trimester (pst trimester, by 80% in the 2nd trimester and by 84% in the 3rd trimester (p<0.001). Conclusion: SD were more frequent during pregnancy comparatively to PG state, mostly at the expenses of EDS and specific awakenings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine the associations of sleep quality and stage of illness with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected African-American women. Participants were recruited from 12 health clinics and AIDS service organizations (ASO) in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The sample consisted of 144 African-American women who ranged in age from 20 to 48 years (m = 34.8, SD = 6.8). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. Participants were categorized as good sleepers (PSQI global score <7) or poor sleepers (PSQI global score ≥ 7) using the median global sleep quality score. Differences in HRQOL between good and poor sleepers, as measured by the SF-36, were tested using MANOVA. Good sleepers scored significantly higher (p < 0.0001) for each SF-36 quality of life dimension and the mental and physical health summary scores. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep quality is associated with HRQOL, independent of the individual's stage of illness, more so with mental HRQOL than with physical HRQOL. The results suggest that treatment for poor sleep quality should be a primary concern for the treatment of HIV infection and a means for improving HRQOL.

N2  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum "blues," depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders.

N2  - Study Objectives: To clarify the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the relationship between sleep problems and RLS, in order to discuss ways for pregnant women to obtain comfortable sleep and to improve the health of both the mother and child. Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey Setting: 500 clinical institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of organizations identified in a survey by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these 500 institutions, 260 participated in the survey. Participants: 16,528 pregnant women living in Japan Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: In this survey of pregnant women, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%. An analysis was conducted on the relationship between RLS and other factors such as subjective evaluation of sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awaking, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The result of this analysis suggested that women with these sleep-related problems were more likely to have RLS than those without. In addition, RLS was more prevalent in the later stages of pregnancy. Conclusion: In the pregnant women in our survey, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%, which is higher than the prevalence of RLS that has been found in the general public in a previous study. This suggests that RLS-related sleep problems may be an important public health issue among pregnant women in Japan. This finding may have implications for attempts to improve sleep hygiene in this group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Patterns of Sleep in Women: An Overview / Helen S. Driver / Discusses hormonal factors in sleep patterns for women. Specifically, menstrual cycles, pregnancy and postpartum, and menopause issues are discussed.  Sleep During Pregnancy and Postpartum / Kathryn A. Lee / Common reasons for awakenings were compiled from a review of the literature and are presented in Table 82.1 by frequency of occurrence in the first and third trimesters. The anatomical and physiological reasons for these complaints are discussed in the following section.  Menstrual-Related Sleep Disorders / Grace W. Pien and Elizabeth A. Beothy / This chapter will examine changes in sleep and the circadian rhythm during normal menstrual cycles and will review how oral contraceptives and disorders of the menstrual cycle such as dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome affect sleep. Finally, we will describe the features of menstrual-related sleep disorders and review therapies for these conditions.  Sleep Disordered Breathing in Women / M. Safwan Badr / Sleep apnea affects both men and women and should be recognized and treated in both genders. This chapter will address the gender differences in physiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and polysomnographic features of sleep disordered breathing in women versus men.  Sleep During the Perimenopausal Period / Naomi L. Rogers and Ronald R. Grunstein / While much research and attention have focused on the effects of menopause and postmenopause on sleep and physiological changes, there are few reports on the sleep changes that manifest during the perimenopausal period. The primary physiological changes associated with perimenopause include changes in the length and frequency of the menstrual cycle, changes in blood sugar levels, weight gain, decreased sex drive, headaches, increased premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms, night sweats, hot flashes, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.  Sleep During Postmenopause / Karen E. Moe / Women and men experience many of the same age-related changes in sleep, though the extent of these changes appears to vary with gender. More older women than men have sleep complaints. Objective measures show that women are less likely to experience a decline in slowwave sleep (SWS) with age and more likely to experience problems with sleep maintenance. Sleep changes in older women are often associated with chronic physical or mental illness and related factors such as caregiving. In addition, the sleep of older women may be affected by some unique factors such as chronic hot flashes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by smoking and/or drinking. We investigate here the joint effect of smoking and drinking with respect to sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Methods: Survey of about 16,000 pregnant women in Japan, conducted in 2002 using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Both smoking and drinking increased the odds of sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome. The joint odds ratios for smoking and drinking corresponded more or less to the products of the odds ratio for smoking or drinking. Conclusion: Smoking and drinking are independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy, in addition to their other well-known side-effects.

N2  - Links between neonatal biological rhythms and the emergence of interaction rhythms were examined in 3 groups (N=71): high-risk preterms (HR; birth weight <1,000 g), low-risk preterms (LR; birth weight =1,700-1,850 g), and full-term (FT) infants. Once a week for premature infants and on the 2nd day for FT infants, sleep-wake cyclicity was extracted from 4-hr observations and cardiac vagal tone was measured. At term age, infant orientation was tested with the Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale. At 3 months, arousal modulation and emotion regulation were assessed, and mother-infant synchrony was computed from microanalysis of face-to-face interactions using time-series analysis. Sleep-wake amplitudes showed a developmental leap at 31 weeks gestation, followed by a shift in vagal tone at 34 weeks gestation. At term, differences among FT, LR, and HR infants were observed for biological rhythms in a linear-decline pattern. Sleep-wake cyclicity, vagal tone, newborn orientation, and arousal modulation were each uniquely predictive of mother-infant synchrony. The organization of physiological oscillators appears to lay the foundation for the infant's capacity to partake in a temporally matched social dialogue.
