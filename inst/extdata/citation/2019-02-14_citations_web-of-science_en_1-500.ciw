AB Background: Repetitive episodes of hypoxia and reoxygenation during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) resemble an ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to test the hypothesis that oxidative stress occurs in pregnant women with OSAS. We also aimed to compare thiol/disulfide homeostasis with ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as markers of ischemia-reperfusion injury in pregnant women with and without OSAS and healthy control. Methods: This study included 29 pregnant women with OSAS, 30 women without OSAS in the third trimester applying for periodic examinations, and 30 healthy women. Serum IMA and TAC (using the ferric reducing power of plasma method) were measured. Serum thiol/disulfide homeostasis was determined by a novel automated method. Results: The mean age of the pregnant women with OSAS was 31.0 +/- 4.7 years with a mean gestational age of 36.5 +/- 3.0 weeks. The mean age of pregnant women without OSAS was 29.8 +/- 4.9 years with a mean gestational age of 36.9 +/- 2.7 weeks. The mean age of the nonpregnant control group was 29.7 +/- 6.4 years. Both native thiol (291 +/- 29 mu mol/L versus 314 +/- 30 mu mol/L; p = .018) and total thiol (325 +/- 32 versus 350 +/- 32, p = .025) levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to pregnant women without OSAS, respectively (p < .01). Conclusions: This is the first study demonstrating the thiol/disulfide homeostasis in pregnant women with OSAS. Native thiol and total thiol levels were lower in pregnant women with OSAS compared to those without OSAS. However, dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis parameters cannot provide valuable information to discriminate OSAS in pregnant women.

   FULL-TERM; CHILDREN; BEHAVIOR; BRAIN; CHILDHOOD; SMOKING
AB Background: The programming of sleep architecture begins in pregnancy and depends upon optimal in utero formation and maturation of the neural connectivity of the brain. Particulate air pollution exposure can disrupt fetal brain development but associations between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure during pregnancy and child sleep outcomes have not been previously explored.
   Methods: Analyses included 397 mother-child pairs enrolled in a pregnancy cohort in Mexico City. Daily ambient prenatal PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved prediction model. Child sleep periods were estimated objectively using wrist-worn, continuous actigraphy over a 1-week period at age 4-5 years. Data-driven advanced statistical methods (distributed lag models (DLMs)) were employed to identify sensitive windows whereby PM2.5 exposure during gestation was significantly associated with changes in sleep duration or efficiency. Models were adjusted for maternal education, season, child's age, sex, and BMI z-score.
   Results: Mother's average age was 27.7 years, with 59% having at least a high school education. Children slept an average of 7.7 h at night, with mean 80.1% efficiency. The adjusted DLM identified windows of PM2.5 exposure between 31 and 35 weeks gestation that were significantly associated with decreased sleep duration in children. In addition, increased PM2.5 during weeks 1-8 was associated with decreased sleep efficiency. In other exposure windows (weeks 39-40), PM2.5 was associated with increased sleep duration.
   Conclusion: Prenatal PM2.5 exposure is associated with altered sleep in preschool-aged children in Mexico City. Pollutant exposure during sensitive windows of pregnancy may have critical influence upon sleep programming.

AB Objective: To examine whether there is a consensus on what guidance to share with expectant fathers from the prenatal through early infancy period among a multidisciplinary group of professionals with expertise on father involvement.
   Design: Consensus-building approach using mixed methods involving two rounds of data collection. In Round 1, participants were requested to individually generate content as text messages to share with expectant fathers that a father should know or do for his infant, his partner, and himself starting prenatally and through early infancy. A content analysis of Round 1 data was conducted to identify domain content to share with fathers. During Round 2, experts were asked to rate their perceived level of importance of the content generated in Round 1. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means, and standard deviations were calculated for Round 2.
   Setting: Electronic survey.
   Participants: Nine multidisciplinary professionals with expertise on father involvement, representing psychology, pediatrics, nursing/midwifery, and sociology.
   Measurements and findings: During Round 1, participants individually generated 302 message content items across domains in the following contexts: plan for/participate in birth (n = 71); his infant (n = 95); his partner (n = 107); and himself (n = 38). During Round 2, participants achieved greatest consensus in more content items in two contexts: infant support and partner support. For infant support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with for fathers included: knowledge about signs of infant illness, feeding, sleep patterns, and impact of second hand smoke/drug use; training on providing newborn care; and taking action including participating in infant care, providing verbal stimulation, engaging in age-appropriate play and physical contact, supporting safe sleep, and making/attending doctor appointments. For partner support, content domains that participants perceived it important to share with fathers included: communicating with partners with regular check-ins, and about parenting styles and shared responsibilities, signs/symptoms of maternal depression, and hopes/dreams for infant; and taking actions to support partner's physical and emotional health and breastfeeding. Although less content was generated in the other two contexts -plan for/participate in birth and father support - participants achieved consensus on some content in these domains as being important to share with fathers.
   Key conclusions: Despite lack of professional guidelines for expectant fathers, experts generally agreed on the content that should be shared with expectant fathers from pregnancy through early infancy, especially in the domains of infant support and partner support.
   Implications for practice: This study can assist clinicians and practitioners on guidance to share with expectant fathers during their partner's pregnancy and the early postnatal period. Dissemination of such guidance to fathers can assist in benefiting all members of the family. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Peripartum major depression (MD) disables mothers and impairs emotional and neurocognitive development of offspring. We tested the hypothesis that critically-timed wake therapy (WT) relieves peripartum MD by altering melatonin and sleep timing, differentially, in antepartum vs. postpartum depressed patients (DP).
   Methods: In a university clinical research center, we initially randomized 50 women-26 antepartum (17 healthy comparison-HC, 9 DP) and 24 postpartum (8 HC, 16 DP)-to a cross-over trial of one night of early-night wake therapy (EWT: sleep 3: 00-7: 00 am) vs. late-night wake therapy (LWT: sleep 9: 00 pm-01: 00 am). Ultimately, we obtained mood, overnight plasma melatonin and polysomnography for: 15 antepartum women receiving EWT, 18 receiving LWT; 15 postpartum women receiving EWT, 14 receiving LWT.
   Results: EWT improved mood more in antepartum vs. postpartum DP in conjunction with reduced (normalized) melatonin-sleep phase-angle differences (PADs) due to delayed melatonin onsets and advanced sleep onsets, and increased (from baseline) total sleep times (TST). LWT improved mood more in postpartum vs. antepartum DP in conjunction with increased TST.
   Limitations: Small samples potentially rendered the study underpowered to detect group differences, making confirmation with larger samples essential. Sufficient follow-up data were not available in most women to document the duration of the mood response to wake therapy.
   Conclusions: EWT benefitted antepartum DP more by realigning melatonin and sleep timing, whereas LWT benefitted postpartum DP more by increasing TST. Thus, consistent with precision medicine aims, maximum mood benefits accrue from timing sleep/wake interventions to specific peripartum circadian pathophysiologies.

AB Immune homeostasis maintenance throughout pregnancy is critical for normal fetal development. Trophoblast cells differentiate into an invasive phenotype and contribute to the transformation of maternal arteries and the functional shaping of decidual leukocyte populations. Insufficient trophoblast invasion, inadequate vascular remodeling, and a loss of immunologic homeostasis are associated with pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a pleiotropic neuropeptide synthetized in trophoblasts at the maternal-placental interface. It regulates the function of trophoblast cells and their interaction with decidual leukocytes. By means of a murine model of pregnancy in normal maternal background with VIP-deficient trophoblast cells, here we demonstrate that trophoblast VIP is critical for trophoblast function: VIP gene haploinsufficiency results in lower matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression, and reduced migration and invasion capacities. A reduced number of regulatory T cells at the implantation sites along with a lower expression of proangiogenic and antiinflammatory markers were also observed. Findings detected in the implantation sites at early stages were followed by an abnormal placental structure and lower fetal weight. This effect was overcome by VIP treatment of the early pregnant mice. Our results support the relevance of trophoblast-synthesized VIP as a critical factor in vivo for trophoblast-cell function and immune homeostasis maintenance in mouse pregnancy.Hauk, V., Vota, D., Gallino, L., Calo, G., Paparini, D., Merech, F., Ochoa, F., Zotta, E., Ramhorst, R., Waschek, J., Leiros, C.

AB Objective The primary purpose of this study was to examine associations of objectively measured sleep duration with weight changes in black and Hispanic mothers over the first postpartum year. Methods Data were from 159 mothers (69% black, 32% Hispanic). Nocturnal sleep duration was assessed using wrist actigraphy at 6 weeks and 5 months post partum, examined as a continuous variable and in categories (< 7 vs. >= 7 hours/night, consistent with American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendations). Body weights were abstracted from medical records in pregnancy and measured at 6 weeks, 5 months, and 12 months post partum. Outcomes included early postpartum (6 weeks to 5 months) and late postpartum (5 to 12 months) weight changes. Results The majority of participants slept < 7 hours/night at 6 weeks (75%) and 5 months (63%) post partum. Early postpartum weight change did not differ by 6-week sleep duration category. By contrast, adjusted average late postpartum weight gain (SE) was 1.8 (0.7) kg higher in participants sleeping < 7 hours/night at 5 months post partum compared with those sleeping >= 7 hours/night (P = 0.02). Results did not show statistically significant associations of continuous measures of sleep duration, nor of measures of sleep quality, with postpartum weight changes. Conclusions Sleeping < 7 hours/night was associated with late postpartum weight gain in minority mothers.

AB Background: Depression is consistently shown to predict lower rates of breastfeeding. In a handful of studies, breastfeeding has predicted lower depression symptoms. However, studies demonstrating the latter are limited in their measurement of both depression and breastfeeding and have not followed participants from pregnancy across the postpartum period. Research Aim: The primary aim of this study was to describe breastfeeding intentions and behaviors for the first 12 months postpartum among nonmedicated depressed, antidepressant-exposed, and control participants. The secondary aim was to examine group differences in the association between depressive symptoms and breastfeeding duration up to 12 months postpartum. Methods: First-trimester women (N = 212) were recruited into a prospective longitudinal study. Depressive disorders at baseline were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, and depressive symptoms were measured at the first and second trimesters and 6 and 12 months postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Breastfeeding duration, support from family and employers, and perceptions of participants' experience were measured. Results: Depressed women and antidepressant-exposed women reported a trend toward lower rates of intention, initiation, and duration, but this did not reach statistical significance. There was a statistically significant difference on depressive symptoms for women taking antidepressants during pregnancy, compared with controls, when they continued to breastfeed for 12 months postpartum. Conclusions: This study did not find a strong association between depression or antidepressant use and intention to breastfeed, partner breastfeeding support, or initiation or duration of breastfeeding. However, for women who took antidepressants, there was evidence that breastfeeding for 12 months was associated with lower depressive symptoms.

AB Infant mortality remains a problem in the United States with sleep-related deaths accounting for a significant portion. Known risk reduction strategies include breastfeeding, avoiding tobacco use and following the American Academy of Pediatrics' safe sleep guidelines. The purpose of this project was to evaluate outcomes of Safe Sleep Instructor-led community baby showers, which included safe sleep promotion, breastfeeding promotion and tobacco cessation education. Certified Safe Sleep Instructors (n=35) were trained on how to plan and host a Community Baby Shower to provide education to pregnant women of low socioeconomic status or with high risk of infant mortality. Eighteen Community Baby Showers were held across two urban and eight rural counties in Kansas. Surveys were administered pre- and post-event to assess participant knowledge, confidence and intentions to follow through with planned action related to safe sleep, breastfeeding and reducing tobacco risk. Matched data were summarized and evaluated for differences using McNemar's and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. Significant increases were observed in Baby Shower participants' (n=845) reported plans to follow the AAP Safe Sleep guidelines (all p<0.001), likelihood to breastfeed (p<0.001), confidence in ability to breastfeed for more than 6 months (p<0.001), knowledge of local breastfeeding support resources (p<0.001), knowledge of ways to avoid second-hand smoke exposure (p<0.001) and knowledge of local tobacco cessation services (p=0.004). Based on the result of the pre- and post-event surveys, certified Safe Sleep Instructors were able to plan and host successful events to increase knowledge and confidence related to risk reduction strategies to reduce sleep-related infant deaths.

AB BackgroundSmart wristbands enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters, for example, in maternity care. Understanding the feasibility and acceptability of these devices in an authentic context is essential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum.MethodsThe feasibility of a smart wristband was tested prospectively through pregnancy in nulliparous women (n=20). The outcomes measured were the wear time of the device and the participants' experiences with the smart wristband. The data were collected from the wristbands, phone interviews, questionnaires, and electronic patient records. The quantitative data were analyzed with hierarchical linear mixed models for repeated measures, and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis.ResultsParticipants (n=20) were recruited at a median of 12.9weeks of gestation. They used the smart wristbands for an average of 182days during the seven-month study period. The daily use of the devices was similar during the second (17.9h, 95% CI 15.2 to 20.7) and third trimesters (16.7h, 95% CI 13.8 to 19.5) but decreased during the postpartum period (14.4h, 95% CI 11.4 to 17.4, p=0.0079). Participants who could not wear smart wristbands at work used the device 300min less per day than did those with no use limitations. Eight of the participants did not wear the devices or wore them only occasionally after giving birth. Nineteen participants reported that the smart wristband did not have any permanent effects on their behavior. Problems with charging and synchronizing the devices, perceiving the devices as uncomfortable, or viewing the data as unreliable, and the fear of scratching their babies with the devices were the main reasons for not using the smart wristbands.ConclusionsA smart wristband is a feasible tool for continuous monitoring during pregnancy. However, the daily use decreased after birth. The results of this study may support the planning of future studies and help with overcoming barriers related to the use of smart wristbands on pregnant women.

TI Running out of time? Understanding the consequences of the biological
   clock for the dynamics of fertility intentions and union formation
SO DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CHILDBEARING; PERSONALITY; WOMEN
AB BACKGROUND
   A considerable proportion of childless women in their late thirties or early forties would still like to have children. The number of men and women whose fertility intentions are potentially influenced by the so-called biological clock for childbearing and who remain involuntarily childless is increasing.
   OBJECTIVE
   We analyze the short-term dynamics of fertility intentions and partner search among childless, non-partnered men and women aged 35-37. By comparing people in this age group to younger men and women, we investigate whether and how their awareness of the biological clock for childbearing affects their childbearing intentions.
   METHODS
   The data stems from the first two waves of the German Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics (pairfam) survey. We selected male and female respondents aged 25-27 (n = 1,073) and 35-37 (n = 369) in Wave 1.
   RESULTS
   Our analyses reveal that fertility intentions are more polarized among men and women aged 35-37 than among their 25-27-year-old counterparts, and are more polarized among women than among men. Finding a partner is shown to positively affect fertility intentions. Our results suggest that people who intensify their fertility intentions are not necessarily successful in finding a partner, which can be seen as a major prerequisite for family formation.
   CONTRIBUTION
   This is one of the first studies to investigate the fertility intentions of childless men and women whose biological clock is running out. It provides an instructive example for a longitudinal study of the dynamics of life-course-related intentions.

AB Animal studies strongly suggest that timed feeding can have beneficial physiological effects, including protection against the obesogenic and metabolic consequences of a high-fat diet. However, the relationship between variables related to the timing of eating and diet quality in pregnancy women, which is considered as a period of nutritional vulnerability, is still poorly described in the literature. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality of pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 100 pregnant women in the first gestational trimester (<= 12 weeks of gestation). The information regarding food intake was obtained by three 24-Hour Dietary Recall (24HR). Time-related eating patterns, i.e., the interval between the first and the last meal (eating duration), nightly fasting, time of the first and last meals, and number of meals eating on a day were determined. Chronotype was derived using the mid-sleep time on free days on weekends, with a further correction for calculated sleep debt. Diet quality was evaluated using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index-Revised (BHEI-R), validated for the Brazilian population. Linear regression modeling analyses adjusted for confounders were used to investigate the association between time-related eating patterns and chronotype with diet quality. The BHEI-R total score was negatively associated with time of the first meal (beta = -0.355; p = 0.002; r(2) adjusted = 0.141), and positively associated with eating duration (beta = 0.262; p = 0.024; r(2) adjusted = 0.086) and number of meals (beta = 0.273; p = 0.019; r(2) adjusted = 0.091). In addition, the score of total fruit component was negatively associated with chronotype (beta = -0.236; p = 0.033; r(2) adjusted = 0.078), time of the first meal (beta = -0.393; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.171), and positively associated with eating duration (beta = 0.259; p = 0.022; r(2) adjusted = 0.087) and number of meals (beta = 0.376; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.159). The score for whole fruit component was negatively associated with time of the first meal (beta = -0.388; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.152), and positively associated with number of meals (beta = 0.403; p = 0.001; r(2) adjusted = 0.164). A longer eating duration, earlier time of the first meal, higher number of meals and morningness tendency are associated with a better diet quality in the first gestational trimester - higher scores of the total BHEI-R and/or fruit components. We suggest that nutritional guidelines should consider time-related eating patterns and chronotype to ensure good diet quality of pregnant women since the beginning of gestation, contributing on prevention of metabolic-nutritional complications.

AB Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate whether exposure to different environmental lighting conditions affects the reproductive parameters of pregnant mice and the development of their offspring.
   Methods Fifteen pregnant albino mice were divided into three groups: light/dark, light, and dark. The animals were euthanized on day 18 of pregnancy following the Brazilian Good Practice Guide for Euthanasia of Animals. Maternal and fetal specimens were measured and collected for histological evaluation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used for comparison of the groups considering p 0.05 to be statistically significant.
   Results There was no significant difference in the maternal variables between the three groups. Regarding fetal variables, significant differences were observed in the anthropometric measures between the groups exposed to different environmental lighting conditions, with the highest mean values in the light group. The histological evaluation showed the same structural pattern of the placenta in all groups, which was within the normal range. However, evaluation of the uterus revealed a discrete to moderate number of endometrial glands in the light/dark and light groups, which were poorly developed in most animals. In the fetuses, pulmonary analysis revealed morphological features consistent with the transition from the canalicular to the saccular phase in all groups.
   Conclusion Exposure to different environmental lighting conditions had no influence on the reproductive parameters of female mice, while the offspring of mothers exposed to light for 24 hours exhibited better morphometric features.
   Resumo
   Objetivo Avaliar se a exposicAo a diferentes luminosidades no ambiente afeta parametros reprodutivos de camundongos femeas prenhas e o desenvolvimento de sua prole.
   Metodos Foram selecionados para o estudo 15 camundongos femeas albinas prenhas. Os camundongos foram separados em grupos: luz/escuro, luz e escuro. As femeas foram eutanasiadas no 18 degrees dia de gestacAo, seguindo as recomendacoes do Guia Brasileiro de Boas Praticas para a Eutanasia de animais. Tanto pecas maternas como fetais foram mensuradas e coletadas para avaliacAo histologica. Foi utilizado o teste de Analise de variantes (Anova) para comparacAo dos grupos, considerando estatisticamente significativo o valor de p 0,05.
   Resultados Ao comparar as variaveis maternas entre os tres grupos, nAo foi encontrada diferenca estatistica significativa. Em relacAo as variaveis fetais, houve diferencas estatisticas entre as medidas de antropometria dos grupos submetidos a diferentes luminosidades do ambiente, com melhores valores medios no grupo luz. Histologicamente, a avaliacAo placentaria evidenciou em todos os grupos o mesmo padrAo estrutural, com todos dentro da normalidade. No entanto, a avaliacAo de uteros, tanto do grupo luz/escuro quanto do grupo luz, mostrou quantidade discreta a moderada de glandulas endometriais, com pouco desenvolvimento na maioria dos animais. Nos fetos, analise pulmonar evidenciou caracteristicas morfologicas compativeis com a transicAo da fase canalicular para sacular em todos os grupos.
   ConclusAo As exposicoes a diferentes luminosidades no ambiente nAo influenciaram nos parametros reprodutivos das femeas, entretanto, a ninhada das mAes que receberam luz em todo periodo apresentou melhores medidas morfometricas.

AB Background: Preeclampsia is a global burden with 10 million incidences annually and 210 daily deaths worldwide. Diagnosis is mainly based on the features following full presentation.
   Objective: This study explored whether early pregnancy circadian changes of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) could predict preeclampsia and hypertension.
   Methods: In a prospective study, 294 pregnant women who were referred to Sarem Women's Hospital, Iran were recruited. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were recorded (diurnally and nocturnally) in each trimester. Dipping was defined as a minimum 10% decrease in blood pressure.
   Results: Of the 251 women who completed the study, 25 percent (n=63) experienced blunted MAP dipping during sleep phases in the second trimester. Eighty-nine percent (n=56) experienced hypertensive disorder in the third trimester, one-third of which experienced preeclampsia. Of the women with normal MAP dipping (n=188), 5 percent (n=10) had gestational hypertension and 1 percent (n=2) became preeclamptic. (P< 0.0001).
   Conclusion: This study clearly demonstrated blunted blood pressure dipping overnight during the second trimester which is a strong predictor of forthcoming pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia. A scoring system was developed to predict hypertensive disorder and it was significantly correlated with preeclampsia occurrence.

   PREVALENCE; TRAUMA; ASSOCIATIONS
AB Background: Trauma-exposed women may be at magnified risk for posttraumatic stress (PTSS) and depression symptoms in the perinatal period, but few studies have examined symptomatology across the perinatal period in high-risk samples. Further, the role of sleep in perinatal symptomatology has been largely neglected in the violence literature, despite its well-established associations to mental health in other samples. This study aimed to examine the trajectory of PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period and the effects of childhood adversity, intimate partner violence and prenatal sleep impairment on PTSS and depression symptoms across the perinatal period.
   Method: In a longitudinal, prospective study, 101 low-income pregnant women were interviewed during pregnancy, at 6-weeks postpartum, and 4 months postpartum. N = 83 women completed at least 2 interviews and were included in the analyses. Prenatal sleep, childhood adversity, and IPV exposure were assessed at the prenatal interview; PTSS and depression were assessed at all interviews.
   Results: Past year IPV was associated with elevated prenatal mental health symptoms and prenatal sleep difficulties were associated with a worsening trajectory in perinatal PTSS.
   Conclusions: Screening for IPV and prenatal sleep difficulties may be paramount in identifying those at risk for the development or exacerbation of mental health symptoms in the perinatal period.

AB Worldwide, every year there is an increase in the number of people exposed to inorganic arsenic (iAs) via drinking water. Human populations present impaired cognitive function as a result of prenatal and childhood iAs exposure, while studies in animal models demonstrate neurobehavioral deficits accompanied by neurotransmitter, protein, and enzyme alterations. Similar impairments have been observed in close association with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In order to determine whether iAs promotes the pathophysiological progress of AD, we used the 3xTgAD mouse model. Mice were exposed to iAs in drinking water from gestation until 6 months (As-3xTgAD group) and compared with control animals without arsenic (3xTgAD group). We investigated the behavior phenotype on a test battery (circadian rhythm, locomotor behavior, Morris water maze, and contextual fear conditioning). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and respiration rates of mitochondria were evaluated, antioxidant components were detected by immunoblots, and immunohistochemical studies were performed to reveal AD markers. As-3xTgAD displayed alterations in their circadian rhythm and exhibited longer freezing time and escape latencies compared to the control group. The bioenergetic profile revealed decreased ATP levels accompanied by the decline of complex I, and an oxidant state in the hippocampus. On the other hand, the cortex showed no changes of oxidant stress and complex I; however, the antioxidant response was increased. Higher immunopositivity to amyloid isoforms and to phosphorylated tau was observed in frontal cortex and hippocampus of exposed animals. In conclusion, mitochondrial dysfunction may be one of the triggering factors through which chronic iAs exposure exacerbates brain AD-like pathology.

AB Objective: This systematic review explores changes in perinatal empathy and influence on maternal behaviours and child development. Background: The well-being and development of infants are commonly linked to their mothers' capacity for empathy. However, characteristic changes during pregnancy and childbirth including sleep deprivation, mood and cognitive difficulties may disrupt empathic processing. Methods: Original research papers (n = 7413) published in English language peer-reviewed academic journals were obtained by searching four electronic databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and CINAHL. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting empathy of women in the period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Empathy was operationalised as a general tendency of empathic emotional responding and cognitive perspective taking. Thirteen studies were systematically assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. Results: Impaired empathy in mothers, due most notably to high personal distress, was associated with risk of neglect or maltreatment of children and was partially explained by mothers' aversive response to infant crying. Conclusion: Few studies present empathy as a central theme. There is a paucity of definitional parameters and theoretical linkages and over-reliance on brief self-report indices of empathy. Future studies need to be theory based, incorporate experimental approaches, and provide greater sampling diversity toadvance our understanding of empathy in perinatal women.

ID CHINA
AB Background and Purpose Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep-related neurological disorder that affects the quality of sleep. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence, predictive factors, and natural course of RLS, and its effect on sleep quality in pregnant Thai women.
   Methods A cross-sectional study that included 214 pregnant women was performed. RLS was diagnosed according to the revised criteria of the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG). General demographic and antenatal-care data were reviewed. Scores on the Thai versions of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the IRLSSG Rating Scale were determined.
   Results RLS was diagnosed in 24 of the pregnant women (11.2%): 4.2%, 25.0%, and 70.8% in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a hemoglobin level (Hb) less than 11 g/dL [odds ratio (OR)=3.21, 95% CI=1.27-8.13] and a history of RLS (OR=16.62, 95% CI=1.52-181.32) were associated with RLS during pregnancy. Subjects with RLS significantly had higher Thai-ESS scores (p<0.01). All subjects with RLS had severe symptoms that subsided within 1 week after delivery. No immediate labor complication was associated with RLS.
   Conclusions Our study has confirmed a high prevalence of RLS and its impacts on sleep in pregnant women. An Hb of less than 11 g/dL and a history of RLS are predictive factors for RLS developing during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related RLS has a benign course and usually disappears within 1 week after delivery.

AB Background: Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) means the amount of energy utilized by body in physical and psychological resting rate, after a night sleep, awake without any previous physical activity post meal (10 h after last meal) & neutral environment. In people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) there is an increase in BMR which is said to be associated with the level of glycaemic control. So, the objective of the study was to find out the correlation between BMR, Insulin resistance and Visceral fat in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.
   Materials & methods: A total of 50 participants with T2DM with peripheral neuropathy were included. Age group of 30-75 years were selected for the study. Participants with a known history of neurological disease, locomotor disability, and pregnancy were excluded from the study. Demographic details of the participants like duration of diabetes mellitus, age, Fasting Blood Glucose, Fasting Insulin, HOMA-IR, Glycated Haemoglobin (HBA1c), Neuropathy and Blood pressure values were noted. We measured Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) by using Mifflin-St Jeor predictive equation in T2DM with peripheral neuropathy.
   Results: The mean age of the participants is 60.16 +/- 10.62. The mean duration of T2DM 13.44 +/- 11.92. In the present study we found a statistical significant correlation between BMR and HOMA IR (r = 0.913*; p = 0.000), BMR & Fasting blood sugar (FBS) (r = 0.281*; p = 0.048), BMR and Visceral fat (VF) (r = 0.332*; p = 0.018).
   Conclusion: Basal metabolic rate is correlated to Homa-IR, visceral fat, fasting blood sugar and musculoskeletal mass among T2DM with peripheral neuropathy. (c) 2018 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and aims: For some women, lumbopelvic pain (LPP) developed during pregnancy becomes a continuing post-partum problem. Increased understanding of potential prognostic factors is required. This study investigated whether active straight leg raise (ASLR), sleep dysfunction and pressure pain sensitivity during pregnancy are correlated with LPP intensity and quality, disability, and physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) post-partum.
   Methods: An exploratory, prospective cohort study design was used. Baseline factors of interest were: (1) ASLR, (2) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and (3) pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) collected from pregnant women from sites local and distal to the lumbopelvic area. Follow-up data collected 11-18 months post-partum (n = 29) were: (1) pain intensity score (numerical rating scale), (2) pain quality (McGill Pain Questionnaire), (3) disability (Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire), and (4) HRQoL (36-item Short Form Health Survey). Correlation analysis was performed.
   Results: Greater difficulty with an ASLR during pregnancy correlated with lower post-partum physical HRQoL scores (r = -0.563, p = 0.002). Likewise, reduced PPTs at the sacrum during pregnancy was correlated with a higher post-partum pain quality score (r = -0.384, p = 0.040).
   Conclusions: In this cohort, findings indicate that poor ASLR performance and localised pressure pain hypersensitivity at the pelvis during pregnancy are correlated with post-partum physical HRQoL and pain quality, respectively.

AB Objective: Sleep disturbance is a common issue that can arise from emotional distress. Women who received the complicated invasive in-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures can be stressful. The purpose of this study is to understanding the association between emotional distress (measured as anxiety and depression) and sleep quality for women undergoing IVF treatment.
   Materials and methods: This research was of a cross-sectional questionnaire design. Questionnaires were completed during the controlled ovarian hyperstimulation of IVF treatment. A total of 97 participants complete the survey. The questionnaires included basic personal information, The Chinese Traditional Childbearing Attitude Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Beck depression and anxiety scales.
   Results: A total of 42.9% and 30% of the participants were determined to be anxious and depressed, respectively. Some participants (18.8%) required more than 30 min to fall asleep, and 56.2% of the participants had less than 7 h of sleep, 43.6% of the participants had less than 85% of sleep efficiency, and 43.3% of the participants were determined with poor sleep quality (PSQI>5). The linear regression analysis indicated that the score of the Beck anxiety index was significantly associated with sleep quality (F = 44.85, p =.000, adjust R-2 = 49.4%).
   Conclusion: This study revealed that some women when receiving early stage IVF treatments were anxious, depressed, and have sleep disturbance. Anxiety was significantly associated with sleep quality. It is suggested that medical care professional should understand these common issues when assisting women undergoing these complicated reproductive treatments.

AB Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy, but not to the level of being diagnostic for diabetes in a nonpregnant adult. In GDM, whole-body insulin-dependent glucose disposal decreases by 40%-60% which necessitates a 200%-250% increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycaemia. GDM develops when a pregnant woman does not produce sufficient insulin to compensate for the reduced glucose disposal. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone that is expressed predominantly in the liver, but also in other metabolically active tissues such as pancreas, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In animals, FGF21 lowers blood glucose levels and inhibits glucagon secretion. In humans, circulating FGF21 levels are increased in insulin-resistant morbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An elevated FGF21 level is also an independent predictor of T2DM. GDM and T2DM are proposed to have similar underlying pathophysiologies, raising the question of whether a similar relationship exists between FGF21 and GDM as it does with T2DM. There are a limited number of studies investigating FGF21 levels in patients with GDM. Moreover, recent clinical trials investigating the therapeutic potential of FGF21 have highlighted a major gap in our understanding of the biology of FGF21. This review evaluates what is currently known about FGF21 and GDM and highlights important gaps that warrant further research.

AB Objectives: To investigate the cross-sectional associations between musculoskeletal pain experience and measures of pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Participants and Methods: In total, 917 participants were eligible for analysis if they provided data pertaining to musculoskeletal pain status at the 22-year follow-up and had data for at least 1 valid pain sensitivity test. Standardized protocols were used to assess pressure pain threshold (4 sites: lumbar spine, tibialis anterior, upper trapezius, and wrist) and cold pain threshold (wrist). Four pain experience groups ("No pain" [n=562, 61.3%], "Low" [n=84, 9.2%], "Medium" [n=147, 16.0%], "High" [n=124, 13.5%]) were determined by latent class analysis using parameters of pain chronicity, frequency, intensity, and number of pain areas. Variables considered as confounders included sex, age, ethnicity, waist-hip ratio, psychological symptoms, sleep quality, physical activity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and income. Results: There were no associations between pain experience and pressure pain sensitivity after adjusting for confounders. The "Medium" and "High" pain experience groups demonstrated heightened cold pain sensitivity compared with the "No pain" group (P=0.023), adjusted for sex and smoking. Discussion: This study provides the most extensive investigation of the relationship between musculoskeletal pain experience and pressure and cold pain sensitivity in young adults. Heightened cold pain sensitivity in those classified as "Medium" and "High" pain experience may suggest altered nociceptive processing and has implications for clinical management.

AB Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is the largest modifiable risk factor for adverse outcomes in the infant. Investigations have focused on the psychoactive component of cigarettes, nicotine. One proposed mechanism leading to adverse effects is the interaction between nicotine and its nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Much data has been generated over the past three decades on the effects of cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) on the expression of the nAChRs in the brainstem and physiological parameters related to cardiac, respiration and sleep, in the offspring of smoking mothers and animal models of nicotine exposure. This review summarises this data and discusses the main findings, highlighting that findings in animal models closely correlate with those from human studies, and that the major brainstem sites where the expression level for the nAChRs are consistently affected include those that play vital roles in cardiorespiration (hypoglossal nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus of the solitary tract), chemosensation (nucleus of the solitary tract, arcuate nucleus) and arousal (rostral mesopontine sites such as the locus coeruleus and nucleus pontis oralis). These findings provide evidence for the adverse effects of CSE during and after pregnancy to the infant and the need to continue with the health campaign advising against CSE.

DE Pregnant; Discomforts; Maternity pillow; Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale
AB In today's generation, there are a lot of new inventions and innovations of the existing products with the use of technology and soon it will be all automated. Different studies were conducted in order to identify things that hold back one thing to explore. With this, customization of different products was important to address all the pains and discomforts and for them to be more productive in life. In different variances of pillows, maternity pillow is one thing the people need to focus on. Pillows can further eliminate the pains and discomforts. Musculoskeletal is the primary discomforts of pregnant women while sleeping. This paper aimed to identify the pains and discomforts with respect to factors such as the age, periods of pregnancy and number of birth of pregnant women. Pearson's Correlation, Quadruple Visual Analogue Scale (QVAS) and weighted mean were used in making the design and development of the maternity pillow.

AB Core and peripheral body temperatures are affected by changes in reproductive hormones during the menstrual cycle. Women worldwide use the basal body temperature (BBT) method to aid and prevent conception. However, prior research suggests that taking one's daily temperature can prove inconvenient and subject to environmental factors. We investigate whether a more automatic, non-invasive temperature measurement system can detect changes in temperature across the menstrual cycle. We examined how wrist skin temperature (WST), measured with wearable sensors, correlates with urinary tests of ovulation and may serve as a new method of fertility tracking. One hundred and thirty-six eumenorrheic, non-pregnant women participated in an observational study. Participants wore WST biosensors during sleep and reported their daily activities. An at-home luteinizing hormone (LH) test was used to confirm ovulation. WST was recorded across 437 cycles (mean cycles/participant = 3.21, S.D. = 2.25). We tested the relationship between the fertile window and WST temperature shifts, using the BBT three-over-six rule. A sustained 3-day temperature shift was observed in 357/437 cycles (82%), with the lowest cycle temperature occurring in the fertile window 41% of the time. Most temporal shifts (307/357, 86%) occurred on ovulation day (OV) or later. The average early-luteal phase temperature was 0.33. C higher than in the fertile window. Menstrual cycle changes in WST were impervious to lifestyle factors, like having sex, alcohol, or eating prior to bed, that, in prior work, have been shown to obfuscate BBT readings. Although currently costlier than BBT, the present study suggests that WST could be a promising, convenient parameter for future multiparameter fertility awareness methods.

AB BackgroundNaphthalene is the simplest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). It is easily emitted into the atmosphere, posing a significant risk to human health. However, limited studies have described the impact of naphthalene exposure on birth outcomes. In this study, we investigated the association between the maternal urinary metabolites of naphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene (2-OH NAP), and birth outcomes.MethodIn the present study, four urinary PAH metabolites were measured in 263 pregnant women during late pregnancy. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between the concentrations of 2-OH NAP and birth outcomes, and restricted cubic spline models were further used to examine the shapes of the dose-response association.ResultGeneral linear models showed that prenatal urinary 2-OH NAP was associated with lower birth weight (BW) (-4.38% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend=0.049) and higher cephalization index (CI) (4.30% for the high vs. low exposure group of 2-OH NAP; p for trend=0.038). These associations were linear and significant when 2-OH NAP was modeled as a continuous variable in restricted cubic spline models (P (linear)=0.0293 for 2-OH NAP and BW; P (linear)=0.0326 for 2-OH NAP and CI). Multiple linear regression data indicated that each 1 ln-unit increase in 2-OH NAP was significantly associated with a 2.09g/cm increase in the CI. The associations among 2-OH NAP, BW, and CI were also observed in a subset of participants residing close to arterial traffic.ConclusionOur data indicated that prenatal exposure to naphthalene had an adverse effect on fetal birth outcomes, especially the brain development index. Reduced exposure to naphthalene may improve newborn health outcomes. In Taiyuan, naphthalene may result from traffic pollution.

AB Early life nutritional imbalances are risk factors for metabolic dysfunctions in adulthood, but the long term effects of perinatal exposure to high versus low protein diets are not completely understood. We exposed C57BL/6J offspring to a high protein/low carbohydrate (HP/LC) or low protein/high carbohydrate (LP/HC) diet during gestation and lactation, and measured metabolic phenotypes between birth and 10 months of age in male offspring. Perinatal HP/LC and LP/HC exposures resulted in a decreased ability to clear glucose in the offspring, with reduced baseline insulin and glucose concentrations in the LP/HC group and a reduced insulin response post-glucose challenge in the HP/LC group. The LP/HC diet group also showed reduced birth and weanling weights, whereas the HP/LC offspring displayed increased weanling weight with increased adiposity beyond 5 months of age. Gene expression profiling of hypothalamus and liver revealed alterations in diverse molecular pathways by both diets. Specifically, hypothalamic transcriptome and pathway analyses demonstrated perturbations of MAPK and hedgehog signaling, processes associated with neural restructuring and transmission, and phosphate metabolism by perinatal protein imbalances. Liver transcriptomics revealed changes in purine and phosphate metabolism, hedgehog signaling, and circadian rhythm pathways. Our results indicate maternal protein imbalances perturbing molecular pathways in central and peripheral metabolic tissues, thereby predisposing the male offspring to metabolic dysfunctions.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: There is limited evidence about the role of herbal and traditional medicine in pregnancy-related insomnia. Extant documents on traditional Persian medicine refer to many plants which could induce sleep and which were used by pregnant women. In Iran, local herbal shops continue to provide these herbs to pregnant women to treat insomnia. One such herb is Lactuca sativa L. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lettuce seed on pregnant women for the treatment of insomnia.
   Methods and materials: In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 100 pregnant women with insomnia aged 20-45 years were assigned to receive capsules containing 1000 mg of lettuce seed or a placebo daily for two weeks. The main outcome was the quality of sleep, which was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
   Results: Each group contained 50 participants. An improvement in the PSQI score was significantly greater in patients receiving lettuce seed than those receiving the placebo. Linear regression analysis showed that, after controlling for the other variables, the average sleep score of the experimental group was significantly lower than for the placebo group (p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that lettuce seed decreased insomnia during pregnancy and could be recommended as a safe natural remedy for treatment of pregnancy-related insomnia.

AB Study Objectives: To examine trajectories of poor sleep quality from late pregnancy to 36 months postpartum, baseline indicators, and association with prospective maternal mood disturbances.
   Methods: A cohort of 262 nonclinical women was followed at late pregnancy, 42 days, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months postpartum. Sleep quality was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at all time points, and mood disturbances were assessed at late pregnancy and 36 months postpartum.
   Results: The rate of poor sleep quality followed an inverted U-shaped curve. Women reporting poor sleep quality at late pregnancy held a consistently higher risk of poor sleep quality at postpartum points. Three sleep trajectories were distinguished, namely, the stable-low (29.4%), the decreasingmild (56.5%), and the stable-high (14.1%). Poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety at baseline were linked to trajectory groups with poorer sleep quality. Adjusting for covariates, the trajectory of the poorer sleep quality group demonstrated increased mood disturbances at 36 months postpartum. Replicating the analyses in women without baseline symptoms of depression and anxiety above clinical cutoffs obtained similar results.
   Conclusions: Women are vulnerable to poor sleep quality from late pregnancy to postpartum years, but follow distinct trajectories. Poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety at late pregnancy help us to anticipate the sleep trajectories. Trajectories of poor sleep quality indicate increased mood disturbances at 36 months postpartum. A flexible suite of interventions targeting both poor sleep quality and mood disturbances should be implemented and tailored to women in the prenatal and postpartum periods.

AB INTRODUCTION: Maternal overweight/obesity and comorbid hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes associate with neurodevelopmental delay in the offspring in childhood. We hypothesize that these maternal conditions associate also with the offspring regulatory behavior problems and impact on neurodevelopment via the offspring regulatory behavior.
   METHODS: A number of 3117 women of the PREDO Study filled in a questionnaire on regulatory behavior problems at the child's mean age of 16.9 days and 2116 of them a questionnaire on developmental milestones at the child's mean age of 42.2 months. Data on maternal BMI and comorbid disorders come from the Finnish Medical Birth Register.
   RESULTS: Offspring of overweight/obese mothers in comparison to normal weight mothers had higher levels of regulatory behavior problems and 22% (95% confidence interval 5-42%) higher odds of having problems on multiple domains of behavioral regulation at the mean age of 16.9 days. Offspring regulatory behavior problems partially mediated the association between maternal overweight/obesity and developmental milestones comprising communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal/social domains of development. Comorbid disorders did not associate with offspring regulatory behavior problems.
   CONCLUSION: Regulatory behavior problems of the offspring have prenatal origins and partially mediate the effects of maternal overweight/obesity on offspring neurodevelopment.

AB Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder characterized by the presence of orthostatic symptoms (including lightheadedness, palpitations, nausea, dyspnea, and tremulousness) as well as excessive upright tachycardia. POTS predominantly affects women of childbearing age. Treating POTS involves a multi-faceted approach using non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. There are no pharmacological treatments that are currently United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for POTS due to lack of randomized controlled trials. Yet, several medications can improve POTS symptoms and are supported by small prospective studies or retrospective case series. Drugs that are most commonly used for POTS target the following mechanisms 1) blood volume expansion, 2) reduction of heart rate, 3) peripheral vasoconstriction and 4) sympatholysis. Pharmacological approaches can also be used to target specific symptoms including "brain fog," fatigue, sleep, and depression. This review outlines pharmacological approaches for treating POTS and summarizes evidence supporting each treatment approach.

ID POSITION; STATES
AB Proper positioning of premature babies resulting from different maternal chronic conditions before pregnancy and hypertension induced during pregnancy can promote normal balanced development with maximizing the sleeping conditions and minimizing the gastric reflux. We conducted a retrospective study on data from Bega Clinics - Obstetrics and Gynecology and Neonatology for 2012-2013 about premature babies of mothers with pathologic pregnancies. Part of the newborns was positioned in a flexible polyurethane foam cocoon and clinical observations on sleeping states and the presence of gastric reflux were noted. In our study, 453 (10.5%) cases of women with different pathological conditions out of 4,312 cases were encountered. Most of them (48%) had a diagnosis of chronic hypertension, followed by chronic renal diseases (34%). Hypertension developed during pregnancy for both years, happened in 340 (7.88%) cases. Severe forms of hypertension were noted in 57.05% of them. Incidence of preterm birth babies was 11.22% (484 cases), of which 12 cases (8.67%) resulted from pregnancies with different forms of hypertension. Clinical observations stated that sleeping quietly and awake and quiet have increased the most when compared with babies positioned in the cocoon (44 babies) compared with babies (45) out of cocoons. Only 8 (18.2%) babies positioned in the cocoon experienced gastric reflux comparatively with 41 babies that were positioned in regular conditions.

AB To explore the influence of the parturients' mental factors on the delivery mode and postpartum hemorrhage and the nursing intervention countermeasures, the research randomly divided the expectant primiparae hospitalized in our hospital during February 2012-February 2013 into the intervention group and the control group. Wherein, the control group received routine nursing, while the intervention group received nursing intervention based on the routine nursing, to compare the postpartum hemorrhage and satisfaction of the two groups of parturients. Result: 36 of 112 parturients suffered from dysphoria, accounting for 32.14%; 37 parturSients suffered from depression, accounting for 33.04%. The parturients' hemorrhage incidence, postpartum amount of bleeding within 2 h and postpartum amount of bleeding within 24 h all significantly declined compared with those of the control group (x2/t = 3.98, 4.02, 4.96, p < 0.05). The cesarean rate of the control group (7.14%, 4/56) was significantly higher than that of the control group (16.07%, 9/56) (x2 = 4.02, p < 0.05). The postpartum satisfaction of the patients in the intervention group was apparently higher than that of the control group (x2 = 4.26, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The nursing intervention can obviously reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage and improve postpartum satisfaction, so it is worth popularizing.

ID HEALTH
AB Objectives: Parental incarceration (PI) is a prevalent adverse childhood experience (ACE) that has been linked to numerous social, emotional, and health problems in childhood and adulthood. A growing body of research has emphasized the importance of the timing of parents incarceration on developmental outcomes.
   Study design: The present study uses case-control matching to examine the impact of recent PI on newborn health and home safety outcomes.
   Methods: Neonatal health and newborn sleep and home safety data, including rates of premature birth, low birth weight (LBW), neonatal intensive care unit admittance, breastfeeding initiation, safe sleep, and home environment (e.g. working smoke alarm, proper firearm storage), were collected from 108 women who completed the Virginia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring survey. Half of these women (n = 54) had experienced the incarceration of themselves or their partner during the previous 12 months. Participants were matched by age, race, income, and the education level with those of 54 women who completed the survey and who had not experienced incarceration in the previous year.
   Results: Controlling for nicotine and alcohol consumption during pregnancy and other stressors, path analyses show that the women who experienced incarceration of themselves or their husband/partner were significantly less likely to deliver an LBW infant and more likely to live in a home with a loaded firearm in the home. No other significant differences emerged between the two matched groups among neonatal health or newborn sleep and home safety outcomes.
   Conclusions: This result is considered from a public health perspective, as PI is an ACE which can be impacted by policy, particularly policies that promote practices that healthcare workers can use in correctional and other environments to encourage healthy pregnancies and home environments for newborns.

AB Introduction: Good control of glycaemia negates potential maternal and fetal complications. A diet suitable for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a first line approach. However, little is said about suitable exercise in pregnancy that will potentially help control glycaemia. This pilot study seeks to understand the perceived barriers to exercise in women with GDM. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited patients with GDM on diet control at the antenatal clinic of Hospital Sultanah Aminah Johor Bahru, Malaysia between October 2017 and January 2018. Those who fulfilled the recruitment criteria were approached and 89 women consented to participate. Data was obtained from antenatal records and a self-administered questionnaire. Results: The mean age of the participants was 33.3 years. More than 80% were Para 1 and above. 69.6% were either overweight or obese at booking of pregnancy. 80.9% were aware that exercise was necessary for women with GDM. Only 6.7% say that healthcare professionals were their source of information on exercise in pregnancy. 77.3% of the women with low physical activity had full time jobs. Housewives (64.5%) had the highest level of physical activity. Tiredness (43.8%), childcare duties (38.2%) and lack of time (27.0%) were the most common perceived barriers to exercise. Nulliparity was significantly associated with tiredness. Conclusion: Main barriers to exercise are tiredness and childcare duties. Health care professionals did little in educating women with GDM on suitable exercise.

AB Globally, estimates show that 41 million children younger than 5 years of age are affected by overweight and obesity. In many regions of the world, these prevalence rates have increased dramatically, especially in low- and middle-income countries, making childhood obesity a global policy issue. Recent data show that many children are already affected by overweight or obesity by the time they start school; hence, the examination of early exposures, with interventions around these exposures, is warranted. In this review, we outline the main modifiable exposures in early life that can lead to an increased risk of obesity. These exposures can be broadly categorised into parental factors such as obesity and gestational diabetes; dietary exposures in early life, including breastfeeding and complementary feeding and feeding behaviours; physical activity, sedentary behaviours and sleep; and environmental exposures such as maternal exposure to tobacco. We also identify research gaps and opportunities for further research.

AB Background Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes. Mechanisms underlying the association between obstructive sleep apnea and gestational diabetes remain to be elucidated. Methods Twenty-three participants with gestational diabetes underwent home sleep apnea testing. Obstructive sleep apnea was defined as an apnea hypopnea index > 5. Fasting morning blood samples were measured using multianalyte profiling (xMAP) multiplexed bead array immunoassay for Interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and Interleukin 8. Results Age, body mass index, and gestational age at enrollment were 31 + 4.4 years, 35.7 + 7.4 kg/m(2), and 28 +/- 4 weeks, respectively. Participants were 52% Caucasian and 16% had obstructive sleep apnea. We observed positive correlations between apnea hypopnea index and Interleukin 6 (r = 0.62, p = 0.005), Interleukin 8 (r = 0.56, p = .56), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (r = .58, p = .009). Women with obstructive sleep apnea had higher levels of Interleukin 6 (F = 5.01, p = .037) and Interleukin 8 (F = 6.33, p = .021) vs. women without obstructive sleep apnea. Conclusion These preliminary results indicate that in women with gestational diabetes, apnea hypopnea index is associated with an elevated inflammatory profile.

AB Good quality sleep of sufficient duration is vital for optimal physiological function and our health. Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired neurocognitive function and emotional control, and increases the risk for cardiometabolic diseases, obesity and cancer. Sleep develops during fetal life with the emergence of a recognisable pattern of sleep states in the preterm fetus associated with the development, maturation and connectivity within neural networks in the brain. Despite the physiological importance of sleep, surprisingly little is known about how sleep develops in individuals born preterm. Globally, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (<37 weeks gestation) each year, and these babies are at significant risk of neural injury and impaired brain development. This review discusses how sleep develops during fetal and neonatal life, how preterm birth impacts on sleep development to adulthood, and the factors which may contribute to impaired brain and sleep development, leading to altered neurocognitive, behavioural and motor capabilities in the infant and child. Going forward, the challenge is to identify specific risk factors for impaired sleep development in preterm babies to allow for the design of interventions that will improve the quality and quantity of sleep throughout life.

AB Light at night is essential to a 24/7 society, but it has negative consequences on health. Basically, light at night induces an alteration of our biological clocks, known as chronodisruption, with effects even when this occurs during pregnancy. Indeed, an abnormal photoperiod during gestation alters fetal development, inducing long-term effects on the offspring. Accordingly, we carried out a longitudinal study in rats, exploring the impact of gestational chronodisruption on the adrenal biorhythms and function of the offspring. Adult rats (90 days old) gestated under chronic photoperiod shift (CPS) decrease the time spent in the open arm zone of an elevated plus maze to 62% and increase the rearing time to 170%. CPS adults maintained individual daily changes in corticosterone, but their acrophases were distributed from 12.00 h to 06.00 h. CPS offspring maintained clock gene expression and oscillation, nevertheless no daily rhythm was observed in genes involved in the regulation and synthesis of steroids. Consistent with adult adrenal gland being programmed during fetal life, blunted daily rhythms of corticosterone, core clock gene machinery, and steroidogenic genes were observed in CPS fetal adrenal glands. Comparisons of the global transcriptome of CPS versus control fetal adrenal gland revealed that 1078 genes were differentially expressed (641 down-regulated and 437 up-regulated). In silico analysis revealed significant changes in Lipid Metabolism, Small Molecule Biochemistry, Cellular Development and the Inflammatory Response pathway (z score: 48-20). Altogether, the present results demonstrate that gestational chronodisruption changed fetal and adult adrenal function. This could translate to long-term abnormal stress responses and metabolic adaptation, increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases.

AB BACKGROUND: Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; obstructive sleep apnea is highly comorbid with obesity and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Screening for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women has remained a challenge because of a lack of validated screening tools.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate established obstructive sleep apnea screening tools, a sleepiness scale, and individual component items in a cohort of pregnant women with extreme obesity in mid pregnancy with the use of objective testing to determine obstructive sleep apnea status and to describe the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among women with extreme obesity.
   STUDY DESIGN: Adult pregnant subjects, between 24 and 35 weeks gestation, with a body mass index >= 40 kg/m(2) at the time of enrollment completed obstructive sleep apnea screening tools (Berlin Questionnaire, American Society of Anesthesiologists checklist, and STOP-BANG questionnaire) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale; they also underwent physical examination of the neck, mouth, and airway. The published obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy prediction score was calculated for each subject. Obstructive sleep apnea status for each subject was determined by the results of an overnight, unattended type III home sleep apnea test.
   RESULTS: Twenty-four percent of pregnant women with extreme obesity had obstructive sleep apnea on home sleep apnea testing in mid pregnancy (Apnea-Hypopnea Index, >= 5 events per hour]. Established obstructive sleep apnea screening tools performed very poorly to screen for obstructive sleep apnea in this cohort. Age, body mass index, neck circumference, frequently witnessed apneas, and highly likely to fall asleep while driving were associated most strongly with obstructive sleep apnea status in this cohort.
   CONCLUSION: We found that 24% of pregnant women with body mass index >= 40 kg/m(2) between 24 and 35 weeks gestation have obstructive sleep apnea, defined as Apnea-Hypopnea Index >= 5 events per hour on an overnight type III home sleep apnea test. We found the Berlin Questionnaire, American Society of Anesthesiologists checklist, STOP-BANG, obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy score by Facco et al, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were not useful screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea in a cohort of obese pregnant women. However, age, body mass index, neck circumference, frequently witnessed apneas, and likely to fall asleep while driving were associated with obstructive sleep apnea in this cohort. Further studies are needed to adjust the criteria and thresholds within the available screening tools to better predict obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women with obesity.

AB Rat pups produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) on isolation from their dam. Ultrasonic vocalization is a sensitive tool for evaluating social behavior between pups and their dam. Prenatal ethanol-exposure leads to a reduction in USVs and have the potential of inducing difficulties in social behavior between pups and their dam. However, effects of prenatal ethanol-exposure on the acoustic characteristics of USVs remain unclear. In this study, we recorded USVs produced by rat pups that were prenatally exposed to ethanol and examined their acoustic characteristics. Ethanol was administered to 13 pregnant rats in three stages by gradually increasing concentrations between gestational days (GDs) 8-20. From GDs 14-20, ethanol-containing tap water at concentrations of 30% and 15% (v/v) was administered to the high- and low-ethanol groups, respectively. Tap water without ethanol was given to the control group. On postnatal days (PNDs) 4, 8, 12, and 16, individual newly born pups were isolated from their dam and littermates and USVs produced by them were recorded for 5 min. The number of USVs in the high-ethanol group was greater than that in both low-ethanol and control groups on PND 12. The mean, minimum, and maximum fundamental frequencies of USVs were elevated in the high ethanol group compared with that in both low-ethanol and control groups. Higher amplitudes of USVs were produced by male pups in the high-ethanol group than in those in both low-ethanol and control groups on PND 12. These results suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure changed emotionality and accordingly, the high-ethanol group produced more USVs as distress calls.

AB Objective: Sleep is critical for glucose metabolism. Pregnant women often have sleep disturbances and extreme sleep duration. Investigations of the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have reported inconsistent results. The present study aimed to meta-analyze the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for studies that were published up to October 2017, that reported associations between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as the effect sizes for all studies. Heterogeneity and potential publication biases were assessed.
   Results: A total of 4366 papers were retrieved, among which seven studies assessed the relationship between sleep duration during pregnancy and GDM development. The seven articles included 18,203 subjects at baseline and 1294 GDM cases during follow-up. Compared to normal sleep duration, extreme sleep duration during early and middle pregnant stages had a close relationship with GDM based upon pooled data from prospective and cross-sectional studies. Prospective results showed that long sleep duration during pregnancy was a risk factor for GDM, but not short sleep duration. Publication biases were found when analyzing the relationship between extreme sleep duration and GDM.
   Conclusions: Extreme sleep duration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. Moreover, long but not short sleep duration can predict the risk of developing GDM. These findings remind us of the importance of sleep duration control during pregnancy and help optimize early strategies for the prevention of GDM. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether specific perinatal factors are associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children.
   Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted. All cases of OSAS were obtained from a tertiary pediatric hospital between April 2013 and April 2016. A total of 823 children who had been diagnosed with OSAS were designated as the case group, and 823 children without OSAS were selected with strict criteria to match with the case group by age, gender and body mass index. Logistic regression models were used to determine the perinatal factors associated with childhood OSAS.
   Results: Preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13-3.08) and cesarean section (aOR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03-1.68) were significantly associated with OSAS. Exposure of the mother to smoke (aOR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.57-4.26) was also associated with an increased risk of childhood OSAS. Mothers aged 35 years and above, performing manual labor, and living in suburban areas significantly increased the risk of childhood OSAS. Multiparous mothers decreased the risk of childhood OSAS (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.83). Maternal education, gravidity, prenatal care times, pregnancy-induced hypertension, multiple pregnancies, sex of the child and birth weight were not significantly associated with OSAS in children.
   Conclusion: Perinatal risk factors are important for predicting childhood OSAS. Our findings provide evidence regarding several potentially useful factors for recognizing OSAS in children, which could be important in diagnosis of pediatric OSAS by physicians.

AB Purpose of ReviewStillbirth is a devastating event for the pregnant woman, families, and care providers alike. No preventable stillbirths should be tolerated, no matter how low the incidence is. The rate of reducing stillbirth rate is less than satisfactory and warrants continued efforts. Indeed, massive researches from all specialties bloomed in recent years. Some interventions are with good evidence and feasible to be practiced, while others are preliminary but exciting to be investigated further. The purpose of this review is a comprehensive overview of the recent studies on stillbirth prevention. An emphasis is placed on novel ideas or areas to be improved on that might interest prospective readers.Recent FindingsFor pregnant women, optimized healthy lifestyle including body weight, blood sugar, and blood pressure control is warranted. Vigilance on fetal movement is important for detecting fetal distress. Sudden vigorous movement means no less than reduced movement and should prompt timely evaluations. Sleep in supine position compromises maternal vena cava and poses increased stillbirth risks; thus, mothers are advised to sleep on their left side. For health professionals, biomarkers are studied to detect early placental insufficiency. Doppler velocimetry, fetal cardiotocography, and biophysical profile are helpful in evaluating fetal well-being but require adequate training and careful interpretation. Timely iatrogenic delivery is effective in lowering perinatal deaths but should be balanced against newborn prematurity. Precision medicine, utilizing genetic studies, microarrays to analyze causes of death or fetal hypoxia severity in utero is promising in filling the knowledge gaps about stillbirth. Special effort should be allocated to bereavement services, follow-up clinics, and social support to minimize the psychological impact on stillbirths. Moreover, care bundles that set specific goals, algorithms, including stillbirth investigations and cause classifications should be implemented, followed by auditing and data analysis. In the long run, health promotion in women by empowerment through gender equality and access to medical resources should be strived for.SummaryStillbirth prevention is a work undone but has received ongoing attention and massive research efforts. Individuals, healthcare providers, and policy makers alike should stay interested and up to date.

AB Introduction The aim of this study was to compare the mental health problems between parents after oocyte donation treatment, after in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) with own gametes and after naturally conceiving (NC). Material and methods Results This is a prospective, longitudinal questionnaire study. The study group consisted of 26 oocyte donation mothers and their matched IVF/ICSI (n = 52) and NC (n = 52) controls. Matching was performed according to mother's age, parity, type of pregnancy, and number of returned questionnaires. The parents filled-in the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-36) at gestational weeks 18-20 (T1), and at 2 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) after the childbirth. Full response rate (T1-T3) for oocyte donation mothers was 76.9% and for oocyte donation fathers was 73.1%. At T1, no significant differences were found between groups in depression, anxiety, sleeping difficulties, or social dysfunction, but they differed at T2 and T3 in anxiety (T2, P = .02; T3, P = .01), in sleeping difficulties (T2, P = .02; T3, P = .04) and in social dysfunction (T2, P = .01; T3, P = .04). Oocyte donation mothers showed less anxiety than NC mothers (T2, T3), and fewer sleeping difficulties and less social dysfunction than IVF/ICSI (T2, T3) and NC mothers (T2). Mental health problems of oocyte donation fathers did not differ from those of IVF/ICSI and NC control fathers at T1-T3. Conclusions Oocyte donation mothers showed fewer mental health symptoms in early parenthood compared with IVF/ICSI and NC mothers. No differences were found among mothers during pregnancy and among fathers at any time point.

AB Obesity is prevalent among pregnant women in the United States; 15-20% of obese pregnant women have obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea increases along with body mass index, age and in the presence of other co-morbidities. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea in women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary and metabolic co-morbidities; recent studies suggest that women with obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy may be at significantly greater risk of entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension and/or of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: gestational hypertension; preeclampsia; or eclampsia. This has serious public health implications; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a major cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and are associated with a greater lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms that associated obstructive sleep apnea with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy have not been defined, but several pathways are scientifically plausible. In this review, we will present a comprehensive literature review of the following: the associations between obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; the proposed mechanisms that may connect obstructive sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; and the effectiveness of treatment at mitigating these adverse outcomes.

AB Background: : The main aim of this study was to examine the prospective impact of maternal postpartum PTSD on several standardized child sleep variables two years postpartum in a large, population-based cohort of mothers. Moreover, we investigated the influence of numerous potential confounding maternal and child factors. Finally, we tested potential reverse temporal associations between child sleep eight weeks postpartum and maternal PTSD symptoms two years postpartum.
   Methods: : This study is part of the population-based Akershus Birth Cohort, a prospective cohort study at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Data from the hospital's birth record, from questionnaires at 17 weeks gestation, eight weeks and two years postpartum were used. At two years postpartum, 39% of the original participants could be retained, resulting in a study population of n = 1480. All child sleep variables significantly correlated with postpartum PTSD symptoms were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for confounding factors.
   Results: : Postpartum PTSD symptoms were related to all child sleep variables, except daytime sleep duration. When all significant confounding factors were included into multivariate regression analyses, postpartum PTSD symptoms remained a significant predictor for number and duration of night wakings (beta = 0.10 and beta = 0.08, respectively), duration of settling time (beta = 0.10), and maternal rating of their child's sleep problems (beta = 0.12, all p < .01. Child sleep at eight weeks postpartum was not significantly related to maternal sleep two years postpartum when controlling for postpartum PTSD at eight weeks.
   Limitations: : Child outcomes were based on maternal reporting and might be influenced by maternal mental health.
   Conclusions: : Our results showed for the first time that maternal postpartum PTSD symptoms were prospectively associated with less favorable child sleep, thus increasing the risk of developmental or behavioral problems through an indirect, but treatable pathway. Early detection and treatment of maternal postpartum PTSD may prevent or improve sleep problems and long-term child development.

AB In neonatal animal models, isolated limb movements during active sleep provide input to immature somatomotor cortex necessary for its development and are somatotopically encoded by alpha-beta oscillations as late as the equivalent of human full-term. Limb movements elicit similar neural patterns in very pre-term human infants (average 30 corrected gestational weeks), suggesting an analogous role in humans, but it is unknown until when they subserve this function. In a cohort of 19 neonates (31-42 corrected gestational weeks) we showed that isolated hand movements during active sleep continue to induce these same somatotopically distributed oscillations well into the perinatal period, but that these oscillations decline towards full-term and fully disappear at 41 corrected gestational weeks (equivalent to the end of gestation). We also showed that these highly localised alpha-beta oscillations are associated with an increase in delta oscillations which extends to the frontal area and does not decline with age. These results suggest that isolated limb movements during active sleep could have an important role in experience-dependent somatomotor development up until normal birth in humans.

AB Sleep disturbance and fatigue are frequent complaints during pregnancy and postpartum. We assessed the effectiveness of Lavender cream and footbath on sleep quality and fatigue in pregnancy and postpartum. In this trial, 141 women with sleep disturbance at 25-28 weeks gestation were recruited from public health centers in Tabriz, Iran, from May 2013 until January 2014 and randomized into one of three groups receiving: Lavender and footbath, Lavender alone, or placebo cream. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index at the 4th and 8th weeks after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Fatigue was assessed with the multidimensional assessment of fatigue scale at the 6th week after intervention and the 6th week postpartum. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA were used. Compared with the placebo group, the global sleep quality score post-intervention in pregnancy and the postpartum were significantly lower in the Lavender and footbath and the Lavender cream only groups. Fatigue in both intervention groups was significantly improved only at the 6th week postpartum. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two intervention groups. Lavender cream with or without footbath may improve sleep quality in pregnancy and postpartum.

AB BackgroundPregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes. Even in uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both maternal and infant health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical and psychological factors in developed countries.MethodsA systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in PubMed, EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Countries with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of the STROBE criteria.ResultsIn total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout pregnancy, the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors associated with better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the absence of social and economic problems, having family and friends, doing physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic. Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction, complications before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting, epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months prior to conception, a history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression during pregnancy and sexual or domestic violence.ConclusionsHealth-related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical, mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.

TI The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
SO JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Review
AB IMPORTANCE Approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel, function, and sleep better and reduce risk of many chronic diseases.
   OBJECTIVE To summarize key guidelines in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (PAG).
   PROCESS AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee conducted a systematic review of the science supporting physical activity and health. The committee addressed 38 questions and 104 subquestions and graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research. Evidence graded as strong or moderate was the basis of the key guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based the PAG on the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.
   RECOMMENDATIONS The PAG provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity to improve a variety of health outcomes for multiple population groups. Preschool-aged children (3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day to enhance growth and development. Children and adolescents aged 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily. Adults should do at least 150 minutes to 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes to 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. They should also do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Pregnant and postpartum women should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Adults with chronic conditions or disabilities, who are able, should follow the key guidelines for adults and do both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. Recommendations emphasize that moving more and sitting less will benefit nearly everyone. Individuals performing the least physical activity benefit most by even modest increases in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Additional benefits occur with more physical activity. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity are beneficial.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, provides information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits. Health professionals and policy makers should facilitate awareness of the guidelines and promote the health benefits of physical activity and support efforts to implement programs, practices, and policies to facilitate increased physical activity and to improve the health of the US population.

AB Background: Pregnancy and childrearing can impact women's health and alter chronic disease trajectories in later life, including cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to assess measures of women's cardiovascular health by time since last live birth. Methods: Data were from 4,021 nonpregnant U.S. women, 20-44 years of age, participating in the 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Cardiovascular health was assessed using physical measures, laboratory measures, self-reported behaviors, medical conditions, and selected psychosocial factors by time since last live birth. Results: Women reported their last live birth within the past 12 months ("mothers of infants"; 7.4%), >12 months, but <3 years ago ("mothers of toddlers"; 10.0%), or >= 3 years ago ("mothers of older children"; 45.2%); 37.3% were nulliparous. Compared with nulliparous women, mothers of older children had a higher prevalence of selected cardiovascular risk factors, including unhealthy diet (75.6% vs. 68.8%) and smoking (28.1% vs. 21.9%), after adjustment for sociodemographics (including age). Mothers of toddlers had a higher prevalence of unhealthy diet (78.0% vs. 68.8%). Mothers also had poorer metabolic health as indicated by a higher prevalence of low HDL cholesterol among mothers of toddlers and older children (44.2% and 40.4%, respectively, vs. 33.6%), and a higher prevalence of high waist circumference among mothers of infants (65.6% vs. 53.8%). Some mothers also had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, including low physical activity and poor sleep. Conclusion: Prior pregnancy and childrearing may be associated with selected cardiovascular risk factors among nonpregnant reproductive-aged U.S. women.

AB We have previously reported that prenatal progestin exposure induces autism-like behavior in offspring through ER beta (estrogen receptor beta) suppression in the brain, indicating that progestin may induce autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In this study, we aim to investigate whether prenatal progestin exposure is associated with ASD. A population-based case-control epidemiology study was conducted in Hainan province of China. The ASD children were first screened with the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) questionnaire, and then diagnosed by clinical professionals using the ASD diagnosis criteria found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V). Eventually, 235 cases were identified as ASD from 37863 children aged 0-6 years old, and 682 matched control subjects with typically developing children were selected for the analysis of potential impact factors on ASD prevalence using multivariate logistic regression. Our data show that the ASD prevalence rate in Hainan was 0.62% with a boy:girl ratio of 5.4:1. Interestingly, we found that the following factors were strongly associated with ASD prevalence: use of progestin to prevent threatened abortion, use of progestin contraceptives at the time of conception, and prenatal consumption of progestin-contaminated seafood during the first trimester of pregnancy. All the above factors were directly or indirectly involved with prenatal progestin exposure. Additionally, we conducted in vivo experiments in rats to further confirm our findings. Either endogenous (progesterone) or synthetic progestin (norethindrone)-treated seafood zebrafish were used to feed pregnant dams, and the subsequent offspring showed autism-like behavior, which further demonstrated that prenatal progestin exposure may induce ASD. We conclude that prenatal progestin exposure may be associated with ASD development.

AB Background: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with adverse short- and long-term maternal and fetal outcomes. Observational data support a link between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy and GDM. However, it is unknown whether treatment of SDB with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves glucose control in this patient population. In addition, CPAP adherence and feasibility as a treatment option in pregnancy is unknown. This pilot randomized, controlled trial aims to primarily determine the feasibility of CPAP treatment in pregnant women with SDB and GDM. This study is also investigating the effect of SDB treatment on 24-h glucose profiles as an exploratory outcome.
   Objectives: To describe the study methodology in this ongoing study of pregnant women with GDM and SDB.
   Patients and Methods: Pregnant women with GDM and SDB defined by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 10 (Chicago Scoring Criteria) on level 2 polysomnography are randomized to either auto titrating CPAP (experimental group) or a nasal dilator strip (control group) until delivery. The primary outcome, objectively-assessed adherence to CPAP, is measured over the course of the treatment period using device-specific software. Recruitment and retention rates will be calculated to assess the feasibility for planning future trials. Twenty-four hour glucose profiles are measured over a 72-h period using the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, before and after the intervention.
   Conclusion: The results of this study will be highly informative to determine whether CPAP is a feasible treatment for pregnant women with GDM and SDB, a specialized population at risk for substantial comorbidity. The trial results will ultimately be useful in planning future SDB treatment trials in pregnancy and GDM.

AB BackgroundThe first 12 months after childbirth may represent a high-risk time for depression. In Ethiopia there is a paucity of evidence about its magnitude and associated factors during that period. So, the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of depression and associated factors among postpartum women in Mizan Aman town, Bench Maji Zone, Southwest Ethiopia 2017.MethodsA community based cross- sectional study design was employed from March 15 to April 15, 2017. Four hundred sixty women were selected using multistage random sampling technique. Face to face interview were conducted using structured questionnaires and standardized scales. Bivariate logistic regression analysis was done to see crude association between each independent variable and outcome variable. Variables with p value<0.25 in bivariate analysis were entered to multivariable logistic regression analysis to control for confounding. Adjusted odd ratios with 95%CI were calculated to identify independent predictors of postpartum depression.ResultFour hundred fifty-six postpartum women participated in the study giving a response rate of 99%. The magnitude of postpartum depression among the study population was 102 (22.4%, 95% CI: 19.84-24.96). Postpartum depression is relatively higher in the first 6 weeks after birth. Postpartum depression is higher among mothers with age range between 18 and 23years (aOR 3.89 95%CI: 1.53-9.90), unplanned pregnancy (aOR 3.35 95% CI: 1.701-6.58), child having sleeping problems (aOR 3.72 95%CI: 1.79-7.72), domestic violence (aOR 2.86 95%CI 1.72-8.79), unsatisfied marital relation (aOR 2.72 95% CI 1.32-5.62), poor social support (aOR 4.30 95% CI 1.79-10.30), history of previous depression (aOR 7.38 95% CI 3.12-17.35) and substance use (aOR 5.16 95% CI 2.52-10.60).ConclusionThe magnitude of postpartum depression was high. This underlines health care planners' needs to incorporate screening strategies for depression following childbirth.

AB Decline in cognitive functioning in the workplace is a major concern for health care systems. Understanding factors associated with nighttime functioning is imperative for instituting organizational risk management policies and developing personalized countermeasures. The present study aims to identify individual factors associated with cognitive functioning during the night shift of hospital nurses working on irregular rotating-shift schedules. Ninety-two female nurses were recruited from 17 wards in two general hospitals, using convenience sampling by clusters. Inclusion criteria were working at least 28 h a week (75% of full time) and one night shift per week. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, diagnosed sleep disorders or medical conditions that may affect sleep and/or function. Cognitive performance was measured during the middle (03:00 h) and at the end (07:00 h) of the night shift using the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) and the Letter Cancellation Task (LCT) over two night shifts. Subjective sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) at the same time points. All participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire for Shift-Workers (MCTQShift) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep duration 24 h before the night shift and time awake since last sleep opportunity were monitored by actigraphy. Univariate repeated measures ANOVA found main effects for clock time (p<0.001), age (p<0.05), time awake (p<0.05) and sleepiness (p<0.01) for DSST correct responses; main effects for clock time (p<0.001) and sleepiness (p<0.001) for LCT capacity; and main effects for clock time (p<0.001) and age (p<0.01) for LCT omission errors. All factors remained significant in a mixed-model analysis for DSST. Cognitive performance among hospital nurses is low during the middle of the night shift and increases at the end of the shift; decreased functioning is associated with increased subjective sleepiness, older age and prolonged time awake. Identifying factors contributing to performance during the night shift may provide a basis for the development of risk management policies and preventative interventions.

AB In the literature, increasing evidence is showing the importance of sleep difficulties in the development or maintenance of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms as well as the association between childbirth-related PTS symptoms and early maternal emotions and perceptions of their children. However, little is known regarding the effects of maternal sleep difficulties on parenting or about the mediational role of childbirth-related PTS symptoms in this association. The present study (pregnancy: T0; 1 month postpartum: T1; 3 months postpartum: T2) had two aims. The first one was to explore whether maternal sleep difficulties could contribute to the maintenance of PTS symptoms and whether PTS symptoms could contribute to the maintenance of maternal sleep difficulties. The second purpose was to explore, at 3 months (T2), the associations among childbirth-related PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and the three dimensions of parenting stress [parental distress (PD), parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child] by examining the mediational role of both maternal sleep difficulties and childbirth-related PTS symptoms. Self-report questionnaires were administered to 95 women at different times (T0, T1, and T2). Mediational results confirmed the bidirectional effects between maternal sleep difficulties and PTS symptoms and their reciprocal role of maintenance of symptoms. Moreover, at 3 months postpartum (T2), sleep difficulties mediated the association between PTS symptoms and the three dimensions of maternal parenting stress, while PTS symptoms mediated the associations among maternal sleep difficulties, PD, and difficult child dimensions of parenting stress. The study contributes to the understanding of the maintenance factors of childbirth-related PTS symptoms and of the relationships among PTS symptoms, maternal sleep difficulties, and parenting stress.

AB Prokineticins are involved in many physiological processes including circadian rhythms, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and cancer. Recently, they have been found to play a role in regulating food intake. Historically, proteins that increase feeding behavior in mammals decrease reproductive behavior to prevent pregnancy and lactation when food is scarce. In the current study, prokineticin-2 (PK2) had pronounced effects on reproductive and ingestive behaviors when given to female Syrian hamsters. Administration of PK2 prevented ingestive behaviors induced by food restriction, such as the amount of time spent with food and eating. Hamsters given PK2 preferred to engage in reproductive behaviors, including spending time with a male and lordosis. Furthermore, analysis of blood plasma revealed that changes to behavior persisted despite similar levels of des-acyl ghrelin (DAG) and reduced glucose concentrations in the blood. Additionally, administering 10 mg/kg of acyl ghrelin (AG) to a different cohort of animals significantly decreased the amount of time females spent with a potential mating partner, increased the amount of time females spent with food, decreased the duration of lordosis, and increased the duration of eating. Results from the current study support the need for further research investigating the reproductive and ingestive roles of PK2 and ghrelin.

AB Women who have experienced significant adversities during childhood and adulthood are at risk for excessive inflammation during pregnancy, but the mechanisms are unclear. Using structural equation modeling, we examined pathways from childhood abuse history and current socioeconomic status (SES) to inflammatory markers through indicators of health risk, recent stressors, and psychological distress in 214 women assessed at mid pregnancy (5-31 weeks gestation). Self-reported data on socioeconomic indicators, childhood trauma history, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), smoking, sleep quality, interpersonal conflict, recent life events, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were collected, and serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined. In separate models, pre-pregnancy BMI, sleep quality, and interpersonal conflict statistically explained the relationship between adversity and inflammation. These three intermediate variables were then entered into a multiple mediation analysis to examine unique effects. Childhood abuse history and current SES both demonstrated significant indirect effects on CRP through pre-pregnancy BMI, and current SES showed a significant indirect effect on IL-6 through all intermediate variables. When examining each indirect pathway individually, pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict emerged as parallel pathways by which low current SES leads to elevated IL-6; the indirect pathway through sleep quality was no longer significant. Pre-pregnancy BMI and interpersonal conflict are two independent mechanisms by which adversity is associated with increased inflammation during pregnancy. Women who have been exposed to significant adversity may be at particular risk for obesity, sleep disruption, and interpersonal conflict, with implications for immune dysregulation during pregnancy.

LA English
DT Article
DE Fine care; Natural childbirth; Pain; Labor; Postpartum recovery
ID DEPRESSION; MODEL
AB Background: This study aimed to observe the effect of fine nursing on pain and postpartum recovery during natural delivery of pregnant women.
   Methods: The clinical data of 192 primiparas who were expecting labor in Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China from 2015-2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 100 cases were treated with fine nursing before and after delivery, and 92 cases were treated with routine nursing. The pain rate, the second stage of labor, the amount of bleeding 2 hours postpartum, and postpartum recovery were compared between the two groups.
   Results: The number of cases of grade 0 and 1 pain and the good rate of pain were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group, the number of cases with grade 2 pain in the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.01). The second stage of labor and the 2h postpartum hemorrhage in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.001). The number of maternal cases with good postpartum sleep, good lactation and good mental health in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05).
   Conclusion: Fine nursing before and after delivery can reduce maternal pain rate, shorten the second stage of labor, reduce the amount of bleeding after 2 hours postpartum, promote good sleep, lactation, psychological conditions, reduce postpartum infection rate, which is conducive to maternal body recovery, worthy of clinical promotion.

AB There are in France several millions of shift-workers and night-workers (20 to 25% of employees).
   These workers are therefore subject to variations in their working and rest schedules.
   These regular schedule changes are associated with repeated desynchronization of circadian biological clock.
   The negative impacts on sleep are insomnia, drowsiness, and reduced sleep time in 24 hours.
   There is also a proven effect on the occurrence of a metabolic syndrome, with a likely effect on obesity, type 2 diabetes, blood pressure and coronary artery disease.
   There is a likely effect on the occurrence of cancer (including breast cancer).
   Night working is not recommended for pregnant women because of the risk of miscarriage, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation.

AB Background Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, little is known about the association of SDB with timing of delivery. We examined the association of snoring frequency, a key SDB marker, and snoring intensity, a correlate of SDB severity, with time-to-delivery among a cohort of pregnant women. Methods In this prospective cohort study, 1483 third trimester pregnant women were recruited from the University of Michigan prenatal clinics. Women completed a questionnaire about their sleep, and demographic and pregnancy information was abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of those with hypertension or diabetes, 954 women were classified into two groups by their snoring onset timing, chronic or pregnancy-onset. Within each of these groups, women were divided into four groups based on their snoring frequency and intensity: non-snorers; infrequent-quiet; frequent-quiet; or frequent-loud snorers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the association between snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery, adjusting for maternal characteristics. Results Chronic snoring was reported by half of the pregnant women, and of those, 7% were frequent-loud snorers. Deliveries before 38 weeks' gestation are completed occurred among 25% of women with chronic, frequent-loud snoring. Compared with pre-pregnancy non-snorers, women with chronic frequent-loud snoring had an increased hazard ratio for delivery (adjusted hazard ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 2.45). Conclusions Snoring frequency and intensity is associated with time-to-delivery in women absent of hypertension or diabetes. Frequent-loud snoring may have a clinical utility to identify otherwise low-risk women who are likely to deliver earlier.

AB Objective: To explore the potential factors that mediate the relationship between mindfulness and symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS) in women who experienced stillbirth.
   Design: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data before women's participation in an online mindfulness intervention (i.e., online yoga).
   Setting: This was a national study, and women participated in their own homes.
   Participants: Women who experienced stillbirth (N = 74) within the past 2 years and resided in the United States.
   Methods: Women were recruited nationally, primarily through social media. Participants (N = 74) completed baseline assessments (self-report mental and physical health surveys) via a Web-based survey tool. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the COPE Inventory subscales to reduce the number of variables before entry into a mediation model. We then tested the mediation effects of sleep quality, self-esteem, resilience, and maladaptive coping on the relationship between mindfulness and PTS symptoms.
   Results: Through the exploratory factor analysis we identified a two-factor solution. The first factor included nine subscales that represented adaptive coping strategies, and the second factor included five subscales that represented maladaptive coping strategies. Results from multiple mediation analysis suggested that mindfulness had a significant inverse relationship to PTS symptoms mediated by sleep quality.
   Conclusion: Mindfulness practices may have potential benefits for grieving women after stillbirth. Evidence-based approaches to improve sleep quality also may be important to reduce PTS symptoms in women after stillbirth.

AB Time of day is a critical factor for most biological functions, but concepts from the field of chronobiology have yet to be fully translated to clinical practice. Circadian rhythms, generated internally and synchronised to the external environment, promote function and support survival in almost every living species. Fetal circadian rhythms can be observed in utero from 30 weeks gestation, coupled to the maternal rhythm, but synchronise to the external environment only after birth. Important cues for synchronisation include the light/dark cycle, the timing of feeding, and exposure to melatonin in breast milk. Disruption to these cues may occur during admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. This can impair the development of circadian rhythms, and influence survival and function in the neonatal period, with a potential to impact health and well-being throughout adult life. Here we outline the rationale and evidence to support a chronobiological approach to neonatal care.

AB Introduction: Given the increasing number of women service members and veterans of childbearing age, it is important to understand the preconception risks in this potentially vulnerable population. This study compared the prevalence of modifiable preconception risk factors among women with and without a history of service.
   Methods: Analyses included data from the 2013 and 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Preconception risk factors included health behaviors, chronic conditions, and mental health among women of childbearing age. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to compare the adjusted prevalence of each outcome among women with and without a history of service. Interaction terms assessed variation by age and history of service.
   Results: Compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service reported higher prevalence of insufficient sleep (49.6% vs. 36.3%; p < .001) and diagnosed depression (26.5% vs. 21.6%; p < .01). Women with a history of service were overall less likely to have obesity (19.8% vs. 26.5%; p < .001). Age-stratified results suggested that, compared with women without a history of service, women with a history of service were more likely to smoke in the 25 to 34 age group and reported comparable levels of obesity in the 35 to 44 age group.
   Conclusions: Women with a history of service demonstrated a preconception health profile that differs from women without a history of service. It is critical that providers are aware of their patients' military status and potential associated risks. (C) 2018 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: Environmental change is one of the stressful events in livestock production. Change in environment disturbs cow behavior and cows require several days to regain a stable behavioral pattern. Sleeping posture (SP) and lying posture (LP) have been used as indicators for animal that are relaxed and well-acclimated to their environment. The aim of this study was to examine the time required by Japanese black cows for stabilization of SP and LP after moving into new environment.
   Methods: Seven pregnant Japanese black cows were used. Cows were moved into new tie-stall shed and their sleeping and lying posture measured 17 times during 35 experimental days. Both SP and LP were detected by accelerometer fixed on middle occipital and hip-cross, respectively. Daily total time, frequency, and average bout of both SP and LP were calculated.
   Results: Daily SP time was the shortest on day 1 and increased to the highest on day 3. It then decreased until day 9, after that stabilized about 65 min/d till the end of experiment. Daily LP time changed in same manner as daily SP time. The average SP bout was the longest on day 1, and then decreased to stable level on day 7. On the other hand, the average LP bout was the shortest on day 1, and it increased to stable level on day 7.
   Conclusion: These results showed that pregnant Japanese black cows needed 1 week to stabilize their SP. However, there were different change patterns between the average SP and LP bout, even though the change pattern of daily SP and LP time were similar.

AB Objective To longitudinally investigate body mass index (BMI) in young children in Ireland and identify factors and critical time points associated with changes in BMI.
   Study design Data on 11 134 children were collected in the nationally representative Growing Up in Ireland infant cohort study. Height and weight were measured at 9 months, 3 years, and 5 years of age. Multilevel regression was used to identify risk factors associated with changes in BMI over time (n = 10 377), combining a unique set of covariates collected from the child and the 2 main caregivers (usually the mother and father).
   Results The proportion of children >= 85th percentile of World Health Organization growth criteria was 39% at 9 months, 44% at 3 years, and 30% at 5 years. Children born large for gestational age (13%) and those with rapid infant weight gain (25%) consistently had higher BMI. Low average BMIs were consistently seen in children born small for gestational age (10%) or before 37 weeks (7%). Smaller variations in BMI existed for other factors including ethnicity, household structure, caregiver weight status, breastfeeding, sex, socioeconomic status, sleeping hours, childcare, and region.
   Conclusions In this study, differences at birth and in infancy appear to be most strongly associated with variation in BMI at all ages. Nevertheless, belonging to a number of other high-risk groups cumulatively could lead children to develop critical weight states. Policy-makers should target families with interventions before and during pregnancy when dominant risk factors are still modifiable. Longer-term follow-up of children may be needed to study associations later in childhood.

AB Among obese pregnant women, 15%-20% have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and this prevalence increases along with body mass index and in the presence of other comorbidities. Prepregnancy obesity and pregnancy-related weight gain are certainly risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy, but certain physiologic changes of pregnancy may also increase a woman's risk of developing or worsening OSA. While it has been shown that untreated OSA in postmenopausal women is associated with a range of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic comorbidities, a body of literature is emerging that suggests OSA may also have serious implications for the health of mothers and fetuses during and after pregnancy. In this review, we discuss the following: pregnancy as a vulnerable period for the development or worsening of OSA; the associations between OSA and maternal and fetal outcomes; the current screening modalities for OSA in pregnancy; and current recommendations regarding peripartum management of OSA.

AB Noise from wind turbines (WTs) is reported as more annoying than traffic noise at similar levels, raising concerns as to whether WT noise (WTN) may negatively affect health, as reported for traffic noise. We aimed to investigate whether residential WTN is associated with adverse birth outcomes. Based on national registries, we identified all Danish dwellings situated within <= 20 wt heights radius and a random selection of 25% of dwellings situated within 20-40 wt heights radius of a WT. We identified 135,795 pregnant women living in the dwellings from 1982 to 2013, and collected information on gestational age and birth weight from a national birth registry. Using data on WT type and simulated hourly wind at each WT, we estimated hourly outdoor and low frequency (LF) indoor WTN at the dwellings of the pregnant women and aggregated as mean nighttime WTN during pregnancy. We used logistic regression with adjustment for individual and area-level covariates for the analyses. We did not find evidence suggesting that mean pregnancy or trimester-specific exposure to outdoor or indoor LF WTN were associated with any of the three adverse birth outcomes investigated: preterm birth (n = 13,003), term small for gestational age (n = 12,220) or term low birth weight (n = 1127). However, the number of cases in the highest exposure categories of >= 42 dB outdoor WTN or >= 15 dB indoor LF WTN were low for all outcomes (n between 0 and 31). The present study does not support an association between nighttime WTN and adverse birth outcomes. However, there were few cases in the high exposure groups and the results call for reproduction.

AB Maternal morbidity is associated with cesarean deliveries. However, new evidence suggests that short- and long-term neonatal morbidity is also associated. This includes respiratory morbidity with conflicting results. To determine whether mode of delivery has an impact on the long-term risk for respiratory morbidity in the offspring, a population-based cohort analysis was conducted including all singleton term deliveries occurring between 1991 and 2014 at a single tertiary medical center. A comparison was performed between children delivered via elective cesarean delivery (CD) and those delivered vaginally. Multiple gestations and fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded from the analysis as were all cases of urgent CDs. Pediatric hospitalizations involving respiratory morbidity of offspring up to the age of 18years were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative respiratory morbidity incidence and a Cox regression model to control for confounders. During the study period, 132,054 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 8.9% were via elective CDs (n=11,746) and 91.1% (n=120,308) were vaginal deliveries. Hospitalizations of the offspring involving respiratory morbidity were significantly more common in offspring delivered by CDs (5.2 vs. 4.3% in vaginal deliveries, p<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of respiratory morbidity in the elective CD group (log rank p<0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model, while controlling for maternal age, gestational age, and birthweight, CD exhibited a significant and independent association with long-term respiratory morbidity of the offspring (adjusted hazard ratio=1.22 (CI, 1.12-1.33), p<0.001).Conclusion: Elective cesarean delivery at term is a significant risk factor for long-term pediatric respiratory morbidity of the offspring.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the association between nightly, napping, and 24-h sleep duration throughout pregnancy and birth weight z-score among nulli- and multiparous women.
   Methods: Nightly,napping, and 24-h sleep duration and birth weight z-score (calculated on thebasis of the International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21st century standards) were studied in a cohort of 176 pregnant women from Brazil. Linear mixed-effect analyses were performed to assess the longitudinal evolution of sleep duration and the best unbiased linear predictors of the random coefficients were estimated. The best unbiased linear predictor estimates of sleep duration intercept and slope were included in the linear regression models with birth weight z-score as the outcome.
   Results: The mean hours of nightly sleep decreased during pregnancy in nulliparous women (beta = -0.55; 95% confidence interval [Cl], -0.83 to -0.27) but the decrease was not statistically significant in multiparous women (beta = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.01). Twenty-four hour sleep duration decreased during pregnancy in both multiparous (beta = -0.50; 95% CI, -0.76 to -0.25) and nulliparous women (beta = 0.77; 95% CI, -1.06 to -0.48). Napping sleep duration did not change in either group. Among the nulliparous women, both first-trimester 24-h sleep duration and its change throughout pregnancy were inversely associated with birth weight (beta = -0.44; 95% CI, -0.68 to -0.21; beta = -1.75; 95% Cl, -3.17 to -0.30, respectively). No associations were detected in multiparous women for nightly and napping sleep duration.
   Conclusions: Nulliparous women with greater decreases in sleep duration throughout their pregnancy gave birth to newborns with lower birth weight z-scores. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Maternal parity and perinatal cortisol adaptation: The role of
   pregnancy-specific distress and implications for postpartum mood
SO PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY

   STRESS; ASSOCIATION; WOMEN; BIRTH; RISK; ANXIETY; MOTHERS
AB Introduction: Compared to women who have given birth before (i.e., multiparas), those giving birth for the first time (i.e., primiparas) show higher cortisol levels. Psychological factors may play a role; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation is a well-described stress response. Primiparity also predicts greater risk for postpartum depression, which may be related to greater correspondence between cortisol and mood following prenatal cortisol elevations. The current study examined associations among parity, perinatal cortisol adaptation, pregnancy-specific distress, and postpartum mood.
   Methods: This longitudinal study assayed serum cortisol levels among 137 women at early, mid-, and late pregnancy and postpartum. Pregnancy-specific distress and depressive symptoms were assessed. Maternal age, race, body mass index, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and sampling time of day were statistically controlled.
   Results: Primiparous women showed higher cortisol levels than multiparous women during mid- (chi(2) = 11.8, p < 0.01) and late pregnancy (chi(2) = 18.9, p < 0.01) and higher distress across pregnancy (F-1,F-126 = 22.1, p < 0.01). Mediation analyses demonstrated that the association between parity and prenatal cortisol (per area under the curve; AUC) was partially accounted for by distress (ab = 1.0, 95%CI [0.05, 2.9]). Prenatal cortisol (per AUC) did not predict postpartum depressive symptoms (b* = 0.03, p = 0.81), with no difference by parity (b* = 0.03, p = 0.91). At postpartum, a significant interaction between parity and cortisol (b* = 0.40, p = 0.03) revealed no significant association between cortisol and mood among multiparas (b* = -0.11, p = 0.28) but a trend toward a positive association among primiparas (b* = 0.24, p = 0.06).
   Discussion: Cortisol levels and pregnancy-specific distress are higher in primiparas versus multiparas, with pregnancy-specific distress partially mediating the association between parity and cortisol levels. Cortisol levels and mood display correspondence at postpartum in primiparous but not multiparous women. While observational studies must be interpreted with caution due to potential unmeasured confounders, these findings suggest that future studies examining mechanisms underlying perinatal and postpartum hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal perturbations and designing interventions aimed at preventing related complications should carefully consider potential differences by parity.

AB Background: Women of childbearing age (18-44 years) present an important group for understanding sleep, but few studies have focused on this population. No study has investigated the associations among sleep, overweight/obesity, and risk of type 2 diabetes among childbearing-age women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: Data were from NHANES, 2005-2008. The study population consisted of 18-44 year old women. Pregnant women and those diagnosed with sleep disorders were excluded. Sleep duration and quality were self-reported. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) measurements, and a 2-hour 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed by trained NHANES staff. An unadjusted linear regression analysis; a second adjusted for demographics only (partially adjusted model); and a third adjusted for demographics and variables associated with overweight/obesity and diabetes (fully adjusted model) were computed to assess associations among sleep duration/quality and BMI, WC, and 2-hour OGTT. Results: Total sample consisted of 2388 childbearing-age women. Only sleep duration was significantly associated with BMI and WC in the unadjusted and partially adjusted models, but was no longer significant in the fully adjusted model. Neither sleep duration nor quality was significantly associated with 2-hour OGTT in any of the models. Conclusions: Targeting sleep duration and sleep quality alone would not likely contribute to significantly lower BMI, WC, or risk of type 2 diabetes in US childbearing-age women. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones using objective measures of sleep, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB To investigate effects of Ca level varying with feeding time daily in sows during late pregnancy on placental lipid metabolism and transport in pigs, sixty pregnant sows were assigned to 3 groups: the CON group was fed low-Ca diet with 11.25 g CaCO3 at 0600 h and 1500 h, H-L group was fed low-Ca diet with 22.5 g CaCO3 at 0600 h and low-Ca diet at 1500 h, and L-H group was fed low-Ca diet at 0600 h and low-Ca diet with 22.5 g CaCO3 at 1500 h, respectively. Serum from sows and umbilical cord and placenta were collected during delivery. Results showed that, compared with the CON group, H-L feeding significantly increased maternal serum total triglyceride (TG) and umbilical serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (P < 0.05). The results showed that long chain fatty acid (FA) contents in placenta were significantly increased in H-L and L-H groups (P < 0.05). Experiments on genes involved in glycolipid metabolism showed that H-L or L-H feeding inhibited mRNA expression of GLUT3, GLUT4, FAS, FABP1, FABPpm, FAT/CD36, while activated the mRNA expression of FASD1, FASD2 and SCD in placenta (P < 0.05). In addition, experiments on genes involved in biological clock showed that L-H feeding sequence activated the mRNA expression of per1 and clock, while H-L and L-H feeding sequence inhibited mRNA expression of per2 in placenta (P < 0.05). It is concluded that maternal supplementation with Ca varying with feeding time daily during late pregnancy affects placental lipid metabolism and transport in pigs by regulating the mRNA expression related to lipid metabolism and the circadian clock.

AB BackgroundWhile the distribution of mosquito bed nets is a widely adopted approach for malaria prevention, studies exploring how the usage of a net may be influenced by its source and other factors remain sparse.MethodsA standardized questionnaire and home-visit observations were used to collect data from 9 villages in Budondo sub-county, Uganda in 2016. Household- and individual-level data were collected, such as bed net ownership (at least one net versus none), acquirement source (free versus purchased), demographics, as well as knowledge of malaria and preventative measures. Net-level data, including alternative uses, and bed net quantity and integrity, were also collected. Mixed effects logistic regression models were performed to identify the key determinants of bed net use.ResultsOverall, the proportion of households with at least one bed net was 40%, while bed net availability was only reported among 27% of all household members. Awareness of the benefits of bed net use was statistically significantly associated with ownership of at least one net (OR=1.72, 95% CI 1.11-2.68, p=0.02). Among those who own net(s), the odds of a bed net being correctly used (i.e., to sleep under) after adjusting for potential confounders were significantly lower for nets that were obtained free compared to nets that were purchased by the owners themselves (OR=0.33, 95% CI 0.21-0.51, p<0.01), resulting in an alternative use of the net. Other factors such as female gender, children5years old, and pregnancy status were also significantly associated with having a net to sleep under (all p<0.01).ConclusionUnderstanding inter- and intra-household net-use factors will help malaria control programmes more effectively direct their efforts to increase public health impact. Future studies may additionally consider socioeconomic status and track the lifetime of the net.

AB Background: Despite the high prevalence of malaria among pregnant women and its associated complications, the level of compliance with insecticide-treated nets (ITN) remains very low. Motivation and self-efficacy have been reported as important determinants of health behaviour, and may be important factors to consider in developing health intervention programmes. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, motivation and self-efficacy of ITN use, and their association with its practice, among pregnant women in a secondary health centre in Maiduguri.
   Methods: The study utilized a cross-sectional study design, using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire to obtain information from 380 respondents. Respondents were classified as ITN users if they slept under an ITN for at least 3days in a week, while those who did not at all, or slept under it less frequently were classified as ITN non-users. Chi squared test was performed to test the bivariate association between ITN use and each of the items of the questionnaire. A further multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors of ITN use.
   Results: The respondents' ages ranged from 15 to 45years, with median (interquartile range) age of 25 (8) years. Eighty percent of them were aware of ITN, but 50.5% believed ITNs could be dangerous. Only 5.5% and 0.8% respectively felt that sleeping under and ITN was either just bad or very bad for their health. Thirty-five percent of the respondents were ITN users. Not having a previous miscarriage (OR = 2.38; 95% CI 1.41-4.03, p = 0.001), knowledge that ITNs were not to be washed after every 1 month (OR = 3.60; 95% CI 1.18-11.06), significant others thinking they should sleep under an ITN (OR = 3.06; 95% CI 1.35-6.96), ability to effectively persuade others to sleep under an ITN (OR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.14-4.94) were significantly associated with ITN use.
   Conclusions: A large proportion of pregnant women in this study were not sleeping under ITNs. The development of health promotion interventions aimed at boosting their self-efficacies for ITN use, and improving social support from their spouses are, therefore, recommended. Health education on ITN use should also be incorporated into post-abortal management.

AB Circadian rhythms, endogenous and entrainable adaptations to 24-hour cycles of light and dark, influence almost all physiologic functions. Emerging evidence suggests that the disruption of normal circadian rhythms, termed chronodisruption, could affect a wide range of disease-related processes. In this review, we describe the molecular generation of circadian rhythms, the effects of chronodisruption on human health, the circadian timing of birth in multiple species, the possible effects of chronodisruption on preterm birth, and some of the open questions in this field.

AB Preterm infants born before 37 weeks' gestation die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) at a rate more than double that of term infants. There is a need for SIDS prevention programs tailored to the specific needs of parents of high-risk infants. The purpose of this study was to pilot test an online educational module addressing SIDS risk-reduction recommendations (RRRs) for parents of preterm infants. This study was conducted in a 44-bed transitional care unit at a level IV NICU in the Midwest. A repeated-measures design was used. Two weeks before discharge, mothers completed a survey, addressing knowledge and plans for caring for their baby at home. Mothers then viewed the 5-section Caring about Preemies' Safe Sleep (CaPSS) education module and completed the postmodule evaluation. A discharge survey was completed 4 weeks postdischarge. Fifteen mothers, mean age 26.4 years, participated; 8 (53%) returned the postdischarge survey. Module evaluation rated clarity and completeness of information high. Mothers' ratings of SIDS knowledge were significantly higher after viewing the module (P = .000) and 4 weeks after discharge home (P = .012). Mothers found the use of a pacifier at sleep times to be new information and changed their plans for caring for their infant, with 28.6% of mothers always offering a pacifier before sleep after discharge compared with the 6.7% who had planned to do this before discharge. However, only 71% of infants slept in parents' room after discharge and only 41% were receiving at least some breast milk, which are not consistent with SIDS RRRs.

DT Article
DE Pregnancy; low back pain; Functional activity; disability
ID PELVIC PAIN; PREVALENCE
AB Objective: To find the impact of pregnancy related low back pain on activity of daily life.
   Methodology: This survey collected data of 200 patients visiting antenatal clinics/hospitals from four city of Punjab during a six months period. Inclusion criteria were the women with third trimester and visiting to antenatal clinic or hospitals. Exclusion criteria were women of 1st and 2nd trimester, and women with previous history of surgery and trauma. Data were collected with modified Ostwestry Disability Index by direct interview.
   Results: Out of 200 women, 156 were with low back pain. Forty (25.6%) females showed minimal disability, 44.9 %(70) females showed moderate disability, 26.3% (41) females showed severe disability, four (2.6%) were crippled and One (0.6%) was bedridden. Out of 200 females, 83.3% had pain in lumbosacral area, 15.4% in sacroiliac area and 1.3% in upper back. 5.7% could not sleep, 5.1% could not lift, 3.8% could not travel, 1.3% had no social life, 0.6% could not stand and 0.6% could not walk. Most disability was noted in sleeping and lifting.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of low back pain among pregnant women was 78%. 26.3% showed severe disability. Low back pain in pregnancy is very common problem that causes significant disability in pregnant women.

AB The weeks and months after birth are vital not only for infant health but also for the health and well-being of women and families as a whole. The first 12weeks postpartum, also known as the 4th trimester, is part of a continuum of pregnancy to recovery and family adjustment. In the United States, this transitional period has been a neglected area for women's health, especially considering the inherent biological, physical, and social changes experienced by millions of women each year. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute supported the 4th Trimester Project to partner with new mothers, health care providers, and health advocates to better describe and understand unmet maternal postpartum health needs. Through woman-centered engagement, the patient-researcher-clinician-advocate team co-developed priority areas for research, policy, communication, and health care service delivery.

AB The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine whether seasonal light exposure, categorized by type of day length, is associated with or predictive of depressive symptoms in late pregnancy and the first 3months postpartum. Women (n=279) expecting their first child were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth education classes. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Day lengths were categorized into short, lengthening, long and shortening. Data analysis included linear mixed models and multiple linear regression. When days were shortening (August to first 4days of November) in late third trimester, depressive symptom scores were highest (35%) and continued to be higher at each postpartum assessment compared to other day length categories. Implications for clinical practice include increased vigilance for depressive symptoms, particularly if late pregnancy and birth occurs during the 3months around the Autumn equinox when day length is shortening. Strategies that increase light exposure in late pregnancy and postpartum should also be considered.

AB This study evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety in women studied in pregnancy and postpartum. Scores on standardized measures of sleep (PSQI) at 6months postpartum, and symptoms of anxiety and depression (OASIS, the PHQ9, and EPDS) were assessed by structured interviews in 116 women in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety. Women who had significantly higher OASIS (anxiety) scores (=.530, p<.001), PHQ9 (depression) scores (=.496, p<.001), and EPDS (postpartum depression and anxiety) scores (=.585, p<.001) also had elevated total PSQI scores after adjustment for covariates, including prenatal depression and anxiety scores. Though inferences about causality are not feasible, these results support emerging research showing sleep quality is a risk factor for negative maternal affect in the postpartum period. Assessment of maternal sleep hygiene is worth consideration as a component of identifying women at risk for postpartum depression and anxiety.

AB We hypothesized that poor sleep quality exacerbates glucose intolerance manifested as elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which increases the risk for gestational diabetes. To test this, 38 pregnant and 22 non-pregnant (age, 18-35 years; body-mass index, 20-35 kg/m(2)) otherwise healthy women were enrolled in the study. Sleep quality was assessed during gestational week 24 (pregnant), or outside of the menstrual period (non-pregnant), using qualitative (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and objective (actigraphic wrist-watch) measures. Blood glucose, total cortisol, and depression status were evaluated. Eight pregnant and one non-pregnant women were lost to follow-up, or withdrew from the study. There was a higher incidence of poor sleep quality in pregnant (73%) relative to non-pregnant women (43%). Although actigraphic data revealed no differences in actual sleep hours between pregnant and non-pregnant women, the number of wake episodes and sleep fragmentation were higher in pregnant women. Poor sleep quality was positively correlated with higher HbA1c in both pregnant (r = 0.46, n = 26, p = 0.0151) and non-pregnant women (r = 0.50, n = 19, p = 0.0217), reflecting higher average blood glucose concentrations. In contrast, poor sleep was negatively correlated with cortisol responses in pregnant women (r = -0.46, n = 25, p = 0.0167). Three pregnant women had elevated one-hour oral glucose tolerance test results (>153 mg/dL glucose). These same pregnant women exhibited poor sleep quality. These results support the suggestion that poor sleep quality is an important risk factor that is associated with glucose intolerance and attendant health complications in pregnancy.

AB Epidemiology studies have investigated the association between vitamin D and the risk of sleep disorders, but the results remain controversial. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis with the goal of clarifying the association between vitamin D and sleep disorders risk. All relevant studies were searched using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to January 2018. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effect model A total of nine studies (6 cross-sectional, 2 case-control, and 1 cohort studies) involving 9397 participants were included. By comparing the lowest verse highest levels of serum vitamin D, we found that participants with vitamin D deficiency (VDD) had a significantly increased risk of sleep disorders (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.72). Subgroup analysis showed that VDD also was associated with poor sleep quality (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.05), short sleep duration (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.32), and sleepiness (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.65). Subgroup analyses further indicated that serum 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL could significantly increase the risk of unhealthy sleep. This meta-analysis suggest that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk of sleep disorders. More high-quality cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to verify this association.

AB Introduction: Snoring, the symptom of partial airway obstruction during sleep, is a common complaint during pregnancy and is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Mechanisms underlying this association have not been studied. We investigated the relationship between snoring in pregnancy and maternal serum markers of feto-placental wellbeing.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross sectional study designed to investigate perinatal outcomes of sleep-disordered breathing. Women admitted for delivery were systematically selected and answered a questionnaire about snoring using the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index. Participants who had screening markers measured were included and divided into snorers and non-snorers. Markers measured included first and second trimester Down syndrome screening markers, reported as multiples of the median (MoM). An additional analysis was performed with snorers categorized as acute or chronic snorers based on duration of snoring in relation to pregnancy.
   Results: While significant differences were noted in co-morbid maternal medical conditions between snorers and non-snorers, there were no significant differences in the neonatal outcomes assessed between the two groups. No significant differences were noted in any of the first trimester (PAPP-A) or second trimester (AFP, uE3, hCG, inhibin-A) markers between snorers and non-snorers, p > 0.25. In addition, no significant differences in marker levels were noted between acute and chronic snorers.
   Conclusion: Snoring is not associated with alterations in the markers of fetal or placental wellbeing tested here and suggests that there are alternative mechanisms underlying the association between snoring and adverse perinatal outcomes.

The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of OSA in shift workers. The systematic literature review was performed using the descriptors "sleep apnea" and "shift work", in the databases PubMed, PubMed Central, Biblioteca Virtual em Saude, Web of Science and Scopus, including studies that presented the frequency of OSA in shift workers; published between 2004 and 2014; in English, Portuguese or Spanish; only with human beings, older than 18 years old; using the polysomnography. Review articles or those including participants with previous comorbidities (except overweight/obesity), treated for sleep disorders or pregnant women were excluded. From 1,428 studies identified, four were included in the analysis, resulting in 819 participants, with a predominance of men. The prevalence of OSA in shift workers varied from 14.3% to 38.1%, higher than that estimated for the general population, suggesting an important association with shift work and the need for prevention, diagnostic and intervention on the possible negative impacts of working range on the health of shift workers.

AB IMPORTANCE Maternal depression and anxiety can have deleterious and lifelong consequences on child development. However, many aspects of the association of early brain development with maternal symptoms remain unclear. Understanding the timing of potential neurobiological alterations holds inherent value for the development and evaluation of future therapies and interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between exposure to prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms and offspring white matter microstructure at 1 month of age.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study of 101 mother-infant dyads used a composite of depression and anxiety symptoms measured in mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy and measures of white matter microstructure characterized in the mothers' 1-month offspring using diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging performed from October 1, 2014, to November 30, 2016. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research facility during natural, nonsedated sleep.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the association between maternal depression and anxiety and 1-month infant white matter microstructure as measured by diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging findings.
   RESULTS In the 101 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] age of mothers, 33.22 [3.99] years; mean age of infants at magnetic resonance imaging, 33.07 days [range, 18-50 days]; 92 white mothers [91.1%]; 53 male infants [52.5%]), lower 1-month white matter microstructure (decreased neurite density and increased mean, radial, and axial diffusivity) was associated in right frontal white matter microstructure with higher prenatal maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. Significant sex x symptom interactions with measures of white matter microstructure were also observed, suggesting that white matter development may be differentially sensitive to maternal depression and anxiety symptoms in males and females during the prenatal period.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These data highlight the importance of the prenatal period to early brain development and suggest that the underlying white matter microstructure is associated with the continuum of prenatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms.

AB Ramadan is observed by 1.6 billion Muslims. In an accompanying article that uses data from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System in Burkina Faso, Schoeps et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2018; 187(10):2085-2092) find that exposure to Ramadan in early pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of mortality among children under age 5 years. Ramadan exposes observant individuals to a specific pattern of nutrition and other behaviors, including changes in sleep patterns. How these behaviors might result in child mortality is not yet understood, and the findings reported in this paper should be replicated in other settings.

AB Aim: To elucidate the changes in the daily variation seen in the autonomic nervous system during pregnancy brought about by maternity yoga and to evaluate how maternal yoga affects stress and sleep.
   Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014. Pregnant women who were attending maternity yoga classes at Palmore Hospital between 20 and 23 weeks' gestation were enrolled as the yoga group, and a matched control group was also enrolled. Study participants completed questionnaires, including a perceived stress scale and sleep logs, during their second and third trimesters. Heart rate variability and salivary alpha-amylase levels were evaluated as stress indices at 20-23 weeks' gestation, 28-31 weeks' gestation and 36-40 weeks' gestation.
   Results: A total of 38 women were in the yoga group, with 53 in the control group. At 28-31 weeks' gestation, heart rate variability during night and late-night periods was significantly higher in the yoga group than in the control group. At 36-40 weeks' gestation, variability between the morning, afternoon and late night was significantly higher in the yoga group. Salivary alpha-amylase levels decreased significantly immediately after practicing yoga during all evaluation periods in the yoga group. Night-time sleep duration was significantly longer in the yoga group.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that practicing yoga activates the parasympathetic nervous system during the third trimester of pregnancy, consolidating sleep during the night and decreasing alpha-amylase levels, which indicates reduced stress.

AB AimThe knowledge on biological rhythms is rapidly expanding. We aimed to define the longitudinal development of the daily (24-hour) fetal heart rate rhythm in an unrestricted, out-of-hospital setting and to examine the effects of maternal physical activity, season and fetal sex.
   MethodsWe recruited 48 women with low-risk singleton pregnancies. Using a portable monitor for continuous fetal electrocardiography, fetal heart rate recordings were obtained around gestational weeks 24, 28, 32 and 36. Daily rhythms in fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variation were detected by cosinor analysis; developmental trends were calculated by population-mean cosinor and multilevel analysis.
   ResultsFor the fetal heart rate and fetal heart rate variation, a significant daily rhythm was present in 122/123 (99.2%) and 116/121 (95.9%) of the individual recordings respectively. The rhythms were best described by combining cosine waves with periods of 24 and 8hours. With increasing gestational age, the magnitude of the fetal heart rate rhythm increased, and the peak of the fetal heart rate variation rhythm shifted from a mean of 14:25 (24weeks) to 20:52 (36weeks). With advancing gestation, the rhythm-adjusted mean value of the fetal heart rate decreased linearly in females (P<.001) and nonlinearly in males (quadratic function, P=.001). At 32 and 36weeks, interindividual rhythm diversity was found in male fetuses during higher maternal physical activity and during the summer season.
   ConclusionThe dynamic development of the daily fetal heart rate rhythm during the second half of pregnancy is modified by fetal sex, maternal physical activity and season.

AB Microglia are the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Originally thought to be primarily responsible for disposing of cellular debris and responding to neural insults, emerging research now shows that microglia are highly dynamic cells involved in a variety of neurodevelopmental processes. The hypothalamus is a brain region critical for maintaining homeostatic processes such as energy balance, thirst, food intake, reproduction, and circadian rhythms. Given that microglia colonize the embryonic brain alongside key steps of hypothalamic development, here we tested whether microglia are required for the proper establishment of this brain region. The Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (Csf1r) is expressed by microglia, macrophages and osteoclasts, and is required for their proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Therefore, to eliminate microglia from the fetal brain, we treated pregnant dams with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. We showed that approximately 99% of microglia were eliminated by embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) after pregnant dams were placed on a PLX5622 diet starting at E3.5. Following microglia depletion, we observed elevated numbers of apoptotic cells accumulating throughout the developing hypothalamus. Once the PLX5622 diet was removed, microglia re-populated the postnatal brain within 7 days and did not appear to repopulate from Nestin + precursors. Embryonic microglia depletion also resulted in a decreased litter size, as well as an increase in the number of pups that died within the first two postnatal days of life. In pups that survived, the elimination of microglia in the fetal brain resulted in a decrease in the number of Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and a concomitant accelerated weight gain starting at postnatal day 5 (P5), suggesting that microglia could be important for the development of cell types key to hypothalamic satiety centers. Moreover, surviving PLX5622 exposed animals displayed craniofacial and dental abnormalities, perhaps due to non-CNS effects of PLX5622 on macrophages and/or osteoclasts. Finally, depletion of microglia during embryogenesis had long-term sex-specific effects on behaviour, including the development of hyperactivity and anxiolytic-like behaviour in juvenile and adult female mice, respectively. Together, these data demonstrate an important role for microglia during the development of the embryonic hypothalamus, and perhaps the CNS more broadly.

AB Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy are growing health concerns because these conditions are associated with adverse outcomes for newborn infants. SDB/OSA during pregnancy exposes the mother and the fetus to intermittent hypoxia. Direct exposure of adults and neonates to IH causes neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, and exposure to IH during gestation (GIH) causes long-term deficits in offspring respiratory function. However, the role of neuroinflammation in CNS respiratory control centers of GIH offspring has not been investigated. Thus, the goal of this hybrid review/research article is to comprehensively review the available literature both in humans and experimental rodent models of SDB in order to highlight key gaps in knowledge. To begin to address some of these gaps, we also include data demonstrating the consequences of GIH on respiratory rhythm generation and neuroinflammation in CNS respiratory control regions. Pregnant rats were exposed to daily intermittent hypoxia during gestation (G10-G21). Neuroinflammation in brainstem and cervical spinal cord was evaluated in PO-P3 pups that were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.1 mg/kg, 3 h). In CNS respiratory control centers, we found that GIH attenuated the normal CNS immune response to LPS challenge in a gene-, sex-, and CNS region-specific manner. GIH also altered normal respiratory motor responses to LPS in newborn offspring brainstem-spinal cord preparations. These data underscore the need for further study of the long-term consequences of maternal SDB on the relationship between inflammation and the respiratory control system, in both neonatal and adult offspring.

AB Sleeping in the lateral position during pregnancy can potentially reduce the severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). However, this hypothesis has not been formally investigated in pregnant women. Unlike previous studies that have relied largely on self-reported measures of sleeping position, we investigated the relationship between SDB and sleeping position during late pregnancy using objective measurements. Thirty pregnant women at the 37th gestational week and 30 non-pregnant women (n-Pr) participated in the present study. The pregnant women were divided into 2 groups: those with body mass index (BMI)30kg/m(2) (with obesity, p-Ob), and those with BMI<30kg/m(2) (without obesity, p-nOb). Data were collected using a portable screening device to detect SDB indicated by the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), as well as sleeping position. The occurrence of the lateral sleeping position was higher in pregnant women than in n-Pr (P<0.05). The total RDI significantly differed among the 3 groups [P<0.01; p-Ob, 10.7 (3.1); p-nOb, 7.0 (3.0); n-Pr, 4.3 (2.9)]. The p-Ob group showed significantly lower RDI in the lateral position than in the supine position (P=0.04). Moreover, there was a significant difference in RDI between p-Ob and p-nOb for the supine position (P=0.001), but there was no between-group difference for the lateral position. Sleeping in the lateral position is likely to mitigate existing SDB in pregnant women with obesity in late pregnancy and may be an effective precaution against undiagnosed SDB and associated complications.

AB BACKGROUND
   Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are linked to excessive maternal weight and frequent snoring. However, pathways between maternal excessive weight, pregnancy-onset snoring, and HDP are only partially estimated. We examined and quantified the total and direct associations between excessive maternal weight and incident HDP and their indirect pathway through pregnancy-onset snoring.
   METHODS
   Third trimester pregnant women enrolled from prenatal clinics of a large tertiary medical center. Sleep data were collected through a questionnaire. Demographic and pregnancy information and first trimester maternal weight were abstracted from medical charts. After exclusion of women with prepregnancy hypertension and/or chronic snoring, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the total and direct association between maternal weight and incident HDP and their indirect association through pregnancy-onset snoring. The proportion of the mediated association through pregnancy-onset snoring from the total association of maternal weight and HDP was also quantified.
   RESULTS
   After excluding those with chronic hypertension and/or snoring, the final sample included 1,333 pregnant women. In adjusted analysis, excessive maternal weight was directly associated with incident HDP; odds ratio (OR) = 1.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30, 2.70). Pregnancy-onset snoring significantly mediated the association between maternal weight and incident HDP; OR = 1.08 (95% CI 1.01, 1.17). The mediated pathway accounted for 15% of the total association between maternal weight and incident HDP.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Pregnancy-onset snoring mediates the association between maternal weight and incident HDP in women without prepregnancy snoring or hypertension. These findings demonstrate the relative contributions of excessive maternal weight and pregnancy-onset snoring to incident HDP.

AB Background: Low parental tolerance for crying has been associated with infant sleep problems, yet the directionality of this link remained unclear. This longitudinal study aimed to assess the synchronous and prospective bidirectional links between parental cry-tolerance, soothing, and infant sleep from pregnancy through six months postpartum.
   Methods: Sixty-five couples were recruited during pregnancy and assessed for cry-tolerance using a paradigm in which participants were shown a videotape of a crying infant and were asked to stop the video when they feel it is necessary to intervene. Infant sleep was assessed objectively using actigraphy for five nights at three and six months postpartum. Parental soothing techniques were reported by parents at both assessment points, and cry-tolerance was reassessed at six months.
   Results: Concomitant associations were found between maternal cry-tolerance and infant sleep at six months, indicating that lower maternal cry-tolerance was correlated with poorer actigraphic sleep quality. Furthermore, Structural Equation Modeling analyses yielded significant prospective associations, showing that lower cry-tolerance at pregnancy predicted better infant sleep at three months, whereas more disrupted sleep at three months predicted lower cry-tolerance at six months. Moreover, fathers showed higher cry-tolerance compared to mothers, and parents became more similar to each other across time in their reactivity to infant crying.
   Conclusion: Consistent with the transactional model of infant sleep, the findings of this study highlight the role of parental cry-tolerance in infant sleep development, and demonstrate bidirectional links between this construct and infant sleep throughout the first six months of life.

AB Introduction The Maternal Infant Health Outreach Worker (MIHOW) program is a home visiting program, utilizing peer mentors to improve maternal/child health outcomes in underserved communities. Findings are presented from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of the MIHOW model in a sample of Hispanic women in Tennessee. We hypothesized maternal and infant outcomes would be better in women assigned to MIHOW than women assigned to the minimal education intervention (MEI) group (receipt of educational materials). Methods Women entered the study during pregnancy (<26 weeks gestation) and were followed through 6 months postpartum. A total of 188 women were enrolled and randomly assigned (MEI=94; MIHOW=94), with 178 women completing the study (MEI=87; MIHOW=91). Results Positive and statistically significant (p<0.01) effects of MIHOW were observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, levels of depressive symptoms and parenting stress, safe sleep practices, and infant stimulation in the home. No statistically significant differences were noted in number of prenatal visits. Discussion Results expand limited empiric evidence and provide strong support of the effectiveness of MIHOW on improving health outcomes in this sample of Hispanic mothers and their infants. MIHOW is a viable option for providing culturally sensitive services to immigrant and underserved families.

AB Introduction Although home-visiting programs typically engage families during pregnancy, few studies have examined maternal and child health outcomes during the antenatal and newborn period and fewer have demonstrated intervention impacts. Illinois has developed an innovative model in which programs utilizing evidence-based home-visiting models incorporate community doulas who focus on childbirth education, breastfeeding, pregnancy health, and newborn care. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the impact of doula-home-visiting on birth outcomes, postpartum maternal and infant health, and newborn care practices. Methods 312 young (M=18.4years), pregnant women across four communities were randomly assigned to receive doula-home-visiting services or case management. Women were AfricanAmerican (45%), Latina (38%), white (8%), and multiracial/other (9%). They were interviewed during pregnancy and at 3-weeks and 3-months postpartum. Results Intervention-group mothers were more likely to attend childbirth-preparation classes (50 vs. 10%, OR=9.82, p<.01), but there were no differences on Caesarean delivery, birthweight, prematurity, or postpartum depression. Intervention-group mothers were less likely to use epidural/pain medication during labor (72 vs. 83%; OR=0.49, p<.01) and more likely to initiate breastfeeding (81 vs. 74%; OR=1.72, p<.05), although the breastfeeding impact was not sustained over time. Intervention-group mothers were more likely to put infants on their backs to sleep (70 vs. 61%; OR=1.64, p<.05) and utilize car-seats at three weeks (97 vs. 93%; OR=3.16, p<.05). Conclusions for practices The doula-home-visiting intervention was associated with positive infant-care behaviors. Since few evidence-based home-visiting programs have shown health impacts in the postpartum months after birth, incorporating doula services may confer additional health benefits to families.

AB Objectives: To compare different actigraphy scoring settings with polysomnography (PSG) for 1 night of total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep onset latency (SOL) in healthy pregnant women between 6 and 7 months of gestation.
   Design: Secondary analysis using data from a case-control study.
   Setting: A large university-affiliated hospital in the Midwestern United States.
   Participants: A total of 78 pregnant women were recruited, among which 38 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies were included for this analysis.
   Measurements: Participants had an overnight PSG assessment at a sleep centerwhile simultaneously wearing an actigraph (Minimitter; Philips Respironics, Andover, MA). Sleep parameters from both devices included TST, SE, WASO, and SOL. Four scoring settings were used to obtain these parameters from actigraphy. Bland-Altman tests were used to evaluate the agreement between sleep variables scored independently from actigraphy and PSG.
   Results: The default scoring setting (10-by-40) yielded significantly different results from the PSG (P <.01). The 10 immobile/mobile minutes for sleep onset/end with an activity threshold of 10 (10-by-10) produced estimations of TST, SE, and WASO closest to those produced by PSG. When this setting was used, the mean differences between PSG- and actigraphy-assessed TST, SE, and WASO were -1.9 minutes, -0.4%, and 7.4 minutes. When the 10 and 15 immobile/mobileminutes for sleep onset/end were used, the difference between PSG-and actigraphy-assessed SOL was approximately 4 to 5 minutes.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study do not support the use of default actigraph settings in pregnant women.

AB Study objectives: Maternal antenatal stress may influence offspring development and behavior, but any association with child sleep is unknown.
   Methods: From 2007 to 2011, we recruited pregnant women in Mexico City to the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors prebirth cohort. Mothers completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS, a 4-item questionnaire assessing past-month stress) and the Crisis in Family Systems measure assessing negative life events (NLEs; how many domains among the 11 assessed in which the mother experienced a stressful event in the prior 6 months)-with higher scores reflecting higher stress-and provided 5 timed salivary samples per day on 2 consecutive days, from which we derived cortisol area under the curve, slope, and awakening response. At age 4-6 years, children's sleep was estimated using accelerometry over a 7-day period. We performed secondary analysis of associations of antenatal maternal stress with child sleep duration and efficiency (time asleep/time in bed) using linear regression adjusted for maternal and child characteristics.
   Results: Among 594 mother-child dyads, mean antenatal PSS score was 5.2 (SD=3.2) out of 16, and mean NLE was 3.2 (SD=2) out of 11; child sleep duration was 7.7 hours (SD=0.7), and sleep efficiency was 79% (SD=6). There was no association between any of the stress measures-PSS, NLE, or salivary cortisol-and sleep duration or sleep efficiency in adjusted or unadjusted models.
   Conclusions: Among mother-child dyads in a Mexico City cohort, antenatal stress was not associated with important changes in child sleep at 4-6 years. (c) 2018 National Sleep Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There is a growing realization that proper sleep during pregnancy is essential for the health of the mother and the offspring. However, there are no reports on the effects of maternal sleep restriction on the sleep-wake profiles of newborns. So, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of sleep restriction during the third term of pregnancy on the sleep-wake profiles of neonates born to them. The female pregnant Wistar rats were sleep restricted for 5 h/day on gestational days 15-20 by gentle handling. Sleep-wake profiles of the pups born to them and to the control rats were recorded on postnatal days 1-21. Pups of sleep restricted dams had higher active sleep (AS) and lower quiet sleep (QS) as well as wakefulness. Higher ratio of AS to QS, longer duration of sleep cycles, lesser bout frequency and reduced EEG delta power were also observed in these pups, all of which indicated brain immaturity. All these signs of delayed maturation, usually found in premature babies, were observed in the pups of sleep restricted mothers, who had longer gestation period. This report not only shows the importance of sleep during pregnancy, but it also suggests that neonatal sleep monitoring can be used as a tool for early assessment of retarded brain development.

   Helicobacter pylori in healthy volunteers challenged with a Cag-positive
   strain: a randomised, placebo-controlled phase 1/2 study

AB Background Intramuscular immunisation with a vaccine composed of three recombinant Helicobacter pylori antigens-vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), cytotoxin-associated antigen (CagA), and neutrophil-activating protein (NAP)-prevented infection in animal models and was well tolerated and highly immunogenic in healthy adults. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the vaccine in prevention of a H pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain (BCM 300) in healthy volunteers.
   Methods In this randomised phase 1/2, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study, healthy non-pregnant adults aged 18-40 years who were confirmed negative for H pylori infection were randomly assigned (3:4) to three intramuscular doses of either placebo or vaccine at 0, 1, and 2 months. Randomisation was via a computer-generated list with study numbers ensuring the correct ratio within a block size of seven. Participants were consecutively assigned in a double-blind manner to existing study numbers of the study protocol. Investigators and participants were blinded to allocation throughout the study. One month after the third immunisation, participants underwent challenge with a CagA-positive H pylori strain, which, for safety reasons, was initially administered in a subset of participants. The primary efficacy outcome was the efficacy of the vaccine as measured by the proportion of participants infected with H pylori 12 weeks after the challenge. At the end of the study, participants infected with H pylori were treated for 14 days with combination therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics twice daily. Safety and immunogenicity were monitored at pre-established visits. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00736476, and is completed.
   Findings 63 patients were randomly assigned, 27 to placebo and 36 to the vaccine. 34 participants (19 in the vaccinated group and 15 in the placebo group) underwent infectious challenge, all but one of whom experienced transient mild-to-moderate epigastric symptoms. 12 weeks after infectious challenge, six (32%) of 19 people in the vaccinated group and six (40%) of 15 people in the placebo group remained positive for H pylori. Eradication was successful in everyone who remained infected at 12 weeks. The geometric mean concentrations of antibodies specific to CagA (202 [95% CI 69-588] vs 4.73 [95% CI 1.41-16]; 13=0.001), VacA (1469 [838-2577] vs 73 [39-138]; 13=0.001), and NAP (208 [139-313] vs 8.01 [5.05-13]; p=0.001) were significantly higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group 12 weeks after infectious challenge.
   Interpretation Compared with placebo, the vaccine did not confer additional protection against H pylori infection after challenge with a CagA-positive strain, despite increased systemic humoral responses to key H pylori antigens. The finding of spontaneous clearance of H pylori infection in more than half the participants in the placebo group is remarkable and suggests important immune protection in the healthy adult population.

AB Evidence suggests that poor postpartum sleep quality is a risk factor for the development of postpartum depression. As such, non-pharmacological interventions have been developed to help improve sleep in the postpartum period. The primary aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to determine if non-pharmacological interventions improved maternal sleep and to compare the effectiveness of different intervention types. Secondary aims included examining effects on maternal mood and infant sleep. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from their inceptions to September 2017 and found 15 eligible studies. Non-pharmacological sleep interventions were found to improve subjective reports of maternal sleep (Cohen's d = -0.54, 95% CI = -0.88 to -0.19). Massage (Cohen's d = -1.07 95% CI = -1.34 to -0.79) and exercise (Cohen's d = -0.82 95% CI = -1.28 to -0.37) interventions had the largest impact on maternal sleep quality. Positive effects on nocturnal infant sleep were found for interventions overall (Cohen's d = -0.27 95% CI = -0.52 to -0.02) but not for maternal depression (Cohen's d = -0.08 95% CI = -0.28 to 0.12). Despite evidence suggesting improvements in subjective maternal sleep, more research must be conducted on the durability of effects of non-pharmacological interventions using objective measures of sleep quality.

AB There is a wealth of evidence to say that sleep impacts maternal health during pregnancy, however, little has been published on fetal health and maternal sleep. This scoping review summarises current literature on maternal sleep including sleep disordered breathing, sleep quality, sleep duration and supine sleep position, as these relate to fetal outcomes specifically birth weight, growth, preterm birth and stillbirth.
   An overall interpretation of the studies evaluated shows that events occurring during maternal sleep such as obstructive sleep apnea, sleep disruption and sleep position may have a negative effect on the fetus resulting in altered growth, gestational length and even death. These effects are biologically and physically plausible.
   In conclusion, there is limited and often conflicting information on maternal sleep and fetal outcomes. However, existing evidence suggests that this is an important area for future research. This area is ripe for investigation if there is to be reduction in the physical, emotional, and financial burden of poor fetal outcomes related to maternal sleep. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: High risk pregnancy represents a clinical enigma with several management strategies suggested as prophylaxis or therapeutic approach. In most cases of women with Unexplained Bad Obstetric History (BOH) or Preterm Birth (PTB), luteal phase insufficiency has often been suggested as the underlying cause that may require long-term administration of progesterone. Natural progesterone offers complimentary anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and uterine quiescence actions that go a long way in continuing pregnancy till term while avoiding complications of preterm delivery or infant mortality.
   Aim: To understand the clinical efficacy and safety of Natural progesterone as primary or secondary prophylactic strategy for High risk women with risk factors for PTB or BOH.
   Materials and Methods: Retrospective, case cohort analyses of Natural progesterone prescriptions utilising the Drug utilisation surveillance sheet were carried out at 40 centres across India between July and October'16. Descriptive statistics was utilised to describe the numerical and categorical (nominal and continuous) data.
   Results: Consecutive prescription records of 185 patients demographics included mean age of 28.4 yrs, body weight 60.5 kg with mean abortion rate of 1.5 and 2 for BOH women with first or second trimester loss. Natural progesterone as OMP SR was supplemented for PTB prophylaxisin BOH cases with first or second trimester loss cases, Cervical factor, Still birth, Spotting and Placenta previa. The preferred dosage of OMP SR for women with Cervical factor, First or Second trimester loss was 300 mg for mean duration of 19, 16 and 21 weeks respectively. Similarly in the unexplained Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) cases, OMP SR was administered in mean dosage of 271mg for 18 +/- 5 weeks to prevent pregnancy loss. In all cases, pregnancy was continued till 34th week with no adverse health outcome. Common adverse events including gastritis (n=4, 2.2%), vomiting (n=4, 2.2%), drowsiness (n=8, 4.3%), dizziness (n=6, 3.2%), spotting (n=2, 1.1%), and treated symptomatically with none requiring further hospitalisation or referral.
   Conclusion: Clinical supplementation with oral NMP SR suggests therapeutic compliance and safety profile for long-term administration especially in High risk pregnancies involving unexplained BOH or PTB risk.

AB Background and Aims In-utero exposure to opioids including buprenorphine (BUP) has been shown to affect fetal activity, specifically heart-rate variability (FHRV) and fetal movement (FM). Our objective was to extract simultaneous recordings of fetal cardiac and brain-related activity in BUP-maintained and non-opioid exposed pregnant women using a novel non-invasive biomagnetic technique. Design A pilot study was conducted, recording and analyzing biomagnetic data from fetuses of BUP-maintained and non-opioid exposed pregnant women. Signals were acquired with the non-invasive 151-channel SARA (SQUID-Array for Reproductive Assessment) system. Advanced signal-processing techniques were applied to extract fetal heart and brain activity. Setting University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). Participants Eight BUP-maintained pregnant women from UAMS Women's Mental Health Program between gestational ages (GA) of 29-37 weeks who were treated with 8-24 mg of BUP daily. Sixteen pregnant women with no known opioid exposure in the same GA range were also included. Measurements Outcome measures from the fetal heart and brain signals included: heart rate (FHR), FM, FHR accelerations, FHR-FM coupling, FHRV, fetal behavioral states (FBS) and power spectral density (PSD) of spontaneous brain activity. These measures were analyzed at three GA intervals. Findings Fetal heart and brain activity parameters were extracted and quantified successfully from 18 non-opioid and 16 BUP recordings. Overall analysis in both groups show that: FHR and FM ranged from 131 to 141 beats per minute (b.p.m.) and 5 to 11 counts, respectively. In the 35-37 weeks GA, the coupling duration (similar to 9 s) was the shortest, while three of the FHRV parameters were the highest. The PSD of brain activity revealed highest power in 0.5-4 Hz bandwidth. Transitions in FBS from quiet to active sleep were > 50% of sessions. Conclusions This pilot study showed that a novel biomagnetic technique allows simultaneous quantification of cardiac and brain activities of a group of buprenorphine-exposed and non-exposed fetuses in the third trimester.

AB Sleep problems in young children are among the most common concerns reported to paediatricians. Sleep is thought to have important regulatory functions, and sleep difficulties in early childhood are linked to several psychosocial and physiological problems. Moreover, several prenatal factors have been found to influence infants' sleep. Among them, most of the studies have been focused on maternal prenatal depression and/or anxiety as potential risk factors for sleep problems in childhood, whereas other relevant psychological factors during pregnancy have not received as much attention. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of several psychiatric maternal risk factors during pregnancy (i.e. symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, alcohol use, seasonality, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and/or stressful life events) on the onset of some sleep problems related to sleep quality and sleep practices in 3-month-old infants. We examined 1,221 cases from a population-based birth cohort, with subjective measures during pregnancy in mothers, and at 3months after birth in the infants. The findings showed that all the maternal risk factors during pregnancy, except for symptoms of alcoholism and sleepiness, were related to sleep difficulties in infants. Interestingly, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder symptomatology in mothers during pregnancy was the only variable that predicted more than two sleeping difficulties (i.e. long sleep-onset latency, co-sleeping with parents and irregular sleeping routines) at 3months old. Our results highlight the relevance of maternal risk factors during pregnancy, and not only prenatal depression and/or anxiety, as variables to be considered when examining sleep difficulties in infants.

AB Sleep-disordered breathing is more common in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy; however, most studies have not adequately accounted for the potential confounding impact of obesity. This study evaluated the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing in women with gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia compared with body mass index- and gestation-matched normotensive pregnant women. Women diagnosed with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia underwent polysomnography shortly after diagnosis. Normotensive controls body mass index-matched within +/- 4kgm(-2) underwent polysomnography within +/- 4weeks of gestational age of their matched case. The mean body mass index and gestational age at polysomnography were successfully matched for 40 women with gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia and 40 controls. The frequency of sleep-disordered breathing in the cases was 52.5% compared with 37.5% in the control group (P=0.18), and the respiratory disturbance index overall did not differ (P=0.20). However, more severe sleep-disordered breathing was more than twice as common in women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia (35% versus 15%, P=0.039). While more than half of women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy meet the clinical criteria for sleep-disordered breathing, it is also very common in normotensive women of similar body mass index. This underscores the importance of adjusting for obesity when exploring the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension in pregnancy. More severe degrees of sleep-disordered breathing are significantly associated with gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and sleep-disordered breathing may plausibly play a role in the pathophysiology of pregnancy hypertension in these women. This suggests that more severe sleep-disordered breathing is a potential therapeutic target for reducing the prevalence or severity of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

AB To increase access to safe infant sleep surfaces and reduce risk of sleep-related infant deaths, the Georgia Department of Public Health implemented a portable crib distribution and safe sleep educational program. The aim of this evaluation was to compare parental knowledge and practices related to infant sleep before and after receipt of the safe sleep educational program and crib. A prospective, matched pre- and post-test cohort design with a follow-up survey was utilized to evaluate changes in knowledge and practices. Female participants were recruited through the county health department and met the following criteria: (1) between 32 and 40 weeks pregnant or within 3 months postpartum, and (2) demonstrated financial need. Participants completed a survey prior to the start of a group educational program and upon program completion. For those who agreed, a follow-up phone survey was conducted approximately 10 weeks after program completion or after the infant's birth. McNemar's Chi square tests were conducted to detect significant differences between specific items on pre-test, post-test, and follow-up surveys, and paired sample t tests were conducted to compare differences in knowledge and practice scores. A total of 132 participants completed matched pre- and post-test surveys and 76 completed follow-up surveys. Knowledge of recommendations regarding position, surface, environment, smoking, breastfeeding, and pacifier use increased significantly between pre- and post-test, with most participants maintaining knowledge at follow-up. The proportion of recommended practices also increased significantly. A group-based safe sleep educational program can be effective in reducing risky infant sleep practices.

AB Pregnancy and lactation are metabolically challenging states, where the mother must supply all the energy requirements for the developing fetus and growing pups respectively. The aim of the current study was to characterize many aspects of energy homeostasis before and during pregnancy in the mouse, and to examine the role of voluntary activity on changes in energy expenditure during pregnancy. In a secondary aim, we evaluate measures of energy homeostasis during pregnancy in mice that successfully reared their litter or in mice that went on to abandon their litter, to determine if an impairment in pregnancy-induced adaptation of energy homeostasis might underlie the abandonment of pups soon after birth. During pregnancy, food intake was increased, characterized by increased meal size and duration but not number of meals per day. The duration of time spent inactive, predicted to indicate sleep behaviour, was increased both early and late in pregnancy compared to pre-pregnancy levels. Increased x + y beam breaks, as a measure of activity increased during pregnancy and this reflected an increase in ambulatory behaviour in mid pregnancy and an increase in non ambulatory movement in late pregnancy. Energy expenditure, as measured by indirect calorimetry, increased across pregnancy, likely due to the growth and development of fetal tissue. There was also a dramatic reduction in voluntary wheel running as soon as the mice became pregnant. Compared with successful pregnancies and lactations, pregnancies where pups were abandoned soon after birth were associated with reduced body weight gain and an increase in running wheel activity at the end of pregnancy, but no difference in food intake or energy expenditure. Overall, during pregnancy there are multiple adaptations to change energy homeostasis, resulting in partitioning of provisions of energy to the developing fetus and storing energy for future metabolic demands.

AB Background: Both perinatal depression and infant sleep problems are common concerns in many communities, with these problems often coinciding. Findings in this area conflict and much of the research relies on poor measures of sleep and/or depression. Adding to this complexity is the rise in antidepressant treatment for perinatal maternal depression and no previous study has examined the relationship between such exposure and infant sleep.
   Methods: This study draws on four waves of data (early pregnancy and third trimester, and six and 12 months postpartum) from 264 women in the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort study of women recruited in early pregnancy in Melbourne, Australia. Cross-lagged regression models were used to examine reciprocity of longitudinal effects between depressive symptoms and infant sleep.
   Results: Maternal antepartum depression and antidepressant use were not significant predictors of infant sleep problems. Likewise, infant sleep problems were not significant predictors of postpartum maternal depression. However, maternal cognitions about infant sleep, characterised by maternal expectations to immediately attend to their crying child, did demonstrate positive reciprocal effects with infant nocturnal waking between six and 12 months postpartum.
   Limitations: Infant sleep outcomes were reported by the mother and the sample were predominantly Anglophone, restricting generalizability of the models to other cultures.
   Conclusions: Maternal depression and antidepressant use were not found to be significant factors in infant sleep problems and, likewise, infant sleep problems were not associated with maternal depression. However, postpartum maternal cognitions around six months postpartum regarding limit-setting at night may predict increases in later nocturnal infant signaling.

AB Background: Even though more than 20% of women meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder during the perinatal period, very little is known about the predictors of these problems. As a result, we systematically reviewed the literature on risk factors for new onset anxiety and maternal anxiety exacerbation in the perinatal period.
   Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Ovid, ProQuest Portal, and Web of Science were searched for studies assessing risk factors for the development of new onset anxiety or anxiety worsening in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
   Results: 11,759 citations were identified, with 11 studies meeting eligibility criteria. New onset anxiety was assessed in 7 studies, anxiety worsening in 3, and 1 assessed both. Lower educational attainment, living with extended family members, multiparity, a family history of psychiatric disorders, hyperemesis gravidarum, comorbid sleep disorders, and prenatal oxytocin exposure were risk factors for new onset perinatal anxiety, while presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and prenatal oxytocin were risk factors for anxiety worsening.
   Limitations: Studies not explicitly stating whether participants had pre-existing anxiety disorders were excluded. As a result, meta-analysis was not possible for several risk factors.
   Conclusions: Risk factors for new onset anxiety and anxiety worsening during the perinatal period include psychological, social, and biological exposures. Given the lack of studies differentiating women with and without pre-existing anxiety disorders, additional research is required in order to determine whether these factors differ from the non-puerperal population, as well as from each other.

AB Background: Recently, the number of patients diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has increased in Korea. Risk factors of GERD include age, sex, medication use, lack of physical exercise, increased psychological stress, low or high body mass index (BMI), unhealthy eating habits, increased alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking. However, few studies examined the major factors affecting GERD in women of childbearing age. Therefore, this study assessed the risk factors of GERD among 20,613 female nurses of reproductive age using data from the Korea Nurses' Health Study.
   Methods: Participants were recruited from July 2013 to November 2014. They provided their history of GERD 1 year prior to data collection, along with information on their demographic characteristics, health-related behaviors, diet, medical history, and physical and psychological factors. Of the total sample, 1184 individuals with GERD diagnosed in the year prior to the study were identified. Propensity score matching was used for analysis.
   Results: Cigarette smoking, increased alcohol consumption, low or high BMI, depression, and increased psychosocial stress were associated with the prevalence of GERD among Korean young women. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed significant positive relationships between GERD and being a former smoker; having a low (< 18.5 kg/m(2)) or high BMI (> 23 kg/m(2)); and having mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression.
   Conclusions: Smoking, BMI, and depression were associated with GERD. To reduce this risk among female nurses, intervention strategies are required to help nurses maintain a normal weight and manage their depression.

AB Background: Although breastfeeding duration in New Zealand's indigenous Maori is shorter than in non-Maori, we know little about barriers or motivators of breastfeeding in this community. The aim of this analysis was to identify predictors for extended duration of breastfeeding amongst participants drawn from predominantly Maori communities in regional Hawke's Bay.
   Methods: Mother/baby dyads were recruited from two midwifery practices serving predominantly Maori women in mostly deprived areas, for a randomised controlled trial comparing the risks and benefits of an indigenous sleeping device (wahakura) and a bassinet. Questionnaires were administered at baseline (pregnancy) and at one, three and six months postnatal. Several questions relating to breastfeeding and factors associated with breastfeeding were included. The data from both groups were pooled to examine predictors of breastfeeding duration.
   Results: Maori comprised 70.5% of the 197 participants recruited. The median time infants were fully breastfed was eight weeks and Maori women were more likely to breastfeed for a shorter duration than New Zealand European women with an odds-ratio (OR) of 0.45 (95% CI 0.24, 0.85). The key predictors for extended duration of breastfeeding were the strong support of the mother's partner (OR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.76, 7.55) or her mother for breastfeeding (OR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.27, 4.82), longer intended duration of maternal breastfeeding (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.03) and being an older mother (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02, 1.12). The key predictors for shorter duration of breastfeeding were pacifier use (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17, 0.46), daily cigarette smoking (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69), alcohol use (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.31, 0.93) and living in a more deprived area (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22, 0.72).
   Conclusions: Breastfeeding duration in this group of mainly Maori women was shorter than the national average. Increasing the duration of breastfeeding by these mothers could be further facilitated by ante and postnatal education involving their own mothers and their partners in the support of breastfeeding and by addressing pacifier use, smoking and alcohol use.

TI The Healthy Pregnancy Research Program: transforming pregnancy research

SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Although maternal morbidity and mortality in the US is among the worst of developed countries, pregnant women have been under-represented in research studies, resulting in deficiencies in evidence-based guidance for treatment. There are over two billion smartphone users worldwide, enabling researchers to easily and cheaply conduct extremely large-scale research studies through smartphone apps, especially among pregnant women in whom app use is exceptionally high, predominantly as an information conduit. We developed the first pregnancy research app that is embedded within an existing, popular pregnancy app for self-management and education of expectant mothers. Through the large-scale and simplified collection of survey and sensor generated data via the app, we aim to improve our understanding of factors that promote a healthy pregnancy for both the mother and developing fetus. From the launch of this cohort study on 16 March 2017 through 17 December 2017, we have enrolled 2058 pregnant women from all 50 states. Our study population is diverse geographically and demographically, and fairly representative of US population averages. We have collected 14,045 individual surveys and 107,102 total daily measurements of sleep, activity, blood pressure, and heart rate during this time. On average, women stayed engaged in the study for 59 days and 45 percent who reached their due date filled out the final outcome survey. During the first 9 months, we demonstrated the potential for a smartphone-based research platform to capture an ever-expanding array of longitudinal, objective, and subjective participant-generated data from a continuously growing and diverse population of pregnant women.

AB Circadian disruptions impair reproductive health in human populations and in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that mistimed food, a common disruptive feature of shift work, impairs reproductive success in mice. Male and female mPer2(Luc) mice on a C57BL/6 background were fed during the light or dark phase in two experiments. Food-induced internal misalignment of the liver clock was verified by in vivo bioluminescence in anesthetized mice in both experiments. In Experiment 1, food-restricted pairs were monitored for litters for 18 weeks. In the light-fed group, birth of the first litter was significantly delayed, and total reproductive output was significantly reduced by 38%. In Experiment 2, estrous cycling was monitored for 3 weeks, and then after pairing, copulatory plugs, pregnancy, litter sizes, and uterine implantation sites were measured. Fewer light-fed females birthed litters (25% versus 73%). This was attributable to a difference in behavior as mating success was significantly reduced in light-fed mice: 42% were observed with a copulatory plug compared to 82% for dark-fed mice. The proportion of mice displaying uterine implantation sites was the same as the proportion observed with copulatory plugs, suggesting no deficit in initiating pregnancy after mating. Estrous cycling and pregnancy maintenance did not differ between the groups. We conclude that mistimed feeding inhibits reproduction in mice by reducing successful mating behavior.

SO PEDIATRIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BORN; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking, substance misuse in pregnancy and prone sleeping increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We examined the effect of maternal smoking, substance misuse and sleeping position on the newborn response to hypoxia.
   METHODS: Infants born between 36 and 42 weeks of gestational age underwent respiratory monitoring in the prone and supine sleeping position before and during a hypoxic challenge. Minute ventilation (MV) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) levels were assessed.
   RESULTS: Sixty-three infants were studied: 22 controls, 23 whose mothers smoked and 18 whose mothers substance-misused and smoked. In the supine position, baseline MV was higher and ETCO2 levels were lower in infants of substance-misusing mothers compared to controls (p = 0.015, p = 0.017, respectively). Infants of substance-misusing mothers had a lower baseline MV and higher ETCO2 levels in the prone position (p = 0.005, p = 0.004, respectively). When prone, the rate of decline in minute ventilation in response to hypoxia was greater in infants whose mothers substance-misused and smoked compared to controls (p = 0.002) and infants of smoking mothers (p = 0.016).
   CONCLUSION: The altered response to hypoxia in the prone position of infants whose mothers substance-misused and smoked in pregnancy may explain their increased vulnerability to SIDS.

   MELATONIN
AB Melatonin is a lipophilic hormone synthesized and secreted mainly in the pineal gland, acting as a neuroendocrine transducer of photoperiodic information during the night. In addition to this activity, melatonin has shown an antioxidant function and a key role as regulator of physiological processes related to human reproduction. Melatonin is involved in the normal outcome of pregnancy, beginning with the oocyte quality, continuing with embryo implantation, and finishing with fetal development and parturition. Melatonin has been shown to act directly on several reproductive events, including folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation, and corpus luteum (CL) formation. The molecular mechanism of action has been investigated through several studies which provide solid evidence on the connections between maternal melatonin secretion and embryonic and fetal development. Melatonin administration, reducing oxidative stress and directly acting on its membrane receptors, melatonin thyroid hormone receptors (MT1 and MT2), displays effects on the earliest phases of pregnancy and during the whole gestational period. In addition, considering the reported positive effects on the outcomes of compromised pregnancies, melatonin supplementation should be considered as an important tool for supporting fetal development, opening new opportunities for the management of several reproductive and gestational pathologies.

AB Introduction Separation after preterm birth is a major stressor for infants and parents. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is a method of care suitable to use in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to minimise separation between parents and infants. Less separation leads to increased possibilities for parent-infant interaction, provided that the parents' sleep quality is satisfactory. We aimed to evaluate the effect of continuous SSC on sleep quality and mood in parents of preterm infants born <33 weeks of gestation as well as the quality of parent-infant interaction and salivary cortisol concentrations at the time of discharge.
   Methods and analysis A randomised intervention study with two arms-intervention versus standard care. Data will be collected from 50 families. Eligible families will be randomly allocated to intervention or standard care when transferred from the intensive care room to the family-room in the NICU. The intervention consists of continuous SSC for four consecutive days and nights in the family-room. Data will be collected every day during the intervention and again at the time of discharge from the hospital. Outcome measures comprise activity tracker (Actigraph); validated self-rated questionnaires concerning sleep, mood and bonding; observed scorings of parental sensitivity and emotional availability and salivary cortisol. Data will be analysed with pairwise, repeated measures, Mann Whitney U-test will be used to compare groups and analysis of variance will be used to adjust for different hospitals and parents' gender.
   Ethics and dissemination The study is approved by the Regional Research Ethics Board at an appropriate university (2016/89-31). The results will be published in scientific journals. We will also use conferences and social media to disseminate our findings.

AB Objective To characterize sleep patterns among pregnant women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization.
   Study design We conducted a prospective cohort study of women undergoing prolonged antepartum hospitalization after 20 weeks' gestation. Women were recruited to wear an Actigraph, complete a sleep log for 7 consecutive days, and complete a sleep survey at the end of the study period. Actigraphy was used to determine rest and sleep intervals, sleep onset latency, and wake time after sleep onset.
   Results A total of 40 participants were recruited, and 28 had >= 5 nights of data for a total of 177 nights of antepartum sleep data. Mean gestational age was 30 weeks. Median sleep duration was 7.05 h +/- 1.71 h. In all, 43.5% of women had an average sleep duration of <7 h per night. In all, 28.2% of the study nights had a bedtime between midnight and 5 am. Going to bed between midnight and 5 am was significantly associated with sleep durations of <7 h (70.7 vs. 32.5%, p < .001). Participants reported an average of 2.4 awakenings per night due to hospital-related events.
   Conclusions Prolonged antepartum hospitalization has a negative impact on sleep duration and quality.

ID INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; PRETERM INFANTS; WEIGHT-GAIN
AB Objectives To measure the internal and external light exposure of incubators and open cots in an Australian single-room configured neonatal unit and compare findings to current recommendations.
   Methods Light meters were placed in the internal and external environment of incubators and open cots within occupied single rooms in a tertiary-level neonatal unit between 15 September and 28 October 2015. Data were recorded in one-second increments over a minimum of 48 hours per room.
   Results Internal median light in incubators and open cots predominantly fell below 50 lux, with low amplitude diurnal cycling. Incubator covers substantially reduced external light exposure, contributing to very low light conditions (< 10 lux). Periodically, light inside incubators peaked six times greater than the maximum recommendation of 600 lux. Overall, internal incubator and open cot lighting in the neonatal unit met American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations for 65.1% of the time during the day and 25.6% overnight. Australasian Health Infrastructure Alliance recommendations were met for 6.7% of the time during the day and 2.4% overnight.
   Conclusions Overall, light levels fell predominantly below 50 lux with peak periods of extreme light exposure. Low amplitude cyclic light was evident, but it remains unknown if this is sufficient to produce an effect on circadian entrainment, especially in preterm neonates. Current guidelines do not stipulate optimal cyclic light levels in neonatal units to promote circadian rhythms in the newborn population. Further research to determine well-defined lighting parameters for neonates of different gestations is paramount.

AB In epidemiologic studies, classifying episodic exposures to chemicals with short half-lives, such as phthalates and phenols, is challenging. We assessed whether accounting for sources of variability unrelated to exposure pathways would improve the reproducibility of urine concentrations of select phthalate metabolites and phenols. In 2011, a subset of pregnant women (n = 19) enrolled in a prospective study provided first morning urine samples every 3-4 weeks between 16 and 36 weeks gestation. At the time of collection, we identified potential contributors to variations in urinary concentrations: weight gain, gestational age, time slept, time since awoke, time since last food/drink, and time since last void. We estimated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) among repeat urine concentrations with and without adjustment for sources of variability using a random intercept linear mixed model. Concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, butyl, and propyl parabens were the most reproducible (ICCs: 0.68, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively). However, adjustment for potential sources of variability unrelated to exposure pathways did not materially improve reproducibility nor the ability of a single sample to predict exposure based on average biomarker concentrations across pregnancy. Future studies should carefully consider the exposure timeframe and the reliability of using biomarker concentrations from a single time point to represent exposures over pregnancy.

AB Postpartum psychosis is a psychiatric emergency that affects 1 to 2 per 1000 women. Key clinical features include mood fluctuation, abnormal thoughts or behaviors, and confusion. Women with a history of bipolar disorder are at heightened risk, as are first-time mothers; current research on the causes focuses on biological triggers, such as immune dysregulation. Women with postpartum psychosis require inpatient hospitalization and should be treated with lithium, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines.

AB Changes in sleep are ubiquitous in the perinatal period, and it is important to be able to determine when these changes are significant enough to indicate sleep deficiency associated with increased risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes. Guidelines for identifying sleep deficiency include insomnia symptoms, excessively shortened sleep duration, and perception of insufficient or nonrestful sleep. Causes and complicating factors related to such sleep problems have been well documented and are used to tailor behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for women who are pregnant or in the early postpartum period.

AB Orexin A (OXA) and B (OXB) are hypothalamic neuropeptides identified as regulators of food intake, energy homoeostasis, sleep-wake cycle and arousal. They also create an integrative link between energy homoeostasis and reproduction. Although their functions in the ovaries and testes have been partially explored, to date, less attention has been focused on the role of the peptides in the uterus. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of one of orexins - orexin B on oestradiol (E-2), oestrone (E-1) and testosterone (T) secretion by porcine endometrial and myometrial slices as well as the gene expression of key steroidogenic enzymes responsible for steroid production (CYP17A1, CYP19A3) during the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle (days 10 to 11) and early pregnancy (days 10 to 11, 12 to 13, 15 to 16, 27 to 28). Orexin B suppressed E-2 secretion by endometrial slices on days 10 to 11 and 15 to 16 of pregnancy, and days 10 to 11 of the cycle. In the myometrium, OXB inhibited E-2 production on days 10 to 11 of pregnancy, whereas on days 12 to 13 it enhanced steroid output. Endometrial E-1 release was potentiated by the peptide during all studied periods of the cycle and pregnancy, with the exception of days 12 to 13, when an inhibitory effect was observed. Myometrial secretion of E-1 was increased, except on days 27 to 28. Testosterone secretion by endometrial slices was increased on days 12 to 13 and 27 to 28 of pregnancy. On days 10 to 11 of the cycle, T release was stimulated in response to the lowest and decreased under the influence of the highest dose of OXB. In the myometrium, T production was inhibited by OXB on days 10 to 11 of pregnancy and during the corresponding period of the cycle. On days 27 to 28 of pregnancy, T release was potentiated by the lowest dose of OXB. Expression of both genes was modified by OXB depending on the period of pregnancy and the type of examined uterine tissues. Our findings suggest that OXB, through modulation of uterine steroidogenesis, may have a regulatory role in the uterus.

AB PurposeTo examine the association between snoring, sleep quality, quantity, and blood pressure in third-trimester normotensive pregnant women.
   DesignThis study was a cross-sectional analysis of two cohorts of healthy pregnant women recruited from a prenatal clinic in a medical center in Northern Taiwan.
   MethodsA total of 322 women reported sociodemographic and health characteristics in a structured interview and wore a wrist actigraph on their nondominant wrist for 7 consecutive days to assess objective sleep patterns. The women's resting blood pressures were measured while seated in the clinic by trained personnel using an electronic sphygmomanometer.
   FindingsOne hundred thirty-three (41.3%) women reported snoring. Ninety-three women (28.9%) had <6 hr of nighttime sleep, with only 95 (29.5%) women averaging 7 or more hours of nighttime sleep. In the univariate analyses, snoring was positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as mean arterial pressure levels (p < .05). In the multivariate analyses, snoring remained as a significant predictor of higher diastolic blood pressure ( = 2.07, p < .05) and mean arterial pressure levels ( = 2.00, p < .05), after adjustment for age, parity, gestational age, body mass index before pregnancy, and sleep quantity and quality by actigraphy.
   ConclusionsSnoring is a highly prevalent condition experienced by healthy third-trimester pregnant women and is associated with elevated blood pressure.
   Clinical RelevanceClinical assessment and screening of snoring are of utmost importance in obstetric nursing practice to potentially prevent or reduce the associated adverse cardiovascular consequences in women during pregnancy.

   RISK; DISEASES; POVERTY; UGANDA; HEALTH
AB Background Despite evidence that education and poverty act through distinct pathways to influence sexually transmitted infection (STI), few studies have examined the unique, independent associations of these socioeconomic vulnerabilities with sexual risk behaviors and STI among women.
   Methods From August to October 2013, women at an antenatal clinic in Gressier, Haiti, were interviewed and tested for chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis (N = 200). We measured low educational attainment as less than 9 years of schooling and currently living in poverty based on crowding, defined as more than 2 people sleeping in one room. We used logistic regression to estimate independent associations between each socioeconomic indicator and outcomes of sexual behaviors and STI.
   Results Approximately 29% of the sample had a current STI (chlamydia, 8.0%; gonorrhea, 3.0%; trichomoniasis, 20.5%), with 2.5% testing positive for more than 1 STI. Forty percent of the sample reported low educational attainment and 40% reported current poverty. Low educational attainment was associated with early risk behaviors, including twice the odds of earlier sexual debut (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.09; 95% confidence interval [CI],: 1.14-3.84). Poverty was associated with reporting the current main sexual partner to be nonmonogamous (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.00-4.01) and current STI (AOR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.26-4.98).
   Conclusions Education and poverty seem to independently influence STI behaviors and infection, with low education associated with early sexual risk and poverty associated with current risk and infection. Improving women's educational attainment may be important in improving risk awareness, thereby reducing risky sexual behaviors and preventing a trajectory of STI risk.

AB Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in pregnancy can present as snoring and/or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and the prevalence is increasing owing to the increase in maternal obesity. Pregnant women often present with fatigue and daytime sleepiness rather than the classic symptoms. Habitual snoring, older age, chronic hypertension, and high prepregnancy body mass index are reliable indicators of an increased risk for SDB and should trigger further testing. The gold standard for diagnosis of OSA is an overnight laboratory polysomnography. Although there are no studies linking SDB to poor fetal outcomes, fetal well-being remains paramount throughout the course of pregnancy.

AB Women often experience sleep disturbances and worsening sleep quality throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Circadian rhythms are closely linked to sleep problems and mood disorders. This systematic review provides a summary of studies of circadian rhythms and associated sleep problems and maternal distress, among postpartum women. Articles were identified through a systematic literature search. Circadian rhythm disturbances were strongly correlated with depression, social factors, and mothers' exposure to light postpartum. Future research should include larger, prospective studies as well as randomized controlled trials for measuring the effect of circadian rhythm interventions on postpartum mental health outcomes.

   OVERWEIGHT
AB Background: Being overweight constitutes a health risk, and the proportion of overweight and obese children is increasing. It has been argued that road traffic noise could be linked to adiposity through its influence on sleep and stress. Few studies, to our knowledge, have investigated whether noise and adiposity are associated. Most of them were on adults, and we are not aware of any longitudinal study using repeated measures.
   Objectives: The present longitudinal study investigated whether road traffic noise exposures in pregnancy (N = 6,963; obs = 22,975) or childhood (N = 6,403; obs = 14,585) were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories in children.
   Methods: We obtained information on BMI and covariates from questionnaires used in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, Statistics Norway, and Medical Birth Registry of Norway. We modeled road traffic noise for the most exposed facade of children's present and historical addresses at 6 time points from pregnancy to age 8. We investigated effects on BMI trajectories using repeated measures and linear mixed models.
   Results: The results indicated that BMI curves depended on road traffic noise exposure during pregnancy, but not on exposure during childhood. Children in the highest decile of traffic noise exposure had increased BMI, with 0.35kg/m(2) more than children in the lowest decile, from birth to age 8 years.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that exposure to road traffic noise during pregnancy may be associated with children's BMI trajectories. Future studies should investigate this further, using anthropometric measures such as waist-hip ratio and skinfold thickness, in addition to BMI.

AB Background: Childhood obesity has become a global epidemic irrespective of the socioeconomic status of a country or nation. Obesity increases the risk of various diseases in children, for example asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type-2 diabetes, and heart problems. The existing literature informs us of the many factors associated with childhood obesity. Among these factors, maternal mental health has been found to be a strong predictor. Maternal mental health programs were implemented to address the issue of childhood obesity but with little or no improvement. It suggests systematically reviewing the literature to assess the contents of these programs and carrying out meta-analysis for the overall effect of these interventions.
   Methods: The studies included in this review will be experimental designs such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which provide information on interventions to improve maternal mental health and its effects on childhood obesity. We plan to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, Scopus, and Web of Science with no restrictions as to language. Reference lists of the selected articles will also be searched for additional articles. The Cochrane EPOC Risk of Bias Tool will be used to assess the quality of studies. If the studies lend themselves to a statistical analysis, we will also carry out a meta-analysis.
   Discussion: This review will help determine the effect of maternal health improvement programs on childhood obesity. These findings, in turn, will guide the research community on the development of related programs in the future.

AB Background: There is little information on the causes of low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g) in South Kivu. The authors determined the prevalence of LBW among full-term newborns, and its relationship with malaria and anaemia at the first antenatal visit (ANV1) in the rural health zone of Miti-Murhesa, in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
   Methods: Four-hundred-and-seventy-eight pregnant women in the second trimester attending their first antenatal clinic were recruited between November 2010 and July 2011, and followed-up until delivery. Besides information on use of preventive measures and malaria morbidity, anthropometric measures and a blood sample were collected.
   Results: Women's mean age (SD) at enrolment, was 26 (6.5) years (n=434); prevalence of malaria was 9.5% (43/453) and that of anaemia 32.2% (141/439). The latter was significantly more frequent in malaria-infected women and in those who had not been dewormed. At delivery, prevalence of LBW was 6.5% (23/355) and was independently associated with not sleeping under insecticide-treated bed net (p=0.030), mother's height <150 cm (p=0.001) and anaemia at the ANV1 (p=0.006).
   Conclusion: In South Kivu, malaria and anaemia are important risk factors for LBW, and should be prevented among all women of reproductive age.

AB Objective To evaluate whether the percentage of time spent supine during sleep in the third trimester of pregnancy could be reduced using a positional therapy device (PrenaBelt) compared with a sham device.
   Design A double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over pilot trial.
   Setting Conducted between March 2016 and January 2017, at a single, tertiary-level centre in Canada.
   Participants 23 participants entered the study. 20 participants completed the study. Participants were low-risk, singleton, third-trimester pregnant women aged 18 years and older with body mass index <35 kg/m(2) at the first antenatal appointment for the index pregnancy and without known fetal abnormalities, pregnancy complications or medical conditions complicating sleep.
   Interventions A two-night, polysomnography study in a sleep laboratory. Participants were randomised by computer-generated, one-to-one, simple randomisation to receive either a PrenaBelt or a sham-PrenaBelt on the first night and were crossed over to the alternate device on the second night. Allocation concealment was by unmarked, security-tinted, sealed envelopes. Participants, the recruiter and personnel involved in setting up, conducting, scoring and interpreting the polysomnogram were blinded to allocation.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent supine during sleep. Secondary outcomes included maternal sleep architecture, respiration, self-reported sleep position and feedback.
   Results The median percentage of sleep time supine was reduced from 16.4% on the sham night to 3.5% on the PrenaBelt night (pseudomedian=5.8, p=0.03). We were unable to demonstrate differences in sleep architecture or respiration. Participants underestimated the time they spent sleeping supine by 7.0%, and six (30%) participants indicated they would make changes to the PrenaBelt. There were no harms in this study.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates that the percentage of sleep time supine during late pregnancy can be significantly reduced via positional therapy.

LA English
DT Article
DE Sleep; Overweight; Obesity; Body mass index; Women; Canada
ID CENTRAL OBESITY; DURATION; QUALITY; METAANALYSIS; ADULTS
AB Objectives Tests of the relationship between sleep and overweight/obesity (OW/OB) among women have been inconsistent. Few studies reporting such associations have focused on women of childbearing age. This paper investigates this association among Canadian women of childbearing age.
   Methods Data were from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2011-2014. The sample consisted of women aged 18-44 years. All variables were self-reported. Sleep duration was dichotomized as insufficient (<7 h/night) or adequate (<= 7 h/night). A composite score of sleep quality was used and dichotomized as poor none/little of the time or some/most/all ofthe time. Height and weight were used to calculate body mass index. Associations between sleep and OW/OB were assessed using logistic regression analyses with survey weights. Three models were computed for sleep duration/quality: model without covariates, model adjusted for demographics (age, ethnicity, level of education, household income, marital status, employment, parity, region, and season), and model adjusted for demographics and variables associated with OW/OB (mood disorder, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol).
   Results Total sample consisted of 9749 women of childbearing age. Thirty-eight percent had insufficient sleep duration. Sleep duration was significantly associated with OW/OB in the model with no covariates and discriminated 52.8% of women of childbearing age, but this association was no longer significant in the models adjusted for covariates. Sleep quality was not significantly linked to OW/OB in any of the models.
   Conclusion Targeting sleep alone would likely not contribute to lower risk of OW/OB among Canadian women of childbearing age. Additional studies, especially longitudinal ones, are needed to confirm these findings.

AB High-altitude natives employ numerous physiological strategies to survive and reproduce. However, the concomitant influence of altitude and physical activity during pregnancy has not been studied above 3,700 m. We report a case of physical activity, sleep behavior, and physiological measurements on a 28-yr-old third-trimester pregnant native highlander (Sherpa) during ascent from 3,440 m to Everest Base Camp (similar to 5,300 m) over 8 days in the Nepal Himalaya and again similar to 10 mo postpartum during a similar ascent profile. The participant engaged in 250-300 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day during ascent to altitude while pregnant, with similar volumes of moderate to vigorous physical activity while postpartum. There were no apparent maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications related to the superimposition of the large volumes of physical activity at altitude. This report demonstrates a rare description of physical activity and ascent to high altitude during pregnancy and points to novel questions regarding the superimposition of pregnancy, altitude, and physical activity in high-altitude natives.

AB Background: Our Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study suggested that a brief sleep intervention in infancy reduced the risk of obesity at age 2 y. In contrast, we observed no benefit from the nutrition and activity intervention.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to determine how these interventions influenced growth at ages 3.5 and 5 y compared with usual care (Control).
   Design: A follow-up of a parallel, 4-arm, single-blind, 2-y, randomized controlled trial in 802 women (86% European, 48% primiparous) recruited in pregnancy (58% response rate) was undertaken. All groups received standard Well-Child care with additional support for 3 intervention groups: FAB (promotion of breastfeeding, healthy eating, physical activity: 8 contacts, antenatal, 18 mo); Sleep (prevention of sleep problems: antenatal, 3 wk); Combination (both interventions). Follow-up measures were collected by staff blinded to group allocation. The primary outcome was child body mass index (BMI) z score, and secondary outcomes were prevalence of obesity (BMI >= 95th percentile), self-regulation (psychological measures), sleep, physical activity (accelerometry, questionnaires), and dietary intake (food-frequency questionnaire). Analyses were conducted through the use of multiple imputation.
   Results: Retention was 77% at age 3.5 y and 69% at age 5 y. Children in the FAB group had significantly higher BMI z scores than did Controls at age 5 y (adjusted difference: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.47) but not at age 3.5 y (0.15; 95% CI: -0.04, 0.34). Children who received the Sleep intervention (Sleep and Combination groups) had significantly lower BMI z scores at age 3.5 y (-0.24; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.10) and at age 5 y (-0.23; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.07) than children who did not (Control and FAB groups).
   Conclusions: A conventional intervention had unexpected adverse long-term weight outcomes, whereas positive outcomes from a less conventional sleep intervention remained promising at age 5 y. More intensive or extended sleep intervention might have larger or longer-lasting effects and should be investigated.

   death syndrome
ID SLEEPING POSITION; RISK-FACTORS; SIDS; SAFETY; TERM
AB BackgroundPreterm infants are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with term born infants and the risk is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birthweight. Parents of these infants should have adequate knowledge and practise the recommended SIDS risk reduction measures.
   MethodsA survey was conducted between December 2016 and August 2017 at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. Parents of preterm infants 36 weeks' gestation were invited to answer a self-administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge and practise regarding SIDS risk reduction.
   ResultsForty-nine (61.33%) of the 80 parents had heard of SIDS prior to the interview, with social media being the commonest source of information (67.3%). Only 35 (43.7%) correctly answered at least five of nine questions on knowledge of SIDS risk reduction (good knowledge). When compared with the group of parents who answered less than five questions correctly (poor knowledge), there was no significant difference in the demographic and infant characteristics between the groups. The majority (68.8%) of parents practised bed sharing with their infants, and this was significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.01). Household smoking was also significantly more common in the group of parents with poor knowledge (P = 0.048).
   ConclusionKnowledge on SIDS risk reduction measures was generally poor among parents of preterm infants in this study. Cigarette smoking, bed sharing and non-supine sleep positions, which are associated with increased risk of SIDS, were common practise among the present subjects.

AB Introduction It is known that perinatal mortality is increased with births at night and at the weekend. The aim of the study was to investigate whether there is also an association between the time of delivery (weekday, night, weekend) and perinatal morbidity.
   Material and Methods All births at Hannover Medical College between 2000 and 2014 were included in a retrospective data analysis. Multiple births, primary sections, severe foetal malformations and intrauterine deaths were not included. A 5-minute Apgar score <= 5 and cord arterial pH < 7.10 were defined as perinatal morbidity. Besides the time of delivery, different variables that are regarded as risk factors for increased perinatal morbidity were studied. Univariate logistical regression analysis was performed, followed bymultivariate analysis.
   Results 18394 deliveries were included in the study. Pathological prepartum Doppler, medical induction of labour and delivery at night and/or at the weekend significantly increased the probability of an Apgar score <= 5 after 5 minutes. The probability that a child will have cord arterial pH < 7.1 post partum is significantly increased with a BMI > 25 before pregnancy, primiparity, medical induction of labour, peripartum administration of oxytocic agents, when the delivery took place at night and weekend combined, but also when the delivery took place at night or at the weekend/on a public holiday. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a time of delivery at night and/or at the weekend or on a public holiday is not a prognostic factor for a 5-minute Apgar score <= 5 (p = 0.2377) but is a prognostic factor for cord arterial pH < 7.1 (p = 0.0252).
   Conclusion The time of delivery at night or at the weekend/on a public holiday increases the risk for cord arterial pH < 7.1 by similar to 30% compared with delivery on a weekday. However, the time of delivery at night or at the weekend/on a public holiday does not increase the risk for the baby of having a 5-minute Apgar score <= 5.

AB Objective
   Multicomponent lifestyle modification interventions designed for gestational and early postnatal periods may be key to preventing obesity in children. The primary objective of the study was to determine if infant growth outcomes differed between treatment arms of an 18-month, maternal, infant and early childhood home visiting project.
   Methods
   Pregnant women at least 18 years of age, less than 19 weeks pregnant and residing in a lower Mississippi Delta county were recruited between March 2013 and December 2014. Postnatal data were collected from 24 experimental and 30 control participants between September 2013 and May 2016. Infant growth outcomes were modelled as time-to-event data using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank tests to determine if survival curves differed between treatment arms.
   Results
   Retention rates for the experimental and control arms were 88% (21/24) and 83% (25/ 30), respectively. Approximately three-fourths of infants in both treatment arms were classified as overweight and experienced rapid weight gain during the first 12 months of life. No differences between median times neither to classification as overweight (3-4 months) nor to experiencing rapid weight gain (6-7 months) were observed between treatment arms.
   Conclusions
   As compared with a standard educational (control) curriculum, an educational curriculum enhanced with diet and physical activity components was not effective at improving infant growth outcomes.

AB Study Objectives: Cortical activity patterns develop rapidly over the equivalent of the last trimester of gestation, in parallel with the establishment of sleep architecture. However, the emergence of mature cortical activity in wakefulness compared with sleep states in healthy preterm infants is poorly understood.
   Methods: To investigate whether the cortical activity has a different developmental profile in each sleep-wake state, we recorded 11-channels electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and respiratory movement for 1 hr from 115 infants 34 to 43 weeks-corrected age, with 0.5-17 days of postnatal age. We characterized the trajectory of delta, theta, and alpha-beta oscillations in wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM sleep by calculating the power spectrum of the EEG, averaged across artifact-free epochs.
   Results: delta-Oscillations in wakefulness and REM sleep decrease with corrected age, particularly in the temporal region, but not in non-REM sleep theta-Oscillations increase with corrected age in sleep, especially non-REM sleep, but not in wakefulness. On the other hand, alpha-beta oscillations decrease predominantly with postnatal age, independently of sleep-wake state, particularly in the occipital region.
   Conclusions: The developmental trajectory of delta and theta rhythms is state-dependent and results in changed cortical activity patterns between states with corrected age, which suggests that these frequency bands may have particular functional roles in each state. Interestingly, postnatal age is associated with a decrease in alpha-beta oscillations overlying primary visual cortex in every sleep-wake state, suggesting that postnatal experience (including the first visual input through open eyes during periods of wakefulness) is associated with resting-state visual cortical activity changes.

AB Objective To investigate whether maternal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with changes in fetal growth trajectory.
   Study design Retrospective review of pregnant women who underwent overnight polysomnography. Fetal growth was estimated using sonographic biometric measurements obtained during routine prenatal care. Customized estimated fetal weight and birth weight centiles were calculated and impaired fetal growth was defined as birth weight <10th centile or a slowing of fetal growth by >33% during the last trimester. Logistic regression models were used to determine the relationship between maternal OSA and altered fetal growth after adjusting for potential covariates.
   Results There were 48 women without and 31 women with OSA. There were no differences in the proportion of infants with birth weight <10th centile between women with and without OSA (23 vs. 25%, p = 1.0), However, the presence of maternal OSA was predictive of impaired fetal growth (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.6). Logistic regression models were repeated using only a slowing of fetal growth in the 3rd trimester (excluding birth weight <10th centile) and OSA predicted a slowing in fetal growth across the 3rd trimester (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.4-9.4). Fourteen additional women were treated with positive airway pressure during pregnancy; fetal growth was not significantly different in these women compared to controls.
   Conclusion Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with altered fetal growth, which appears to be ameliorated with use of positive airway pressure.

AB ObjectivesThe present study aimed at investigating the timing of birth across the day in a rural population of indigenous and nonindigenous women in the province of Formosa, Argentina in order to explore the variation in patterns in a non-Western setting.
   Materials and methodsThis study utilized birth record data transcribed from delivery room records at a rural hospital in the province of Formosa, northern Argentina. The sample included data for Criollo, Wichi, and Toba/Qom women (n=2421). Statistical analysis was conducted using directional statistics to identify a mean sample direction. Chi-square tests for homogeneity were also used to test for statistical significant differences between hours of the day.
   ResultsThe mean sample direction was 81.04 degrees, which equates to 5:24 AM when calculated as time on a 24-hr clock. Chi-squared analyses showed a statistically significant peak in births between 12:00 and 4:00 AM. Birth counts generally declined throughout the day until a statistically significant trough around 5:00 PM.
   DiscussionThis pattern may be associated with the circadian rhythms of hormone release, particularly melatonin, on a proximate level. At the ultimate level, giving birth in the early hours of the morning may have been selected to time births when the mother could benefit from the predator protection and support provided by her social group as well as increased mother-infant bonding from a more peaceful environment.

AB Background: The demand for fetal monitoring and constant reassurance is high in pregnant women. Consequently, pregnant women use various health apps and are more likely to visit emergency departments due to subjective but nonurgent complaints. However, electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) solutions are rarely used to prevent nonurgent emergency consultations. To implement modern care solutions, a better understanding of the attitudes, fears, and hopes of health care professionals toward eHealth and mHealth is needed.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of health care professionals in obstetrics toward telemedicine.
   Methods: A quantitative Web-based survey on health care professionals in obstetrics in Germany was conducted. The participants included nurses, midwives, and physicians of all age groups and job positions working in hospitals that provide various levels of health care. The questionnaire comprised 24 questions about the characteristics of the study population, views about emergency consultations in obstetrics, attitude toward telemedicine, job satisfaction, and sleeping behavior.
   Results: In total, 244 health care professionals participated in the Web-based survey. In general, health care professionals were skeptical (170/233, 72.9%) about the use of telemedicine in obstetrics; however, 55.8% (130/233) recognized its potential. Moreover, 72% (62/86) of physicians were optimistic in using apps for pregnancy monitoring, whereas 36.1% (47/130) of nonphysicians (P<.001) were not. Significantly, more nonphysicians rejected such developments (75/130, 57.7% rejected) compared with physicians (24/86, 28%; P<.001). We also found that obstetricians with more than 10 years of work-experience are more skeptical; however, approximately 49% (18/37) of them believed that telemedicine could reduce nonurgent emergency consultations, whereas 73.2% (106/145) of obstetricians with less than 5 years of experience (P=.01) thought otherwise. Our survey revealed a high job satisfaction and a prevalence of regular sleeping problems of 45.9% (91/198) among health care professionals in obstetrics. Surprisingly, both job satisfaction and sleeping problems were independent from the number of night shifts per month (P=.77 and P=. 99, respectively). Yet, 56.6% (112/198) of the survey participants thought they would be happier with their job if they had to work fewer night shifts per month.
   Conclusions: Our study reveals an ambivalent attitude toward the use of telemedicine among health care professionals in obstetrics in Germany at the moment. Efforts to promote the use of telemedicine should focus on nurses and midwives because these groups are the most skeptical. By contrast, particularly young physicians recognize the potential of apps in patient care and would like to use such technology in pregnancy monitoring.

AB Maternal psychological stress, depression, and anxiety during pregnancy (prenatal stress; PNS) are thought to impact fetal development with long-term effects on offspring outcome. These effects would include physical and mental health, including psychopathology. Maternal sleep, diet, and exercise during pregnancy are lifestyle behaviors that are understudied and often solely included in PNS studies as confounders. However, there are indications that these lifestyle behaviors may actually constitute essential mediators between PNS and fetal programming processes. The goal of this theoretical review was to investigate this idea by looking at the evidence for associations between PNS and sleep, diet, and exercise, and by piecing together the information on potential underlying mechanisms and causal pathways through which these factors may affect the offspring. The analysis of the literature led to the conclusion that sleep, diet, and exercise during pregnancy, may have fundamental roles as mediators between PNS and maternal pregnancy physiology. By integrating these lifestyle behaviors into models of prenatal programming of development, a qualitatively higher and more comprehensive understanding of the prenatal origins of psychopathology can be obtained. The review finalizes by discussing some of the present challenges facing the field of PNS and offspring programming, and offering solutions for future research.

AB Maternal perinatal depression exerts pervasive effects on the developing brain, as evidenced by electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns that differ between children of women who do and do not meet DSM or ICD diagnostic criteria. However, little research has examined if the same EEG pattern of right-frontal alpha asymmetry exists in newborns and thus originates in utero independent of postnatal influences, and if depressive symptoms are associated with this neural signature. Utilizing 125-lead EEG (n = 18), this study considered clinician-rated maternal prenatal depressive symptoms in relation to newborn EEG. Maternal depressive symptomatology was associated with greater relative right-frontal alpha asymmetry during quiet sleep. These results suggest that even subclinical levels of maternal depression may influence infant brain development, and further support the role of the prenatal environment in shaping children's future neurobehavioral trajectories.

AB Objective: To assess the effects of relaxation exercises on subjective sleep quality of in third-trimester pregnant women.
   Materials and methods: The pretest posttest randomized controlled trial recruited 84 pregnant women in the third trimester. Following random assignment of subjects, the treatment group (n = 46) performed relaxation exercises for four weeks and the control group (n = 46) received standart cares. At baseline and after the intervention sleep quality was assessed. Data obtained were analyzed in SPSS.
   Results: The mean score of the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was 7.12 +/- 3.66. It was determined that relaxation exercises improved some sleep quality subscales including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration and habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, daytime dysfunction and global sleep quality. The difference between the two groups was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: A four -week compact disc guide relaxation exercises program can be effective in improving sleep quality.

AB OBJECTIVE DATA: Sleep-disordered breathing is an increasingly common condition in nonobstetric populations and is associated with significant morbidity. The incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy is unknown, and it is likely that many cases go undiagnosed.
   STUDY: A systematic review and metaanalysis was undertaken to determine whether pregnant women who receive a diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing are more likely to have adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes compared with control subjects.
   STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cinahl data-bases were searched for full-text publications in English of sleep-disordered breathing and human pregnancy up to June 2017. Only studies that reported on sleep-disordered breathing in relation to gestational age or birthweight at delivery, preterm birth, mode of delivery, cord pH, Apgar score, nursery admission, stillbirth or perinatal death, meconium at delivery, or wound complications were included.
   RESULTS: A total of 1576 results were identified; 33 studies met inclusion criteria. Women with sleep-disordered breathing were older (mean difference, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.28) and had a higher body mass index (mean difference, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.30-4.32) than those who did not. Maternal sleep-disordered breathing was associated significantly with preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation; odds ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-2.31) and low birthweight (< 2500 g; odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.78). These women were also less likely to have a vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) and to be at a higher risk of having an assisted vaginal delivery (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.21) or a cesarean delivery (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.11). The risk of both elective (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 - 1.76) and emergency cesarean (odds ratio, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-5.29) was increased. In addition, women with sleep-disordered breathing were at a higher risk of having an infant with a 5-minute Apgar score < 7 (odds ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-3.71), stillbirth or perinatal death (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-3.28), and neonatal nursery admission (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-2.61).
   CONCLUSION: Maternal sleep-disordered breathing is associated with increased risks of adverse intrapartum and perinatal outcomes.

AB There is mounting evidence for an association between sleep disorders and hypertension. In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), there are plausible biological reasons for the development of hypertension, and treatment of OSA results in modest (2-3 mm Hg), adherence-dependent decreases in blood pressure, with larger effects evident in those with resistant hypertension. However, prospective, population-based cohort studies have not yet convincingly demonstrated a link between OSA and incident hypertension, and adequately powered controlled trials of CPAP for the prevention or treatment or hypertension are lacking. While associations have been identified between short sleep duration, insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), shift work, and hypertension, the causative role of these conditions/circumstances is not proven, and further well-designed pathophysiological and/or interventional studies are needed. Particular emphasis should be placed on defining subgroups of hypertensive OSA patients that stand to benefit most from OSA treatment and in understanding the link between sleep apnea and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Well-controlled intervention studies are needed in populations with short sleep duration, insomnia, shift work sleep disorder, and RLS to confirm their putative links with hypertension.

AB Objective: Although afternoon napping is very common, particularly in China, there are limited data regarding the potential health effects of afternoon napping during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. We aimed to investigate the relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and low birth weight (LBW).
   Methods: A total of 10,111 women aged 15-50 years were recruited from the ongoing Healthy Baby Cohort study in China, in 2012-2014. Information on sleep habits during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaires at the time of institutional delivery. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Compared with women who reported no napping, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for LBW were 0.83 (95% CI 0.58-1.18) and 0.61 (0.44-0.83) for those who reported <= 1 h and >1 h of napping, respectively (P for trend <0.001). LBW risk reached a threshold at approximately 1.5 h of afternoon napping. The inverse relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW was stronger among women with lower educational level (P for interaction = 0.011). For frequency of afternoon napping, the multivariate analysis suggested a significant inverse association between LBW and napping 5-7 days/week (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92).
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association between afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW risk. Our findings suggest that appropriate afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping for pregnant women might reduce the risk of LBW. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   learning; Classification
ID OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; TRANSDUCER SYSTEM; PRESSURE; RESISTANCE;
   CHILDREN; MEN; WOMEN; AREA
AB Background: Inspiratory flow limitation is a breathing pattern during sleep caused by upper airway (UA) narrowing that occurs during snoring and various degrees of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Clinical examination of flow limitation relies on identifying patterns of airflow contour, however this process is subjective and lacks physiological evidence of UA narrowing. Our objective is to derive the temporal features of nasal airflow contour that characterize flow limitation. The features that correlate with UA narrowing can be used to develop machine learning classifiers to detect flow limitation with physiological support.
   Methods: Sixteen healthy adult men underwent full daytime polysomnography where the nasal airflow was recorded. Before and after sleep, we measured UA anatomical parameters including neck circumference (NC) and upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA). We extracted various temporal features of airflow and investigated their relationships with the UA anatomical parameters.
   Results: We found that three features were correlated with the anatomical parameters associated with UA narrowing: deviation index vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.67, p = 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.69, p < 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. ANC (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and peak number vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.54, p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Temporal features of airflow were associated with UA narrowing. Future studies could utilize the features to develop classifiers to detect flow limitation and assess the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children.

AB Short sleep duration has been linked to maternal hyperglycemia. Systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and hyperglycemia in pregnancy or gestational diabetes (GDM). MEDLINE and Scopus were searched until July 2017. Studies that assessed sleep duration and had objective measurements of hyperglycemia during pregnancy were eligible. Aggregate data were available from eight studies, n = 17,308 (seven with self-reported and one with objectively measured sleep duration). Meta-analysis was applied for pooling aggregate data using a random-effects model. Identified authors provided individual patient data (IPD) from four studies with objectively measured sleep duration, n = 287. A one-stage approach with a hierarchical mixed-effect logit model was applied to pool IPD across studies. Aggregate data analysis revealed that women with short sleep duration (<6-7 h) were more likely to have GDM than women without short sleep duration, odds ratio 1.70 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.33). IPD analysis demonstrated that, compared to sleeping >6.25 h, women who slept <= 6.25 h had higher 1-h glucose levels after 50-g oral glucose tolerance testing by 0.65 mmol/L (0.18, 1.13) and an increased risk of GDM, adjusted odds ratio 2.84 (1.25, 6.44). In conclusion, short sleep duration in pregnancy, both self-reported and objectively measured, is associated with hyperglycemia and an increased GDM risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pregnant women are more likely to be affected by restless legs syndrome (RLS) than the general population. Restless legs syndrome during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Currently unknown is the worldwide and regional prevalence of RLS in pregnant women. We performed a meta-analysis to provide a full profile of the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy. A systematic search of the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was performed to identify studies that were published up to April 2017, followed by random-effects meta-analyses. A total of 196 articles were identified, among which 27 longitudinal and cross-sectional observational studies with 51,717 pregnant subjects were included in the analysis. The pooled overall prevalence of RLS across all three trimesters was 21%. According to the regional classification of the World health organization, the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy in the European Region, Western Pacific Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Region of the Americas was 22%, 14%, 30%, and 20%, respectively. The regional prevalence in the African Region and South-East Asia Region was not assessed because of insufficient data. We also analyzed the prevalence of RLS in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, and the rates of RLS were 8%, 16%, and 22%, respectively. We also found that the high prevalence of RLS decreased to 4% after delivery. No publication bias was found in these analyses. The findings emphasize the high occurrence of RLS during pregnancy. Future studies should examine the effects of RLS during pregnancy on maternal and fetal outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is common among cancer patients. Early identification of patients at risk for CINV may help to personalize anti-emetic therapies. To date, few studies have examined the combined contributions of patient-reported and genetic risk factors to CINV. The goal of this study was to evaluate these risk factors.
   Methods Prior to their first chemotherapy infusion, participants completed demographic and risk factor questionnaires and provided a blood sample to measure genetic variants in ABCB1 (rs1045642) and HTR3B (rs45460698) as well as CYP2D6 activity score. The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory was completed at 24 h and 5-day post-infusion to assess the severity of acute and delayed CINV, respectively.
   Results Participants were 88 patients (55% female, M = 60 years). A total of 23% experienced acute nausea and 55% delayed nausea. Younger age, history of pregnancy-related nausea, fewer hours slept the night prior to infusion, and variation in ABCB1 were associated with more severe acute nausea; advanced-stage cancer and receipt of highly emetogenic chemotherapy were associated with more severe delayed nausea (p values < 0.05). In multivariable analyses, ABCB1 added an additional 5% predictive value beyond the 13% variance explained by patient-reported risk factors.
   Conclusions The current study identified patient-reported and genetic factors that may place patients at risk for acute nausea despite receipt of guideline-consistent anti-emetic prophylaxis. Additional studies examining other genetic variants are needed, as well as the development of risk prediction models including both patient-reported and genetic risk factors.

TI Household ownership and utilization of insecticide-treated nets under
   the Regional Artemisinin Resistance Initiative in Myanmar
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Malaria is a major public health problem in Myanmar with reported artemisinin resistance. Myanmar promotes the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) through the free delivery of long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) with target coverage of at least 80% in moderate and high-risk areas by 2014. Migrant people are at greater risk of malaria. They have significant barriers to health care services for febrile illness and malaria. Thus, a community-based survey was conducted among the migrant population to assess the ownership and utilization of bed nets (ITN/LLINs) for malaria.
   Methods: The study analyzed secondary data from a community-based malaria survey conducted in 2014 among migrant population in 30 randomly selected townships out of 52 Regional Artemisinin Resistance Initiative (RAI) townships. In each township, five migrant sites were randomly selected (total of 150 migrant sites). A total of 3933 households (approximately 125 households from each township) were selected.
   Results: Of 3923 households assessed, 97% had access to at least one bed net (any type), but only half had access to ITN/LLINs. Only 24% of households had adequate ITN/LLIN access (at least one ITN/LLIN per two persons). In terms of household utilization, 94.3% slept under a bed net (any type) the previous night Only 43.4% slept under an ITN/LLIN. ITN/LLIN utilization in children under 5 years and pregnant women (high-malaria risk groups) was 45.3 and 46.6%, respectively. Of all nets, 31.3% had holes or had already undergone repairs. In terms of insecticide treatment status, 52.9% of bed nets were untreated and 35.9% of ITNs had not been treated with insecticide for more than a year.
   Conclusion: This study highlights poor access and high utilization of ITN/LLINs among migrant population, particularly among children and pregnant women. It highlights the need for improving bed net coverage and access to ITN/LLINs through bed net distributions and/or social marketing with the focus on migrant population and targeting of households with children and pregnant women.

AB Background: Becoming the parent of a new baby comes with a range of challenges including difficulties with emotional adjustment, couple relationship issues and difficulty managing common infant behaviors, such as crying and sleep problems. This time can be especially challenging for couples who experience a range of risk factors. Previous parenting interventions for parents of babies have shown mixed results. This protocol paper describes a randomized controlled trial of a group-based parenting intervention for high-risk parents expecting their first baby.
   Methods/design: Participants will be randomized to either Group Baby Triple P or Care as Usual (CAU). Group Baby Triple P involves 4 x 2 h group sessions delivered during pregnancy and 4 individual telephone sessions of 30 min each in the early postnatal period. Outcomes will be assessed via parent self-report questionnaire, home observations and a baby diary 10 weeks and 6 months post-birth. Primary outcomes will be parental confidence and perceived competence. Secondary outcomes will include parental responsiveness and bonding with the baby, relationship happiness, life satisfaction, depression, anxiety and stress, and infant crying and sleep. Analyses will involve a series of rANOVA and rMANOVAs, t-tests and a multilevel modeling approach.
   Discussion: A brief summary, strengths and potential implications are discussed.

AB Background: The socioecological model proposes a wide array of factors that influence behaviours. There is a need to understand salient correlates of these activity behaviours in a specific population. However, few studies identified socio-demographic, behavioural, physical, and psychological correlates of objectively-assessed physical activity and sedentary time in young adults.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants in the Raine Study (a pregnancy cohort started in 1989). Australian young adults (mean 22.1 years +/- SD 0.6) wore Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers on the hip 24 h/day for seven days to assess moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time (n = 256 women, n = 219 men). Potential correlates were assessed via clinical assessment and questionnaire and included socio-demographic variables (ethnicity, relationship status, work/study status, education, mothers education), health behaviours (food intake, alcohol consumption, smoking status, sleep quality), and physical and psychological health aspects (anthropometrics, diagnosed disorders, mental health, cognitive performance). Backwards elimination (p < 0.2 for retention) with mixed model regressions were used and the gender-stratified analyses were adjusted for demographic variables, waking wear time and number of valid days.
   Results: Increased time spent in MVPA was associated with: being single (IRR 1.44 vs in a relationship living together, 95%CI: 1.17, 1.77, p = .001) in women; and better sleep quality in men (lower scores better IRR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.00). Less time spent sedentary was associated with: lower mother's education (-32.1 min/day, 95% CI -52.9, 11.3, p = 0.002 for having mother with no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and smoking (-44. 3 min/day, 95% CI: -72.8, -15.9, p = .0002) for women; lower education status (-32.1 min/day, 95% CI: -59.5, -4.8, p = 0.021 for having no university degree vs at least a baccalaureate degree) and lower depression scores in men (2.0, 95% CI: -3.5, -0.4, p = 0.014); more alcoholic drinks per week for women (-1.9 min/day, 95% CI: -3.1, -0.6, p = 0. 003) and men (-1.0, 95% CI: -1.8, -0.3, p = 0.007).
   Conclusions: Less desirable correlates were associated with positive levels of activity in young Australian adult women and men. Interventions to increase MVPA and decrease sedentary activity in young adults need to specifically consider the life stage of young adults.

AB When they do not meet norms related to sexuality and reproduction, Bangladeshi women often face abandonment and are thus deprived of an active sexual life, a marital relationship, and motherhood. Little is known about how a stigmatised disease such as tuberculosis (TB) may constrain the reproductive health and sexual lives of women. This article, derived from a larger study on the impact of TB on women's sexual and reproductive health and rights in Narsingdi district and Dhaka, Bangladesh, aims to fill this gap. Based on interviews with nine married women who have or had TB, four husbands, and two mothers-in-law, this article highlights that the ways in which TB impedes on the sexual and reproductive lives of women depends on the stigma within their family and community, their relationships with their husbands, motherhood, their living arrangements, their economic contribution to the family and/or their disclosure of their TB diagnosis. Women with children and supportive husbands retain a stronger position among their in-laws and are less likely to be isolated or rejected. The patients' narratives revealed that the instructions of health workers influenced their decisions about intercourse or abstinence. Future studies should examine the instructions patients receive from health workers regarding their living and sleeping arrangements, sexual intercourse, and pregnancy, as well as policy documents on TB treatment and prevention.

AB Background
   Fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) of normal-to-normal (NN) beat intervals provides high-temporal resolution access to assess the functioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).
   Aim
   To determine critical periods of fetal autonomic maturation. The developmental pace is hypothesized to change with gestational age (GA).
   Study design
   Prospective longitudinal observational study.
   Subjects
   60 healthy singleton fetuses were followed up by fetal magnetocardiographic heart rate monitoring 4-11 times (median 6) during the second half of gestation.
   Outcome measure
   FHRV parameters, accounting for differential aspects of the ANS, were studied applying linear mixed models over four predefined pregnancy segments of interest (Sol: < 27; 27+0-31 +0; 31 +1-35+0; > 35+1 weeks GA). Periods of fetal active sleep and quiescence were accounted for separately.
   Results
   Skewness of the NN interval distribution VLF/LF band power ratio and complexity describe a saturation function throughout the period of interest. A decreasing LF/HF ratio and an increase in pNN5 indicate a concurrent shift in sympathovagal balance. Fluctuation amplitude and parameters of short-term variability (RMSSD, HF band) mark a second acceleration towards term. In contrast, fetal quiescence is characterized by sequential, but low-margin transformations; ascending overall variability followed by an increase of complexity and superseded by fluctuation amplitude.
   Conclusions
   An increase in sympathetic activation, connected with by a higher ability of parasympathetic modulation and baseline stabilization, is reached during the transition from the late 2nd into the early 3rd trimester. Pattern characteristics indicating fetal well-being saturate at 35 weeks GA. Pronounced fetal breathing efforts near-term mirror in fHRV as respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

AB The study aimed to investigate the associations between maternal lifestyles and antenatal stress and anxiety. 1491 pregnant women were drawn from the Guangxi birth cohort study (GBCS). A base line questionnaire was used to collect demographic information and maternal lifestyles. The Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to assess prenatal stress and anxiety, respectively. Regression analyses identified the relationship between maternal lifestyles and prenatal stress and anxiety: (1) Hours of phone use per day was positively correlated to prenatal stress and anxiety and increased with stress and anxiety levels (all P trend < 0.05). In addition, not having baby at home was positively correlated to prenatal stress. (2) Self-reported sleep quality was negative with prenatal stress and anxiety, and decreased with stress and anxiety levels (all P trend < 0.01). Moreover, not frequent cooking was negatively correlated to prenatal stress and having pets was negatively correlated to prenatal anxiety (P < 0.05). However, having pets was not correlated to prenatal stress (P > 0.05). Our results showed that adverse lifestyles increase the risk of antenatal stress and anxiety, a regular routine and a variety of enjoyable activities decreases the risk of prenatal stress and anxiety.

AB The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy is rising. OSA during pregnancy has been associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. The effect of maternal OSA on the fetus, particularly on fetal growth, is less apparent. Most of the currently available human data is based on non-objective assessment of OSA and includes heterogeneous populations with inadequate control on confounders, such as maternal obesity and pregnancy complications. Using objective tools in non-obese women with uncomplicated pregnancies, we aimed to investigate the association between maternal OSA and fetal growth. A total of 155 non-obese pregnant women were recruited. Birth-weight percentile of the newborns of women with mild OSA was significantly higher compared with the newborns of non-OSA controls (72% vs. 57%, respectively, P < 0.01). Birth-length and triceps thickness measurements were significantly higher among the newborns of women with OSA compared with controls (P = 0.02 for both). The proportion of large for gestational age (LGA) newborns was higher among women with OSA compared with controls (28% vs. 8%, respectively, P = 0.04). Our results suggest that maternal OSA during the third trimester of pregnancy - even in a mild form - is associated with accelerated fetal growth.

AB Diabetes is a common complication of pregnancy, and the prevalence of all types of the disease is increasing worldwide. Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with short term and long term adverse effects for mother and child. The goal of treatment of diabetes in pregnancy is to minimize maternal and fetal adverse events related to hyperglycemia. Treatment options vary by type of diabetes, from a focus on lifestyle modifications in gestational diabetes to continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps in pregestational diabetes. Nevertheless, given the commonality of hyperglycemia, considerable overlap exists in the treatment of different types of diabetes in pregnancy. Also, despite ongoing research on treatment of diabetes in pregnancy for decades, changes in the characteristics of the patient population have highlighted the limited effectiveness of different therapies. Specifically, despite the co-occurrence of obesity and diabetes, treatment recommendations including glycemic targets are not altered in such cases and a single optimal treatment strategy for each type of diabetes in pregnancy does not seem to exist. Rather, the approach to treating pregnant women with diabetes likely needs to be individualized to maximize the short term and long term health of mother and child. This article will review recent clinical studies to summarize established treatment strategies and introduce novel therapies for diabetes in pregnancy.

AB Background: Although leisure-time physical activity (PA) contributes to overall health, including pregnancy health, patterns across pregnancy have not been related to birth outcomes. We hypothesized that women with sustained low leisure-time PA would have excess risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and that changing patterns across pregnancy (high to low and low to high) may also be related to risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods: Nulliparous women (n = 10,038) were enrolled at 8 centers early in pregnancy (mean gestational age in weeks [SD] = 12.05 [1.51]. Frequency, duration, and intensity (metabolic equivalents) of up to three leisure activities reported in the first, second and third trimesters were analyzed. Growth mixture modeling was used to identify leisure-time PA patterns across pregnancy. Adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, [PTB, overall and spontaneous], hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [HDP], gestational diabetes [GDM] and small-for-gestational-age births [SGA]) were assessed via chart abstraction.
   Results: Five patterns of leisure-time PA across pregnancy were identified: High (35%), low (18%), late decreasing (24%), early decreasing (10%), and early increasing (13%). Women with sustained low leisure-time PA were younger and more likely to be black or Hispanic, obese, or to have smoked prior to pregnancy. Women with low vs. high leisure-time PA patterns had higher rates of PTB (10.4 vs. 7.5), HDP (13.9 vs. 11.4), and GDM (5.7 vs. 3.1, all p < 0.05). After adjusting for maternal factors (age, race/ethnicity, BMI and smoking), the risk of GDM (Odds ratio 2.00 [95% CI 1.47, 2.73]) remained higher in women with lowcompared to high patterns. Early and late decreasing leisure-time PA patterns were also associated with higher rates of GDM. In contrast, women with early increasing patterns had rates of GDMsimilar to the group with high leisure-time PA (3.8% vs. 3.1%, adjusted OR 1.16 [0.81, 1.68]). Adjusted risk of overall PTB (1.31 [1.05, 1.63]) was higher in the low pattern group, but spontaneous PTB, HDP and SGA were not associated with leisure-time PA patterns.
   Conclusions: Sustained low leisure-time PA across pregnancy is associated with excess risk of GDM and overall PTB compared to high patterns in nulliparous women. Women with increased leisure-time PA early in pregnancy had low rates of GDM that were similar to women with high patterns, raising the possibility that early pregnancy increases in activity may be associated with improved pregnancy health.

AB BACKGROUND Among the various factors that may influence the pharmacological response to opioids, genetic polymorphisms [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)] have generated some interest.
   OBJECTIVES To examine the influence on morphine dose requirements and adverse events in the postoperative period of four SNP [opioid receptor mu1 (OPRM1), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) ex-21 and ex-26, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT)] in candidate genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.
   DESIGN A single centre prospective study.
   SETTING University Hospital, Paris, France, from 2 January 2007 to 15 November 2011.
   PATIENTS A total of 438 white adults scheduled for major orthopaedic surgery (spine, hip and knee) under general anaesthesia. The main exclusion criteria were receiving opioids for chronic pain, nonopioid drugs within 2 days prior to surgery, pregnancy, renal insufficiency, sleep apnoea obstruction syndrome, morbid obesity, severe hepatic impairment, cognitive dysfunction.
   INTERVENTIONS Assays of plasma concentrations of morphine and metabolites (morphine 3-glucuronide and morphine 6-glucuronide) were performed and common polymorphisms in four candidate genes [OPRM1 A118G rs1799971; P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) T3435C (rs1045642) and G2677T/A (rs2032582); COMT Val 158 Met (rs4680)] were analysed. Morphine was titrated by staff in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) and in the ward patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was used for 24 h.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The dose of morphine required to achieve pain relief and the influence of SNP in genes involved in morphine pharmacodynamics and kinetics on morphine dose requirements. Secondary endpoints were the concentrations of morphine, morphine 6-glucuronide and morphine 3-gluguronide, the proportion of patients requiring a rescue analgesic and the proportion of morphine-related adverse events.
   RESULTS A total of 404 patients completed the study to final analysis. The mean +/- SD morphine dose to achieve pain relief was 15.8 +/- 8.8 mg in the PACU and 22.7 +/- 18.6 mg during patient-controlled intravenous administration. Morphine-related adverse events were observed in 37%. There was no relationship between any genetic polymorphisms and morphine dose, morphine 3-gluguronide and morphine 6-glucuronide concentration, morphine-related adverse events or pain level. In the PACU only, P-glycoprotein polymorphisms (ex-21; ex-26) were significantly associated with morphine concentration but the prediction of the model was poor (R-2 = 0.04).
   CONCLUSION No major relationship has been demonstrated between SNP of OPRM1, ABCB1, COMT and morphine requirement, pain level or adverse effects in the postoperative period.

AB Background: Unwanted, intrusive thoughts of infant-related harm are a normal, albeit distressing experience for most new mothers. The occurrence of these thoughts can represent a risk factor for the development of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). As the early postpartum period represents a time of increased risk for OCD development, the transition to parenthood provides a unique opportunity to better understand OCD development. Aims: The purpose of this study was to assess components of cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of postpartum OCD in relation to new mothers' thoughts of infant-related harm. Method: English-speaking pregnant women (n = 100) participated. Questionnaires were completed at approximately 36 weeks of gestation, and at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. An interview to assess postpartum harm thoughts was administered at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum. Questionnaires assessed OC symptoms, OC-related beliefs, fatigue, sleep difficulties and negative mood. Results: Prenatal OC-related beliefs predicted postpartum OC symptoms, as well as harm thought characteristics and behavioural responses to harm thoughts. The severity of behavioural responses to early postpartum harm thoughts did not predict later postpartum OC symptoms, but did predict frequency and time occupation of accidental harm thoughts, and interference in parenting by intentional harm thoughts. Strong relationships between OC symptoms and harm thought characteristics, and concurrent sleep difficulties, negative mood and fatigue were also found. Conclusions: Findings provide support for cognitive behavioural conceptualizations of postpartum OCD and emphasize the importance of maternal sleep, fatigue and negative mood in the relationship between OC-related beliefs and maternal cognitive and behavioural responses to postpartum harm thoughts.

AB BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) has emerged as a predictor of later cardiac risk. This study tested whether pregnancy complications that may have long-term offspring cardiac sequelae are associated with differences in HRV at birth, and whether these HRV differences identify abnormal cardiovascular development in the postnatal period.
   METHODS: Ninety-eight sleeping neonates had 5-min electrocardiogram recordings at birth. Standard time and frequency domain parameters were calculated and related to cardiovascular measures at birth and 3 months of age.
   RESULTS: Increasing prematurity, but not maternal hypertension or growth restriction, was associated with decreased HRV at birth, as demonstrated by a lower root mean square of the difference between adjacent NN intervals (rMSSD) and low (LF) and high-frequency power (HF), with decreasing gestational age (p < 0.001, p = 0.009 and p = 0.007, respectively). We also demonstrated a relative imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, compared to the term infants. However, differences in autonomic function did not predict cardiovascular measures at either time point.
   CONCLUSIONS: Altered cardiac autonomic function at birth relates to prematurity rather than other pregnancy complications and does not predict cardiovascular developmental patterns during the first 3 months post birth. Long-term studies will be needed to understand the relevance to cardiovascular risk.

While some of these challenges, such as lack of sleep, were predictable, many were not. For example, I was not aware that just getting pregnant would be a difficulty. Also, I did not know how paralyzing postpartum depression could be. Looking back on these experiences after a few years, I have a new perspective. I share my experiences, feelings about them, and some of the ways I figured out to overcome the hardships I experienced.

AB IMPORTANCE Surgical removal of adenoids and tonsils to treat obstructed breathing or recurrent middle-ear infections remain common pediatric procedures; however, little is known about their long-term health consequences despite the fact that these lymphatic organs play important roles in the development and function of the immune system.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate long-term disease risks associated with adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and adenotonsillectomy in childhood.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort study of up to 1189 061 children born in Denmark between 1979 and 1999 and evaluated in linked national registers up to 2009, covering at least the first 10 and up to 30 years of their life, was carried out. Participants in the case and control groups were selected such that their health did not differ significantly prior to surgery.
   EXPOSURES Participants were classified as exposed if adenoids or tonsils were removed within the first 9 years of life.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The incidence of disease (defined by International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision [ICD-8] and Tenth Revision [ICD-10] diagnoses) up to age 30 years was examined using stratified Cox proportional hazard regressions that adjusted for 18 covariates, including parental disease history, pregnancy complications, birth weight, Apgar score, sex, socioeconomic markers, and region of Denmark born.
   RESULTS A total of up to 1 189 061 children were included in this study (48% female); 17 460 underwent adenoidectomy. 11 830 tonsillectomy, and 31 377 adenotonsillectomy; 1157 684 were in the control group. Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in diseases of the upper respiratory tract (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.51-2.63 and RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.54-4.80; respectively). Smaller increases in risks for infectious and allergic diseases were also found: adenotonsillectomy was associated with a 17% increased risk of infectious diseases (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10-1.25) corresponding to an absolute risk increase of 2.14% because these diseases are relatively common (12%) in the population. In contrast, the long-term risks for conditions that these surgeries aim to treat often did not differ significantly and were sometimes lower or higher.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study of almost 1.2 million children, of whom 17 460 had adenoidectomy. 11830 tonsillectomy, and 31 377 adenotonsillectomy, surgeries were associated with increased long-term risks of respiratory, infectious, and allergic diseases. Although rigorous controls for confounding were used where such data were available, it is possible these effects could not be fully accounted for, Our results suggest it is important to consider long-term risks when making decisions to perform tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.

AB Background In many western countries, women have a much higher rate of sickness absence than men. To what degree the gender differences in sickness absence are caused by gender differences in health is largely unknown.
   Aims To assess to what degree the gender gap in sickness absence can be explained by health factors and work-and family-related stressors.
   Methods Norwegian parents participating in the Tracking Opportunities and Problems (TOPP) study were asked about sickness absence and a range of factors possibly contributing to gender differences in sickness absence, including somatic and mental health, sleep problems, job control/demands, work-home conflicts, parent-child conflicts and stressful life events. Using a cross-sectional design, we did linear regression analyses, to assess the relative contribution from health and stressors.
   Results There were 557 study participants. Adjusting for health factors reduced the gender difference in sickness absence by 24%, while adjusting for stressors in the family and at work reduced the difference by 22%. A simultaneous adjustment for health factors and stressors reduced the difference in sickness absence by about 28%.
   Conclusions Despite adjusting for a large number of factors, including both previously well-studied factors (e.g. health, job control/demands) and lesser-studied factors (parent-child conflict and sexual assault), this study found that most of the gender gap in sickness absence remains unexplained. Gender differences in health and stressors account for only part of the differences in sickness absence. Other factors must, therefore, exist outside the domains of health, work and family stressors.

AB IntroductionBreastfeeding rates in the United States continue to fall short of Healthy People 2020 goals. Bedsharing has been promoted as a way of increasing breastfeeding durations.
   MethodsWe used prospectively collected Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) and PRAMS-2 data from 2276 women to explore whether bedsharing frequency predicts age at weaning. Bedsharing was assessed at 14 weeks after birth (PRAMS), and duration of breastfeeding was assessed at 2 years after birth (PRAMS-2). Cox proportional hazards models controlled for primiparity, cesarean birth, marital status, employment status, maternal race and ethnicity, and pregravid body mass index.
   ResultsWomen in this sample reported high rates of bedsharing: only 15.7% of PRAMS respondents said they never shared a bed with their infant. We also observed a dose-response association between bedsharing frequency and breastfeeding duration when the analysis controlled for covariables: women who reported more frequent bedsharing at 14 weeks postpartum were more likely to wean later. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.18 (95% CI, 1.02-1.35) for often versus always bedsharing to 1.92 (95% CI, 1.66-2.24) for never versus always. In other words, at any given infant age, women who always bedshared were more likely to keep breastfeeding. Women who always bedshared at 14 weeks postpartum breastfed their infant for a median of 13 months (95% CI, 12-14), compared with 10 months (95% CI, 9-11) for women who never bedshared at 14 weeks.
   DiscussionAlthough we cannot rule out confounding by breastfeeding intention, our results suggest that bedsharing in early infancy might lead to later weaning. Regardless of infant feeding method, given the frequency of bedsharing reported by women in this and other samples, clinicians encountering pregnant and postpartum women should teach safe bedsharing practices.

AB Pregnancy rhinitis (PR), a common condition in pregnant women, is defined as long-lasting nasal congestion due to mucosal swelling and increased secretion without any signs of infection, allergy or tumor, starting at any time during pregnancy and disappearing within 2 weeks of delivery. Smoking and a sensitization to house dust mites are known risk factors. While a definitive pathophysiological concept for PR does not exist, hormonal influences are discussed. We present a stepwise therapeutic strategy for PR and an overview to the latest literature.

AB There are many ways in which women experience sleep differently from men. Women contending with distinct sleep challenges respond differently to sleep disorders, as well as sleep deprivation and deficiency, and face particular health outcomes as a result of poor sleep. Idiosyncrasies, including changes that occur with the biological life cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, make the understanding of sleep in women an important topic to study. Each phase of a woman's life, from childhood to menopause, increases the risk of sleep disturbance in unique ways that may require distinct management. Indeed, new research is unraveling novel aspects of sleep pathology in women and the fundamental role that sex hormones play in influencing sleep regulation and arousals and possibly outcomes of sleep conditions. Moreover, studies indicate that during times of hormonal change, women are at an increased risk for sleep disturbances such as poor sleep quality and sleep deprivation, as well as sleep disorders such as OSA, restless legs syndrome, and insomnia. This article reviews sleep changes in female subjects from neonatal life to menopause.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a commonly occurring disease, particularly among young women of child-bearing age. The underlying pathophysiology for this disease has remained largely unclear; however, the recent literature suggests that focal outflow obstruction of the transverse sinus may be the cause. The purpose of this study was to report one group's early experience with transverse venous sinus stenting in the treatment of IIH and assess its effectiveness.
   METHODS The authors performed a retrospective chart review to identify patients who had undergone stenting of an outflow-obstructed transverse venous sinus for the treatment of IIH at Gates Vascular Institute between January 2015 and November 2017. Patient demographic data of interest included age, sex, BMI, and history of smoking, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hormonal contraceptive use, and acetazolamide therapy. Each patient's presenting signs and symptoms and whether those symptoms improved with treatment were reviewed. The average opening lumbar puncture (LP) pressure preprocedure, average pressure gradient across the obstructed segment prior to stenting, treatment failure rate (need for shunt placement), and mean follow-up period were calculated.
   RESULTS Of the 18 patients who had undergone transverse venous stenting for IIH, 16 (88.9%) were women. The mean age of all the patients was 38.3 years (median 38 years). Mean BMI was 34.2 kg/m(2) (median 33.9 kg/m(2)). Presenting symptoms were headache (16 patients [88.9%]), visual disturbances (13 patients [72.2%]), papilledema (8 patients [44.4%]), tinnitus (3 patients [16.7%]), and auditory bruit (3 patients [16.7%]). The mean opening LP pressure preprocedure was 35.6 cm H2O (median 32 cm H2O). The mean pressure gradient measured proximally and distally to the area of focal obstruction within the transverse sinus was 16.5 cm H2O (median 15 cm H2O). Postprocedurally, 14 patients (77.8%) continued to have headaches; 6 (33.3%) continued to have visual disturbances. No patients continued to have auditory bruit (0%) or papilledema (0%). One patient (5.6%) had new-onset tinnitus postprocedure. Overall improvement of symptoms was noted in 16 patients (88.9%) postprocedure, with 1 patient (5.6%) requiring shunt placement and 2 other patients (11.1%) requiring postprocedural LP to monitor intracranial pressure to determine candidacy for further surgical interventions to treat residual symptoms. The mean duration of follow-up was 194.2 days.
   CONCLUSIONS Transverse sinus stenting is a rapidly developing technique that has shown good effectiveness and safety in the literature. Authors of the present study found that stenting a flow-obstructed transverse sinus in patients with IIH was a safe and effective way to treat the condition.

AB Melatonin is a neurohormone synthesized from the aromatic amino acid tryptophan mainly by the pineal gland of mammals. Melatonin acts as a broad-spectrum antioxidant, powerful free radical scavenger, anti-inflammatory agent, anticarcinogenic factor, sleep inducer and regulator of the circadian rhythm, and potential immunoregulator. Melatonin and reproductive system are interrelated under both physiological and pathological conditions. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune dysregulation are associated with the pathogenesis of the female reproductive system which causes endometriosis (EMS), recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Accumulating studies have indicated that melatonin plays pleiotropic and essential roles in these obstetrical and gynecological disorders and would be a candidate therapeutic drug to regulate inflammation and immune function and protect special cells or organs. Here, we systematically review the pleiotropic roles of melatonin in EMS, RSA, and PCOS to explore its pathological implications and treatment potential.

AB Bariatric patients may face specific clinical problems after surgery, and multidisciplinary long-term follow-up is usually provided in specialized centers. However, physicians, obstetricians, dieticians, nurses, clinical pharmacists, midwives, and physical therapists not specifically trained in bariatric medicine may encounter post-bariatric patients with specific problems in their professional activity. This creates a growing need for dissemination of first level knowledge in the management of bariatric patients. Therefore, the Obesity Management Task Force (OMTF) of the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) decided to produce and disseminate a document containing practical recommendations for the management of post-bariatric patients. The list of practical recommendations included in the EASO/OMTF document is reported in this brief communication.

AB Background: The prevalence of pregnancy-associated insomnia is high. Although insomnia may flow from normal physiologic features of pregnancy, it may also be an early warning sign of a relapse, or a trigger for a relapse, of a psychiatric illness. Those at risk for psychiatric illnesses may require medications as well as behavioral and psychotherapeutic interventions, to prevent relapse in the perinatal period. Unfortunately, few reviews of psychotropics used to treat pregnancy-related sleep disorders exist.
   Objective: We discuss issues related to sleep and sleep disorders in pregnancy in the context of co-morbid psychiatric illness, and review the literature on the commonly-used medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, trazodone, and melatonin) for insomnia during pregnancy.

AB Husbands' alcohol use has been associated with family-level stress and intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in India. Joint family systems are common in India and IPV often co-occurs with non-violent family maltreatment of wives (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care). Alcohol use increases for some parents following the birth of a child. This study examined 1,038 postpartum women's reports of their husbands' alcohol use and their own experiences of IPV (by husband) and non-violent maltreatment from husbands and/or in-laws. We analyzed cross-sectional, quantitative data collected in 2008, from women (ages 15-35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months at three large urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Crude and adjusted logistic regression models estimated associations between the independent variable (husbands' past month use of alcohol) and two dependent variables (postpartum IPV and maltreatment). Overall, 15% of husbands used alcohol, ranging from daily drinkers (10%) to those who drank one to two times per week (54%). Prevalence of postpartum IPV and family maltreatment was 18% and 42%, respectively. Prevalence of IPV among women married to alcohol users was 27%. Most abused women's husbands always (27%) or sometimes (37%) drank during violent episodes. Risk for IPV increased with a man's increasing frequency of consumption. Women who lived with a husband who drank alcohol, relative to non-drinkers, were more likely to report postpartum IPV, aOR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.3, 3.1]. Husbands' drinking was marginally associated with increased risk for family maltreatment, aOR = 1.4, 95% CI = [1.0, 2.1]. Our findings suggest that men's alcohol use is an important risk factor for postpartum IPV and maltreatment. Targeted services for Indian women contending with these issues are implicated. Postpartum care offers an ideal opportunity to screen for IPV, household maltreatment, and other health risks, such as husband's use of alcohol. There is need to scale up proven successful interventions for reducing men's alcohol use and design strategies that provide at-risk women protection from alcohol-related IPV.

AB Introduction: Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) from maternal cigarette smoking is linked to developmental deficits, including impaired auditory processing, language, generalized intelligence, attention, and sleep. Fetal brain undergoes massive growth, organization, and connectivity during gestation, making it particularly vulnerable to neurotoxic insult. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are extensively involved in growth, connectivity, and function of developing neural circuitry and neurotransmitter systems. Thus, PNE may have long-term impact on neurobehavioral development. The purpose of this study was to compare the auditory K-complex, an event-related potential reflective of auditory gating, sleep preservation and memory consolidation during sleep, in infants with and without PNE and to relate these neural correlates to neurobehavioral development.
   Methods: We compared brain responses to an auditory paired-click paradigm in 3- to 5-month-old infants during Stage 2 sleep, when the K-complex is best observed. We measured component amplitude and delta activity during the K-complex.
   Results: Infants with PNE demonstrated significantly smaller amplitude of the N550 component and reduced delta-band power within elicited K-complexes compared to nonexposed infants and also were less likely to orient with a head turn to a novel auditory stimulus (bell ring) when awake.
   Conclusions: PNE may impair auditory sensory gating, which may contribute to disrupted sleep and to reduced auditory discrimination and learning, attention re-orienting, and/or arousal during wakefulness reported in other studies.
   Implications: Links between PNE and reduced K-complex amplitude and delta power may represent altered cholinergic and GABAergic synaptic programming and possibly reflect early neural bases for PNE-linked disruptions in sleep quality and auditory processing. These may pose significant disadvantage for language acquisition, attention, and social interaction necessary for academic and social success.

AB Pluripotent stem cells may serve as an alternative source of beta-like cells for replacement therapy of type 1 diabetes; however, the beta-like cells generated in many differentiation protocols are immature. The maturation of endogenous beta cells involves an increase in insulin expression starting in late gestation and a gradual acquisition of the abilities to sense glucose and secrete insulin by week 2 after birth in mice; however, what molecules regulate these maturation processes are incompletely known. In this study, we aim to identify small molecules that affect immature beta cells. A cell-based assay, using pancreatic beta-like cells derived from murine embryonic stem (ES) cells harboring a transgene containing an insulin 1-promoter driven enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter, was used to screen a compound library (NIH Clinical Collection-003). Cortisone, a glucocorticoid, was among five positive hit compounds. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that glucocorticoids enhance the gene expression of not only insulin 1 but also glucose transporter-2 (Glut2; Slc2a2) and glucokinase (Gck), two molecules important for glucose sensing. Mifepristone, a pharmacological inhibitor of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling, reduced the effects of glucocorticoids on Glut2 and Gck expression. The effects of glucocorticoids on ES-derived cells were further validated in immature primary islets. Isolated islets from 1-week-old mice had an increased Glut2 and Gck expression in response to a 4-day treatment of exogenous hydrocortisone in vitro. Gene deletion of GR in beta cells using rat insulin 2 promoter-driven Cre crossed with GR(flox/flox) mice resulted in a reduced gene expression of Glut2, but not Gck, and an abrogation of insulin secretion when islets were incubated in 0.5mM d-glucose and stimulated by 17mM d-glucose in vitro. These results demonstrate that glucocorticoids positively regulate glucose sensors in immature murine beta-like cells.

AB Objective: To assess satisfaction with maternity waiting home built spaces and features in women who are at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. residential facilities that temporarily house near-term pregnant mothers close to healthcare facilities that provide obstetrical care). Specifically we wanted to answer the questions: (1) Are built spaces and features associated with maternity waiting home user satisfaction? (2) Can built spaces and features designed to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function improve maternity waiting home user satisfaction? And (3) Which built spaces and features are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction?
   Design: A cross-sectional study comparing satisfaction with standard and non-standard maternity waiting home designs. Between December 2016 and February 2017 we surveyed expectant mothers at two maternity waiting homes that differed in their design of built spaces and features. We used bivariate analyses to assess if built spaces and features were associated with satisfaction. We compared ratings of built spaces and features between the two maternity waiting homes using chi-squares and t-tests to assess if design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy and function were associated with higher satisfaction. We used exploratory robust regression analysis to examine the relationship between built spaces and features and maternity waiting home satisfaction.
   Setting: Two maternity waiting homes in Malawi, one that incorporated non-standardized design features to improve hygiene, comfort, privacy, and function (Kasungu maternity waiting home) and the other that had a standard maternity waiting home design (Dowa maternity waiting home).
   Participants: 322 expectant mothers at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes (i.e. first-time mothers and those with no pregnancy risk factors) who had stayed at the Kasungu or Dowa maternity waiting homes. Findings: There were significant differences in ratings of built spaces and features between the two differently designed maternity waiting homes, with the non-standard design having higher ratings for: adequacy of toilets, and ratings of heating/cooling, air and water quality, sanitation, toilets/showers and kitchen facilities, building maintenance, sleep area, private storage space, comfort level, outdoor spaces and overall satisfaction (p = <.0001 for all). The final regression model showed that built spaces and features that are most important for maternity waiting home user satisfaction are toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space (R-2 = 0.28).
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: The design of maternity waiting home built spaces and features is associated with user satisfaction in women at risk for underutilizing maternity waiting homes, especially related to toilets/showers, guardian spaces, safety, building maintenance, sleep area and private storage space. Improving maternity waiting home built spaces and features may offer a promising area for improving maternity waiting home satisfaction and reducing barriers to maternity waiting home use.

AB The natural history of the southern naked-tailed armadillo Cabassous unicinctus squamicaudis is not well known. Here, we provide basic information about burrow systems, home ranges, activity, morphometric measures, and reproductive behaviour. We monitored 10 individuals through VHF telemetry and direct observations in the central Pantanal of Brazil for 24 months. Males (2.06 km(2)) had significantly larger home ranges than females (0.59 km(2)) and home ranges of males overlapped with those of several females. There was very little overlap in ranges of the same sex and very few social interactions were observed. Southern naked-tailed armadillos dug convoluted galleries to forage, and, unless they used their entrance to exit, they emerged on average 2 m away (ranging from 0.01 m to 17 m) from the burrow entrance. When leaving their burrows, they spend on average 6.5 min above ground, travelling an average of 83 m (ranging from 1 m to 781 m) before going back underground. They do not return to sleep in a particular burrow, changing burrows frequently. The studied armadillos were diurnal, and spend 99.25% of the day underground, emerging only during the hottest period of the day (mid-afternoon). The southern naked-tailed armadillos should be classified as a subterranean species, rather than fossorial since they spent most of their time underground where foraging also takes place. Minimum densities of C. u. squamicaudis were estimated at 2.21 adults/km(2). Gestation was estimated to last for 4 months. Parental care of a single young lasted on average 4 months. Niche overlap between E. sexcinctus and C. u. squamicaudis in the study area is minimal. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier GmbH on behalf of Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB Objective: Prematurely born children have been reported to have more sleep problems throughout childhood than children born at term. The aim of this study was to explore if prenatal or neonatal factors can predict sleep problems at age 11 years in children born extremely preterm (EPT).
   Method: A prospective observational study of all infants who were born EPT in Norway in 1999 and 2000. Prenatal and neonatal data were collected by all Norwegian obstetric and pediatric departments. Parental questionnaire mapped sleep problems and sleep habits at the age of 11 years.
   Results: Of the 372 eligible children, 221 participated. Of those, 28.1% snored, 27.5% had difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings and 17.2% suffered from daytime sleepiness. Themean sleep duration was 9.4 h (range 4.3-11.0 h). Smoking in pregnancy predicted snoring (odds ratio 4.3). Neonatal cerebral hemorrhage and being born small for gestational age predicted difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings (odds ratio 2.2 and 2.3). Other morbidities during pregnancy or the newborn period, gestational age or the burden of treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit did not predict sleep problems. None of the studied prenatal or neonatal factors predicted daytime sleepiness or sleep duration <9 h.
   Conclusion: Of numerous prenatal and neonatal factors, only smoking during pregnancy, being born small for gestational age and cerebral hemorrhage predicted sleep problems at 11 years of age among these children born EPT.

   DELIVERY; OUTCOMES
AB Background: The burden of malaria and anaemia in pregnancy remains high despite the availability of proven efficacious antenatal care interventions. Sub-optimal uptake of the interventions may be due to inadequate active participation of pregnant women in their antenatal care. It was hypothesized that providing opportunities for pregnant women to improve upon active participation in their antenatal care through malaria and anaemia point-of-care testing would improve adherence to ANC recommendations and interventions and lead to better pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods: Fourteen antenatal clinics in the Ashanti region of Ghana were randomized into intervention (pregnant women participating in their care plus current routine care) and control (current routine care) arms. Pregnant women attending the clinics for the first time were recruited and followed up until delivery. Haemoglobin levels and malaria parasitaemia were measured at baseline, 4-8 weeks after recruitment and at 36-40 weeks gestation. Birth weight and pregnancy outcomes were also recorded.
   Results: The overall mean age, gestational age and haemoglobin at baseline were 26.4 years, 17.3 weeks and 110 g/l, respectively, with no significant differences between groups; 10.7% had asymptomatic parasitaemia; 74.6% owned an ITN but only 48.8% slept under it the night before enrolment. The adjusted risk ratio by 8 weeks follow up and at 36-40 weeks gestation in the intervention versus the control was 0.97 (95% CI 0.78-1.22) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.63-1.34) for anaemia and 1.17 (95% CI 0.68-2.04) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.27-2.57) for parasitaemia. The adjusted risk ratio for low birth weight was 0.93 (95% CI 0.44-1.97) and for pregnancy complications (abortions, intrauterine fetal deaths and still births) was 0.77 (95% CI 0.17-3.52) in the intervention group versus controls.
   Conclusion: Although its potential was evident, this study found no significant beneficial effect of women participating in their malaria and haemoglobin tests on pregnancy outcomes. Exploring factors influencing health worker compliance to health intervention implementation and patient adherence to health interventions within this context will contribute in future to improving intervention effectiveness.0

AB Background: Preterm birth leads to multiple morbidities affecting the health of a child. Lack of information on the health impact of prematurity hinders the possibility of any effective public health interventions in this regard. Our aim was to determine the association between preterm birth and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) among 3 years old children in the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka.
   Methods: A community-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 790 preterm and term born children who were 03 years old. Multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to identify children. The exposure status, a preterm birth, was established using the maternal pregnancy records. Outcome status was measured using a validated health related quality of life questionnaire (prepared in Sinhala) for preschool-aged children. Mothers of the children responded to an interviewer-administered questionnaire which had variables on the exposure status, outcome and additional variables such as child development status and birth related information. Quality of life was measured in twelve different domains of health (subscales). The impact was analyzed using the multiple linear regression.
   Results: Response rate was 95.5% (n = 379) for preterm group and 95.2% (n = 378) for term-born group. Health-Related Quality of Life scores obtained by preterm children were lower than the term born children in eight subscales. Preterm birth showed statistically significant association with subscales on sleep wellbeing, general wellbeing and abdominal symptoms in the adjusted analysis (p < 0.05). Among preterm children prolonged illness, delayed development status, socio economic status and maternal perception on the health status of the child were common predictors of quality of life.
   Conclusion: Preterm birth affected health related quality of life of preschool aged children.

TI Assessment of the quality of care in Maternity Waiting Homes MWHs in
   Mulanje District, Malawi
SO MALAWI MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCESS
AB Aim
   Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)in Malawi remains high at 439 deaths per 100,000 live births, primarily due to limited access to skilled birth care. Although Malawi established Maternity Waiting Homes (MWHs) to improve access to skilled labour, the quality of care provided in the homes has received limited assessment. The aim of this study was to assess quality of care in the Maternity Waiting Homes in Mulanje, Malawi.
   Methods
   We conducted a descriptive qualitative study in three MWHs in Mulanje district, Malawi, from December 2015 to January 2016. We conducted a non-participatory observation using a checklist, to assess the physical layout of the facilities, six face-to-face in-depth interviews (IDIs)with health providers and four focus group discussions (FGDs) with 27 pregnant women admitted for more than 48 hours in MWHs. We digitally recorded all FGDs and IDIs simultaneously transcribing and translating them verbatim into English. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results
   There were mixed perceptions towards the quality of care in the MWHs. Factors that were perceived to indicate higher quality included a quiet environment at the MWH and midwifery services. Lack of cooking spaces, lack of 24-hour nursing care, absence of food and recreation services and sleeping on the floor negatively affected perceptions of quality.
   Conclusion
   The study has shown that care provided in MWHs varied across facilities. Perceptions of the quality of care were not uniform and a lack of standards contributed to the differences. Efforts should be made to improve, sustain and standardize care in MWHs in order to improve perceptions of quality of care in MWHs.

AB Sugar-sweetened beverages containing caffeine are widely used among humans nowadays and can have negative consequences on the overall health. Our study aims to discuss the effects of these sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and how they can impact the health in different ways particularly on the brain. Some of the mechanisms by which soft drinks can exert adverse effects include an increase in glutathione-6-dehydrogenase level, increased levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and dopamine alteration in brain waves on electroencephalography (EEG) eventually leading to stroke and dementia. They can increase the oxidative stress by a decreasing monoamine oxidase and acetylcholine esterase and antioxidants such as glutathione and catalase. The sleep quality and duration of sleep is also significantly affected by their increased consumption. Also, the consumption of sodium benzoate (found in beverages) on impairing memory, motor coordination, affecting reduced glutathione (GSH), increasing the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the brain and producing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children is emphasized. Finally, we will highlight how diet drinks can also be harmful and the maternal consumption of chocolate or soft drinks during pregnancy and postnatal period can be linked to cognitive impairment and child obesity.

AB Objectives. To evaluate the impact of the Southern Public Health Regions' (Regions IV and IV) Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (CoIIN) to Reduce Infant Mortality, supported by the US Health Resources and Services Administration.
   Methods. We examined pre-post change (2011-2014) for CoIIN strategies with available outcome data from vital records (early elective delivery, smoking) and the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (safe sleep) as well as preterm birth and infant mortality for Regions IV and VI relative to all other regions.
   Results. For most outcomes, CoIIN improvements were greater in Regions IV and VI than in other regions. For example, early elective delivery decreased by 22% versus 14% in other regions, smoking cessation during pregnancy increased by 7% versus 2%, and back sleep position increased by 5% versus 2%. Preterm birth decreased by 4%, twice that observed in other regions, but infant mortality reductions did not differ significantly.
   Conclusions. The CoIIN approach to public health improvement shows promise in accelerating progress in intermediate outcomes and preterm birth. Impact on infant mortality may require additional strategies and sustained efforts.

ID PAIN MANAGEMENT; LABOR PAIN; METAANALYSIS; MEDICINE; NAUSEA
AB Introduction Major concerns regarding the use of medication during pregnancy justify the need for safer interventions. Acupuncture is an emerging alternative for several clinical conditions during this period. The objective of this study is to summarise evidence derived from systematic reviews (SRs) focusing on acupuncture for pregnancy-related acute conditions.
   Methods Review of SRs. A systematic literature search was carried out in several electronic databases, aiming to include all SRs assessing the effects of acupuncture for acute conditions during pregnancy. Methodological quality and quality of the publication/reporting of each SR were assessed by the application of AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), respectively.
   Results The initial search retrieved 11 492 records, of which 16 SRs met our inclusion criteria. The average AMSTAR score was 7.3, the lowest score being 3 and the highest 11. The lowest PRISMA score was 12, the highest 25, and the average PRISMA score was 19.9. The results support the proposal that acupuncture might be considered an option for alleviating pain during labour, for correcting breech presentation, and for managing pelvic and back pain during pregnancy. There is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for inducing labour, managing nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, improving sleep quality, controlling nausea and vomiting associated with Caesarean delivery, and managing urinary infection.
   Conclusions Acupuncture might be an option for alleviating pain during labour, for correcting breech presentation, and for managing pelvic and back pain during pregnancy. More studies are needed to confirm the effects of acupuncture for other pregnancy-related acute conditions.

AB BACKGROUND: We tested the hypotheses that caffeine th,-rapy would increase the ventilatory response to hypercarbia in infants above the effect of maturation and those with a weaker ventilatory response to hypercarbia would be more likely to subsequently develop apnea that required treatment.
   METHODS: Infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestation underwent a steady-state hypercarbic challenge using 0, 2, and 4% carbon dioxide soon after birth that was repeated at weekly intervals. The results of the initial study were compared between infants who did or did not subsequently develop apnea requiring treatment with caffeine.
   RESULTS: Twenty-six infants born at a median gestation of 32 (range 31-33) weeks were assessed. Caffeine administration was associated with an increase in CO2 sensitivity, and the mean increase was 15.3 (95% CI: 1-30) ml/kg/min/% CO2. Fourteen infants subsequently developed apnea treated with caffeine. After controlling for gestational age and birth weight, they had significantly lower carbon dioxide sensitivity at their initial study compared with those who did not require treatment.
   CONCLUSION: Caffeine administration was associated with an increase in the ventilatory response to hypercarbia. An initial weaker ventilatory response to hypercarbia was associated with the subsequent development of apnea requiring treatment with caffeine.

AB Anxiety about labor in women at the end of pregnancy sometimes reaches levels that are clinically concerning. We investigated whether low-risk pregnant women with childbirth fear during the last trimester demonstrate specific findings with regard to resting heart rate variability (HRV) and examined whether HRV biofeedback can reduce this fear and alter resting HRV. We measured the levels of childbirth fear (Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire, W-DEQ) and resting HRV indexes in 97 low-risk pregnant women in their 32nd-34th week of gestation and advised women with W-DEQ scores of ae<yen> 66 (n = 40) to practice HRV biofeedback (StressEraser) at home. We then reassessed these measures 3-4 weeks later in the 36th-37th week of gestation regardless of whether the women practiced the method. We found that childbirth fear had no significant effect on resting HRV indexes when the W-DEQ cutoff was conventionally set at ae<yen> 66. However, women with W-DEQ scores of ae<yen> 90 (n = 5) had a significantly lower high-frequency power than their counterparts (p = 0.028). The W-DEQ scores reduced significantly in women who performed HRV biofeedback (n = 18, p < 0.001), but there was no change in those who did not perform the method (n = 20). These findings suggested that very high W-DEQ scores (ae<yen> 90), but not the conventional criteria (W-DEQ score ae<yen> 66), of the fear of childbirth were associated with low parasympathetic activity among low-risk pregnant women and that HRV biofeedback intervention can effectively decrease the fear of childbirth in these women.

AB Background: African-American (AA) women have poorer pregnancy outcomes, and studies in nonpregnant women suggest a different etiology of weight gain in AA compared with white women. We hypothesized that physiologic factors such as low energy expenditure and physical activity would be present in AA compared with white women in pregnancy.
   Objective: We armed to identify physiologic risk factors for disordered energy balance in AA and white women early in pregnancy.
   Design: This was a cross-sectional study in 66 pregnant women with obesity, between 14 and 16 wk of gestation. Energy intake was calculated using the intake-balance method. Energy expenditure was measured in free-living conditions [total daily energy expenditure (TDEE)] over 7 d with the use of doubly labelled water and during sleep [sleeping EE (SleepEE)] in a room calorimeter. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography and physical activity by accelerometers. Markers of metabolic health were obtained from fasting blood and urine.
   Results: AA (n = 34) and white (n = 32) women were comparable in age (mean +/- SEM: 27.7 +/- 0.6 y), enrollment body mass index [mean +/- SEM (in kg/m(2)): 36.9 +/- 0.7], and body fat (mean +/-
   SEM: 45.0% +/- 0.6%). AA women had more fat-free mass (P = 0.01) and tended to be more insulin-resistant (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, P = 0.06). Energy intake was significantly lower in AA than in white women (2499 +/- 76 compared with 2769 +/- 58 kcal/d, P = 0.001), although absolute TDEE was comparable (AA: 2590 +/- 77 kcal/d; white: 2711 +/- 56 kcal/d; P = 0.21). After adjusting for body composition, TDEE was significantly lower in AA women (-231 +/- 74 kcal/d, P = 0.003), as was SleepEE (-81 +/- 37 kcal/d, P = 0.03). Physical activity, substrate oxidation, and metabolic biomarkers (triiodothyronine and thyroxine concentrations, catecholamine excretion) were not significantly different between groups.
   Conclusions: Body mass-adjusted energy expenditure is significantly lower in AA than in white pregnant women. Energy intake recommendations for pregnancy do not consider this difference and may therefore overestimate energy requirements in AA women. This may lead to unintentional overeating and contribute to the disparity of excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention that is more prevalent in AA women. This trial was registered at clmicaltrials.gov as NCT0 1954342.

AB Reproductive phenology is an important trait subjected to natural selection. Current horses in America belong to the Palearctic original populations after being introduced by European colonizers. Photoperiod variation is the main environmental factor for the adjustment of reproductive timing in horses, but is absent in equatorial areas. Here we hypothesize that seasonality of green-grass availability may influence breeding phenology in equatorial regions. We used data of 929 services to mares from 2006 to 2011 in a thoroughbred equine exploitation in Ecuador that experienced strong grass seasonality. Actual births could not be used to infer natural phenology because they were influenced by management decisions. Instead, we used variations in the probability of pregnancy after a service as a measure of the natural tendency of mares to show breeding phenology. We found that although managers tended to schedule pregnancies in two periods within the year, mares were more prone to become pregnant after the increase in grass greenness that takes place at the beginning of the year (February). Our finding has potential applications to improve the success of services and the welfare of animals, by providing green-grass stimuli in the appropriate season.

AB Anxiety and depression levels are higher in obese compared to those in normal weight pregnant women. The aims of this study are to examine anxiety and depression in pregnancy following bariatric surgery and to compare with obese pregnant controls considering the dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), folate, and vitamin B-12.
   Anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) were examined in the first (T1) and third (T3) pregnancy trimester in 54 women with bariatric surgery and 25 obese. T1 and T3 dietary intake of PUFA, folate, and vitamin B-12 intake was assessed using a 3-day food record. Mixed models with a compound symmetry covariance structure and regression models were applied.
   About half of the women with surgery had high state and trait anxiety scores ( 40), which did not significantly change during pregnancy. Every 10-kg postoperative weight loss was associated with an increase in T1 state and trait anxiety with respectively 2.7 and 2.3 points. A smoking woman had a 8.6-point higher state anxiety score than a non-smoking woman in T1. In T3, every additional hour of sleep was associated with a decrease in trait anxiety score with 1.59 points. Anxiety and depression scores were not associated with and could not be explained by inadequate PUFAs, folate, and vitamin B-12 intakes. Anxiety scores were higher following surgery than those in untreated obesity at both time points.
   Pregnancy following bariatric surgery induces high levels of anxiety that are not associated with an inadequate maternal diet.

AB The spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) ranges from mild snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the most severe form of SDB. Current recommendations are to treat these women with continuous positive airway pressure despite limited data. SDB in early and mid pregnancy is associated with preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Pregnant women with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea at delivery were at significantly increased risk of having cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and in-hospital death. These effects were exacerbated in the presence of obesity. Postpartum, these women are at risk for respiratory suppression and should be monitored.

AB Context: Disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep quality during pregnancy have been related to gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which affect postpartum glucose metabolism and future risk of type 2 diabetes.
   Objective: We assessed whether the circadian rhythm-related melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) genotype was associated with 1 to 5 years of postpartum glycemic changes among women with a history of GDM and whether gestational weight gain modified such associations.
   Design, Settings, and Participants: The established circadian rhythm-associated MTNR1B genetic variant (rs10830963) was genotyped in 1025 Chinese women with a history of GDM. Body weight and glycemic traits, during and after pregnancy, were longitudinally collected.
   Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measure was postpartum glycemic changes.
   Results: We found that women carrying different MTNR1B genotypes showed distinct postpartum changes in 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test: 0.36, 0.20, and 20.19 mM per additional copy of the shorter sleep duration-related G allele in women with inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight gain, respectively (for interaction, P = 0.028). The corresponding changes in fasting glucose were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.01 mM, although the modification effect of gestational weight gain on the genetic association was marginally significant (for interaction, P = 0.067).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that gestational weight gainmaymodify the circadian rhythm-related MTNR1B genetic variant on long-term glycemic changes, highlighting the significance of gestational weight management in diabetes prevention among women with GDM.

AB Aims. Few epidemiological studies evaluated associations between perinatal complications and maternal mood at the early postpartum period and the findings are inconsistent. We aimed at investigating a wide range of complications during pregnancy, at delivery, and at the early postpartum period as determinants of postpartum depression (PPD) at 8 weeks postpartum.
   Methods. A total of 1037 women who enrolled in the Rhea mother-child cohort in Crete, Greece participated in the present study. Information on pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications was obtained from clinical records or by questionnaires. Postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed at 8 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were fit to estimate the association between pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications and maternal depressive symptoms, adjusting also for potential confounders.
   Results. The prevalence of women with probable depression (EPDS score >= 13) was 13.6% at 8 weeks postpartum. Gestational hypertension and/or preeclampsia (beta coefficient 1.86, 95% CI: 0.32, 3.41) and breastfeeding difficulties (beta coefficient 0.77, 95% CI: 0.02, 1.53) were significantly associated with higher PPD symptoms. Sleep patterns during pregnancy, such as sleep deprivation (OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.91, 6.67) and snoring (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.93), and breastfeeding duration less than 2 months (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.19, 2.64) were significantly associated with increase in the odds for PPD. Some other complications, such as unplanned pregnancy and hospitalisation during pregnancy were also associated with EPDS score, but these associations were explained by socio-demographic characteristics of the mother.
   Conclusions. We found that several pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum complications may have an adverse effect on maternal mood at the early postpartum period. These findings have considerable implications for developing effective prevention and early psychoeducational intervention strategies for women at risk of developing PPD.

   Methods: A population-based cohort analysis including singleton pregnancies delivered between the years 1991 to 2014 in a tertiary referral hospital was conducted. Incidence of hospitalizations (up to age 18 years) due to various respiratory diseases was compared between offspring of GDM-complicated pregnancies and normoglycemic pregnancies. Kaplan-Meyer curves were used to assess cumulative hospitalization incidence Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for baseline selected confounders.
   Results: During the study period 216,197 deliveries met the inclusion criteria Of those, 4.7% (n = 10,184) were complicated by GDM. In most of the investigated respiratory diseases, no significant differences were found between offspring of both groups. Nonetheless, obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalization rate was higher among the GDM group, an association which proved to be independent of potential confounders with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.26 (95% CI 1.02-1.55, p = 0.036).
   Conclusion: Gestational diabetes mellitus does not appear to be associated with long-term respiratory hospitalizations of the offspring other than obstructive sleep apnea-related hospitalizations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite recognition that parents are critical stakeholders in childhood obesity prevention, obesity research has overwhelmingly focused on mothers. In a recent review, fathers represented only 17% of parent participants in > 600 observational studies on parenting and childhood obesity. The current study examined the representation of fathers in family interventions to prevent childhood obesity and characteristics of interventions that include fathers compared with those that only include mothers. Eligible studies included family-based interventions for childhood obesity prevention published between 2008 and 2015 identified in a recent systematic review. Data on intervention characteristics were extracted from the original review. Using a standardized coding scheme, these data were augmented with new data on the number of participating fathers/male caregivers and mothers/female caregivers. Out of 85 eligible interventions, 31 (37%) included mothers and fathers, 29 (34%) included only mothers, 1 (1%) included only fathers, and 24 (28%) did not provide information on parent gender. Of the interventions that included fathers, half included 10 or fewer fathers. Across all interventions, fathers represented a mere 6% of parent participants. Father inclusion was more common in interventions targeting families with elementary school-aged children (6-10 years) and those grounded in Ecological Systems Theory, and was less common in interventions focused on very young children (0-1 years) or the prenatal period and those targeting the sleep environment. This study emphasizes the lack of fathers in childhood obesity interventions and highlights a particular need to recruit and engage fathers of young children in prevention efforts.

AB ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify factors that may predispose women to excess gestational weight gain (GWG).
   MethodsSeventy-two healthy women with obesity (30 class I, 24 class II, 18 class III) expecting a singleton pregnancy were studied at 13 to 16 weeks gestation. Energy expenditure (EE) was measured during sleep (SleepEE, average EE from 0200-0500 hours) in a whole-room calorimeter, and total daily EE (TDEE) over 7 days using doubly labeled water. Glucose, insulin, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines were measured.
   ResultsBody composition explained 70% variability in SleepEE, and SleepEE accounted for 67% to 73% of TDEE. Though there was no evidence of consistent low metabolism, there was considerable variability. Low SleepEE was associated with insulin resistance and low triiodothyronine concentrations (both P=0.01). Physical activity level was 1.470.02. For women with SleepEE within 100 kcal/d of their predicted EE, TDEE was significantly less than the estimate (2,530 +/- 91 vs. 2,939 kcal/d; P<0.001) provided from the most recent gestational energy requirement model.
   ConclusionsPregnant women with obesity are inactive, possibly predisposing them to excess GWG. Current energy requirement models overestimate activity and may promote excess GWG in women with obesity. Furthermore, the observed large interindividual variability in basal metabolism may be important to consider when assessing the risk for excess GWG.

AB Objectives: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep, including habitual snoring and insomnia. The co-occurrence among non-pregnant cohorts is 30%-50% with increased risk for adverse health outcomes. To date, no study has examined the comorbid status or impact in pregnant women.
   Methods: The prevalence of insomnia (INS) and habitual snoring (HS) were examined in 439 women in the third trimester (34.1 +/- 3.7 weeks). Habitual snoring (snoring >= 3 times/week) was self-reported. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ).
   Results: Four groups emerged: HS-/ISQ- (n = 161; 36.7%), HS-/ISQ+ (n = 146; 33.3%), HS+/ISQ- (n = 63; 14.4%), and HS+/ISQ+ (n = 69; 15.7%). Logistic regression models revealed both independent associations, as well as comorbid HS/INS status with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3 -6.5, p < 0.001; aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.4, p = 0.02; aOR 7.2, 95%CI 3.7-14.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Only comorbid HS/INS was associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 3.2 95%CI 1.0-10.6, p = 0.048). Insomnia alone and HS alone were associated with a baby born large for gestational age (aOR 2.9 95%CI 1.2-7.1, p = 0.019 and aOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11.1, p = 0.034 respectively) but however, the comorbid state was not significantly associated with LGA. Only women with HS alone were at increased odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.2 95%CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.046).
   Conclusions: Both insomnia alone and comorbid insomnia/habitual snoring were associated with adverse outcomes even after accounting for confounders. These findings are clinically relevant since adverse pregnancy outcomes may have severe consequences for both mother and baby. In order to mitigate these outcomes, identifying viable treatment(s) for women at risk should be considered a high priority. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: To examine the relationship between poor sleep quality during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   Methods: A total of 4066 singleton pregnant women from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort (TMCHC) without overt diabetes before pregnancy were analyzed. Sleep quality and duration during early pregnancy were self-reported by enrolled women at their first antenatal care visit before 16 weeks of gestation. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was assessed with a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Information about self-reported sleep quality and duration in mid-pregnancy were also collected at this time. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models, and adjusted for potential confounders to estimate the effect of poor sleep quality and the interaction between sleep quality and duration on the development of GDM. Stratified analyses were performed according to age, parity, family history of diabetes and napping.
   Results: A total of 335 (8.2%) participants were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality was reported in 259 (6.4%) women during early pregnancy and 248 (6.1%) in mid-pregnancy. The risk of GDM was increased in women with poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20-2.61). No association was found between poor sleep quality during mid-pregnancy and the risk of GDM. The risk of GDM was highest in women with poor sleep and longer nighttime sleep duration during early pregnancy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.29) when compared with those who reported good sleep and 7.0-8.5 h of sleep duration per night. Stratified analysis found that the association between poor sleep quality in early pregnancy and the risk of GDM was stronger among women aged >= 30 years (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.35-4.09) and those with a family history of diabetes (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.54-10.48).
   Conclusions: Poor sleep quality during early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of GDM. Screening for and treating sleep problems in early pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk of GDM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Obesity during pregnancy causes numerous maternal and fetal health complications, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity has previously been linked to disruption of the intrinsic adipose clock gene network that is crucial for normal metabolic function. This adipose clock also undergoes major change as part of the maternal metabolic adaptation to pregnancy, but whether this is affected by maternal obesity is unknown. Consequently, in this study we tested the hypothesis that obesity disturbs rhythmic gene expression in maternal adipose tissue across pregnancy. A rat model of maternal obesity was established by cafeteria (CAF) feeding, and adipose expression of clock genes and associated nuclear receptors (Ppars and Pgc1 alpha) was measured across days 15-16 and 21-22 of gestation (term = 23 days). CAF feeding suppressed the mesor and/or amplitude of adipose tissue clock genes (most notably Bmal1, Per2, and Rev-erb) relative to chow-fed controls (CON) across both days of gestation. On day 15, the CAF diet also induced adipose Ppar, Ppar, and Pgc1 alpha rhythmicity but repressed that of Ppar, while expression of Ppar, Ppar, and Pgc1 alpha was reduced at select time points. CAF mothers were hyperleptinemic at both stages of gestation, and at day 21 this effect was time-of-day dependent. Fetal plasma leptin exhibited clear rhythmicity, albeit with low amplitude, but interestingly these levels were unaffected by CAF feeding. Our data show that maternal obesity disrupts rhythmic expression of clock and metabolic genes in maternal adipose tissue and leads to maternal but not fetal hyperleptinemia.

AB Pregnancy often predisposes women to new-onset sleep disturbances, as well as exacerbations of preexisting sleep disorders. The goals of treating perinatal sleep disorders include the promotion of restorative sleep and the benefits it brings to both mother and fetus. The prescribing of any sleep aid in pregnancy must include consideration of the risks and benefits for both the patient and her fetus. Although data on the perinatal use of sleep aids are limited, there may be effects on fetal development, timing and duration of delivery, and postnatal outcomes.

AB Obstetricians may be a pregnant woman's primary professional source of information about her infant prior to the birth, but infant safe sleep knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of this population are unknown. This study explores obstetric physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and infant safe sleep and identifies barriers as well as enabling and/or reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with obstetric physicians who provide prenatal healthcare to women in Ohio. Surveys were sent to all licensed physicians included in the registry of the State Medical Board of Ohio with "obstetrics," "obstetrics and gynecology," or "maternal and fetal medicine" as their primary specialty (n = 1771). The response rate was 30%, with 418 physicians included in the analysis. Many participants were knowledgeable about infant safe sleep recommendations; however, only 55% indicated that it was important for obstetric physicians to discuss Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and/or infant safe sleep with prenatal patients. Many participants (70%) perceived barriers to providing infant safe sleep education, however most (82%) indicated interest in doing so. Participants' knowledge and attitudes were significant predictors of whether they discuss this topic with patients. Obstetric physicians can influence the infant safe sleep decisions that women make. Improving obstetricians' knowledge and attitudes about infant safe sleep and supporting physicians who wish to provide education on this topic may help to ensure that women are receiving frequent and consistent infant safe sleep messaging throughout the prenatal period.

AB Breastfeeding benefits both infant and mother, including reducing the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). To further reduce risk of SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends infants sleep on their backs on a separate sleep surface. Our objective was to describe trends and factors associated with breastfeeding and infant sleep practices in Georgia. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 2004-2013 data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Chi square tests for trends were utilized to determine whether there were significant linear trends in breastfeeding and infant sleep overtime and by survey phase. After exclusions, 4643 cases remained for analysis. From 2004 to 2013, there was a slight (insignificant) decrease in breastfeeding initiation, with the highest proportion in 2010 (79.9%) and the lowest in 2013 (66.9%). Rates of exclusive breastfeeding increased significantly from 2004 (31.3%) to 2013 (81.7%). During that time, the proportion of infants being placed back to sleep slightly decreased (though not significantly), from 59.7 to 48.9%. The proportion of mothers who reported never bed-sharing increased significantly from 26.7 to 45.1% over this period. The decreasing breastfeeding initiation rates in Georgia diverge from national upward trends, however, exclusive breastfeeding rates by survey phase were slightly higher than national trends. Our results suggest the need for targeted education and support for breastfeeding and safe sleep practices. State-level trends data on breastfeeding and infant sleep practices provide valuable information for state-level public health professionals and policy makers, health care providers, and breastfeeding and safe sleep advocates.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by phenotypic variations, which can be partly attributed to specific gene polymorphisms. Recent studies have focused on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in order to permit a more precise perception about clinical phenotyping and targeted therapies. The aim of this review was to synthesize the current state of knowledge on the relation between DNA methylation patterns and the development of pediatric OSA, in light of the apparent limited literature in the field. We performed an electronic search in PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases, including all types of articles written in English until January 2017. Literature was apparently scarce; only 2 studies on pediatric populations and 3 animal studies were identified. Forkhead Box P3 (FOXP3) DNA methylation levels were associated with inflammatory biomarkers and serum lipids. Hypermethylation of the core promoter region of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) gene in OSA children were related with decreased eNOS expression. Additionally, increased expression of genes encoding pro-oxidant enzymes and decreased expression of genes encoding anti-oxidant enzymes suggested that disturbances in oxygen homeostasis throughout neonatal period predetermined increased hypoxic sensing in adulthood. In conclusion, epigenetic modifications may be crucial in pediatric sleep disorders to enable in-depth understanding of genotype-phenotype interactions and lead to risk assessment. Epigenome-wide association studies are urgently needed to validate certain epigenetic alterations as reliable, novel biomarkers for the molecular prognosis and diagnosis of OSA patients with high risk of end-organ morbidity.

AB Background: Due to the high prevalence in pregnant women and potential association with pregnancy complications or perinatal outcomes, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has become an increasing concern.
   Methods: Pubmed and Embase were retrieved from inception until 2017 to conduct a meta-analysis to explore the association of SDB and several outcomes during gestation. A stratified analysis differentiated by the type of SDB [snoring alone/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)] was also performed. Pooled odds ratios were produced for binary outcomes. Weighted mean differences were also produced for continuous outcomes. Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the impact of individual studies on summary results and estimation of publication bias was performed by funnel plot.
   Results: 35 studies with a total of 56,751,837 subjects were included. SDB during pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), and preeclampsia (PEC), but not significantly associated with fetal maternal outcomes, namely APGAR score and birth weight. Moreover, OSA was linked with an increasing risk of GDM, PIH, PEC and preterm birth while snoring appeared to increase the risk of GDM, PIH, and PEC.
   Conclusion: The finding provided potential evidence for association between SDB and adverse perinatal outcomes. SDB increased the risk of some pregnancy complications while its influence to fetal outcomes was not clear.

AB Physiological studies in animals and human support an important role of circadian system in reproduction. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential association of CLOCK gene polymorphisms with idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortion (IRSA). We performed a case-control study. The study group consisted of 268 women with a history of three or more idiopathic recurrent spontaneous abortions and 284 women with at least two live births and no history of pathologic pregnancies all from Slovenia and Serbia. Two SNPs in the CLOCK gene were chosen and genotyped. The results showed a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between the two groups in the CLOCK gene for rs6850524 and rs11932595. Our analysis showed that G allele under dominant model (GG+GC/CC) for rs6850524 (p = 2.10(-4), OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.46-3.56) as well as G allele under dominant model (GA+AA/AA) for rs11932595 (p = 0.04, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.01-2.04) might be risk factors against IRSA. Our data suggest that genetic variability in the CLOCK gene is associated with IRSA warranting further confirmation and mechanistic investigations.

AB Background: We recently demonstrated that a gestational diabetes history in mothers is associated with higher postpartum incident diabetes not only in mothers but also in fathers. In the present study, we examined changes in health behaviours and cardiometabolic profiles in both mothers and partners who participated in a diabetes prevention program within 5 years of a gestational diabetes pregnancy.
   Methods: Couples were enrolled into a 13-week program that included 5 half-day group sessions and web/telephone-based support between sessions. It was designed in consultation with patients and previously studied in mothers. We computed mean changes from baseline (95% CI) for physical activity, eating, and sleep measures, and cardiometabolic parameters (fasting and 2-h post glucose load plasma glucose, BMI, blood pressure) in both partners and mothers.
   Results: Among 59 couples enrolled, 45 partners (76%) and 47 mothers (80%) completed final evaluations. Baseline cardiometabolic measures averaged within normal limits. Similar to mothers, partners increased physical activity (+ 1645 steps/day, 9596CI 730, 2561; accelerometer assessed moderate-to-vigorous physical activity + 36.4 min/week, 95% CI 1.4, 71.4) and sleep duration (+0.5 h/night, 95% CI 0.1, 0.9) and reduced the sodium-to-potassium ratio of food intake (- 0.09 95% CI -0.19, - 0.001). No conclusive changes were observed in glucose measures or insulin resistance; in analyses combining mothers and partners, systolic blood pressure decreased (- 2.7 mmHg, 95% CI -4.4, - 1.0).
   Conclusions: Partners and mothers demonstrated improved physical activity, sleep, and dietary quality. Baseline cardiometabolic profiles averaged at normal values and there were no changes in glucose or insulin resistance; some blood pressure impact was observed. While strategies need to be developed to attract participants at higher cardiometabolic risk, this study demonstrates that partners of women within 5 years of a gestational diabetes diagnosis can be recruited and do achieve health behaviour change.

AB The weeks following birth are a critical period for a woman and her infant, setting the stage for long-term health and well-being. To optimize the health of women and infants, postpartum care should become an ongoing process, rather than a single encounter, with services and support tailored to each woman's individual needs. It is recommended that all women have contact with their obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric care providers within the first 3 weeks postpartum. This initial assessment should be followed up with ongoing care as needed, concluding with a comprehensive postpartum visit no later than 12 weeks after birth. The comprehensive postpartum visit should include a full assessment of physical, social, and psychological well-being, including the following domains: mood and emotional well-being; infant care and feeding; sexuality, contraception, and birth spacing; sleep and fatigue; physical recovery from birth; chronic disease management; and health maintenance. Women with chronic medical conditions such as hypertensive disorders, obesity, diabetes, thyroid disorders, renal disease, and mood disorders should be counseled regarding the importance of timely follow-up with their obstetrician-gynecologists or primary care providers for ongoing coordination of care. During the postpartum period, the woman and her obstetrician-gynecologist or other obstetric care provider should identify the health care provider who will assume primary responsibility for her ongoing care in her primary medical home. Optimizing care and support for postpartum families will require policy changes. Changes in the scope of postpartum care should be facilitated by reimbursement policies that support postpartum care as an ongoing process, rather than an isolated visit. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should be in the forefront of policy efforts to enable all women to recover from birth and nurture their infants. This Committee Opinion has been revised to reinforce the importance of the "fourth trimester" and to propose a new paradigm for postpartum care.

AB Organisms respond to environmental stimuli in ways that optimize survival and reproduction. Tsetse fly life history is characterized by high investment in progeny by the pregnant female and low birth rate. This places constraints on tsetse populations across the sub-Saharan biotopes they colonize where extreme climatic conditions militate against survival. Controlling metabolic rate is crucial in biotopes where daily swings in temperature can exceed 20 degrees C. Tsetse acquire their nutrient requirements from the blood meal. These diurnal flies are otherwise confined for most of their lives to perching sites in the shade. At these locations they are simultaneously threatened by vertebrate and invertebrate predators. Here we describe behaviours of the East African tsetse Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae) that permit it to reduce risk daily. Newly-emerged flies remain immobile at emergence in the photophase but scotophase-emerging flies walk away within seconds to climb (negative geotaxis) vertical substrates to find a perch off the ground. Flies of all ages show the ability to fly in almost total darkness (1.10(-5) lux) in the scotophase to perch on the upper side of horizontally suspended 1 cm diameter bars, simulating branches of vegetation, but perch under the same bars during the photophase. This underlines the predilection of tsetse for objects with a linear aspect that provide a vantage point and shade. Mature G. pallidipes can discriminate between horizontally suspended bars of different diameter and shape. Flicker fusion frequency values established by optomotor and retinogram recordings reveal a higher visual acuity in mature compared to newly-emerged tsetse.

AB BACKGROUND: A newly developed fetal movement acreleiation measurement recorder has made it possible to count gross movements for hours Tine purpose of tins study was to determine the normal reference values for such movements.
   METHODS: One bundled and six pregnant women recorded fetal movements by themselves when they slept at home weekly from 28 weeks to term. The normal inference values were determined based on the data that could be recorded for more than 4 h per night.
   RESULTS: A total of 2,458 h of data from 385 recordings from 64 women was available. The median ratio of 10-s periods in which fetal movements occurred to the total time interval was 17% at 28 gestational weeks, decreasing to similar to 6% at term. The number of fetal movements was 74 times/h, decieasing to 29 times at term. The number, the mean, and the longest durations of periods with no fetal movement, meaning no fetal movements were found for more than 5 min, were 1.6 times/ h, 7.95 and 14.25 mm, respectively, at 28 weeks, and mcieasing to 2 54 times, and 9.63 and 19.67 mm, respectively, at term.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study piovides noimal leference values for gross fetal movement count using the fetal movement acceleration measurement recorder.

AB IntroductionNearly 40% of US women of childbearing age are obese. Obesity during pregnancy is associated with multiple risks for both the woman and fetus, yet clinicians often feel unprepared to provide optimal antepartum care for this group of women. We collected and reviewed current evidence concerning antepartum care of women who are obese during pregnancy.
   MethodsWe conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines. Current evidence relating to the pregnancy care of women with a prepregnancy body mass index of 30kg/m(2) or higher was identified using MEDLINE databases via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection between January 2012 and February 2018.
   ResultsA total of 354 records were located after database searches, of which 63 met inclusion criteria. Topic areas for of included studies were: pregnancy risk and outcomes related to obesity, communication between women and health care providers, gestational weight gain and activity/diet, diabetic disorders, hypertensive disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, mental health, pregnancy imaging and measurement, late antepartum care, and preparation for labor and birth.
   DiscussionMidwives and other health care providers can provide better antepartum care to women who are obese during pregnancy by incorporating evidence from the most current clinical investigations.

AB Background. Music therapy as an adjunct to treatment is rarely used in perinatology and obstetrics, despite the proven therapeutic effect. Auditory stimulation through music positively impacts the health of adults and infants, its special role being observed in the development of prematurely born neonates. It is equally interesting how music impacts fetuses.
   Objectives. The aim of this study is to assess the parameters of fetuses through cardiotocographic recording in women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy while listening to Pyotr Tchaikovsky's "Sleeping Beauty" and "Swan Lake."
   Material and methods. The study was conducted in 2015 at Dr. Jan Biziel 2nd University Hospital in Byd-goszcz, on 48 women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The cardiotocographic parameters of the fetus were examined by means of a Sonicaid Team Standard Oxford apparatus (Huntleigh Healthcare, Cardiff, United Kingdom).
   Results. Significant changes were observed in the number of uterine contractions, accelerations, episodes of higher variability, and fetal movements after listening to the music.
   Conclusions. Listening to classical music can serve as a successful method of prophylaxis against premature deliveries, indicated by the lower number of uterine contractions, and in stimulating fetal movement in the case of a non-reactive non-stress test (NST). Music therapy, as a therapeutic method which is inexpensive and soothing, should be used more frequently in obstetrics wards, indicated by pathological pregnancies, isolation from the natural environment, and distress resulting from diagnostics and from being in an unfamiliar environment.

AB INTRODUCTION Tobacco use has been implicated as an important factor for poor sleep quality. However, in most studies, the sleep quality of smokers was only assessed though a self-reported questionnaire, without measuring any internal biomarkers that reflect the levels of tobacco exposure. We examined the association of active and passive smoking with sleep quality, assessed smoking exposure using urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP) as an internal biomarker, and further explored the relationship between 1-HOP and sleep quality.
   METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Liuzhou city, Guangxi, China. A total of 1787 male enterprise workers were enrolled. The smoking attribute data were collected by self-reported questionnaire, and individual sleep quality was evaluated through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The concentration of urinary 1-HOP was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
   RESULTS Compared with non-smoking, active smoking and passive smoking were significantly associated with long sleep latency (odds ratio, OR=1.84, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.28-2.64; 1.45, 1.00-2.11, respectively), short sleep duration (OR=2.72, 95% CI=1.45-5.09; 1.94, 1.01-3.71, respectively), daytime dysfunction (OR=1.54, 95% CI=1.10-2.17; 1.44, 1.02-2.03, respectively), and overall poor sleep quality with PSQI total score > 5 (OR=1.41, 95% CI=1.05-1.88; 1.34, 1.00-1.79, respectively). Compared with non-smokers, active smokers had higher urinary 1-OHP concentrations that were significant (p=0.004), while passive smokers had no significant difference in urinary 1-OHP concentration (p=0.344). The high concentration group was significantly associated with daytime dysfunction and overall poor sleep quality with PSQI total score > 5 (OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.06-2.81; 1.76, 1.18-2.63, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS Both active smoking and passive smoking are risk factors for poor sleep quality among Chinese male enterprise workers. Active smokers had significantly higher levels of urinary 1-OHP than non-smokers, and high concentration of 1-OHP was associated with daytime dysfunction and overall poor sleep quality.

AB Purpose:Many parents of multiples experience elevated mental health symptoms in the perinatal period. This population often presents with unique treatment needs and barriers to care; however, no tailored interventions have been developed for pregnant or postpartum mothers of multiples and/or their partners. This study involved an initial exploration of the perceived mental health treatment needs, preferences, and barriers to care in this population, as a first step toward developing such an intervention.Methods:Participants were 241 parents of multiples who were recruited in-person and online. They completed self-report measures assessing treatment history/preferences, barriers to care, and symptoms during the perinatal period.Results:Participants identified postpartum months 0 to 3 as the most difficult time. Few participants received any form of mental health treatment, although a significant percentage (approximately half) expressed interest in such treatment. Treatment interest was high for a range of clinical concerns. Participants were interested in both traditional treatment paradigms and eHealth approaches. Barriers to care were common, with the most common barrier being lack of time.Conclusions:There is a large, unmet need for mental health treatment in parents of multiples in the perinatal period, especially the early postpartum months. eHealth strategies seem particularly feasible and acceptable in this population and may help circumvent common barriers to care. Clinical recommendations and considerations in treatment development are discussed.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a shared-care model to enable primary-care physicians to participate more fully in meeting the complex, multidisciplinary healthcare needs of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Design: The design consisted of development of consensus recommendations and a shared-care algorithm. Participants: A working group of 11 Canadian neurologists involved in the management of patients with MS were included in this study. Main message: The clinical management of patients with multiple sclerosis is increasing in complexity as new disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) become available, and ongoing safety monitoring is required. A shared-care model that includes primary care physicians is needed. Primary care physicians can assist in the early detection of MS of individuals presenting with neurological symptoms. Additional key roles for family physicians are health promotion, symptom management, and safety and relapse monitoring of DMT-treated patients. General principles of health promotion include counseling MS patients on maintaining a healthy lifestyle; performing standard screening measures; and identifying and treating comorbidities. Of particular importance are depression and anxiety, which occur in >20% of MS patients. Standard work-ups and treatments are needed for common MS-related symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, spasticity, and sleep disorders. Ongoing safety monitoring is required for patients receiving specific DMTs. Multiple sclerosis medications are generally contraindicated during pregnancy, and patients should be counseled to practice effective contraception. Conclusions: Multiple sclerosis is a complex, disabling illness, which, similar to other chronic diseases, requires ongoing multidisciplinary care to meet the evolving needs of patients throughout the clinical course. Family physicians can play an invaluable role in maintaining general health, managing MS-related symptoms and comorbidities, monitoring for treatment-related adverse effects and MS relapses, and coordinating allied health services to ensure continuity of care to meet the complex and evolving needs of MS patients through the disease course.

AB Purpose This research was conducted to determine the effects of sleep hygiene training given to pregnant women with restless leg syndrome on their sleep quality.
   Methods This study was conducted using a quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test, and a control group. When the power analysis was made, a sample size with 5% two-sided significance, 95% confidence interval, and 95% ability to represent the population was calculated to have a total of 128 pregnant women. The sleeping hygiene training was given to two sessions of the experiment group. A personal identification form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used for the collection of data. Percentage distribution, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and chi-square were used for statistical evaluation in addition to dependent and independent groups t tests.
   Results PSQI pre-test mean values revealed that sleep quality in both groups was similarly poor (p = 0.353). It was determined that the mean post-test score after sleep hygiene training was 7.23 +/- 2.17 in the experiment group and 10.54 +/- 2.20 in the control group, while the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.000). Accordingly, it was determined that the sleepers in the experimental group had better sleep quality than those in the control group.
   Conclusions Sleep hygiene training given to pregnant women with restless leg syndrome increased sleep quality.

TI Quality of life in patients with endometriosis
SO GYNAKOLOGISCHE ENDOKRINOLOGIE
LA German
DT Article
ID HEALTH; IMPACT; WOMEN
AB Endometriosis, with an incidence of 10% in women of childbearing age, is more common than often thought and is considered to be a chronic disease. Symptoms can express themselves as early as menarche and change in character over time. In order to prevent chronic pelvic pain, adequate treatment of the causes of endometriosis and the resulting pain are essential to avoid impairment in quality of life. The focus of therapy is on stress, sleep disorders, relationship problems, and anxiety. If psychiatric diagnoses already exist, special attention should be paid to depression and anxiety disorders. Because the most appropriate therapy can change over time, depending on the life situation and current symptoms, women with endometriosis often need to be accompanied by an interdisciplinary team. In this article, we discuss the important aspects that should be considered to maintain a high quality of life for patients with endometriosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in pregnancy, but there are limited data on predictors.
   OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop predictive models of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: Nulliparous women completed validated questionnaires to assess for symptoms related to snoring, fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome. The questionnaires included questions regarding the timing of sleep and sleep duration, work schedules (eg, shift work, night work), sleep positions, and previously diagnosed sleep disorders. Frequent snoring was defined as self-reported snoring >= 3 days per week. Participants underwent in-home portable sleep studies for sleep-disordered breathing assessment in early (6-15 weeks gestation) and mid pregnancy (22-31 weeks gestation). Sleep-disordered breathing was characterized by an apnea hypopnea index that included all apneas, plus hypopneas with >= 3% oxygen desaturation. For primary analyses, an apnea hypopnea index >= 5 events per hour was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for predictor variables. Predictive ability of the logistic models was estimated with area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves, along with sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values and likelihood ratios.
   RESULTS: Among 3705 women who were enrolled, data were available for 3264 and 2512 women in early and mid pregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%, respectively. At each time point in gestation, frequent snoring, chronic hypertension, greater maternal age, body mass index, neck circumference, and systolic blood pressure were associated most strongly with an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Logistic regression models that included current age, body mass index, and frequent snoring predicted sleep-disordered breathing in early pregnancy, sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy, and new onset sleep-disordered breathing in mid pregnancy with 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves of 0.870, 0.838, and 0.809. We provide a supplement with expanded tables, integrated predictiveness, classification curves, and an predicted probability calculator.
   CONCLUSION: Among nulliparous pregnant women, logistic regression models with just 3 variables (ie, age, body mass index, and frequent snoring) achieved good prediction of prevalent and incident sleep-disordered breathing. These results can help with screening for sleep-disordered breathing in the clinical setting and for future clinical treatment trials.

AB The average Australian working week in middle-aged and older workers exceeds government recommendations. Long working weeks are associated with poor health outcomes; however, the relationship between long working weeks and health in young Australian workers is unknown.
   Data were drawn from the 22-year follow-up of the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study in Perth, Western Australia. Information was available from 873 young adults about working hours per week, shift work and sleep duration. Blood samples provided measures of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors.
   Almost one-third (32.8%) of young workers reported > 38 h working weeks. This was commonly reported in mining and construction industries for males; health and social assistance, mining and retail trade industries for females. CMR factors including increased waist circumference, higher fasting plasma glucose and reduced HDL cholesterol were associated with > 38 h working weeks. These relationships were not moderated by gender or by BMI for glucose and HDL cholesterol. Total sleep time was significantly lower in both male and female workers reporting > 38 h working weeks, but did not mediate the relationships seen with CMR factors.
   These findings point to early associations between > 38 h working weeks and CMR risk, and highlight the potential benefit of making young employees aware of the health associations with working arrangements to reduce the longer-term relationships seen with working hours and poor cardiometabolic health in population studies.

AB Objective: To evaluate relationships among obesity in pregnancy and plasma levels of tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenine (KYN), inflammatory markers, and depressed mood.
   Methods: Pregnant women (N = 374) were enrolled, and data were collected at a mean gestation of 20 weeks in this cross-sectional study. Plasma was analyzed for TRP, KYN, neopterin, and nitrite levels. Women completed demographic and mood scales.
   Results: There was a statistically significant inverse correlation between body mass index (BMI) and TRP and positive correlations between BMI and KYN and the kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) ratio. Neopterin was correlated with KYN/TRP, suggesting that the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) enzyme was activated. The correlations of neopterin and nitrite with BMI were too small to be clinically meaningful but may provide mechanistic insight. There was a correlation between depressed mood and nitrite levels. Depressed mood was also associated with lower TRP levels. When the sample was divided into pregnant women with or without obesity, TRP was significantly lower and the KYN/TRP ratio was significantly higher in the women with obesity.
   Conclusion: The pro-inflammatory state of obesity in pregnancy may drive activation of IDO-1, resulting in diversion of TRP away from serotonin and melatonin production and toward KYN metabolites. This alteration could contribute to depression, impaired sleep, increased production of excitotoxic neurotransmitters, and reinforcement of a pro-inflammatory state in pregnancy.

AB BackgroundAcupuncture is a non-pharmacological option to relieve pregnancy-related complaints.
   ObjectivesTo critically appraise the best available evidence for the use of acupuncture in outpatient care.
   Search strategyThe MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases were searched for English-language and German-language papers published from January 1980 to March 2017 using search terms related to pregnancy combined with acupuncture'.
   Selection criteriaSystematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing non-pharmacological treatments in unselected or low-risk pregnant women.
   Data collection and analysisQuality was assessed using a checklist (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were also performed.
   Main resultsHigh-quality systematic reviews (n=5) and RCTs with low risk of bias (n=3) were identified. The systematic reviews were based on single studies, with small sample sizes, that showed a benefit of acupuncture for evening pelvic pain; pelvic and low-back pain; nausea; functional disability; and sleep quality. Contradictory results were found in the RCTs regarding cesarean delivery; time to delivery; spontaneous labor; fetal distress; and Apgar score. Data pooling emphasized the heterogeneity ofresults.
   ConclusionsEvidence to support the use of acupuncture for relief of pregnancy-related conditions was limited.
   The evidence in favor of acupuncture for relief of pregnancy-related conditions was limited compared to sham acupuncture, standard care, or any type of physical exercise.

   POTENTIATION; TRANSMISSION; MECHANISMS; STRESS
AB Maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) has been suggested to be associated with increased frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in both humans and animal models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism is still unclear. We have recently reported that MSD at different stages of pregnancy impairs the emotional and cognitive functions, and suppresses hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) in the offspring rats. Here, we report that the MSD induced LTP impairment at the CA1 hippocampus of the offspring rats is associated with increased long-term depression (LTD) and reduced expression of postsynaptic GluA2-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs). Importantly, we found that inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis by a synthetic peptide Tat-GluA2(3Y) (3 mu mol/kg, i.p.) not only increased level of AMPARs and reduced LTD, but also restored LTP. Moreover, treatment with Tat-GluA2(3Y) peptide markedly alleviated the MSD-induced impairments of spatial learning and memory; and decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring. Together, our findings suggest that the MSD-induced postsynaptic AMPAR endocytosis causally contributes to the impairments of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, thereby disrupting the emotional and cognitive functions in the offspring.

AB Background: Sexual initiation occurs early in Sierra Leone. This study aims to analyze the determinants of condom and/or contraceptive use among a representative sample of young persons (10 to 24 years) in Sierra Leone.
   Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from a study conducted to monitor the implementation of a UNFPA package of interventions directed to improve SRH in young people of Sierra Leone. This assessment was conducted in 2016 at the end of the Ebola outbreak. In consequence, determinants linked to healthy lifestyle behaviors and UNFPA interventions were explored in addition to the usual determinants: socio demographic and sexual lifestyle. This study is a household quantitative survey with open ended questions used to illustrate and complete the analysis.
   Results: A total of 1409 young people were interviewed: of these, 216 boys and 381 girls were sexually active. Those who were pregnant or wished for pregnancy were excluded, leaving 194 boys and 268 girls for the analysis of determinants. The proportion of young people using neither condom nor other contraception at their last sexual intercourse in the whole sample was 40.5% and there was no statistically significant difference between boys and girls (42.3 vs 39.2; P = 0.504). Determinants were assessed and, after multivariable analysis, results differed between boys and girls and showed the importance of behavioral aspects. Four determinants were common to boys and girls: literacy, distance, negotiation capacity and hand washing. However, the distance factor for girls was to the health facility and for boys it was to school. Three more determinants remained in the boy's model: sleeping under a bednet, number of sexual partners and knowledge of contraceptive methods. Opinions about condoms and contraception revealed important barriers; opposition to contraceptive use was the main reason for non-use for both boys and girls, while lack of access was an important reason for boys.

AB Background: The use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) is crucial to the prevention, control, and elimination of malaria. Using household surveys conducted in 2014-2015 by the Health Communication Capacity Collaborative project in Madagascar, Mali, and Nigeria, we compared a model of psychosocial influence, called Ideation, to examine how malaria-related variables influence individual and household bed net use in each of these countries. Evaluations of non-malaria programs have confirmed the value of the ideational approach, but it is infrequently used to guide malaria interventions. The study objective was to examine how well this model could identify potentially effective malaria prevention approaches in different contexts.
   Methods: Sampling and survey designs were similar across countries. A multi-stage random sampling process selected female caregivers with at least one child under 5 years of age for interviews. Additional data were collected from household heads about bed net use and other characteristics of household members. The caregiver survey measured psychosocial variables that were subjected to bivariate and multivariate analysis to identify significant ideational variables related to bed net use.
   Results: In all three countries, children and adolescents over five were less likely to sleep under a net compared to children under five (OR = 0.441 in Madagascar, 0.332 in Mali, 0.502 in Nigeria). Adults were less likely to sleep under a net compared to children under five in Mali (OR = 0.374) and Nigeria (OR = 0.448), but not Madagascar. In all countries, the odds of bed net use were lower in larger compared to smaller households (OR = 0.452 in Madagascar and OR = 0. 529 in Nigeria for households with 5 or 6 members compared to those with less than 5; and OR = 0.831 in Mali for larger compared to smaller households). Of 14 common ideational variables examined in this study, six were significant predictors in Madagascar (all positive), three in Mali (all positive), and two in Nigeria (both negative).
   Conclusion: This research suggests that the systematic use of this model to identify relevant ideational variables in a particular setting can guide the development of communication strategies and messaging, thereby improving the effectiveness of malaria prevention and control.

   DETERMINANTS; STILLBIRTH; CARE
AB Background: In low-resource settings, a significant proportion of fetal, neonatal, and maternal deaths can be attributed to intrapartum-related complications. Certain risk factors, such as non-cephalic presentation, have a particularly high risk of complications. This qualitative study describes experiences around non-cephalic births and highlights existing perceptions and care-seeking behavior specific to non-cephalic presentation in rural Sarlahi District, Nepal.
   Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 34 individuals, including women who recently gave birth to a non-cephalic infant and female decision-makers in their households. We also conducted two focus groups with mothers (have two or more children, with at least one child under age five) and two focus groups with grandmothers in the community.
   Results: Several women described scenes of obstructed labor and practices like provision of unspecified injections early in labor to assist with the delivery. There were reports of arduous care-seeking processes from primary health centers to tertiary facilities, and mixed quality of care among home birth attendants and facility-based health workers respectively. Very few women were aware of the fetal presentation prior to delivery, and we identified no consistent understanding among participants of the risks of and care strategies for non-cephalic births. Risk perception around non-cephalic presentation varied widely. Some participants were acutely aware of potential dangers, while others had not heard of non-cephalic birth. Many interviewees said that the position in which a pregnant woman sleeps could impact the fetal position. Several participants had either taken or heard of medication intended to rotate the fetus into the correct position.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest the mixed quality of and access to care associated with non-cephalic birth and a lack of consistent understanding of the risk of and care for non-cephalic births in rural Nepal. The high risk of the condition and the recommended tertiary care present a dilemma in low-resource settings; the logistical difficulties and the mixed quality of care make care-seeking and referral decisions complex. While public health stakeholders strive to improve the quality of and access to the formal health system, those players must also be sensitive to the potential negative implications of promoting institutional care-seeking.

ID GENERATION-R; GROWTH; DELIVERY; CHILDREN; SMOKING; IMPACT; NAUSEA; SLEEP
AB The objective of this study was to identify distinct trajectories and their predictors of health related quality of life (HRQOL) of women during pregnancy in a prospective mother and child cohort. Analyses were based on 3936 Dutch pregnant women in Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. Information on potential predictors was collected in early pregnancy by questionnaire. Latent Class Mixture Modelling and Multinomial Logistic Regression were applied to assess the trajectory and predictors of HRQOL during pregnancy. HRQOL was measured by SF-12 in early, mid- and late pregnancy; physical and mental component summary (PCS-12/MCS-12) scores were calculated. Four physical HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory ('healthy) in 63.3%, consistently low (Vulnerable') in 10.8%; a small increase ('recovering') in 12.8% and a large decrease Cat risk') in 13.1%. Three mental HRQOL trajectories were identified: a healthy trajectory ('healthy') in 86.1%; a large increase ('recovering') in 7.5%; and a large decrease Cat risk') in 6.4%. Compared with healthy trajectories, the likelihood of following the 'vulnerable' physical HRQOL trajectory rather than a healthy trajectory was increased by daily fatigue(OR: 4.82[2.76, 8.40]), pelvic pain (OR:4.76[2.91, 7.78]) and back pain (OR:5.29[3.21, 8.70]); pregnancy-specific anxiety increased the likelihood of following the 'at risk' mental HRQOL trajectory (OR:7.95[4.84, 13.05]). Healthy physical and mental HRQOL trajectories during pregnancy were most common. Predictors indicative of poor HRQOL trajectories included pregnancy-related symptoms and anxiety.

TI A Cohort Study on Risk Factors for Preterm Births in Rural Gujarat

DE Antenatal care; cohort study; preterm births; risk factors; rural
AB Background: Prematurity is one of the leading causes of neonatal and under-five mortalities globally and also in India. It is an important determinant of short- and long-term morbidities in infants and children. Unfortunately, risk factors of majority of preterm births (PTBs) remain unexplained which calls for appropriate action. There is a dearth of community-based research on PTB and its risk factors, especially in high burden countries like India. Objectives: The objective of the study was to explore different risk factors for PTB. Methods: A cohort of 1977 antenatal mothers was enrolled at household level by trained field investigators and was followed up in four districts of Gujarat, India, to document the outcome of pregnancy. Pretested and structured questionnaires were used to collect information. A hierarchical regression model was used to analyze the risk factors for PTB. Results: Proportion of PTB was 9% among the enrolled cohort. Risk factors which were found to be significant on applying the hierarchical model were periodontal disease, long sleep duration, and sex during any trimester. Conclusions: The study suggests an urgent need for strengthening of existing guidelines for effective, evidence-based, and culturally appropriate interventions for prevention of PTB. Maintenance of good oral hygiene should find a place in routine recommendations for pregnant women, and antenatal examinations should include screening for oral hygiene also.

   PREGNANCY; HYPERTENSION
AB Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in pregnancy and may compromise fetal and even postnatal development. We developed an animal model to determine if maternal OSA could have lasting effects in offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to reduced ambient O-2 from 21 to 4-5%, approximately once per minute [chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH)] for 8 h/day during gestation days 3-19. Similarly handled animals exposed to ambient air served as controls (HC). Offspring were studied for body growth and cardiovascular function for 8 postnatal weeks. Compared with HC, prenatal CIH led to growth restriction, indicated by smaller body weight and tibial length, and higher arterial blood pressure in both male and female offspring. Compared with same-sex HC, CIH males showed abdominal obesity (greater ratio of abdominal fat weight to body weight or tibial length), left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (greater heart weight-to-tibial length ratio and LV posterior wall diastolic thickness), elevated LV contractility (increases in LV ejection fraction, end-systolic pressure-volume relations, and preload recruitable stroke work), elevated LV and arterial stiffness (increased end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship and arterial elasticity), and LV oxidative stress (greater lipid peroxide content). Compared with female CIH offspring, male CIH offspring had more profound changes in blood pressure (BP), cardiac function, myocardial lipid peroxidase (LPO) content, and abdominal adiposity. Rodent prenatal CIH exposure, mimicking human maternal OSA, exerts detrimental morphological and cardiovascular effects on developing offspring; the model may provide useful insights of OSA effects in humans.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Obstructive sleep apnea is common in human pregnancy. Following maternal exposure to chronic intermittent hypoxia, a hallmark of sleep apnea, both sexes of rat offspring showed growth retardation, with males being more vulnerable to hypertension and dysfunctional left ventricular changes. This model is useful to study detrimental effects of maternal obstructive sleep apnea on developing offspring in humans.

AB Most individuals adjust their caffeine intake according to the objective and subjective effects induced by the methylxanthine. However, to reach the desired effects, the quantity of caffeine consumed varies largely among individuals. It has been known for decades that the metabolism, clearance, and pharmacokinetics of caffeine is affected by many factors such as age, sex and hormones, liver disease, obesity, smoking, and diet. Caffeine also interacts with many medications. All these factors will be reviewed in the present document and discussed in light of the most recent data concerning the genetic variability affecting caffeine levels and effects at the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels that both critically drive the level of caffeine consumption. The pharmacokinetics of caffeine are highly variable among individuals due to a polymorphism at the level of the CYP1A2 isoform of cytochrome P450, which metabolizes 95% of the caffeine ingested. Moreover there is a polymorphism at the level of another critical enzyme, N-acetyltransferase 2. At the pharmacodynamic level, there are several polymorphisms at the main brain target of caffeine, the adenosine A2A receptor or ADORA2. Genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies, identified several loci critically involved in caffeine consumption and its consequences on sleep, anxiety, and potentially in neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. We start reaching a better picture on how a multiplicity of biologic mechanisms seems to drive the levels of caffeine consumption, although much more knowledge is still required to understand caffeine consumption and effects on body functions.

SO BMJ OPEN

ID BLOOD-FLOW
AB Introduction Accumulating evidence has shown an association between maternal supine going-to-sleep position and stillbirth in late pregnancy. Advising women not to go-to-sleep on their back can potentially reduce late stillbirth rate by 9%. However, the association between maternal right-sided going-to-sleep position and stillbirth is inconsistent across studies. Furthermore, individual studies are underpowered to investigate interactions between maternal going-to-sleep position and fetal vulnerability, which is potentially important for producing clear and tailored public health messages on safe going-to-sleep position. We will use individual participant data (IPD) from existing studies to assess whether right-side and supine going-to-sleep positions are independent risk factors for late stillbirth and to test the interaction between going-to-sleep position and fetal vulnerability.
   Methods and analysis An IPD meta-analysis approach will be used using the Cochrane Collaboration-endorsed methodology. We will identify case-control and prospective cohort studies and randomised trials which collected maternal going-to-sleep position data and pregnancy outcome data that included stillbirth. The primary outcome is stillbirth. A one stage procedure meta-analysis, stratified by study with adjustment of a priori confounders will be carried out.
   Ethics and dissemination The IPD meta-analysis has obtained central ethics approval from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee, ref: NTX/06/05/054/AM06. Individual studies should also have ethical approval from relevant local ethics committees. Interpretation of the results will be discussed with consumer representatives. Results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.

AB Objectives There is increasing evidence to suggest an association between sleep and diet. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between sleep duration and fruit/vegetable (FV) intakes and their associated biomarkers in UK adults.
   Design Cross-sectional.
   Setting Data from The National Diet and Nutrition Survey.
   Participants 1612 adults aged 19-65 years were included, pregnant/breast ceding women were excluded from the analyses.
   Outcome measures Sleep duration was assessed by self-report, and diet was assessed by 4-day food diaries, disaggregation of foods containing FV into their components was conducted to determine total FV intakes. Sleep duration was divided into: short (<7 hours/day), reference (7-8 hours/day) and long (>8 hours/day) sleep periods. Multiple regression adjusting for confounders was used for analyses where sleep duration was the exposure and FV intakes and their associated biomarkers were the outcomes. Restricted cubic spline models were developed to explore potential non-linear associations.
   Results In adjusted models, long sleepers (LS) consumed on average 28 (95% CI-50 to 6, p=0.01) g/day less of total FV compared to reference sleepers (RS), whereas short sleepers (SS) consumed 24 g/day less (95% CI-42 to 6, p=0.006) and had lower levels of FV biomarkers (total carotenoids, (3-carotene and lycopene) compared to RS. Restricted cubic spline models showed that the association between sleep duration and FV intakes was non-linear (p<0.001) with RS having the highest intakes compared to SS and LS. The associations between sleep duration and plasma total carotenoids (p=0.0035), plasma vitamin C (p=0.009) and lycopene (p<0.001) were non-linear with RS having the highest levels.
   Conclusions These findings show a link between sleep duration and FV consumption. This may have important implications for lifestyle and behavioural change policy.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) and markers of microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes.
   Study design: A total of 151 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited for repeat 24-h BP recordings thrice during pregnancy and once three months post partum. Fifty women without diabetes served as controls. The AASI and pulse pressure (PP) were computed from blood pressure recordings. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used for comparison between groups during and after pregnancy. Linear regression analysis was performed with AASI and PP as dependent variables and albuminuria and retinopathy as independent variables.
   Main outcome measures: AASI during diabetic pregnancy and association with microvascular disease.
   Results: Micro-or macroalbuminuria was present in 23% of the women and 58% had either simplex or proliferative retinopathy. The AASI was inversely associated with the coefficient of determination, which means that the stiffer vascular wall the more random variability in BP.
   Conclusion: AASI showed a strong association with microvascular disease during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes. Together with the flattened circadian rhythm this indicates a pregnancy-related functional change in the vascular bed.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain development underlies maturation of sleep patterns throughout childhood Intrautenne head growth-marker of early neurodevelopment-has not been associated with childhood sleep chatacteristics. We explored associations between ultrasonographic measures of prenatal and early postnatal neurodevelopment and childhood sleep.
   METHODS: A total of 6,808 children from a population based birth cohort (Generation R) were included. Head circumference (HC) and lateral ventricles size were assessed with mid and late-pregnancy fetal ultrasounds, and with carnial ultrasound 3-20 weeks postnatally. Mothers reported children's sleep duration at 2 and 3 years and sleep problems at 1 5, 3, and 6 years.
   RESULTS: Larger ventricular size, but not HC, was related to longer sleep duration at 3 years (beta = 0.06 h, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.02, 0.10 in late pregnancy and beta = 0.11 h, 95% CI 0.02, 0.20 in early infancy, mid-pregnancy parameters were unrelated to sleep duration). Larger HC in mid-pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk for being a "problematic sleeper" up to the age of 6 years (odds ratio (OR): 0.94, 95% Cl 0.89, 0.99). Consistently, children with larger HC in early infancy were less likely to be "problematic sleepers" at 3 and 6 years.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that variations in fetal and neonatal brain size may underlie behavioral expression of sleep in childhood Albeit small effect estimates, these associations provide evidence for neurodevelopmental origins of sleep.

ID HANSHIN-AWAJI EARTHQUAKE; TRAUMA; SURVIVAL
AB More than 6,000 people died in the Great Hanshin (Kobe) Earthquake in 1995, and it was later reported that there were around 500 preventable trauma deaths. In response, the Japanese government developed the helicopter emergency medical service in 2001, known in Japan as the "Doctor-Heli" (DH), which had 46 DHs and 2 private medical helicopters as of April 2016. DHs transport physicians and nurses to provide pre-hospital medical care at the scene of medical emergencies. Following lessons learned in the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, a research group in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare developed a command and control system for the DH fleet as well as the Disaster Relief Aircraft Management System Network (D-NET), which uses a satellite communications network to monitor the location of the fleet and weather in real-time during disasters.
   During the Kumamoto Earthquake disaster in April 2016, 75 patients were transported by 13 DHs and 1 private medical helicopter in the first 5 days. When medical demand for the DHs exceeded supply, 5 patients, 8 patients, and 1 patient were transported by Self-Defense Force, Fire Department, and Coast Guard helicopters, respectively. Of the 89 patients who were transported, 30 (34%) had trauma, 3 (3%) had pulmonary embolisms caused by sleeping in vehicles, and 17 (19%) were pregnant women or new-borns. This was the first time that the command and control system for aeromedical transport and D-NET, established after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, were operated in an actual large-scale disaster. Aeromedical transport by DHs and helicopters belonging to several other organizations was accomplished smoothly because the commanders of the involved organizations could communicate directly with each other in person within the Aviation Coordination Section of the prefectural government office.
   However, ongoing challenges in the detailed operating methods for aeromedical transport were highlighted and include improving shared knowledge and training across the organizational framework. These are particularly important issues to address given the Nankai Trough and Tokyo inland earthquakes that are predicted for the near future in Japan.

AB Aims: We examined prospective associations between pre-and-postnatal tobacco and cannabis exposure on child behavior problems from 2 to 3 years of child age, sex differences in these associations, and bidirectional associations between maternal postnatal substance use and child behavior problems across time.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 247 primarily young, unmarried, low-income, minority mothers and their children (97 prenatally exposed to tobacco and cannabis, 81 exposed to tobacco only, and 69 non-exposed). Mothers were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy, at 2, 9, 16 months, 2 and 3 years of child age.
   Results: Bivariate results indicated significant differences mainly for girls. Girls in the prenatal tobacco exposure group had higher internalizing problems compared to the other two groups, and higher attention and sleep problems at 3 years compared to the control group. Higher number of cigarettes per day during pregnancy was significantly associated with higher anxiety/depression and higher attention problems at 3 years, and the associations were stronger for girls compared to boys. In model testing controlling for prenatal exposure, results indicated bidirectional associations between behavior problems at 2 years and maternal postnatal cannabis use, such that higher cannabis use across the infant toddler period predicted higher behavior problems at 2 years, which in turn predicted higher cannabis use a year later.
   Conclusions: Results add to the literature on joint effects of tobacco and cannabis, highlight the importance of considering bidirectional associations between maternal substance use and child behavior problems, and indicate generally stronger prenatal tobacco exposure effects for girls.

AB Aim: To determine the effect of music on sleep-wake cycle (SWC) patterns in late preterm neonates.
   Methods: In a masked crossover study, infants between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks gestation were randomised to music exposure either during the first six or last six hours of a 12-hour observation period. SWC characteristics were determined by continuous amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) read by two coders masked to exposure sequence. Analysis was performed in paired comparisons. ANOVA was used to assess the effects of music exposure, period and crossover on SWC outcomes: (i) Burdjalov Scores (BS) during active sleep (AS) (ii) per cent and duration of quiet sleep (QS).
   Results: Thirty infants were studied. A total of 222 QS cycles (median seven per patient; range five to 12) were analysed. Music exposure was associated with higher BS (F = 10.60, p = 0.0019) in AS and decreased interruptions during QS. The advanced postconceptual age (PCA) SWC pattern during AS was equivalent to a one-week mean. Number, duration and ratio of QS cycles did not change with music exposure.
   Conclusion: Music exposure elicits an increasing PCA pattern in AS and fewer interruptions in QS. Music may benefit sleep in late preterm infants.

AB Aim: Gather 'proof-of-concept' evidence of the adverse developmental potential of cotinine (a seemingly benign biomarker of recent nicotine/tobacco smoke exposure).
   Methods: Pregnant C57 mice drank nicotine- or cotinine-laced water for 6 wks from conception (N-PRE = 2% saccharin + 100 mu g nicotine/mL; C-PRE = 2% saccharin + 10 mu g cotinine/mL) or 3 wks after birth (C-POST = 2% saccharin + 30 mu g cotinine/mL). Controls drank 2% saccharin (CTRL). At 17 +/- 1 weeks (male pups; CTRL n = 6; C-POST n = 6; C-PRE n = 8; N-PRE n = 9), we assessed (i) cardiovascular control during sleep; (ii) arterial reactivity ex vivo; and (iii) expression of genes involved in arterial constriction/dilation.
   Results: Blood cotinine levels recapitulated those of passive smoker mothers' infants. Pups exposed to cotinine exhibited (i) mild bradycardia - hypotension at rest (p < 0.001); (ii) attenuated (C-PRE, p < 0.0001) or reverse (C-POST; p < 0.0001) BP stress reactivity; (iii) adrenergic hypocontractility (p < 0.0003), low protein kinase C (p < 0.001) and elevated adrenergic receptor mRNA (p < 0.05; all drug-treated arteries); and (iv) endothelial dysfunction (N-PRE only).
   Conclusion: Cotinine has subtle, enduring developmental consequences. Some cardiovascular effects of nicotine can plausibly arise via conversion into cotinine. Low-level exposure to this metabolite may pose unrecognised perinatal risks. Adults must avoid inadvertently exposing a foetus or infant to cotinine as well as nicotine.

AB Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is an emerging concern, as it can adversely affect the development of the offspring brain. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of deprivation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the third term of pregnancy on the sleep-wake profiles of neonates in the Wistar rat model. Sleep-wake patterns were assessed through electrophysiological measures and behavioural observations during postnatal days 1-21 on pups born to REM sleep-deprived dams and control rats. Pups of REM sleep-deprived dams had active sleep that was not only markedly higher in percentage during all the days studied, but also had reduced latency during later postnatal days 15-21. Quiet sleep and wake periods were lower. These factors, along with less frequent but longer sleep-wake cycles, indicated maturational delay in the sleep-wake neural networks. The disruption of time-bound growth of sleep-wake neural networks was substantiated further by the decreased slope of survival plots in the sleep bouts. Examination of altered sleep-wake patterns during early development may provide crucial information concerning deranged neural development in the offspring. This is the first report, to our knowledge, to show that maternal sleep deprivation during pregnancy can delay and impair the development of sleep-wake profile in the offspring.

AB This was a retrospective case-control study in 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy and 75 women in the control group. Patients completed the questionnaire by Maurovich-Horvat etal. (J. Sleep Res., 2013, 22: 496-512). We personally interviewed 25 patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy using the administered questionnaire regarding conception, pregnancy, delivery, perinatal and breastfeeding periods. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy reported 59 pregnancies versus 164 in the control group. In 16 cases (27.1%), a disease before pregnancy was present compared with eight cases (4.9%) in the control group (P < 0.001); among them, extrinsic asthma was reported 11 times in the narcolepsy with cataplexy group (P < 0.005). Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy more often had a single pregnancy compared with controls (P < 0.05). Gestational diabetes was more frequent in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (P < 0.05). Induced deliveries were higher in controls (P < 0.009). No differences were found between the groups in terms of duration of pregnancies and complications during and after delivery, as during the puerperium. Neonates from patients had heavier birth weight (P < 0.015). The breastfeeding period was longer in patients (P < 0.01). Modafinil and methylphenidate were the drugs administered in six pregnancies. No significant differences in depression during pregnancy and during puerperium were found between patients and controls. This is the first case-control study in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy related to pregnancy, delivery, childbirth and puerperium. Data suggest that patients have pregnancy outcomes similar to controls. The prevalence of gestational diabetes was higher in women with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Caesarean sections, complications during delivery and normal perinatal period for infants were similar in both groups. Breastfeeding was longer in patients.

AB OBJECTIVES: Infants are at risk of overweight. Infant overweight predisposes child, adolescent, and adult to obesity. We hypothesized that parent education, initiated prenatally and provided in the home, would reduce the incidence of infant overweight at age 12 months.
   METHODS: Pregnant obese Latina women were recruited at Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and randomized to intervention versus control. Intervention subjects received home visits by trained Spanish fluent community health workers who provided counseling on infant growth, breastfeeding, nutrition, child development, sleep, physical activity, and safety. Promotoras did not visit the control subjects. A research assistant collected outcome data on all subjects.
   RESULTS: Compared to controls, parent education did not reduce infant overweight. infant overweight developed rapidly and was present in 46% of infants by age 6 months. Infants overweight at 6 months were likely to be overweight at age 12 months (r = 0.60, P < .0001). Overweight was more common in formula-fed infants at ages 6 months (P < .06) and 12 months (P = .005). Breastfeeding was less common in families with employed mothers (P = .02) and unemployed fathers (P < .01), but the father living with the mother at the time of the prenatal visit predicted successful breastfeeding at infant age 2 months (P < .003). Compared to formula feeding, overweight at age 12 months was 2.7 times less likely for infants breastfed for months (P = .01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The lack of success of the intervention may be explained in part by a high cesarean section rate in the intervention group, food and employment insecurity, and confounding by WIC breastfeeding promotion, which was available to all mothers. Breastfeeding was the most important mediator of infant overweight. The study supports efforts by WIC to vigorously promote breastfeeding.

   QUESTIONNAIRE
AB Emerging literature suggests that sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) worsens over the course of pregnancy and is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Earlier studies, using mainly snoring as a surrogate marker for SDB, have shown an increase in the prevalence of SDB during pregnancy compared with that in the pregravid state. More recently, prospective observational studies in which the investigators ascertained SDB by using complete polysomnography have shown a prevalence ranging from approximately 17% to 45% in the third trimester. Pregnancy itself can be associated with daytime hypersomnolence, so complaints of increasing fatigue and sleepiness during pregnancy are not specific for SDB. Moreover, snoring in isolation also has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for diagnosing maternal SDB. The indications for screening for SDB during routine obstetric prenatal visits are still unclear, but observational studies indicate that maternal SDB is linked with the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus. Some studies also have identified a relationship between maternal SDB and the delivery of infants who are small for gestational age. Aside from a few small interventional studies of CPAP in pregnant patients with gestational hypertension, little currently is known about whether treatment of SDB during pregnancy improves clinical outcomes for the mother and/or baby. Additional current knowledge gaps include elucidating underlying mechanisms of maternal SDB, determining optimal treatment strategies, and understanding the trajectory of SDB after delivery.

   COGNITION; AIRCRAFT; EXPOSURE
AB With rapid urbanization and life style changes, loud noise is omnipresent and has become a part of life. Indoor and outdoor environmental noise pollution have been documented as a serious health hazard with increasing adverse effects on fetus, infants, children, adolescents and adults. Noise induced hearing loss and non-auditory adverse effects due to noise pollution, are being increasingly diagnosed in all age groups including the fetus. Outdated motorized vehicles, machinery, increasing traffic, congested residential areas, crowded educational institutions and workplaces, unregulated commercial and industrial noise have become a source of noise pollution with long-term disability. Areas of noise pollution must be identified and corrective measures be taken. Toys, personal, domestic, commercial, industrial equipment should be within the safe sound intensity. Loudspeakers and vehicular horns should be banned except in emergencies. Nocturnal noise pollution must be avoided near residential areas as sleep disturbances have serious long-term health consequences. Pregnant women, fetus, newborns, infants and children are most susceptible to noise induced health hazards and should be given utmost protection. Educational institutions, workplaces, commercial and industrial areas should be regularly monitored for noise levels and protective ear muffs and plugs be used. Public be educated repeatedly regarding health hazards of noise. Traffic noise should be regulated to be within safe limits. Bus-stands, railway stations and airports should be moved away from residential areas. Houses should be sound proofed suitably. Long term studies should be conducted in pregnant women, newborn children and adults to have more data on hazards of noise pollution.

ID NEW-ZEALAND; HYPOXIA
AB AimSudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) rates for maori and Pacific infants remain higher than for other ethnic groups in New Zealand and bed-sharing is a major risk factor when there is smoking exposure in pregnancy. Sleep space programmes of education and Pepi-Pod baby beds require evaluation.
   MethodsTwo hundred and forty maori and Pacific women and infants were randomised 1:1, to the Pepi-Pod sleep space programme, or to a control group with usual care'. When infants were under 2 weeks of age, baseline interviews occurred, followed up by interviews at 2 and 4 months of age to assess safe sleep knowledge, infant care practices and Pepi-Pod use and acceptability. All participants were offered a New Zealand Standard approved portable cot.
   ResultsAt baseline, 25% of babies did not have a baby bed. Knowledge of smoking and bed-sharing as SUDI risks improved at follow-up in both groups. One quarter regularly bed-shared at follow-up in both groups. Intention to bed-share was a strong predictor of subsequent behaviour. Pepi-Pods were regularly used by 46% at 2 months and 16% at 4 months follow-up.
   ConclusionsBed-sharing and knowledge improvement were similar irrespective of group. It is likely that the impact of the intervention was reduced because the control group received better support than usual care' and all participants had a baby bed. New Zealand SUDI rates have declined since sleep space programmes have been available. Sleep space programmes should be prioritised for those with modifiable SUDI risk.

AB We examined the effect of chronic prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the process of adult neurogenesis in C57BL/6J mice at early adulthood (PND 56). Pregnant mice, and their in utero litters, were exposed to alcohol, through oral gavage, on gestational days 7-16, with recorded blood alcohol concentrations averaging 184 mg/dL (CA group). Two control groups, sucrose (CAc) and non-treated (NTc) control groups were also examined. The brains of pups at PND 56 from each experimental group were sectioned in a sagittal plane, and stained for Nissl substance with cresyl violet, and immunostained for Ki-67 which labels proliferative cells and doublecortin (DCX) for immature neurons. Morphologically, the neurogenic pattern was identical in all three groups studied. Populations of Ki-67 immunopositive cells in the dentate gyrus were not statistically significantly different between the experimental groups and there were no differences between the sexes. Thus, the PAE in this study does not appear to have a strong effect on the proliferative process in the adult hippocampus. In contrast, the numbers of immature neurons, labeled with DCX, was statistically significantly lower in the prenatal alcohol exposed mice compared with the two control groups. Alcohol significantly lowered the number of DCX hippocampal cells in the male mice, but not in the female mice. This indicates that the PAE appears to lower the rate of conversion of proliferative cells to immature neurons and this effect of alcohol is sexually dimorphic. This lowered number of immature neurons in the hippocampus appears to mirror hippocampal dysfunctions observed in FASD children.

AB Background: Underutilisation of antenatal care services due to intimate partner violence during pregnancy has been well documented elsewhere, but it is understudied in Nepal. Our study aimed at exploring the impact of intimate partner violence on antenatal care service utilisation in southern Terai of Nepal.
   Method: A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in 6 village development committees in Dhanusha district, Nepal. A total of 426 pregnant women in their second trimester were selected using a multistage cluster sampling method. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine the association between exposure to intimate partner violence and selected antenatal care services, adjusting for covariates.
   Results: Among 426 pregnant women, almost three out of ten women (28.9%) were exposed to intimate partner violence at some point during their pregnancy. Pregnant women who were exposed to intimate partner violence were less likely to: register for antenatal care (OR 0.31; 95% CI (0.08-0.50)), take iron and folic acid (OR 0.55; 95% CI (0.12-0.90)), report dietary diversity (middle vs low: OR 0.34; 95% CI (0.11-0.58) and high vs low: OR 0.18; 95% CI (0.08-0.37)), have rest and sleep during day time (OR 0.47; 95% CI (0.61-0.58)), and attend mother's group meetings (OR 0.29; 95% CI (0.10-0.83)).
   Conclusions: Intimate partner violence during pregnancyis associated with low utilisation of antenatal care services. Therefore, effective strategies to prevent or reduce intimate partner violence during pregnancy is needed, which maylead to improved antenatal care service utilization in Nepal with healthier mothers and children's outcome.

AB Pregnancy and postpartum are periods of high susceptibility to major depression (MD) and other mood disorders. The peripartum period is also a time of considerable changes in the levels of hormones, including cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, gonadotropins, and gonadal steroids. To investigate the relationship between mood and hormonal changes during and after pregnancy, we reviewed published reports of hormonal measures during this time frame, searched via PubMed and Web of Science. Studies were included if women in the antepartum or postpartum periods were clinically diagnosed with MD, and if there were repeated measures of cortisol, TSH, or prolactin. For these three hormones, the numbers of human studies that met these criteria were 15, 7, and 3, respectively. Convergent findings suggest that morning cortisol is reduced in pregnant and postpartum women with MD. Evidence did not support changes in TSH as a marker of MD during the peripartum period, and evidence for changes in prolactin in peripartum MD was equivocal. Aside from reduced morning cortisol in peripartum women with MD, definitive evidence for an association between specific hormonal fluctuations and mood disorders in the peripartum period remains elusive.

   RESEARCH; CROSSOVER TRIAL; TYPE-1; TECHNOLOGY; DELIVERY; ADULTS;
   ACCEPTANCE
AB There is a pressing need for new treatment regimens that enable improved glycaemic control and reduced diabetes self-management burdens. Closed-loop, or artificial pancreas, systems represent one of the most promising avenues in this regard. Closed-loop systems connect wearable continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors to smartphone- or tablet-mounted algorithms that process and model CGM data to deliver precise and frequently updated doses of fast-acting insulin (and glucagon in dual-hormone systems) to users via wearable pumps. Recent studies have demonstrated that closed-loop systems offer significant benefit in terms of improved glycaemic control. However, less attention has been paid to the psychosocial impact on users of closed-loop systems. This article reviews recent research on psychosocial aspects of closed-loop usage in light of preceding research on user experience of currently available technologies such as insulin pumps and CGM sensors. The small, but growing body of research in this field reports generally positive user experience and a number of experienced benefits including: reassurance and reduced anxiety, improved sleep and confidence, and time off' from diabetes demands. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by important challenges, ranging from variable levels of trust to concerns about physical bulk, technical glitches and difficulties incorporating closed-loop systems into everyday life. Future research should explore psychosocial aspects of closed-loop usage in more diverse groups and with regard to clinicians, as well as users, to ensure that the clinical benefits of closed-loop systems are realized at scale in routine medical care.
   What's new?
   Whereas most studies of closed-loop overlook psychosocial issues, there is growing recognition of the need to evaluate user experience of new diabetes technologies. This review evaluates research carried out on the psychosocial aspects of closed-loop system usage across paediatric, pregnant and adult populations, using qualitative and/or quantitative methodologies. Existing research identifies both benefits and burdens arising from the use of varied closed-loop systems. Future studies should be carried out with more consistent methodological rigour in addition to exploring psychosocial experiences in more diverse patient groups and in clinicians.

AB Women's sleep quality has been reported to change during pregnancy; prevalence estimates of poor sleep quality during pregnancy vary widely. To further understand the observed variation of findings, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Articles (N = 24) that reported prevalence of poor sleep quality as captured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) >= 5 were included, with a total of 11,002 participants contributing data. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched. Results indicated that the average PSQI score during pregnancy was 6.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.30, 6.85], and 45.7%, 95% CI [36.5%, 55.2%], of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality. Longitudinal studies indicated that sleep quality decreased from second (M = 5.31, SE = 0.40) to third trimester (M = 7.03, SE = 0.85) by 1.68 points, 95% CI [0.42, 2.94]. Gestational age moderated the average PSQI scores and prevalence of PSQI scores >= 5; older samples reported higher mean PSQI scores and higher prevalence of poor sleep quality. Clinicians should be aware that some reduction in sleep quality is expected during pregnancy, but complaints of very poor sleep quality could require intervention. Future research should examine various factors underlying poor sleep quality during pregnancy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a larger prospective cohort study, which will aim at determining the independent contribution of male and female lifestyle-related factors to assisted reproductive technology (ART) success. The study also examined whether couples seeking fertility treatments present lifestyle-related factors that may interfere with their reproductive health.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective pilot study was conducted in a fertility clinic between May 2015 and February 2016. Feasibility factors evaluated were recruitment rates, compliance with the protocol, retention rate and ART outcomes at six-month follow-up. Anthropometric profile and lifestyle habits of both partners were evaluated before the beginning of infertility treatments.
   Results: We approached 130 eligible infertile couples. Among them, 32 (25%) agreed to participate and 28 (88%) complied with the protocol. At six-month follow-up, seven couples (25%) did not start, or stop, infertility treatments and 13 couples (62%) achieved a clinical pregnancy. Among the 28 couples included in the analyses, 16% of the partners were obese and 23% had abdominal obesity. The majority of the subjects were still drinking alcohol (84%). Sixty-eight percent of women needed improvement in their diet (vs. 95% of men, P=0.05) and none of them achieved the Canadian recommendations for physical activity (vs. 33% of men, P=0.001). Moreover, 35% of the partners had a poor sleep quality. Overall, women presented a worse reproductive health profile than men, with 3.1 and 2.4 out of seven adverse factors, respectively (P=0.04).
   Conclusion: Conducting a large prospective cohort study in our fertility clinic will be feasible but recruitment and compliance with the protocol need to be improved. Many women and men seeking fertility treatments present unfavourable lifestyle-related factors that may explain, at least partially, their difficulties in conceiving.

AB &para;&para; BACKGROUND&para;&para; Anthropometric measures have been used for screening patients for cardiovascular abnormalities and metabolic syndrome since many years. The measurements generally used are height, weight, waist and hip circumference and their ratio and neck circumference. However, it might not be acceptable for all cultures to agree for such screening. Neck circumference could be an acceptable option for such patients, as it is considered as an index of upper body obesity and correlates positively with changes in blood pressure and other components of metabolic syndrome.&para;&para; MATERIALS AND METHODS&para;&para; The study was conducted on patients attending the outpatient department (OPD) for general health check-up at Yenepoya Medical College Hospital among 201 participants above 20 years of age and excluding cases with thyroid disorders, any neck surgery and pregnant women. Along with fasting lipid profile, neck circumference was measured in all the participants and parameters evaluated.&para;&para; RESULTS&para;&para; On analysis, we found a significant positive correlation between Neck circumference and Cholesterol in males and females with p<0.001 in males and p= 0.02 in females and significant positive correlation between Neck circumference and LDL in males with p<0.001.&para;&para; CONCLUSION&para;&para; Studies on similar lines are not available on Indian population. Neck circumference may be used as a simple and time saving screening measure to identify cardiometabolic risk factors like dyslipidaemia in patients.

AB Clock gene oscillations are necessary for a successful pregnancy and parturition, but little is known about their function during lactation, a period demanding from the mother multiple physiological and behavioral adaptations to fulfill the requirements of the offspring. First, we will focus on circadian rhythms and clock genes in reproductive tissues mainly in rodents. Disruption of circadian rhythms or proper rhythmic oscillations of clock genes provoke reproductive problems, as found in clock gene knockout mice. Then, we will focus mainly on the rabbit doe as this mammal nurses the young just once a day with circadian periodicity. This daily event synchronizes the behavior and the activity of specific brain regions critical for reproductive neuroendocrinology and maternal behavior, like the preoptic area. This region shows strong rhythms of the PER1 protein (product of the Per1 clock gene) associated with circadian nursing. Additionally, neuroendocrine cells related to milk production and ejections are also synchronized to daily nursing. A threshold of suckling is necessary to entrain once a day nursing; this process is independent of milk output as even virgin does (behaving maternally following anosmia) can display circadian nursing behavior. A timing motivational mechanism may regulate such behavior as mesolimbic dopaminergic cells are entrained by daily nursing. Finally, we will explore about the clinical importance of circadian rhythms. Indeed, women in chronic shift-work schedules show problems in their menstrual cycles and pregnancies and also have a high risk of preterm delivery, making this an important field of translational research.

AB Background: Postpartum is a period of unique psychosocial stress characterized by sleep disturbance, risk for depressed mood, and heightened parenting stress. However, data on effects of these exposures on inflammatory immune function are limited.
   Methods: This study examined associations among sleep, psychosocial stress (i.e., parenting stress, general perceived stress), mood (i.e., depressive symptoms), serum cytokine levels, and LPS-stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production among 69 women (32 African American, 37 White) assessed at 7-10 weeks postpartum.
   Results: No associations between behavioral measures and serum cytokine levels were observed among women of either race. In African American women, but not Whites, poorer sleep quality, greater parenting stress, and greater depressive symptoms were associated with greater LPS-stimulated IL-6 and IL-8 production (ps <= 0.05). Also in African Americans, greater general perceived stress was associated with greater IL-8 production, and greater depressive symptoms with greater stimulated TNF-alpha production (ps <= 0.05). Simple mediation models highlighted the bidirectional relationship between stress and sleep in relation to inflammation among African American women.
   Conclusions: Significant effects of both stress/distress and poor sleep quality on proinflammatory cytokine production during postpartum were observed uniquely among African American women. These data are consistent with an allostatic load model which predicts that conditions of chronic stress impart vulnerability to dysregulated responses to novel stressor exposures. The bidirectional nature of the stress-sleep relationship has clinical relevance. Studies examining whether interventions focused on one or both of these psychological factors during postpartum is beneficial for inflammatory profiles would be informative. In addition, examination of these models in relation to maternal health at postpartum, including delivery related wounds and other infections, is warranted.

AB Purpose: To investigate the association of sleep duration and quality at 12 months and myopia at 3 years.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Methods: The Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort recruited pregnant women at 2 major public maternity hospitals (n = 1236). We included 376 children of Chinese, Malay, and Indian ethnicity who had completed caregiver questionnaires on the child's sleep at 12 months of age [Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ)] and also completed cycloplegic autorefraction and eye axial length (AL) measurement at 3 years of age. Data on total sleep duration and number of night wakings were collected by BISQ. Univariable and multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, ethnicity, parental myopia, maternal education level, outdoor time, near work, and height) were used.
   Results: Thirteen (3.5%) participants were myopic and mean spherical equivalent (SE) was 0.89 diopters (D) (SD 0.88) at 3 years. Total sleep duration and number of night wakings at 12 months were not associated with SE at 3 years (P > 0.05). The total sleep duration (P = 0.07) and number of night wakings (P = 0.49) were not associated with AL in the multivariate model. Total sleep duration in tertile 2 was not associated with AL (P = 0.11) compared with tertile 1. Only total sleep duration in tertile 3 was associated with longer AL (P = 0.006), but there was no association with SE.
   Conclusions: Sleep duration and quality at 12 months of age were not associated with refractive error at 3 years.

DE birth cohort; selection; prevalence
AB In March 2016, the website of the NINFEA project (an Internet-based cohort set up to investigate the effects of exposures acting early in life) was enriched with the section "Data", which reports aggregated data for selected variables of the cohort. This article discusses the rationale for this new section, available data and their possible uses are described, and some results are compared with figures accessible from surveillance studies. The Italian birth cohort NINFEA includes 7,500 pregnant women, recruited through the Internet from 2005 to June 2016, and of their children, followed up with repeated questionnaires. Thus, the "Data" section is based on a selected population. Currently, this new section includes information on maternal lifestyles/ characteristics in pregnancy (e.g., alcohol, smoking, use of medications), child health (e.g., obesity, asthma symptoms, growth) and behaviours (e.g., sleeping patterns, being breastfed). Up to December 18th, 2017, its pages were visited 12,620 times. Prevalences for selected variables (e.g., pre-pregnancy body mass index, breast feeding, infant sleeping position) are similar to those reported by surveillance studies. Aggregated exposure and outcome data from large cohorts can be systematically made publicly available. These data may be of interest to the participants, to population subgroups whose characteristics are similar to the study participants, and to researchers and policy makers, whenever similar data are not available from population-based surveillance systems.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor disorder characterized by unusual, uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs. It is commonly associated with sleep disturbance and it may appear or worsen during the third trimester of pregnancy. RLS is experienced by one in four women during pregnancy and is associated with poor sleep, lowered quality of life and an increased risk of cesarean delivery. Review of the literature suggests that low serum levels of iron and ferritin, and a high level of estrogen may play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy. Exercise training and massage therapy are nonpharmacological interventions that can be safely applied to these patients. Studies including larger sample sizes need to be carried out to provide more information on the etiology and management of this condition.

ID SLEEP-WAKE IDENTIFICATION
AB Current actigraphic sleep/wake detection algorithms have predominantly been validated against polysomnography, although the accuracy of such validations is dependent on the degree to which the timestamps of these two methods of data collection are synchronised. We created and validated an algorithm to temporally align actigraphy and polysomnography data using a sample of 100 healthy young adults, recruited from a pool of participants in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Each participant underwent one night of polysomnography with simultaneous wrist actigraphy (Actigraph GT3X+). Our alignment algorithm incorporates the raw acceleration data and considers the best alignment when the sum of the products of acceleration and polysomnography values are maximised. Segments of the night of various lengths and locations were considered as input values in addition to several values for the maximum allowable discrepancy. The optimal input values were determined by comparing accuracies, sensitivities and specificities calculated from two commonly used sleep/wake classification methods, and then validated using a simulation study. Validation suggested that our alignment algorithm can successfully align polysomnography and actigraphy timestamps. This allows for more accurate and detailed actigraphic sleep/wake detection algorithms to be created, thus strengthening the use of actigraphy as an appropriate method for sleep detection.

AB Objective Skin-to-skin care (SSC) has proven benefits in preterm infants, but increased hypoxic and bradycardic events have been reported. This may make clinicians hesitant to recommend SSC as standard care. We hypothesised that regional cerebral oxygenation (rStO(2)) measured with near infrared spectroscopy is not worse during SSC compared with standard incubator care.
   Design Prospective, observational, non-inferiority study.
   Setting Single tertiary perinatal centre in Australia.
   Patients Forty preterm infants (median (IQR) 30.6 (29.1-31.7) weeks' gestation) not receiving respiratory support were studied on day 14 (8-38).
   Interventions Recordings during 90 min of incubator care, followed by 90 min of SSC. Each infant acted as their own control and caregivers were blinded to the rStO(2) measurements.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the mean difference in rStO(2) between SSC and incubator care. The prespecified margin of non-inferiority was -1.5%. Secondary outcomes included heart rate (HR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), time in quiet sleep, temperature and hypoxic (SpO(2) <80% for >5 s) or bradycardic events (HR < 80 bpm for >5 s) and time spent in cerebral hypoxia (rStO2 < 55%) and hyperoxia (rStO(2) > 85%).
   Results Mean (SD) rStO(2) was lower during SSC compared with incubator care: 73.6 (6.0)% vs 74.8 (4.6)%, mean difference (95% CI) 1.3 (2.2 to 0.4)%. HR was 5 bpm higher, SpO(2) 1% lower and time in quiet sleep 24% longer during SSC. Little evidence of a difference was observed in temperature. The number of hypoxic or bradycardic events as well as the proportion of time spent in cerebral hypoxia and hyperoxia was very low in both periods.
   Conclusions Mean rStO(2) was marginally lower during SSC without observed differences in hypoxic or bardycardic events but an increase in time spent in quiet sleep.

AB Objectives: We address questions about (1) how college women with a disability experience sexual violence (SV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) across partners, including disability-specific abuse and (2) how SV/IPV impacts psychological, behavioral, physical, and academic life domains. Methods/Design: Twenty-seven female college students (mean age, 21.2; 66.6% white; 66.6% heterosexual) were randomly sampled from university registrar records. To be eligible for the study, students had to have at least one experience of SV/IPV since age 18 and a disability (88.8% reported one or more mental health conditions; 11.1% reported other conditions, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder; with the majority of women indicating their disability preceded SV/IPV victimization). Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions of SV/IPV as guides, clinically trained master's level interviewers conducted semistructured interviews to ascertain SV/IPV patterns across students' three most recent relationships and related life impacts. Results: SV/IPV was pervasive in college women with a disability, within hookup settings and/or recurring SV/IPV with a long-term partner. For some women, SV spanned multiple abusive partners. For women in relationships marked by chronic abuse, in addition to SV, the relationship dynamic included disability-specific abuse, social isolation, threats/intimidation, and technology-related abuse. For women experiencing SV events within hookup settings, alcohol was a common facilitator, with some abusers using a disability to manipulate a sexual connection. All but one participant reported exacerbated adverse mental health consequences (e.g., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation/attempts, stress) after victimization. These adverse mental health consequences coincided with adverse behavioral (e.g., becoming less social, avoiding usual study lounge areas on campus), physical (e.g., problems sleeping, bruising, pregnancy concerns, and sexually transmitted disease), and academic outcomes (e.g., skipping and/or dropping class, grades suffering). Discussion: Our results underscore the need for continued investment in campus programs that improve response to SV/IPV, including prevention programs and support services tailored to the specific needs and vulnerabilities of women with underlying mental health conditions.

AB Background There is recent interest exploring the possible impact of sleep disordered breathing on the mechanisms of preeclampsia. A biomarker of preeclampsia, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, has come to prominence in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between continuous positive airway pressure treatment, sleep disordered breathing and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations during pregnancy.
   Methods A 38-year-old G1P0 presented at 20+5 weeks. She had a history of chronic hypertension. Sleep studies revealed she had sleep disordered breathing with an AHI of 7.3/h. She was commenced on continuous positive airway pressure. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations and blood pressure recordings were taken at various points during her pregnancy.
   Results She did not develop preeclampsia or require an escalation in her antihypertensives. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations rose 16% from a low baseline. She remained compliant with her continuous positive airway pressure. She progressed to birth a well, live, term baby.
   Conclusion Continuous positive airway pressure treatment controlled sleep disordered breathing in a high risk pregnant woman with chronic hypertension with no increase in soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 concentrations.

TI Causes of death and infant mortality rates among full-term births in the
   United States between 2010 and 2012: An observational study
SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; CHILD
AB Background
   While the high prevalence of preterm births and its impact on infant mortality in the US have been widely acknowledged, recent data suggest that even full-term births in the US face substantially higher mortality risks compared to European countries with low infant mortality rates. In this paper, we use the most recent birth records in the US to more closely analyze the primary causes underlying mortality rates among full-term births.
   Methods and findings
   Linked birth and death records for the period 2010-2012 were used to identify the state- and cause-specific burden of infant mortality among full-term infants (born at 37-42 weeks of gestation). Multivariable logistic models were used to assess the extent to which state-level differences in full-term infant mortality (FTIM) were attributable to observed differences in maternal and birth characteristics. Random effects models were used to assess the relative contribution of state-level variation to FTIM. Hypothetical mortality outcomes were computed under the assumption that all states could achieve the survival rates of the best-performing states. A total of 10,175,481 infants born full-term in the US between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012, were analyzed. FTIM rate (FTIMR) was 2.2 per 1,000 live births overall, and ranged between 1.29 (Connecticut, 95% CI 1.08, 1.53) and 3.77 (Mississippi, 95% CI 3.39, 4.19) at the state level. Zero states reached the rates reported in the 6 low-mortality European countries analyzed (FTIMR < 1.25), and 13 states had FTIMR > 2.75. Sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI) accounted for 43% of FTIM; congenital malformations and perinatal conditions accounted for 31% and 11.3% of FTIM, respectively. The largest mortality differentials between states with good and states with poor FTIMR were found for SUDI, with particularly large risk differentials for deaths due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (odds ratio [OR] 2.52, 95% CI 1.86, 3.42) and suffocation (OR 4.40, 95% CI 3.71, 5.21). Even though these mortality differences were partially explained by state-level differences in maternal education, race, and maternal health, substantial state-level variation in infant mortality remained in fully adjusted models (SIDS OR 1.45, suffocation OR 2.92). The extent to which these state differentials are due to differential antenatal care standards as well as differential access to health services could not be determined due to data limitations. Overall, our estimates suggest that infant mortality could be reduced by 4,003 deaths (95% CI 2,284, 5,587) annually if all states were to achieve the mortality levels of the best-performing state in each cause-of-death category. Key limitations of the analysis are that information on termination rates at the state level was not available, and that causes of deaths may have been coded differentially across states.
   Conclusions
   More than 7,000 full-term infants die in the US each year. The results presented in this paper suggest that a substantial share of these deaths may be preventable. Potential improvements seem particularly large for SUDI, where very low rates have been achieved in a few states while average mortality rates remain high in most other areas. Given the high mortality burden due to SIDS and suffocation, policy efforts to promote compliance with recommended sleeping arrangements could be an effective first step in this direction.

AB Objective: To evaluate prospectively the association between male sleep duration and fecundability.
   Design: Pregnancy Online Study (PRESTO), a Web-based prospective cohort study of North American couples enrolled during the preconception period (2013-2017).
   Setting: Not applicable.
   Patient(s): Male participants were aged >= 21 years; female participants were aged 21-45 years.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): At enrollment, men reported their average nightly sleep duration in the previous month. Pregnancy status was updated on female follow-up questionnaires every 8 weeks for up to 12 months or until conception. Analyses were restricted to 1,176 couples who had been attempting to conceive for up to six cycles at enrollment. Proportional probabilities regression models were used to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders.
   Result(s): Relative to 8 hours per night of sleep, multivariable-adjusted FRs for < 6, 6, 7, and >= 9 hours per night of sleep were 0.62 (95% CI 0.45-0.87), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87-1.30), 0.97 (95% CI 0.81-1.17), and 0.73 (95% CI 0.46-1.15), respectively. The association between short sleep duration (< 6 hours per night) and fecundability was similar among men not working nights or rotating shifts (FR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.88) and among men without a history of infertility (FR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.87) and was stronger among fathers (FR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.76).
   Conclusion(s): Short sleep duration in men was associated with reduced fecundability. Because male factor accounts for 50% of couple infertility, identifying modifiable determinants of infertility could provide alternatives to expensive fertility workups and treatments.

AB IntroductionLittle is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of certified nurse-midwives related to sudden infant death syndrome and infant safe sleep. However, this population is an important and trusted source of information for pregnant women and may provide guidance on infant care. We explored these topics with certified nurse-midwives to identify potential barriers as well as enabling and reinforcing factors associated with providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal health care environment.
   MethodsParticipants in this cross-sectional survey study were certified nurse-midwives who provide prenatal health care to women in Ohio. Surveys were mailed to all certified nurse-midwives listed with the licensing registry of the Ohio Board of Nursing (N = 333).
   ResultsA total of 153 eligible respondents completed the survey for a response rate of 55%. Most participants had at least some knowledge of the infant safe sleep recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and two-thirds had positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment. Many participants (61%) perceived that there were barriers to providing prenatal infant safe sleep education, but nearly all (94%) indicated that they were interested in providing this education to their patients. Positive attitudes about providing infant safe sleep education were predictive of whether they discussed this topic with their patients.
   DiscussionCertified nurse-midwives routinely provide guidance on infant care, and it is important that they are familiar with current evidence-based recommendations on infant safe sleep. They should be supported in their desire to provide infant safe sleep education to their prenatal patients. In addition, efforts should be made to improve attitudes and social norms related to providing infant safe sleep education in the prenatal environment.

AB Objectives Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been linked with ill-health in adulthood, but ACE literature has focused on family disruption or dysfunction (e.g., child abuse, parental separation), with less attention to economic adversity. We examined whether a mother's economic hardship in childhood (EHC) was associated with women's hardships and health-risk behaviors during/just before pregnancy. Methods We analyzed population-based survey data on 27,102 postpartum California women. EHC included respondents' reports that during childhood they/their families experienced hunger because of inability to afford food or moved because of problems paying rent/mortgage and the frequency of difficulty paying for basic needs. We examined six maternal hardships/behaviors during/just before pregnancy, including four hardships (poverty, food insecurity, homelessness/no regular place to sleep, intimate partner violence) and two behaviors (smoking, binge drinking). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated from sequential logistic regression models estimating associations between EHC (categorized by level of hardship) and each maternal hardship/behavior, first without adjustment, then adjusting for other childhood and current maternal factors, and finally adding family disruption/dysfunction. Results Before adjustment for family disruption/dysfunction, the highest and intermediate EHC levels were associated with each maternal hardship/behavior; after full adjustment, those associations persisted except with smoking. Higher EHC levels generally appeared associated with larger PRs, although confidence intervals overlapped. Conclusions for Policy/Practice These findings link childhood economic hardship with women's hardships, binge drinking, and possibly smoking around the time of pregnancy. Without establishing causality, they support previous research indicating that childhood economic adversity should be considered an ACE.

AB Study Objectives: In humans and other mammals, sleep is altered during pregnancy. However, no studies have been conducted on sleep/wakefulness during pregnancy in mice. In this study, we examined sleep/wakefulness in female C57BL/6 mice during pregnancy. We also examined sleep/wake behaviors in an animal model of preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertensive (PAH) mice, in which increased angiotensin causes hypertension.
   Methods: Sleep/wake behaviors of female C57BL/6 and PAH mice were examined based on electroencephalogram (EEG) or electromyogram recordings before, during, and after pregnancy. To examine whether high blood pressure disrupts the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in PAH mice, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (olmesartan)administered PAH mice and female Tsukuba hypertensive mice were also examined.
   Results: C57BL/6 mice showed a decreased total wake time and increased nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep time during late pregnancy. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time did not change during the course of pregnancy. PAH mice exhibited a general slowing of EEG during late pregnancy and subsequently returned to apparently normal sleep/wakefulness after delivery. All PAH mice exhibited multiple focal leakages of Evans blue dye in the brain. Spike-and-wave discharges were observed in 50% of PAH mice. Olmesartan-administered PAH mice did not show general slowing of EEG. Tsukuba hypertensive mice showed a normal time spent in wakefulness and NREM sleep and a decreased total REM sleep time.
   Conclusions: This study showed pregnant-stage-specific changes in sleep/wakefulness in C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, PAH mice may be useful as an animal model for eclampsia.

AB Study Objectives: Zika virus infection during pregnancy may result in congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), whose characteristics are being described.
   Methods: The aim of the present study was to investigate the sleep characteristics of 136 infants and toddlers (88 with CZS and 48 with typical development [TD], age and gender matched, 60% girls and 40% boys in both groups) using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. The ages of children in both groups ranged from 5 to 24 months (CZS 15.9 +/- 0.4 vs. TD 15.8 +/- 1.0 months, p = 0.90).
   Results: The results show that 34.1% of CZS and 2% of TD children were defined as poor sleepers, 15% of CZS and 2% of TD children remained awake at night for a period longer than 1 hr, and 24% of CZS and 2% of TD children slept less than 9 hr. The CZS group showed shorter total sleep time (CZS 11.24 +/- 2.6 vs. TD 12.02 +/- 1.9 hr, p = 0.03) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration than the TD group (CZS 8.2 +/- 0.2 vs. TD 9.4 +/- 0.2 hr, p = 0.0002). In contrast to the control group (p = 0.02, r = -0.34), in the CZS group, no correlation was found between age and nocturnal wakefulness. Future studies should explore these data in relation to the development and maturation of the central nervous system of these children.
   Conclusions: Considering the well-known consequences of poor sleep quality on health in several populations, the presence of sleep disorders should be considered in CZS using multidisciplinary treatments.

AB Introduction: We evaluated changes in placental and fetal hemodynamics in rodents during acute hypercapnia using BOLD-MRI and Doppler ultrasound.
   Methods: Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital and, in consecutive 4-min periods, breathed: air, 21%O2:5%CO2, and 95%O2:5%CO2. BOLD-MRI: Pregnant ICR mice (n = 6; E17.5) were scanned in a 4.7-T Bruker Biospec spectrometer. Placenta and fetal liver, heart and brain were identified on True-FISP images. Percent change in signal intensity (SI) were analyzed every 30 s from T2*-weighted GE images (TR/TE = 147/10 ms). Doppler: Pregnant Wistar rats (n = 6; E18-20) were anesthetized with pentobarbital and received abdominal Doppler ultrasound. Umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI) and fetal heart rate were assessed at baseline and after two minutes of both hypercapnic challenges.
   Results: BOLD-MRI: Normoxic-hypercapnia caused immediate marked reduction in SI in placenta (-44% +/- 5.5; p < 0.001), fetal liver (-32% +/- 6.4; p < 0.001) and fetal heart (-53% +/- 9.9; p < 0.001) but only minor changes in fetal brain (-13% +/- 3.4; p < 0.01), suggesting fetal brain sparing. Doppler: Normoxic-hypercapnia caused a marked increase in umbilical artery PI (+27.4% +/- 7.2; p < 0.001) and a reduction in fetal heart rate (-48 bpm; 95% CI -9.3 to -87.0; p = 0.02), suggesting acute fetal asphyxia.
   Conclusions: Brief maternal hypercapnic challenge caused BOLD-MRI changes consistent with acute placental and fetal hypoperfusion with fetal brain sparing. The same challenge caused increased umbilical artery PI and fetal bradycardia on Doppler ultrasound, suggestive for acute fetal asphyxia. BOLD-MRI may be a suitable noninvasive imaging strategy to assess placental and fetal organ hemodynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oxidative stress caused by intermittent hypoxemia and reoxygenation may impact pregnancy health. We hypothesize that pregnant women with OSA have a pronounced oxidative stress profile.
   A case-control study was performed to study oxidative stress markers in the serum of pregnant women with or without OSA. Patients with OSA were identified between 2003 and 2009. Contemporaneous controls were pregnant subjects without apnea, gasping, or snoring around the time of delivery. Serum markers of oxidative and carbonyl stress were measured by spectrophotometric/fluorometric methods. Multiple linear regression analysis was used with a model including age, body mass index at delivery, history of diabetes, and gestational age.
   Serum samples from 23 OSA cases and 41 controls were identified. Advanced oxidation protein products, a marker for oxidative stress, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a marker for carbonyl stress, were significantly lower in women with OSA than in controls (p value < 0.0001). Total antioxidant capacity was higher in women with OSA in comparison to controls (p value < 0.0001). The difference in AGEs remained significant even after adjusting for confounders.
   Contrary to our hypothesis, the results of this study suggest that pregnant women with OSA have higher antioxidant capacity and lower oxidative and carbonyl stress markers compared to controls, suggesting a possible protective effect of intermittent hypoxia. Whether OSA in pregnancy impacts oxidative stress differently than OSA in the general population remains to be confirmed.

AB Objectives: The prevalence of RLS in pregnancy is higher when compared with the general population however it remains unknown among indigenous black Africans. Available data indicate that RLS is uncommon in sub-Saharan Africa. We embarked on this study to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in an antenatal clinic sample of Nigerian pregnant women compared with a primary care sample of non-pregnant women.
   Methods: A total of 310 pregnant women and non-pregnant women filled out a questionnaire which incorporated the 2014 minimal criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Demographic and clinical data, including sleep duration and samples for blood hemoglobin concentration and urinalysis were obtained.
   Results: The mean ages of the pregnant and non-pregnant women were 24.9 +/- 5.6 years and 23.6 thorn 5.4 years, respectively (p = 0.003). There was no case of RLS found among pregnant women while five (1.6%) of the non-pregnant women fulfilled the criteria for RLS. Overall, the prevalence report of RLS symptoms was associated with lower mean habitual nocturnal sleep duration (p < 0.05) coffee (p = 0.013) and kola nut (0.023) consumption, report of leg cramps (p < 0.001) and proteinuria (p = 0.047), Report of leg cramps and proteinuria were independently associated with RLS.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of restless legs syndrome is low among women of child-bearing age in the Nigerian population and may be lower in pregnancy. Report of leg cramps and proteinuria are independently associated with RLS. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Noise pollution due to road traffic is a potential threat to human health. Since it is a global hazard, the rapid urbanization and exponential traffic growth have aggravated the problem. Population residing along the busy traffic lanes is continuously exposed to the sound levels which are above the permissible limits. This constant exposure to noise pollution is a cause of concern as it leads to several adverse impacts on human health. Traffic noise causes irritation and annoyance, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular disease, risk of stroke, diabetes, hypertension and loss of hearing. It results in decreased work performance. The present review highlights the serious health hazards of road traffic noise (RTN) which needs to be curbed. Preventive measures of noise pollution can help in combating noise-induced health hazards and increased work performance.

AB Background: Although the association between lead exposure and children's neurodevelopment has been studied, gender differences remain to be investigated. We examined the effects of lead exposure on the neurobehavioral development of 5-year-old children to identify the vulnerable time window of exposure and potential gender difference.
   Method: A total of 1751 pregnant women and children participated in the prospective birth cohort study, Mothers and Children's Environmental Health study, since 2006. Lead levels were measured in the maternal blood in early and late pregnancies, in cord blood at birth, and in 2-, 3-, and 5-year-old children's blood. The behavior of 575 children aged 5 years were assessed using the Korean Child Behavior Checklist. The association between the blood lead level at each time window and behavior was examined using a generalized linear model adjusted for potential confounders and covariates.
   Results: Lead levels at late pregnancy were significantly associated with increased risk of behavioral problems in males. Lead levels in 2- and 5-year-old children's blood significantly increased behavioral risks in females: for a 1-mu g/dL increase in blood lead levels, the score for total behavioral problems increased by 3.00 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-5.45) during the late pregnancy in males, whereas it increased by 3.82 (95% CI: 1.25-6.39) at 2 years and by 5.72 ( 95% CI: 0.44-10.99) at 5 years in females with a stronger effect in attention and sleep problems.
   Conclusion: Effects of lead toxicity on children's neurobehavioral development showed gender differences. Males were more susceptible to prenatal exposure, while females were more susceptible to postnatal exposure with stronger effects in attention and sleep problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Chronic maternal stress during pregnancy can have long-term, detrimental consequences for the offspring. An understanding of the mechanisms responsible for mediating these effects is essential for devising therapeutic interventions. Here, we examined whether serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) mediates the effects of maternal stress on the behavioral outcomes of the offspring as adults. Heterozygous (HET) mouse dams were bred with HET males and were randomly assigned to stress or control groups. Pregnant dams in the stress group were exposed to a regime of chronic unpredictable stress from embryonic day 7 to 18. At two months of age, groups of male and female wildtype (WT), HET, and knockout (KO) offspring underwent a comprehensive behavioral test battery that included tests of social behavior, memory, aggression, anxiety, sensorimotor information processing, and exploratory and risk assessment behaviors. Independent of genotype, prenatal stress resulted in a change in locomotor activity and fear memory in male mice and a change in prepulse inhibition in female animals. 5-HT1AR KO affected anxiety in male mice, and fear memory and prepulse inhibition in female mice. 5-HT1AR genotype moderated the effects of maternal prenatal stress exposure on social behavior of male offspring and on activity levels of female offspring. Our findings indicate that 5-HT1A receptor availability can affect outcomes of the offspring resulting from maternal prenatal stress exposure, and that these effects are sex-specific. (C) 2017 IBRO.

AB Objective: To quantify insomnia and their components in a longitudinal cohort of pregnant women and factors associated with insomnia.
   Study design: A prospective cohort of 486 healthy singleton pregnancies assembled before the 14th gestational week (February 2013 to March 2016). Insomnia data were collected pre-gestationally, in each trimester and six months post-partum, analysing five different moments. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to generate adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of determinants of insomnia in each trimester, defined using Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) as score >= 8.
   Results: Insomnia prevalence was 6.1% (3.9-8.9) pre-gestational, 44.2% (39.3-49.6) in first trimester (T1), 46.3% (41.9-51.3) in second (T2) and 63.7% (57.7-67.8) in third trimester (T3). Post-gestational insomnia was 33.2% (28.2-37.9) (p < 0.001 pre-gestational vs T1, T2 vs T3 and T3 vs after pregnancy). There was worsening mean AIS score, from: 2.34 before pregnancy to 9.87 in T3 because the deterioration of nighttime sleep, in absolute terms, but daytime impact was higher in T1. Previous trimester insomnia was associated with insomnia in T2 (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI 2.78-6.37) and T3 (aOR = 4.43, 95% Cl 2.77-7.08). Pre-gestational insomnia was determinant of insomnia in T1 (aOR 12.50, 95% Cl 3.58-43.60) and obesity was associated with insomnia in T3 (aOR = 2.30, 95% Cl 0.99-5.32). On the contrary, moderate physical activity reduced the odds of insomnia in T3 (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.40-1.03).
   Conclusions: Insomnia prevalence was high from the beginning of pregnancy, associated with pre-gestational insomnia. In late pregnancy, two out of three pregnant women suffering insomnia. Insomnia prevention should be targeted particularly to those with high body mass index and pre-gestational insomnia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sex-bias in gene expression is a widespread mechanism for controlling the development of phenotypes that differ between males and females. Most studies on sex-bias in gene expression have focused on species that exhibit traditional sex-roles (male-male competition and female parental care). By contrast the Syngnathid fishes (sea horses, pipefish, and sea dragons) are a group of organisms where many species exhibit male brooding and sex role reversal (female-female competition for mates and paternal parental care), and little is known about how patterns of sex-bias in gene expression vary in species with sex-role reversal. Here we utilize RNA-seq technology to investigate patterns of sex-bias in gene expression in the brain tissue of the Gulf Pipefish (Syngnathus scovelli) a species that exhibits sex-role reversal. Gene expression analysis identified 73 sex-biased genes, 26 genes upregulated in females and 47 genes upregulated in males. Gene ontology analysis found 52 terms enriched for the sex-biased genes in a wide range of pathways suggesting that multiple functions and processes differ between the sexes. We focused on two areas of interest: sex steroids/hormones and circadian rhythms, both of which exhibited sex-bias in gene expression, and are known to influence sexual development in other species. Lastly, the work presented herein contributes to a growing body of genome data available for the Syngnathids, increasing our knowledge on patterns of gene expression in these unusual fishes.

AB The in utero environment is inherently rhythmic, with the fetus subjected to circadian changes in temperature, substrates, and various maternal hormones. Meanwhile, the fetus is developing an endogenous circadian timing system, preparing for life in an external environment where light, food availability, and other environmental factors change predictably and repeatedly every 24 h. In humans, there are many situations that can disrupt circadian rhythms, including shift work, international travel, insomnias, and circadian rhythm disorders (e. g., advanced/delayed sleep phase disorder), with a growing consensus that this chronodisruption can have deleterious consequences for an individual's health and well-being. However, the impact of chronodisruption during pregnancy on the health of both the mother and fetus is not well understood. In this review, we outline circadian timing system ontogeny in mammals and examine emerging research from animal models demonstrating long-term negative implications for progeny health following maternal chronodisruption during pregnancy.

AB Background: There appears to be a chasm between idealised motherhood and reality, and for women who experience birth trauma this can be more extreme and impact on mental health. Australia is unique in providing residential parenting services to support women with parenting needs such as sleep or feeding difficulties. Women who attend residential parenting services have experienced higher rates of intervention in birth and poor perinatal mental health but it is unknown how birth trauma may impact on early parenting.
   Aims and objectives: This study aims to explore the early parenting experiences of women who have accessed residential parenting services in Australia and consider their birth was traumatic.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with eight women across Australia who had experienced birth trauma and accessed residential parenting services in the early parenting period. These interviews were conducted both face to face and over the telephone. The data was analysed using thematic analysis.
   Findings: One overarching theme was identified: "The Perfect Storm of Trauma" which identified that the participants in this study who accessed residential parenting services were more likely to have entered pregnancy with pre-existing vulnerabilities, and experienced a culmination of traumatic events during labour, birth, and in the early parenting period. Four subthemes were identified: "Bringing Baggage to Birth", "Trauma through a Thousand Cuts", "Thrown into the Pressure Cooker", and "Trying to work it all out".
   Conclusion: How women are cared for during their labour, birth and postnatal period impacts on how they manage early parenthood. Support is crucial for women, including practical parenting support, and emotional support by health professionals and peers. (c) 2018 Australian College of Midwives. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI The influence of physical activity in water on sleep quality in pregnant
   women: A randomised trial

ID INTERNATIONAL SURVEY; DISTURBANCES; DISORDERS; OVERWEIGHT; INDEX
AB Introduction: Sleep is a physiological state of self-regulation. The international classification of sleep disorders now includes as a new category those occurring during pregnancy. Regular physical activity is known to improve the quality of life, one aspect of which is sleep quality. During pregnancy, physical activity is decreased but should not be eliminated, as studies have reported a high correlation between sleep disorders and the absence of physical activity. Regular physical exercise during pregnancy, whether performed in water or out of it, provides greater control of gestational weight gain. Furthermore, the reduced weight gain during pregnancy, as a result of physical exercise, is associated with greater physical resistance to the demands of childbirth, combats the fatigue caused by pregnancy and reduces back pain. All of these outcomes tend to enhance sleep quality, among other beneficial effects.
   Objective: To determine whether, in pregnant women, there is an association between moderate-intensity physical activity in an aquatic environment and sleep quality.
   Material and methods: A randomised clinical trial was conducted with a sample of 140 pregnant women aged 21-43 years, divided into two groups; Intervention Group and Control Group. The women were recruited in the twelfth week of gestation and took part in the [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy programme from week 20 to week 37. Sleep quality was evaluated in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire.
   Results: The Mann-Whitney U test showed that the results obtained were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In the Intervention Group, 44 of the women (65.67%) were classified as "poor sleepers" versus 62 women (92.54%) in the Control Group.
   Conclusions: The [Study of] Water Exercise in Pregnancy method improves the quality of sleep in pregnant women, both subjectively and in terms of latency, duration and efficiency. (c) 2017 Australian College of Midwives. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Study Objectives: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) occurs in up to 10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of prematurity and neurodevelopmental impairment. FGR also alters sleep-state distribution in utero and maturation in infancy. Currently, limited data on the long-term associations of FGR and childhood sleep exist. Accordingly, we assessed the associations between preterm birth and FGR and sleep in children aged 5-12 years.
   Methods: Seventeen children born preterm and FGR, 15 children born preterm but appropriately grown (appropriate birth weight for gestational age [AGA]), and 20 term AGA children (controls) were studied using overnight polysomnography. Sleep macroarchitecture was assessed using standard criteria, and sleep microarchitecture was assessed using spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram (C4-M1) with total, delta(0.5-3.9 Hz), theta(4.0-7.9Hz), alpha(8.0-11.9 Hz), sigma(12.0-13.9 Hz), and beta power (14.0-30 Hz) calculated.
   Results: For sleep macroarchitecture, preterm FGR children had higher N2% compared with term AGA children (p<.05). Preterm AGA children had reduced total sleep time, NREM%, and sleep efficiency compared with term AGA children (p<.05 for all). For sleep microarchitecture, preterm FGR children had a higher amount of total, d and a power compared with both groups (p<.05). Sigma and beta power was lowest in the preterm AGA group compared with both groups (p <.05 for both).
   Conclusions: Prematurity and FGR were associated with altered sleep macro-and microarchitecture measures indicative of reduced sleep quantity and quality in childhood. As sleep disturbance can affect both behavior and neurodevelopment in children, sleep in FGR and preterm children warrants further investigation.

AB Background and aims: The ideal cardiovascular health (iCVH) construct consists of 4 health behaviors (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) and 3 health factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose). A greater number of iCVH components in adolescence are related to better cardiovascular health, but little is known about the correlates of iCVH in adolescents. Thus, the aim of the study was to examine correlates of iCVH in European adolescents.
   Methods and results: The study comprised 637 European adolescents with complete iCVH data. Participants were part of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a cross-sectional, multicenter study conducted in 9 different European countries. Correlates investigated were sex and age, family affluence scale, maternal education, geographic location, sleep time, television viewing, duration of pregnancy, birth weight and breastfeeding. Younger adolescents, those whose mothers had medium/high education or those whowatched television less than 2 h per day had a greater number of iCVH components compared to those who were older, had a mother with low education or watched television 2 h or more daily (P <= 0.01).
   Conclusion: Since in our study older adolescents had worse iCVH than younger adolescents, early promotion of cardiovascular health may be important. Future studies mayalso investigate the usefulness of limiting television viewing to promote iCVH. Finally, since adolescents of mothers with low education had poorer iCVH, it may be of special interest to tailor public health promotion to adolescents from families with low socioeconomic status.

AB Objective: Childhood trauma is associated with negative perinatal health outcomes including mood disorders and shorter gestation. However, effects of early life exposures on maternal biology are poorly delineated. This study examined associations between childhood trauma and inflammation, as well as the mediating role of obesity in this relationship. Method: This study examined a racially diverse sample of 77 pregnant women assessed in early, mid, and late pregnancy. Assessments included the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, serum CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, and prepregnancy BMI. Results: Per linear mixed models, while no direct relationships were observed between childhood trauma with IL-6 or TNF-alpha, physical (95% CI: 0.007, 0.080) and emotional (95% CI: 0.005, 0.046) abuse as well as emotional neglect (95% CI: 0.010, 0.051) predicted elevated CRP. Effects remained after adjustment for race, income, education, smoking status, medical conditions, and depressive symptoms. PROCESS analyses showed BMI mediated the relationship between physical abuse and both serum CRP (95% CI: 0.014, 0.062) and IL-6 (95% CI: 0.009, 0.034). Conclusions: Exposure to childhood trauma, particularly emotional abuse, physical abuse, and emotional neglect, is associated with inflammation in pregnant women. Obesity served as 1 pathway by which physical abuse contributed to elevations in serum CRP and IL-6. Interventions targeting maternal obesity prior to pregnancy may help mitigate the effects of childhood trauma on perinatal health. These findings have relevance for understanding biological and behavioral pathways by which early life exposures contribute to maternal health.

AB Women with gestational diabetes (GDM) are a high risk group for early type 2 diabetes (T2D). Depression is a risk factor for T2D in the general population. We investigated in women after a recent pregnancy with GDM and without a clinical diagnosis of depression, whether mild to moderate depressive symptoms associate with pathologic glucose metabolism. In a cross-sectional analysis, we examined 173 women, 9 3 months after delivery with several psychopathological assessments, 5-point oral glucose tolerance test with insulin, anthropometrics, and laboratory chemistry. In a subgroup of 101 women, abdominal visceral fat was quantified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   A total of 22 women (13%) showed mild to moderate depressive symptoms, and the proportion of women with pathologic glucose metabolism (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or T2D) was higher in this group than in the women without depressive symptoms (59.1% vs. 33.1%, p = 0.018). Women with depressive symptoms also had higher body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, plasma leptin, plasma resistin, and abdominal visceral fat volume. Pathologic glucose metabolism (OR = 2.594, 95% CI: 1.021-6.592), systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.076, 95% CI: 1.027-1.128), and abdominal visceral fat volume (OR = 2.491, 95% CI: 1.142-5.433) remained, even after adjustment for BMI, associated with the presence of depressive symptoms.
   Taken together, we found depressive symptoms at a level not generally diagnosed in clinical practice in a subgroup of women with recent GDM. This subgroup also showed an unfavorable metabolic profile. Mild to moderate depressive symptoms may therefore help to identify this special subgroup.

AB Diurnal rhythms within the immune system are considered important for immune competence. Until now, they were mostly studied in humans and rodents. However, as the domestic pig is regarded as suitable animal model and due to its importance in agriculture, this study aimed to characterize diurnal rhythmicity in porcine circulating leukocyte numbers. Eighteen pigs were studied over periods of up to 50 h. Cosinor analyses revealed diurnal rhythms in cell numbers of most investigated immune cell populations in blood. Whereas T cell, dendritic cell, and eosinophil counts peaked during nighttime, NK cell and neutrophil counts peaked during daytime. Relative amplitudes of cell numbers in blood differed in T helper cell subtypes with distinctive differentiation states. Mixed model analyses revealed that plasma cortisol concentration was negatively associated with cell numbers of most leukocyte types, except for NK cells and neutrophils. The observed rhythms mainly resemble those found in humans and rodents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing evidence suggests a role for inflammation in neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous work in rodents has established that immune activation during critical developmental periods can cause phenotypes that reproduce core features of ASD, including decreased social interaction, aberrant communication, and increased repetitive behavior. In humans, ASD is frequently associated with comorbid medical conditions including sleep disorders, motor hyperactivity, and seizures. Here we use a 'two-hit' immune-activation paradigm to determine whether perinatal immune activation can also produce these comorbid features in mice. In this paradigm, we treated timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which simulates a viral infection, on gestational day 12.5 according to an established maternal immune activation regimen. A subset of the offspring also received a second 'hit' of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which simulates a bacterial infection, on postnatal day 9. At 6 weeks of age, mice were implanted with wireless telemetry transmitters that enabled continuous measurements of electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), locomotor activity, and subcutaneous temperature. Effects at 7 and 12 weeks of age were compared. Both prenatal Poly I: C and postnatal LPS produced changes in locomotor activity and temperature patterns, increases in slow-wave sleep, and shifts in EEG spectral power, several of which persisted at 12 weeks of age. Postnatal LPS also produced persistent increases in spontaneous bursts of epileptiform activity (spike-wave discharges) that occurred predominantly during sleep. Our findings demonstrate that early-life immune activation can lead to long-lasting physiologic perturbations that resemble medical comorbidities often seen in ASD and other neuropsychiatric conditions.

AB Purpose: To examine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in obstetric patients after intensive care discharge, with comparison to age-appropriate reference values from the general Finnish female population.
   Material and methods: Retrospective register-based study. Four multidisciplinary intensive care units at Finnish university hospitals participated.
   Results: A total of 291 obstetric patient were admitted to the ICU, of whom 114 (39%) completed follow-up measurements. At baseline (pre-intensive care admission), patients showed lower physical (mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort) and social (usual activities) dimensions compared to reference values. Baseline overall health status (EQsum) was lower than reference values. However EQsum increased over six months (mean, 0.907 to 0.946) such that follow-up values were similar to reference values. At follow-up, 18.4% of patients showed poorer HRQoL (mean, 0.764; range, 0.638-0.885) compared to reference values. Multiparous patients showed lower scores than primiparous patients. EQ VAS scores were lower at baseline, but increased over six months (72.12 to 87.5) such that follow-up values were similar to reference values.
   Conclusions: The baseline HRQoL of study population was lower than that of the general population, but after six months, the mean values were comparable to reference value. However, one in five patients still experienced impaired QOL at follow-up. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sudden unexpected perinatal collapse is a major trauma for the parents of victims. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is unexpected and mysterious death of an apparently healthy neonate from birth till 1 year of age without any known causes, even after thorough postmortem investigations. However, the incidence of sudden intrauterine unexplained death syndrome (SIUDS) is seven times higher as compared with SIDS. This observation is approximated 40-80%. Stillbirth is defined as death of a fetus after 20th week of gestation or just before delivery at full term without a known reason. Pakistan has the highest burden of stillbirth in the world. This basis of SIDS, SIUDS, and stillbirths eludes specialists. The purpose of this study is to investigate factors behind failure in control of these unexplained deaths and how research may go ahead with improved prospects. Animal models and physiological data demonstrate that sleep, arousal, and cardiorespiratory malfunctioning are abnormal mechanisms in SIUDS risk factors or in newborn children who subsequently die from SIDS. This review focuses on insights in neuropathology and mechanisms of SIDS and SIUDS in terms of different receptors involved in this major perinatal demise. Several studies conducted in the past decade have confirmed neuropathological and neurochemical anomalies related to serotonin transporter, substance P, acetylcholine alpha 7 nicotine receptors, etc., in sudden unexplained fetal and infant deaths. There is need to focus more on research in this area to unveil the major curtain to neuroprotection by underlying mechanisms leading to such deaths.

AB Maternal depression was recently conceptualized as a network of interacting symptoms. Prior studies have shown that low self-efficacy, as an index of maternal functioning, is one important source of stress that worsens depression. We have limited information, however, on the specific relationships between depression symptoms and self-efficacy. In this study, we used regularized partial correlation networks to explore the multivariate relationships between maternal depression symptoms and self-efficacy over time. Depressed mothers (n = 306) completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale at four time points, between four and eight weeks apart. We estimated (a) the network structure of the 20 CES-D depression symptoms and self-efficacy for each time point, (b) determined the centrality or structural importance of all variables, and (c) tested whether the network structure changed over time. In the resulting networks, self-efficacy was mostly negatively connected with depression symptoms. The strongest relationships among depression symptoms were lonely-sleep difficulties' and 'inability to get going-crying'. 'Feeling disliked' and 'concentration difficulty' were the two most central symptoms. In comparing the network structures, we found that the network structures were moderately stable over time. This is the first study to investigate the network structure and their temporal stability of maternal depression symptoms and self-efficacy in low-income depressed mothers. We discuss how these findings might help future research to identify clinically relevant symptom-to-symptom relationships that could drive maternal depression processes, and potentially inform tailored interventions. We share data and analytical code, making our results fully reproducible.

AB The widely used organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is often detected in food. CPF inhibits acetylcholinesterase and can modify muscle contractility and respiratory patterns. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to CPF on respiratory parameters and diaphragm contractility in 21-and 60-days old rats. Pregnant rats were exposed to oral CPF (1 or 5 mg/kg/day: CPF-1 or CPF-5 groups vs vehicle: controls) from gestation onset up to weaning of the pups that were individually gavaged (CPF or vehicle) thereafter. Two developmental time points were studied: weaning (day 21) and adulthood (day 60). Whole-body plethysmography was used to score breathing patterns and apnea index during sleep. Then, diaphragm strips were dissected for the assessment of contractility and acetylcholinesterase activity. Results showed that the sleep apnea index was higher in CPF-exposed rats than in controls. In adult rats, the expiratory time and tidal volume were higher in CPF-exposed animals than in controls. At both ages, the diaphragm's amplitude of contraction and fatigability index were higher in the CPF-5 group, due to lower acetylcholinesterase activity. We conclude that chronic exposure to CPF is associated with higher sleep apnea index and diaphragm contractility, and modifies respiratory patterns in sleeping juvenile and adult rats.

AB Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is present in various body fluids and originates mostly from blood cells. In specific conditions, circulating cfDNA might be derived from tumours, donor organs after transplantation or from the foetus during pregnancy. The analysis of cfDNA is mainly used for genetic analyses of the source tissue tumour, foetus or for the early detection of graft rejection. It might serve also as a nonspecific biomarker of tissue damage in critical care medicine. In kidney diseases, cfDNA increases during haemodialysis and indicates cell damage. In patients with renal cell carcinoma, cfDNA in plasma and its integrity is studied for monitoring of tumour growth, the effects of chemotherapy and for prognosis. Urinary cfDNA is highly fragmented, but the technical hurdles can now be overcome and urinary cfDNA is being evaluated as a potential biomarker of renal injury and urinary tract tumours. Beyond its diagnostic application, cfDNA might also be involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting the kidneys as shown for systemic lupus, sepsis and some pregnancy-related pathologies. Recent data suggest that increased cfDNA is associated with acute kidney injury. In this review, we discuss the biological characteristics, sources of cfDNA, its potential use as a biomarker as well as its role in the pathogenesis of renal and urinary diseases.

AB Background: Most studies regarding the relationship between binge eating disorder (BED) and depression have targeted obese populations. However, nurses, particularly female nurses, are one of the vocations that face these issues due to various reasons including high stress and shift work. This study investigated the prevalence of BED and the correlation between BED and severity of self-reported depressive symptoms among female nurses in South Korea.
   Methods: Participants were 7,267 female nurses, of which 502 had symptoms of BED. Using the propensity score matching (PSM) technique, 502 nurses with BED and 502 without BED were included in the analyses. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman's correlation, and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The proportion of binge eating disorder was 6.90% among the nurses, and 81.3% of nurses displayed some levels of depressive symptoms. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that age (40 years old and older), alcohol consumption (frequent drinkers), self-rated health, sleep problems, and stress were associated with self-reported depression symptoms. Overall, after adjusting for confounders, nurses with BED had 1.80 times the risk (95% CI = [1.41-2.30]; p-value < 0.001) of experiencing a greater severity of self-reported depression symptoms.
   Conclusions: Korean female nurse showed a higher prevalence of both binge eating disorder and depressive symptoms, and the association between the two factors was proven in the study. Therefore, hospital management and health policy makers should be alarmed and agreed on both examining nurses on such problems and providing organized and systematic assistance.

TI Vital Signs: Trends and Disparities in Infant Safe Sleep Practices -
   United States, 2009-2015
SO MMWR-MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPLEMENTATION; INTERVENTIONS; POSITION; SUDDEN
AB Introduction: There have been dramatic improvements in reducing infant sleep-related deaths since the 1990s, when recommendations were introduced to place infants on their backs for sleep. However, there are still approximately 3,500 sleep-related deaths among infants each year in the United States, including those from sudden infant death syndrome, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, and unknown causes. Unsafe sleep practices, including placing infants in a nonsupine (on side or on stomach) sleep position, bed sharing, and using soft bedding in the sleep environment (e.g., blankets, pillows, and soft objects) are modifiable risk factors for sleep-related infant deaths.
   Methods: CDC analyzed 2009-2015 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data to describe infant sleep practices. PRAMS, a state-specific and population-based surveillance system, monitors self-reported behaviors and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy among women with a recent live birth. CDC examined 2015 data on nonsupine sleep positioning, bed sharing, and soft bedding use by state and selected maternal characteristics, as well as linear trends in nonsupine sleep positioning from 2009 to 2015.
   Results: In 2015, 21.6% of respondents from 32 states and New York City reported placing their infant in a nonsupine sleep position; this proportion ranged from 12.2% in Wisconsin to 33.8% in Louisiana. Infant nonsupine sleep positioning was highest among respondents who were non-Hispanic blacks. Nonsupine sleep positioning prevalence was higher among respondents aged < 25 years compared with >= 25 years, those who had completed >= 12 years compared with > 12 years of education, and those who participated in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children during pregnancy. Based on trend data from 15 states, placement of infants in a nonsupine sleep position decreased significantly from 27.2% in 2009 to 19.4% in 2015. In 2015, over half of respondents (61.4%) from 14 states reported bed sharing with their infant, and 38.5% from 13 states and New York City reported using any soft bedding, most commonly bumper pads and thick blankets.
   Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Improved implementation of the safe sleep practices recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics could help reduce sleep-related infant mortality. Evidence-based interventions could increase use of safe sleep practices, particularly within populations whose infants might be at higher risk for sleep-related deaths.

AB Background: Health professionals may advise women to either stop breastfeeding or drug treatment due to restrictive advice in drug monographs. Regional medicines information and pharmacovigilance centres in Norway (RELIS) provide free and industry-independent answers to questions about drugs and breastfeeding documented in a full-text, searchable database (RELIS database). We used the RELIS database to describe which health care practitioners sought information about medication safety in lactation, most common drugs involved, advice provided and which resources were used to provide the advice.
   Methods: A random selection of 100 question-answer pairs (QAPs) from the RELIS database indexed with "BREASTFEEDING" in the period from January 2011 to December 2015 was analysed. Inclusion criteria were queries from health professionals about drugs. Questions about herbal supplements and other exposures not classified as drugs were excluded. The QAPs were manually analysed for compatibility of one or several drugs with breastfeeding, health care profession and workplace of enquirer in addition to advice and search strategy used.
   Results: In the 100 QAPs there were enquires about 152 drugs. Seventy-four questions concerned a single drug, but the number of drugs evaluated varied between 1 and 16. Fifty-nine questions were from physicians, 34 from nurses or midwives, two from pharmacists and two from other health professionals. Questions from physicians contained 93 drug evaluations (61%), nurses or midwives 47 (31%) and pharmacists seven (5%). The most frequent categories of drugs were antidepressants, antiepileptics and immunosuppressants. The most asked about drugs were lamotrigine, codeine, quetiapine and escitalopram. Fifty-nine percent of the drugs were deemed safe while breastfeeding, 16% if precautions were taken and 12% not recommended. Thirty-nine percent of the drug evaluations used an advanced literature search strategy, and this was significantly (p < 0.05) more likely when the enquirer was a physician.
   Conclusions: This analysis of questions to Norwegian medicines information centres about medicine use in breastfeeding indicates the need for communication about safety of drugs affecting the nervous system, primarily to medical doctors and midwives. In the majority of cases the medicine information centre can reassure about the safety of breastfeeding while taking a drug.

   SYMPTOMS
AB Background: The first months after birth can be challenging for parents, leading to parental distress and decreased well-being. Parents with high levels of distress are found to respond less adequately and sensitively to their infant, which in turn affects infant well-being and health. The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and enhance the quality of caregiving and infant well-being. In contrast to other interventions, this intervention will be (1) offered already before birth, (2) offered to all parents-to-be, regardless of their risk of postpartum distress, and (3) include fathers. The proposed study examines the effectiveness of this intervention on (1) parenting distress, (2) quality of caregiving, and (3) the infant's well-being.
   Methods/design: In this randomized controlled trial, 128 pregnant women and their partners will be recruited through midwifery practices and general media. Women with a complicated pregnancy, current psychopathology, insufficient Dutch language proficiency and without Internet access will be excluded. Parents will be randomized to either the intervention or a waitlist control group. The intervention consists of a booklet and video (offered prenatally), a home visit at 34-36 weeks of pregnancy and a telephone call 4 weeks after birth. Information and practical tools are provided on (1) sensitive responding and making contact with the baby, (2) crying, (3) feeding, and (4) sleeping. Assessments will take place at baseline (26-34 weeks of pregnancy), during the home visit (34-36 weeks of pregnancy), and 2, 6, and 10 weeks after birth. The control group will be offered the intervention after the end of the study. The primary outcome is maternal parenting stress. Secondary outcomes are: paternal parenting stress, parental well-being, quality of caregiving, and infant well-being and health.
   Discussion: The goal of this study is to test the effects of a psycho-educational prenatal parenting intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and to enhance well-being in both parents and infants. When the intervention appears effective it can be implemented broadly because of its low costs. It will make support available for a large number of parents and their children.

DE Narcolepsy; Pregnancy; L-Carnitine
ID CATAPLEXY
AB Narcolepsy type 1 is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep fragmentation, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and cataplexy. Stimulant medications such as modafinil and amphetamines are the first-line medications for treating sleepiness. However, the management of narcolepsy during special circumstances of life such as pregnancy is complex. MMDM is a 34-year-old female with Narcolepsy type 1 treated with modafinil (400mg/d) and citalopram (20mg/d). Before she become pregnant, modafinil and citalopram were replaced for L-Carnitine 510mg/d with good outcome. She underwent an usual pregnancy and was submitted to a term cesarean delivery without child-birth complications. This is the first description of oral L-Carnitine such an alternative to treatment narcolepsy type 1 during pregnancy. Treat these patients is not easy but care narcolepsy pregnant is a challenging even bigger. In a disease without many treatment options, L-Carnitine can be used to treat daytime sleepiness during pregnancy in narcolepsy.

AB Study Objectives: Few studies have objectively evaluated sleep characteristics during pregnancy or investigated the relationship between altered spectral electroencephalogram (EEG) bands and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The study aimed to describe changes in sleep as measured by polysomnography (PSG) and spectral EEG bands during pregnancy and to examine the relationship between delta power in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and SDB.
   Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective study. One hundred twenty-three women underwent full PSG in early pregnancy, and 97 repeated PSG in late pregnancy. Spectral analysis of the EEG in NREM sleep was performed. We used linear and logistic mixed-model regression to analyze the sleep measures and linear regression to explore the association between delta power and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) changes during pregnancy.
   Results: In late pregnancy, women had shorter sleep duration, poorer sleep efficiency, more awakenings, more stage N2 sleep, less slow wave sleep, less REM sleep, higher AHI, and higher periodic limb movement index compared to early pregnancy. The percentage of stage N1 sleep, sleep latency, REM sleep latency, and arousal index frequency did not change. Regarding EEG-spectra, delta and theta powers decreased, but beta-2 power increased during pregnancy. In multivariable analyses, greater reduction of delta power was associated with larger increases in AHI (beta [95% confidence interval] = -0.038 [-0.073, -0.002], P = .040). Estimates suggest that each one-unit increase in AHI reduces delta power by 4% in late pregnancy.
   Conclusions: PSG-measured sleep characteristics change during pregnancy. Delta power decreases when the severity of SDB increases during pregnancy.

AB Objective: Circadian rhythms are generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus and involve rhythmic expression of clock genes and proteins. This rhythmicity is transferred to peripheral tissues by neural and hormonal signals. Late pregnancy is considered a state of inflammation which impacts on peripheral tissues such as joints. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediates inflammatory and circadian responses through its p55 receptor (TNFRp55). Neuroimmunoendocrine interactions in joints have not been studied completely. The purpose of this study was to analyze these interactions, investigating the circadian rhythms of progesterone (Pg) and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the joints at the end of pregnancy (gestational day 18). Moreover, the impact of TNFRp55 deficiency on these temporal oscillations was explored. Methods: Wild-type and TNFRp55deficient (KO) C57BL/6 mice were kept under constant darkness in order to study their endogenous circadian rhythms. The expression of the clock genes Bmal1 and Per1 at circadian time 7 was studied by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in the ankle joints of nonpregnant and pregnant (gestational day 18) mice. In late pregnancy, Pg and the cytokines interleukin 17 (IL-17), IL-6, and IL-10 were measured in the joints throughout a 24-h period by radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: A significant increase in Bmal1 and Per1 mRNA expression was detected in the joints of pregnant KO mice. Furthermore, KO mice displayed a desynchronization of articular Pg and cytokine production. Conclusions: Our results show that TNF, via TNFRp55 signaling, modulates articular Pg and cytokine circadian rhythms in late pregnancy. These findings suggest a temporal neuroimmunoendocrine association in peripheral tissues in late pregnancy. (c) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB While prolactin is most well known for its role in lactation and suppression of reproduction, its physiological functions are quite diverse. There are many etiologies of hyperprolactinemia, including physiologic as well as pathologic causes. Physiologic causes include pregnancy, lactation, sleep-associated, nipple stimulation and sexual orgasm, chest wall stimulation, or trauma. Stress is also an important physiologic cause of hyperprolactinemia, and its clinical significance is still being explored. This review will provide an overview of prolactin physiology, the role of stress in prolactin secretion, as well as the general clinical approach to hyperprolactinemia.

AB Pregnancy is a physiological state during which the woman's body undergoes profound modifications. During this time, every woman must be nourished in such a way as to maintain herself in good health and at the same time allovt , the fetal tissues to form and develop in the best way.
   Proper nutrition is one of the fundamental prerequisites for the normal evolution of both pregnancy and fetal growth: the quantity and quality of food and drinks must be scrupulously controlled.
   Contrariwise, it is important to avoid the excess calories and macronutrients. In filet, during pregnancy, it may be just as harmful as their shortage, e.specially in overweight and obese women, jar which the risk of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, fetal growth disorders and preeclampsia increases.
   The pasta constitutes the foundation of the Mediterranean diet food. The dough can be seen, therefore, so it represents an excellent ally of the diet from a nutritional point of view. The nutritional values of the pasta change depending on the type, based on the fact that the dough is traditional or integral semolina. It also contains vitamin B and has an abundance of minerals, among which potassium.
   The pasta is an easily digestible food, ensuring energy ready to use (such as all carbohydrates); moreover, it possesses a great satiating power. In case of overweight, however, it is possible to reduce the number of carbohydrates in the diet, taking care not to make them ever miss.
   In conclusion, the consumption of pasta is very important during pregnancy: a diet without carbohydrates can be dangerous for all physiological pathways.

AB Objective: To determine the awareness, availability and use of ANC services among the pregnant women attending the emergency ward of SGRH. We also wanted to find out the adequacy of these services.
   Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the pregnant women attending the emergency department at SGRH. A total of 200 pregnant women participated and was convenient sampling was done. It was an anonymous survey and participation was voluntary. SPSS was used for data entry and analysis. For categorical data chi-square was used & for continuous data students t-test was used. All the tests were performed using alpha=0.05.
   Results: Data on antenatal care was collected from 200 pregnant women aged 11-50 years out of them, a majority of pregnant women, 160 (80%) were aware of ANC services but only 120 amongst them avail it. Majority of those women 180 (93%) were housewives belonging to low socioeconomic status. 93(46.5%) of the respondents have the parity of 2-3 & 75% visited ANC clinic in their 3rd trimester with major complication of Hypertension & other mentioned diseases. Out of the sample of 200, 90 (45%) of them attended the ANC before 7 weeks majority having their first contact with a general practitioner while 71 (35.5%) of the women visited for more than 4 times. Services and investigations were adequately provided however health education about prevention against malaria & dengue (40.5%), proper sleep (21.5%), weight gain during pregnancy (20.5%), avoiding smoking (14.5%), use of contraceptive methods after delivery (20.5%) and labor (18%) was confined to very low proportion of pregnant women. Majority 170 (85%) of women think that ANC were beneficial for them.
   Conclusion: Cultural and traditional practices often influence negatively, the attitude of pregnant women in Pakistan. Despite the high rate of awareness of the existence and importance of ANC services the women think that they really don't need it. Other women have issues like lack of availability of transport as well as absence of such a center nearby. Majority of the women suffer from preventable diseases but because of lack of health education & it's implementation they have to face complications endangering lives of both mother & child. The findings of this study provide insights for planning & implementing appropriate antenatal health education programs in order to improve the health & wellbeing of mother & child.

AB It is a fact that parental care has become a standard routine in the cases of pregnancy from the earliest settings of twentieth century. Several modifications have been made since then. Its effectiveness was given due consideration and considerable attention. Parental care has evolved much because of numerous impacts on its evaluation. At first attempt it was limited to pre-natal care programs only but latest developments inthis regard have gone further. Outcomes are different from traditional findings and results. Other outcomes are also in question to other researchers and their studies. Certain regular and continuous expansion is also observed inthis regard. This impact has specially affected the duration of postpartum. These requests have prompted the in-hand researchstudy. It is therefore, the research aims at the examination of pre-natal impact on post-partum childcare. It also aims at the identification of the information sources linked with the mothers in the cases pf pre-natal availability. In this research information is gathered regarding child birth, pregnancy and post-partum. In this research, adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU) index is utilized for mother's classification for various pre-natal care index levels. An analysis was carried out from the initiation of pre-natal care for an adequate use of post-partum care by mothers. Maternal works after the act of delivery include breastfeeding, complementary foods initiation, sleeping place of the child, sleeping position of infants, immunization of child. Maternal age and parity are potential hindrances in the relationship studying the outcome measures and pre-natal care. Pre-natal care has a role to play in the assessment of the outcomes of the research. Positive impact of breastfeeding, porridge, meat and cerealis significantly involved in comparison to formula milk, which has negative impact. Sleeping place and position of childand after delivery maternal work has no association in pre-natal care. Additionally, an important source is the system of the healthcare and education accessible to mothers regarding the core issue under discussion.

AB "Music of the Brain" is based on musical or music-like stimulation organized in close accordance with the biopotentials of a subject's brain. Initial studies of the "Music of the Brain" approach were analyzed and limitations were noted. To enhance the efficiency and usability of the approach, several combinations of music therapy with a neurofeedback technique - musical neurofeedback were developed. Enhanced efficiency of the approach has been shown for the correction of functional disturbances during pregnancy and for elimination of stress-induced states in high technology specialists. The use and advantages of musical neurofeedback technology for increasing human cognitive activity, correcting sleep disturbances, and treatment of disorders of attention were verified. After further development and testing the approach may be suited for a wide range of therapeutic and rehabilitation procedures in the public health arena.

AB Objectives Exposure to traffic noise and air pollution is suspected to increase susceptibility to viral infections-the main triggering factor for febrile seizures. No studies have examined these two exposures in relation to febrile seizures. We aimed to investigate whether exposure to road traffic noise and air pollution are associated with risk of febrile seizures in childhood.
   Methods From our study base of 51 465 singletons from a national birth cohort, we identified 2175 cases with febrile seizures using a nationwide registry. Residential address history from conception to six years of age were found in national registers, and road traffic noise (L-den) and air pollution (NO2) were modeled for all addresses. Analyses were done using Cox proportional hazard model with adjustment for potential confounders, including mutual exposure adjustment.
   Results An interquartile range (IQR) increase in childhood exposure to road traffic noise and air pollution was associated with an 11% [ incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.19) and 5% (IRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.07) higher risk for febrile seizures, respectively, after adjustment for potential confounders. Weaker tendencies were seen for pregnancy exposure. In models with mutual exposure adjustment, the estimates were slightly lower, with IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.00-1.16) and 1.03 (95% CI 0.99-1.06) per IQR increase in childhood exposure to road traffic noise and air pollution, respectively.
   Conclusions This study suggests that residential exposure to road traffic noise and air pollution is associated with higher risk for febrile seizures.

AB Objective/Background: Poor sleep quality is common in pregnancy and associated with increased psychological distress, which has adverse consequences for families. Emerging theory suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may help reduce cognitive and emotional reactivity to stressful events. The current study examines the effects of a mindfulness-based intervention on the relationship between poor sleep quality and increased depression symptom severity and perceived stress during pregnancy. Additionally, we explored the prevalence of poor sleep quality in this unique sample and the impact of intervention on sleep quality. Participants: Participants were 215 ethnically diverse, overweight and obese, predominantly low-income pregnant women drawn from a study examining the impact of an 8-week mindfulness-based program (Mindful Moms Training; MMT) to reduce excessive gestational weight gain, stress, and depression compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Methods: Participants reported global sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and perceived stress at baseline and postintervention. Results: Most participants (63%) were categorized as poor sleepers at baseline. MMT participants did not experience significantly greater improvement in sleep quality compared to TAU participants. Baseline poor global sleep quality predicted increased depression symptom severity for all participants. Baseline poor global sleep quality predicted increased perceived stress for the TAU group only; this association was not evident in the MMT group. Conclusions: Poor sleep quality is prevalent in overweight and obese predominantly low-income pregnant women. Poor sleep quality was associated with worsening psychological distress, but mindfulness training significantly attenuated the influence of poor sleep on perceived stress.

AB Introduction: The disorder insomnia represents a relevant and frequent condition in clinical care. Cognitive behavioral therapy of insomnia (CBT-I) is regarded as first line treatment. Pharmacotherapy can be considered if CBT-I is not available or effective. Therefore, pharmacological approaches for disturbed sleep are still among the most widely prescribed pharmacological treatments in clinical care.Areas covered: In this review, the authors highlight basic physiological pathways of sleep regulation to understand fundamental pharmacological principles of sleep medicine. Available guidelines and reviews are summarized and recommendations formulated regarding the use of benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines, and orexin receptor antagonists in insomnia disorder. Variations in the treatment of insomnia disorder in subpopulations with increased prevalence of sleep disorders - childhood, pregnancy and old age - are specified.Expert opinion: The well-established off-label use of hypnotic drugs should evocate a debate about a better alignment of clinical practice and scientific evidence and guidelines. Better understanding of sleep regulation could help in the development of completely new substance classes. Focusing subjective sleep disturbances, such as superficial sleep perception might help identify novel pathways.

AB In this study, we sought to investigate the effect of lifestyle and demographic factors on classic and functional semen parameters. Three hundred and twenty-eight subjects who underwent semen analysis were recruited. Routine SA, sperm vitality, acrosome reaction (AR) assay and sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) were analyzed. Demographic and lifestyle information, including (1) BMI, (2) current smoking and alcohol drinking frequency, (3) sleep habits, (4) daily fluid intake, (5) weekly meat intake, (6) sports frequency, (7) trouser cell phone use, (8) age, and (9) abstinence time, were collected. Generalized additive models were used to analyze the possible non-linear association. The results showed that total sperm count (TSC) was significantly associated with age (P = 0.001), abstinence time (P = 0.001) and daily coffee intake (P = 0.044). Semen volume was significantly associated with age (P < 0.001) and daily coffee intake (P < 0.001). Sperm concentration was significantly associated with abstinence time (P = 0.011) and average sleep duration (P = 0.010). Sperm motility was significantly associated with age (P = 0.002) and daily juice intake (P = 0.001). Total motile sperm count was significantly associated with age (P = 0.003) and abstinence time (P = 0.009). DFI was significantly associated with age (P = 0.002), irregular sleeping habit (P = 0.008) and abstinence time (P = 0.032). The percentage of AR sperm was significantly associated with daily juice intake (P = 0.013). In conclusion, DFI and TSC were the most sensitive semen parameters for demographic and lifestyle features, whereas age had more influence on semen parameters than other demographic and lifestyle features.Abbreviations: BMI: body mass index; SA: semen analysis; AR: acrosome reaction; DFI: DNA fragmentation index; GAM: generalized additive model; TSC: total sperm count; TMC: total motile sperm count; IUI: intrauterine insemination; SCSA: sperm chromatin structure assay; SD: standard deviation; IQR: interquartile range; CBAVD: congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens; NEQAS: national external quality assessment service; HTF: human tubal fluid; HSA: human serum albumin.

AB Obesity during pregnancy causes adverse maternal and fetal health outcomes and programs offspring for adult-onset diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Obesity also disrupts core body temperature (T-c) regulation in nonpregnant rodents; however, it is unknown whether obesity alters normal maternal T-c adaptations to pregnancy. Since T-c is influenced by the circadian system, and both obesity and pregnancy alter circadian biology, it was hypothesized that obesity disrupts the normal rhythmic patterns of T-c before and during gestation. Obesity was induced by cafeteria (CAF) feeding in female Wistar rats for 8 weeks prior to and during gestation, whereas control (CON) animals had free access to chow. Intraperitoneal temperature loggers measured daily T-c profiles throughout the study, while maternal body composition and leptin levels were assessed near term. Daily temperature profiles were examined for rhythmic features (mesor, amplitude and acrophase) by cosine regression analysis. CAF animals exhibited increased fat mass (93%) and associated hyperleptinemia (3.2-fold increase) compared to CON animals. CAF consumption reduced the average T-c (by up to 0.29 degrees C) across the estrous cycle and most of pregnancy; however, T-c for CAF and CON animals converged toward the end of gestation. Obesity reduced the amplitude of T-c rhythms at estrus and proestrus and on day 8 of pregnancy, but increased the amplitude at day 20 of pregnancy. Photoperiod analysis revealed that obesity reduced T-c exclusively in the light period during pre-pregnancy but only during the dark period in late gestation. In conclusion, obesity alters rhythmic T-c profiles and reduces the magnitude of the T-c decline late in rat gestation, which may have implications for maternal health and fetal development.

AB Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between OSA and preeclampsia. Methods: Between 30 and 39weeks gestation, objective sleep apnea were evaluated in 38 normal pregnant and 40 preeclamptic women. Preeclampsia was defined by having a blood pressure (BP) >140/90mmHg on two occasions after the 20th week of pregnancy with excess protein in the urine (>300mg in 24h) or 30mg persistent proteinuria (+1 in dipsticks) in random samples. Objective sleep apnea was evaluated using an overnight in-hospital sleep evaluation using the SOMNOwatch plus Respiratory Screener. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 5, and further grouped into severity categories: mild (5-14.9), moderate (15-29.9), and severe (30). Results: Mean AHI was 33.3 +/- 12.1 in preeclamptic women and was 23.8 +/- 15.8 in normal pregnant women (p=0.008). There was significant difference in prevalence of OSA severity (none, mild, moderate, or severe) between groups. Out of 33 preeclamptic women, 11 women had moderate and 22 women had severe OSA. Whereas, among 33 normal pregnant women, 8, 13, and10 women had mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. Two normal pregnant women had no OSA (AHI<5). Conclusion: Our study suggests women are susceptible to developing OSA during pregnancy that is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.

AB Men appear to gain weight during the transition to parenthood, and fathers are heavier than non-fathers. Paternal perinatal weight gain may set weight trajectories in midlife and have long-term health implications. Since men do not undergo the physical demands of pregnancy and breastfeeding, the specific mechanisms underlying weight gain in new fathers warrant investigation. This review aims to stimulate research on paternal perinatal weight gain by suggesting testable potential mechanisms that (1) show change across the transition to parenthood and (2) play a role in weight and body composition. We identify seven mechanisms, within three categories: behavioural mechanisms (sleep, physical activity, and diet), hormonal mechanisms (testosterone and cortisol), and psychological mechanisms (depression and stress). We also discuss direct effects of partner pregnancy influences (e.g., couvade syndrome') on men's body weight. In presenting each mechanism, we discuss how it may be affected by the transition to parenthood, and then review its role in body composition and weight. Next, we describe bidirectional and interactive effects, discuss timing, and present three broad research questions to propel theoretical development.

AB Objectives/background: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep beginning in early pregnancy. Among nonpregnant populations, exercise has been associated with improved sleep; however, research in pregnant samples has been equivocal. We examined whether varying degrees of exercise were associated with better nocturnal sleep among pregnant women during early gestation. Participants: 172 pregnant women. Methods: Self-reported sleep and exercise and objective sleep were collected during early gestation: T1 (10-12 weeks), T2 (14-16 weeks), and T3 (18-20 weeks) from 172 pregnant women. Exercise was categorized into three time-varying groups: 0 metabolic equivalent minutes per week (MET-min/week), 1 to < 500 MET-min/week, or >= 500 MET-min/week. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to test hypotheses. Results: A significant main effect for Time (F [2254] = 9.77, p < 0.0001) and Time*Exercise group interaction were observed for actigraphic sleep efficiency (aSE) (F[4,569] = 2.73, p = 0.0285). At T2, women who reported >= 500 MET-min/week had higher aSE than those who reported 0 MET-min/week. Significant main effects for Exercise Group and Time were observed for actigraphic wake after sleep onset (aWASO; F[2,694] = 3.04, p = 0.0483 and F [2,260] = 3.21, p = 0.0419). aWASO was lowest for those reporting 1 to < 500 MET-min/week (t(701) = 235, adjusted p = .0489) and aWASO decreased from T1 to T3 (t[258] = 2.53, adjusted p value = 0.036). Lastly, there was a main effect for Time for the PSQI (F[2,689] = 52.11, p < 0.0001), indicating that sleep quality improved over time. Conclusions: Some level of exercise among pregnant women appears to be more advantageous than no exercise at all. Moderate exercise, while still uncleanly defined, may be a worthwhile adjunct treatment to combat sleep disturbances during pregnancy.

AB Purpose: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet few studies are currently available regarding the determinants of sleep quality among pregnant women in China. This study aimed to: (a) calculate the prevalence of sleep disorder during pregnancy, (b) examine the difference in sleep quality among three trimesters, and (c) identify determinants of sleep quality in pregnant women.Materials and methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Five hundred pregnant women were recruited at the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynecology of two teaching hospitals in central China. Five selfreport questionnaires were used for gathering data, including information of sample characteristics, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), prenatal depression (the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)).Results: A total of 454 pregnant women participated in the study between September 2016 and April 2017. Eighty-seven percent pregnant women experienced sleep disorder (PSQI score >5). Poorer global sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, lower sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances were most prevalent during third trimester. The significant contributors to sleep quality for pregnant women were prenatal depression, maternal age, and gestational age.Conclusions: Sleep disorder is very common in pregnant women from China. Depressive symptoms, increased maternal age, and gestational age are determinants of sleep quality. These determinants can assist healthcare professionals in preventative intervention.

AB Introduction: The World Health Organization recommends newborns to be breastfed but this may be challenging if the mother needs to be treated for depression, since strong evidence to inform treatment choice is missing.
   Areas covered: We provide a critical review of the literature to guide clinicians who are considering sertraline for the management of depression during postpartum.
   Expert opinion: Sertraline is one of the safest antidepressants during breastfeeding. In most cases, women already taking sertraline should be advised to breastfeed and continue the medication. We recommend to begin with low doses and to slowly increase the dose up, with careful monitoring of the newborn for adverse effects (irritability, poor feeding, or uneasy sleep, especially if the child was born premature or had low weight at birth). The target dose should be the lowest effective. When feasible, child exposure to the medication may be reduced by avoiding breastfeeding at the time when the antidepressant milk concentration is at its peak. A decision to switch to sertraline from ongoing and effective treatment should be taken only after a scrupulous evaluation of the potential risks and benefits of switching versus continuing the ongoing medication while monitoring the infant carefully.

AB Background: Sleep problems have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms and diagnosis. However, past research has studied the simultaneous association of sleep problems with precursor ASD symptoms. Using data from a birth cohort, we estimate prospective associations between infant sleep characteristics at 12 months and later ASD screening scores at 24 months.
   Methods: We obtained data from children (N = 1,096) and their mothers as participants in the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood longitudinal birth cohort study. Mothers were enrolled between 2006 and 2011, when they were 16-26 weeks pregnant. Using linear regression, we examined the influence of infant sleep characteristics (nighttime and daytime sleep, night wakings, and sleep onset latency) at 12 months on ASD screening scores at 24 months while controlling for other psychosocial characteristics.
   Results: The number of night wakings was the only sleep characteristic at 12 months to be significantly associated with the development of early ASD symptoms at 24 months (B = 0.097, P = .021; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.180). However, other competing risks, especially child socioemotional competence at 12 months (B = 0.573, P < .001; 95% CI, 0.361 to 0.785), showed stronger relative contributions in predicting ASD risk.
   Conclusions: Infants with more sleep problems by 12 months, especially those waking more often during the night, showed an increased number of early ASD symptoms a year later. This study suggests that infant sleep characteristics could constitute one clinical sign of ASD risk, together with key psychosocial characteristics.

AB Objective The aim of this study was to investigate whether night work expressed by number and duration of night shifts, number of consecutive night shifts, and number of quick returns during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy is a risk factor for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP).
   Methods The study population comprised Danish workers in public administration and hospitals who gave birth between 2007 and 2013. Exposure was assessed objectively through payroll data. Information on the outcome was retrieved from the National Patient Register. We performed logistic regression on the risk for HDP according to night work adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), parity, socioeconomic status, and sickness absence prior to pregnancy.
   Results Among 18 724 workers, 60% had at least one night shift during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. The prevalence of HDP was 3.7%. Among night workers, the risk of HDP grew with increasing number of consecutive night shifts [odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.98) and of quick returns after night shifts (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.87-1.95). Among obese women (body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2)), those,who worked long night shifts and longer spells of consecutive night shifts, and had the highest number of quick returns after night shifts, had a 4-5 fold increased risk of HDP compared to day workers.
   Conclusion Working consecutive night shifts and quick returns after night shifts during the first 20 pregnancy weeks was associated with an increased risk of HDP. particularly among obese women.

AB Aim. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) levels and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Materials and Method. 44 patients with OSAS and 44 healthy adults were included in this study. The participants having rheumatic or systemic inflammatory disease, advanced liver or kidney failure, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, pregnancy, prerenal azotemia, known history of coronary artery disease, any pulmonary disease, rhinitis, or atopy, history of major trauma or surgery within the last six 6 months, and inhaled nasal or systemic corticosteroid use or other anti-inflammatory medications and those with < 18 years of age were excluded. Serum PAPP-A levels were determined by the Elisa method with the immune sandwich measuring method. Statistical analysis of the study was performed with SPSS 17.0 statistical analysis package program, and p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results. Serum PAPP-A levels of patients with OSAS (2.350 ng/ml (0.641-4.796)) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) when compared with healthy controls (0.971 ng/ml (0.109-2.679)). There was a statistically significant difference in serum PAPP-A levels between groups of OSAS patients according to the classification of OSAS severity. Between the groups of patients with OSAS, serum levels of PAPP-A in moderate group was significantly higher when compared with severe OSAS group (p < 0.001). There was positive correlations between PAPP-A levels and night minimum (p=0.042, r=0.309), and average oxygen levels (p=0.006, r=0.407). There was a negative correlation between PAPP-A levels and AHI (p=0.002, r=0.460). Conclusion. Higher PAPP-A levels in OSAS patients that were found in this study show inflammatory component in OSAS.

AB Objective: The maternal representations of an unborn baby begin to develop during pregnancy. However, the factors that moderate them are not well identified. The objective of this study was to jointly explore supportive and undermining factors in the maternal representations of an unborn baby and motherhood. Methods: Cross-sectional data comprising 1646 women studied during the third trimester of pregnancy. Maternal expectations were measured using a 12-item self-report questionnaire, Mother's Representations about an Unborn Baby. Depression, anxiety, family atmosphere and adult attachment were measured using standardised questionnaires. Statistical analysis is based on multivariate linear regression analysis. Results: The most powerful predictors of a mother's prenatal expectations were the mother's educational status, age, closeness in adult relationships, higher levels of depressive symptoms and family atmosphere. In accordance with our hypothesis, depression was related to the mother's more negative expectations on their relationship with the unborn baby and on regularity in the baby's sleeping and eating patterns. A positive family atmosphere and the mother's ability for closeness and dependence (i.e. confidence) in adult relationships were related to more positive expectations of the mother-unborn baby relationship. On the other hand, stress, anxiety and adverse life events were not related to the mother's expectations of her unborn baby. Conclusions: The results may be helpful in identifying families who need early professional support and call for studies where the prenatal phase is explored as a proactive phase for the development of the child-parent relationship.

AB Objective: To analyze the perception of mothers deprived of freedom about breastfeeding. Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was developed in four prison units in the state of Paraiba, Brazil. The non-probabilistic type sample was composed of inmates who were breastfeeding. Information regarding mother, infant, prenatal care, breastfeeding and sucking habits were collected. Data were analyzed through the Statistical Package for Social Sciences and presented through descriptive statistics. Results: Of the 496 women under closed prison system, only 13 (2.6%) were breastfeeding their children in the prison environment. The age of mothers ranged from 19 to 35 years, and the most frequent age group was 19-23 years (46.2%). The majority had no partner (84.6%), low schooling (60%) and had other children (84.6%). All were pregnant when they were arrested and 76.9% underwent cesarean delivery. Infants aged 1-5 months and 61.5% were female. The majority of inmates performed prenatal care (76.9%), with prison being the referred site (60%). Participation in educational activities on breastfeeding was reported by 90.9%, and nurses were the health professionals who provided these guidelines (66.6%). Exclusive breastfeeding was reported by 69.2%, but the maximum period was two months (33.3%). All mothers complemented breastfeeding (100%). Nocturnal breastfeeding was reported by 15.4%, being used for the child to sleep. All children started bottle-feeding from the first trimester of life. Pacifier use was observed in all infants. Conclusion: Inmates are predominantly young, single, of low schooling and underwent cesarean delivery. Prenatal care was carried out at the prison and mothers participated in educational activities about breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding was reported by the majority; however, the maximum time was two months. All infants used bottle and pacifier use was reported from birth.

AB Introduction. The paper (a) discusses psychological and physiological conditions of motherhood among women at risk of postnatal depression, (b) overviews studies on depression risk factors, and (c) presents the results of the original study. This research concentrates on mothers' views of their own experience of motherhood and also their personality traits. The present study develops and validates diagnostic tools for identifying women at risk of depression.
   Methods. The study employed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Beck Depression Inventory, and the author's questionnaire on motherhood conditions.
   Results. The study involved mothers (n = 151) of babies under one year old. The conducted study helped to reveal a group of women at risk of postnatal depression. Sleep-deprived mothers (sleeping less than 7 hours per day) not feeling a constant support from their husbands fell into this risk group. The risk group mothers underwent a difficult labor; they had unrealistic expectations of motherhood.
   Discussion. The following factors determine the risks of postnatal depression: (a) a woman's expectations of motherhood, (b) her views of parenthood realities, (c) the context of marital relations, and (d) psychological conditions of parenthood. The research findings can be readily used in practice.

AB The expression of aquaporins (AQPs) in the fetal porcine urinary tract and its relation to gestational age has not been established. Tissue samples from the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder and urethra were obtained from porcine fetuses. Samples were examined by RT-PCR (AQPs 1-11), QPCR (AQPs positive on RT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry. Bladder samples were additionally examined by Western blotting. RNA was extracted from 76 tissue samples obtained from 19 fetuses. Gestational age was 60 (n = 11) or 100 days (n = 8). PCR showed that AQP1, 3, 9 and 11 mRNA was expressed in all locations. The expression of AQP3 increased significantly at all four locations with gestational age, whereas AQP11 significantly decreased. AQP1 expression increased in the ureter, bladder and urethra. AQP9 mRNA expression increased in the urethra and bladder, but decreased in the ureter. AQP5 was expressed only in the urethra. Immunohistochemistry showed AQP1 staining in sub-urothelial vessels at all locations. Western blotting analysis confirmed increased AQP1 protein levels in bladder samples during gestation. Expression levels of AQP1, 3, 5, 9 and 11 in the urinary tract change during gestation, and further studies are needed to provide insights into normal and pathophysiological water handling mechanisms in the fetus.

AB A preference for eveningness (being a "night owl") and preterm birth (<37 weeks of gestation) are associated with similar adversities, such as elevated blood pressure, impaired glucose regulation, poorer physical fitness, and lower mood. Yet, it remains unclear if and how preterm birth is associated with circadian preference. The aim of this study was to assess this association across the whole gestation range, using both objective and subjective measurements of circadian preference.
   Circadian preference was measured among 594 young adults (mean age 24.3 years, SD 1.3) from two cohorts: the ESTER study and the Arvo Ylppo Longitudinal Study. We compared 83 participants born early preterm (<34 weeks) and 165 late preterm (34 to <37 weeks) with those born at term (>= 37 weeks, n = 346). We also compared very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 g) participants with term-born controls. We obtained objective sleep data with actigraphs that were worn for a mean period of 6.8 (SD 1.4) nights. Our primary outcome was sleep midpoint during weekdays and weekend. The sleep midpoint is the half-way time between falling asleep and waking up, and it represents sleep timing. We also investigated subjective chronotype with the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) in 688 (n = 138/221/329) ESTER participants. The MEQ consists of 19 questions, which estimates the respondent to be of a "morning", "evening," or "intermediate" chronotype, based on the Morningness-Eveningness Score (MES). We analyzed the data from the actigraphs and the MES with three linear regression models, and analyzed distribution of the chronotype class with Pearson chi(2).
   There were no consistent differences across the study groups in sleep midpoint. As compared with those born at term, the mean differences in minutes:seconds and 95% confidence intervals for the sleep midpoint were: early preterm weekdays 11:47 (-834 to 32:08), early preterm weekend 4:14 (-19:45 to 28:13), late preterm weekdays -10:28 (-26:16 to 5:21), and late preterm weekend -1:29 (-20:36 to 17:37). There was no difference in sleep timing between VLBW-participants and controls either. The distribution of chronotype in the MEQ among all participants was 12.4% morningness, 65.4% intermediate, and 22.2% eveningness. The distribution of the subjective chronotype class did not differ between the three gestational age groups (p = 0.98). The linear regression models did not show any influence of gestational age group or VLBW status on the MES (all p > 0.5).
   We found no consistent differences between adults born early or late preterm and those born at term in circadian preference. The earlier circadian preference previously observed in those born smallest is unlikely to extend across the whole range of preterm birth.

AB Study Objectives: To measure prevalence and severity of third trimester obstructive sleep apnea and evaluate postpartum resolution. To assess a novel biomarker for screening for obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy.
   Methods: This prospective observational study was performed at Wake Forest School of Medicine obstetrics clinics between April 2014 and December 2015. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurements and sleep studies were obtained and compared at 32 0/7 to 35 6/7 weeks gestation and postpartum. Exhaled nitric oxide and risk factors for the development of gestational sleep apnea were evaluated for predictive ability independently and in screening models.
   Results: Of 76 women enrolled, 73 performed valid sleep studies in pregnancy and 65 had an additional valid study 6 to 15 weeks postpartum. Twenty-four women (37%) had gestational sleep apnea compared with 23 (35%) with postpartum sleep apnea (P > .99). Eight of 11 women (73%) retested 6 to 8 months postpartum had persistent sleep apnea. Exhaled nitric oxide had moderate discrimination screening for sleep apnea in pregnancy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.64). A model utilizing exhaled nitric oxide, pregnancy-specific screening, and Mallampati score improved ability to identify women at risk for gestational sleep apnea (sensitivity = 46%, specificity = 91% and likelihood ratio = 5.11, area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.75).
   Conclusions: Obstructive sleep apnea is common in the early postpartum period and often persisted at least 6 months. Exhaled nitric oxide as a sole biomarker to screen for sleep apnea in pregnancy has only modest discrimination. Combined with additional parameters sensitivity and specificity improved.

AB Introduction: The aim of this paper was to examine the role of perinatal, obstetric and post partum factors on maternal and paternal stress. It will present the first examination of the role of prenatal, obstetric, post-partum, and demographic variables in parenting stress for mothers and fathers at 9 months.Methods: Data from 6821 parental dyads of 9-month-old infants were extracted from the Growing Up in Ireland National Longitudinal Study of Children. Participants completed the Parental Stress Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Quality of Attachment Sub-scale from the Maternal and Paternal Postnatal Attachment Scales, and a single item health status question from the Short Form 12 Health Survey. Information on prenatal care, pregnancy complications, obstetric outcomes, infant health, and participant demographics were also collected. Separate hierarchical linear regressions were conducted for mothers and fathersResults: Mothers reported higher levels of parenting stress than fathers (p<0.001). Maternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment, own health status, average sleep, occupation, household income, and having a very rapid labor. Paternal parenting stress was predicted by attachment and own health status.Discussion: A range of perinatal factors was associated with an increased risk of higher parenting stress at 9 months post-partum and the roles of these factors differ between mothers and fathers. These findings are important for predicting and reducing risk of parenting stress in both genders.

AB Fetal pain and fetal anesthesia are still matter of debate: some authors hypothesize that several intrauterine endocrine neuroinhibitors (ENIn) anesthetize the fetus, keeping it in a constant state of sleep, and making pharmacological fetal anesthesia useless for fetal surgery, while others argue fetal pain is possible and shoud be prevented with fetal anesthesy.Aim: To retrieve evidences about fetal pain, fetal arousability and about the level of sedation induced by the ENIn, in order to assess the necessity of direct fetal anesthesia during prenatal fetal surgery.Methods: We performed a careful literature review (1990-2016) on fetal arousability, and on the possibility that ENIn at the average fetal blood levels induce actual anesthesia. We retrieved the papers that fulfilled the research criteria, with particular attention to the second half of pregnancy, the period when most fetal surgery is performed.Results: Fetuses are awake about 10% of the total time in the last gestational weeks, and they can be aroused by external stimuli. ENIn have not an anesthetic effect at normal fetal values, but only when they areartificialy injected at high doses; their blood levels in the last trimester of average pregnancies are not dissimilar either in the fetus or in the mother.Conclusions: During the second half of the pregnancy, external stimuli can awake the fetuses, although they spend most of the time in sleeping state; the presence of ENIn is absolutely not enough to guarantee an effective anesthesia during surgery. Thus, direct fetal analgesia/anesthesia is mandatory, though further studies on its possible drawbacks are necessary.

ID METAANALYSIS; GROWTH; RISK
AB Aim: To compare the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects of labetalol and nifedipine modified release (MR) in hypertensive pregnant women. We also investigated the effect on the heart rate (HR) and determined the proportion of time spent in target.
   Methods: This was an exploratory study. Women with chronic hypertension taking either labetalol or nifedipine were offered 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Sleep, wake and drug ingestion times were self-reported. An indirect response model was used to analyse the systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and HR time-series; the effect of gestation and type of drug was evaluated.
   Results: Forty-eight women were recruited: 24 in each group. There was no difference in clinical characteristics. In women taking nifedipine there was a positive association between the dose of nifedipine and pre-dose BP p = .002, this was not present in the labetalol group.
   There was a difference between the drug effects on both the SBP and DBP time-series (p = .014). In comparison to labetalol, there was less variation in day time BP in those women prescribed nifedipine. Women on labetalol spent a larger proportion of time with their DBP below target (< 80 mmHg). The HR dynamics were qualitatively different, a stimulatory effect was found with nifedipine compared to an inhibitory effect with labetalol.
   Conclusion: There are significant and important differences between the BP lowering effects of nifedipine and labetalol. A large randomised control trial is required to investigate the relationship between BP variability and time in target on pregnancy outcomes.

AB Globally, anxiety and depression is the third leading cause of disease burden for women 14 to 44years of age. The World Health Organisation reports that 15 to 57% of women in developing countries experience symptoms of depression. Maternal mental illness has a negative impact on infant and young child (IYC) growth, development and care, having serious health implications in terms of physical, cognitive and emotional well-being during crucial stages of the life span, such as the first 1000days and early childhood. Various studies conducted in both developed and developing countries, have shown that maternal depression is associated with negative health outcomes such as: low birth weight, developmental delay, incomplete immunisation schedules, acute or chronic diarrhoea, somatic symptoms, disrupted sleep patterns and child abuse, as well as psychiatric and neuro-behavioural disorders. In addition, maternal depression impairs IYC care practices related to breastfeeding, health care, safety and development. It also contributes to inadequate nutrition during pregnancy as well as that of offspring during infancy and childhood, resulting in suboptimal brain development and inadequate growth. Infants with depressed mothers are not only vulnerable to becoming underweight, but also being stunted.

AB Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study assessed the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in obese pregnant females with GDM and OSA.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted (April 2014 - June 2016). Obese females at 24 to 34 weeks gestation and with diet-controlled GDM were screened for OSA. Those with OSA were randomly assigned to receive 2 weeks nightly CPAP or be part of a waitlist control group. After 2 weeks, all patients were offered CPAP. The primary outcome was glucose metabolism, obtained from an oral meal tolerance test (MTT) at baseline and 2 weeks. Pregnancy outcomes were collected.
   Results: Eighteen patients were randomized to CPAP and 18 to control groups. There were no significant changes between groups in fasting glucose, glucose response to MTT, and insulin sensitivity or secretion after 2 weeks. Those adherent to CPAP had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .016) compared to the control group. When a counterfactual instrumental variable approach was applied to deal with nonadherence, the CPAP group had significantly improved insulin secretion (P = .002) and insulin sensitivity (P = .015). Lower rates of preterm delivery (P = .002), unplanned cesarean section (P = .005), and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (P < .001) were observed among those who used CPAP longer than 2 weeks.
   Conclusions: Two weeks of CPAP in females with GDM and OSA did not result in improved glucose levels, but insulin secretion improved in those adherent to CPAP. Continued CPAP use was possibly associated with improved pregnancy outcomes.

DE Sleep; fatigue; pregnancy; postpartum; breastfeeding
ID DISTURBANCE; PREGNANCY; WOMEN
AB Postpartum women sleep less during the early days following delivery. Long-term sleep disturbance and fatigue can have significant implications for physical and mental health, relationships, employment and parental competence. Most studies focus on the quality and quantity of maternal sleep between weeks one and six postpartum. We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery. Thirty first-time mothers completed a postnatal sleep questionnaire, detailing their total sleep time (TST), the reasons for being awake and their level of fatigue. The logs were completed in real time during the first 48h postpartum, while they were still in a hospital environment. The data collected from the mothers in the study indicated that the mean TST in the first 48h was 9.7h. Of the factors explored only breastfeeding influenced the TST. Breastfeeding women slept on average 2.6h longer than women who bottle-fed (p=.042).Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject: Childbearing affects women's sleep in many ways. Hormonal changes during pregnancy and postpartum as well as physiological and anatomical alterations, and the process of adaptation to the new parent's responsibilities contribute to changes in sleep architecture. Since first study of sleep and pregnancy published in 1968 there have been very few publications addressing maternal sleep postpartum. Most studies which have focussed on quality of maternal sleep in the first 6-months postpartum period describe the relationships between poor maternal sleep and postpartum depression and other mental health outcomes.What the results of this study add: We explored sleep patterns and reasons for wakefulness of first-time mothers immediately following delivery while they remained in the hospital environment. We found that environmental factors such as background noise, shared rooms, type of delivery, feeding and worrying about the neonate did not influence the total sleep time, however, the main outcome of our study is that breastfeeding promotes maternal sleep.What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: We believe that this study would be of interest to many obstetricians, general practitioners, nurses and midwives as well as to the general public. Appropriate counselling of patients early in postnatal period can improve their sleep patterns and reduce the risk of depression and other abnormal physical, psychological and social outcomes.

AB Poor sleep in pregnancy is related to adverse neonatal health. Elevated maternal cortisol has been proposed as a pathway, yet the association in pregnancy is not well understood. The goals of the current study were to examine associations between (a) sleep and cortisol, (b) sleep, cortisol, and neonatal outcomes, and (c) variables that could explain these associations. Two hundred pregnant women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989) and provided diurnal salivary cortisol samples at two times over pregnancy. Poor sleep quality was associated with greater evening cortisol concentrations at 36 weeks' gestation. This association was mediated by anxiety symptoms. Higher evening cortisol at 36 weeks' gestation was associated with shorter gestation.

AB BackgroundDuring the first postpartum year 20% of women retain excessive weight from pregnancy (postpartum weight retention; PPWR), which predicts long-term overweight/obesity.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to explore the associations between psychological factors (depression, anxiety and stress symptoms and body attitudes) in late gestation and at 12-months postpartum with PPWR one-year post-birth.MethodsPregnant women (N=176) completed questionnaires in early-mid pregnancy (Time 1; mean (SD) = 16.97 (1.35) weeks), late pregnancy (Time 2; mean (SD) = 33.33 (2.05) weeks), and one year postpartum (Time 3; mean (SD) = 53.12 (3.34) weeks). Women provided demographic characteristics, height and pre-pregnancy weight at Time 1. At Times 2 and 3, weight, depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms and body attitudes (salience of weight and shape, attractiveness, feeling fat, and strength and fitness) were assessed in addition to physiological, socio-contextual and lifestyle factors. Gestational weight gain and PPWR were calculated. Hierarchical linear regression models were conducted to explore variance in 12-month PPWR.ResultsOverall, models explained 26-39% variance in PPWR. Gestational weight gain in late pregnancy and low attractiveness at 12 months postpartum were the only variables associated significantly with 12-month PPWR.ConclusionWhile psychological factors did not appear to be important direct contributors to PPWR at 12 months, the overall contribution of all variables suggests that such factors may be implicated in a small and incremental way. Exploration of the interactions between variables will help unpack potential mechanisms of the development of PPWR at 12 months post-birth.

AB Female shift workers are at increased risk for negative reproductive outcomes, and animal evidence suggests that manipulation of the light-dark cycle is detrimental to early gestation in female mice. Specifically, failure of implantation may be responsible for these findings. The objective of this study was to better delineate which reproductive processes are vulnerable to detrimental effects of maternal circadian disturbance. We exposed mice undergoing embryo transfer to repetitive phase advances of the photoperiod. Embryos were derived from donor sperm and eggs from mice living in normal light-dark conditions to isolate the effects of photoperiod disruption on uterine receptivity and early gestation. Twenty-eight mice receiving embryo transfer underwent an experimental light-dark condition (advance of lights on and lights off by 6 hours every 4 days). Twenty-eight mice remained in a normal light-dark condition. Animals lived in their assigned light-dark condition beginning 2 weeks prior to embryo transfer and ending the day of uterine necropsy (post-coitus day 14.5). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test demonstrated no significant differences between control and experimental light-dark conditions in pups (Z=0.10, p=.92), resorptions (Z=0.20, p=.84), or implantations (Z=-0.34, p=.73). Pup and placental weights were similar between groups. In this investigation, uterine receptivity and maintenance of early gestation were preserved despite recurrent phase advances in photoperiod. This finding, in the context of the current literature, suggests that the negative effects of circadian disruption are mediated by reproductive processes upstream of implantation.

AB Restless legs syndrome is a neuromotor problem which is more common among pregnant women. Several studies have reported different prevalences for this disorder. Combining the results of these studies reveals reliable evidences for policymakers. This study aims to estimate the total prevalence of restless legs syndrome in pregnant women using meta-analysis. Different databanks (PubMed, Web of Sciences, EMBASE, EBSCO, Ovid, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched using relevant keywords. After limiting the search strategy, reviewing the abstracts and full texts and quality assessment, eligible papers were selected for meta-analysis. Cochrane and I-squared indices were used to detect the degree of heterogeneity. The point prevalences were combined using random effects model. Studies that influenced the heterogeneity were detected using sensitivity analysis, while meta-regression models were applied to determine the factors that most affected the heterogeneity. Out of 26 eligible articles, 20.5% of pregnant women (95% confidence interval 16.5-24.2) were suffering from restless legs syndrome compared to 2.9% in Japan to 43.7% in Iran. Our meta-analysis showed that approximately one-fifth of pregnant women in the world have restless leg syndrome.

AB Pregnant women have a two-to threefold increased prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) compared to the general population, and the majority of RLS patients also experience periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). PLMS have been associated with sleep disturbance as well as autonomic heart rate and blood pressure responses; however, the prevalence, cause and significance of PLMS during pregnancy remain unknown. This study evaluated the presence of PLMS in late pregnancy and its relationship to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Ninetyone women in the third trimester of pregnancy underwent overnight polysomnography. An RLS questionnaire and the Multivariate Apnea Risk Index were administered and venous blood was sampled within 2 weeks of the sleep study. After exclusions due to obstructive sleep apnoea and signal loss, PLMS data were available for 73 women, 36 hypertensive women and 37 BMI-and gestation-matched controls. PLMS were found to be very common during pregnancy; 45% of women had a PLMS index > 5 and 25% had a PLMS index > 15. The number of PLMS per hour did not differ by hypertensive status. Sleep quality was mostly unaffected by PLMS, as was change in blood pressure overnight. While RLS was reported by 18.3% of the sample, this did not reliably predict the presence of PLMS. Despite iron deficiency being common in this population, it was not associated with PLMS. This novel study investigating the frequency and impact of PLMS during pregnancy revealed that PLMS are very common in the third trimester; however, this disorder appears to be benign in terms of objective sleep quality and relationship with pregnancy-related hypertension.

AB Stressful early life experiences cause immune dysregulation across the lifespan. Despite the fact that studies have identified childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivors as a particularly vulnerable group, only a few attempts have been made to study their lived-experience of the physical health consequences of CSA. The aim of this study was to explore a female CSA survivor's lived-experience of the physical health consequences of CSA and how she experienced the reactions of healthcare providers. Seven interviews were conducted with this 40-year-old woman, Anne, using a phenomenological research approach. Anne was still a young child (two to three years old) when her father started to rape her. Since her childhood, she has experienced complex and widespread physical health consequences such as repeated vaginal and abdominal infections, widespread and chronic pain, sleeping problems, digestive problems, chronic back problems, fibromyalgia, musculoskeletal problems, repeated urinary tract infections, cervical dysplasia, inflammation of the Fallopian tubes, menorrhagia, endometrial hyperplasia, chlamydia, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancies, uterus problems, severe adhesions, and ovarian cancer. Anne disclosed her CSA experience to several healthcare providers but they were silent and failed to provide trauma-informed care. Anne's situation, albeit unique, might reflect similar problems in other female CSA survivors.

AB An intact communication between circadian clocks and the stress system is important for maintaining physiological homeostasis under resting conditions and in response to external stimuli. There is accumulating evidence for a reciprocal interaction between both-from the systemic to the molecular level. Disruption of this interaction by external factors such as shiftwork, jetlag, or chronic stress increases the risk of developing metabolic, immune, or mood disorders. From experiments in rodents, we know that both systems maturate during the perinatal period. During that time, exogenous factors such as stress or alterations in the external photoperiod may critically affect-or program-physiological functions later in life. This developmental programming process has been attributed to maternal stress signals reaching the embryo, which lastingly change gene expression through the induction of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the well-known function of the adult circadian system in temporal coordination of physiology and behavior, the role of maternal and embryonic circadian clocks during pregnancy and postnatal development is still poorly defined. A better understanding of the circadian-stress crosstalk at different periods of development may help to improve stress resistance and devise preventive and therapeutic strategies against chronic stress-associated disorders.

AB The aim of this review is to clarify the interrelationship between melatonin and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during fetal development. ASD refers to a diverse range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by social deficits, impaired communication, and stereotyped or repetitive behaviors. Melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland, has well-established neuroprotective and circadian entraining effects. During pregnancy, the hormone crosses the placenta into the fetal circulation and transmits photoperiodic information to the fetus allowing the establishment of normal sleep patterns and circadian rhythms that are essential for normal neurodevelopment. Melatonin synthesis is frequently impaired in patients with ASD. The hormone reduces oxidative stress, which is harmful to the central nervous system. Therefore, the neuroprotective and circadian entraining roles of melatonin may reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD.

AB Introduction: Numerous physiologic and anatomic changes during pregnancy exacerbate or unmask obstructive sleep apnea in women. Left untreated, upper airway flow limitation during pregnancy may lead to dire maternal and fetal health consequences.
   Areas covered: This review outlines the relationship between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. It also discusses the implications of SDB on fetal and maternal health and concludes with a review of the emerging literature of treatment options for SDB in pregnancy and its benefit.
   Expert commentary: Providers should screen, recognize, and treat SDB in pregnant women given its implicated risk on maternal and fetal health. This is particularly true in preeclampsia, a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality where SDB has been shown to add risk and severity. It is important to note that repetitive upper airway flow limitations in pregnancy are associated with surges in nocturnal blood pressure and poor maternal and fetal outcomes, and may be just as detrimental as frank apneas/hypopneas. Future large, prospective, randomized controlled studies on the effects of CPAP are still needed. The epidemiology of SDB in pregnant women needs to be further studied, as well as highlighting the need for systematic, long-term follow ups on mother and infant health post-delivery.

ID PREGNANCY
AB Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of symptoms associated with the Couvade syndrome in two groups of men of Polish and Finnish nationality, and to perform a comparative analysis.
   Material and methods: The study was conducted in two groups of men (expectant fathers): 51 Poles and 40 Finns using a self-constructed questionnaire prepared in Polish and English languages. The statistical analysis was performed in Micro-soft Office Excel 2010 and Statistica 12. The Pearson's test was calculated, and the statistical significance level was p < 0.05.
   Results: The most common physical symptoms reported by the Polish men were weight gain (78%) and gastric disorders (80%), whereas the Finns most frequently declared weight gain (60%). As for emotional symptoms, mood swings (p = 0.0001) and sleep disorders (p = 0.00004) were significantly more common in the Poles, whilst the Finns experienced frustration (p = 0.0403) and nervousness (p = 0.01579) significantly more frequently. The Finnish respondents more often used professional forms of preparation for childbirth and parenthood (p = 0.00229).
   Conclusions: Psychosomatic symptoms of the Couvade syndrome are significantly more common in Polish than in Finnish expectant fathers. Compared with Polish fathers, Finns significantly more frequently attend ante-natal classes. Ante-natal care should encompass education of men as they do experience the symptoms of the Couvade syndrome during their wives'/partners' pregnancies.

AB Maternal obesity induces pregnancy complications and disturbs fetal development, but the specific mechanisms underlying these outcomes are unclear. Circadian rhythms are implicated in metabolic complications associated with obesity, and maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy. Accordingly, obesity-induced circadian dysfunction may drive adverse outcomes in obese pregnancy. This study investigated whether maternal obesity alters the rhythmic expression of clock genes and associated nuclear receptors across maternal, fetal, and placental tissues. Wistar rats were maintained on a cafeteria (CAF) diet prior to and throughout gestation to induce maternal obesity. Maternal and fetal liver and placental labyrinth zone (LZ) were collected at four-hourly time points across days 15-16 and 21-22 of gestation (term = 23 days). Gene expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Expression of the accessory clock gene Nr1d1 was rhythmic in the maternal and fetal liver and LZ of chow-fed controls, but in each case CAF feeding reduced peak Nr1d1 expression. Obesity resulted in a phase advance (approx. 1.5 h) in the rhythms of several clock genes and Ppar-delta in maternal liver. Aside from Nr1d1, expression of clock genes was mostly arrhythmic in LZ and fetal liver, and was unaffected by the CAF diet. In conclusion, maternal obesity suppressed Nr1d1 expression across maternal, fetal, and placental compartments and phase-advanced the rhythms of maternal hepatic clock genes. Given the key role of Nr1d1 in regulating metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory processes, our data suggest that disruptions to rhythmic Nr1d1 expression in utero may contribute to programmed health complications in offspring of obese pregnancies.
   Summary Sentence
   Obesity suppresses Nr1d1 expression in maternal, fetal, and placental tissues and phase-advances the rhythms of maternal hepatic clock genes during rat pregnancy.

AB Fertility awareness-based (FAB) methods represent a term that includes all family planning methods that are based on the identification of the fertile window. They are based on the woman's observation of physiological signs of the fertile and infertile phases of the menstrual cycle. The first approach consists basically in symptothermal methods accompanied by cervical mucus measurements and clinical menstrual cycling data recording. The second most often used methods are the urinary measurement of E3G and luteinizing hormone (LH) with a personalized computer system. Hence these systems lack the efficacy of the continuous circadian and circamensual measurement of the core body temperature. Only this approach enables the accurate detection of the ovulation during the fertile window. A new medical device called OvulaRing has been developed to fill this gap. In the present study, the system and its first clinical results are presented. OvulaRing is a medical device used just like a tampon. The device is a vaginal ring of evatane that contains an integrated biosensor. This sensor measures continuously every 5 min the core body temperature throughout the entire cycle. This device allows a circadian and circamensual intravaginal exact measurement. With this system, 288 measurements are created per day. The system can detect retrospectively and predict prospectively the fertile window of the users. One hundred and fifty eight women aged between 18 and 45 years used this medical device in an open non-randomized clinical study for 15 months. A total of 470 cycles could be recorded and were able for analysis. By the same time in a subgroup of patients, hormonal assessments of LH, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and progesterone as well as vaginal ultrasound were performed in parallel between the 9th and the 36th day of the cycle. The validation error due to software errors was 0.89% for the retrospective analysis; that means that the accuracy for the detection of the ovulation was 99.11%. Accuracy of 88.8% for a window of 3 days before ovulation, the day of ovulation and the 3 days after ovulation was achieved for the prospective analysis. In the subgroup of woman with recorded pregnancies, it could be shown that after 3.79 months of use (median) pregnancies were observed. In 67.72% in up to 3 months, in 16.36% between 3 and 6 months of use, in 7.27% between 7 and 9 months, in 5.45% between 10 and 12 months and in 1.82% between 13 and 15 months of use of the system. With this new web-based system, a precise determination of the fertile window even in women with ultralong cycles (>35days) could be detected independently of their personal live circumstances. Exact determination of the fertile window is herewith possible so that OvulaRing represents an evolution in the FAB method for the cycle diagnosis of women with regular, irregular or anovulatory menstrual cycles.

AB Objective: Sleep complaints are clinically expected in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep-wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).
   Methods: Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver's informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns.
   Results: A total of 4008 words were indexed where sleep took the 91st place of most important words. Sleep and wake were however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were: night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, and wake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were: huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a family' issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostly night was associatively conversed, the association of Routines, Managing, and Planning with sleep underscores the challenges faced.
   Conclusion: When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate sleep' but rather night' with FASD-characteristics. Increased sleep awareness combined with educational initiatives regarding sleep are advocated.

AB Objectives While being overweight (body mass index [BMI] >25) prior to pregnancy is linked to antenatal depression, whether weight is confounded by socioeconomic and/or medical risks is unclear.
   Study Design We assessed 66 healthy privately insured pregnant women at M = 35.0 +/- 3.3 weeks for symptoms of depression (Inventory for Depressive Symptoms-Self-Report (IDS-SR 30), lifetime history of depression and other psychiatric conditions (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), and pre-pregnancy BMI derived from pre-pregnancy weight (by recall) and directly measured height. Pre-pregnancy overweight (BMI > 25) and antenatal depression (score of mild or greater [14] on the IDS-SR 30) were assessed using logistic regression, controlling for past major depressive disorder(MDD) and demographic factors showing significant between group differences.
   Results Pre-pregnancy overweight (n = 17; 25.8%) was associated with an increased risk of third trimester depression, independent of past MDD and marital status (odds ratio = 7.47; 95% confidence interval [2.09-26.68]; B (standard error) = 2.010 [0.650]).
   Conclusion Replication in a larger sample is suggested to confirm an independent effect of pregravid overweight on third trimester depression.

AB Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suffer from concurrent medical symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) and sleeping problems. However, there is limited information on the correlation between co-morbidities and autistic behavioral symptoms. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of GI and sleep problems in Chinese ASD children, examined the impacts of GI and sleep problems on autistic behavioral symptoms, and investigated the factors associated with GI and sleep problems. The survey included 169 ASD and 172 healthy children. Data regarding demographic characteristics, GI symptoms, sleep disturbances and behavioral symptoms were collected through questionnaires. GI and sleep problems were prevalent in Chinese ASD children. Moreover, ASD children with GI symptoms reported more severe ASD core symptoms than others. Autistic children's GI symptoms were associated with maternal sleep problems during pregnancy, child's 0-6 month food sources and picky eating. ASD children with sleep disturbances had lower performance in daily living skills, social cognition, social communication and intellectual development than ASD children without sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances were associated with extra nutrient supply during lactation and feeding, and child's picky eating. Autistic children with GI or/and sleep problems may represent clinically relevant subtypes of ASD, for which targeted treatments may be needed.

AB Background: Gymnastics is a preferable safe exercise for postnatal women performing regularly.
   Objective: The aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to determine whether the aerobic gymnastic exercise improves stress, fatigue, sleep quality and depression in postpartum women.
   Design: Single-blinded, randomized controlled trial held from December 2014 until September 2015. Setting: Postnatal clinic of a medical center in southern Taiwan.
   Participants: 140 eligible postnatal women were systematically assigned, with a random start to experimental (n = 70) or a control (n = 70) group.
   Interventions: Engage in aerobic gymnastic exercise at least three times (15 min per section) a week for three months using compact disc in the home.
   Outcome measures: Perceived Stress Scale, Postpartum Fatigue Scale, Postpartum Sleep Quality Scale, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
   Results: In a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, the aerobic gymnastic exercise group showed significant decrease in fatigue after practicing exercise 4 weeks and the positive effects extended to the 12-week posttests. Paired t-tests revealed that aerobic gymnastic exercise participants had improved significantly in perceived stress and fatigue after 4 weeks gymnastic exercise; these positive effects extended to the 12-week posttests. In addition, the changes in physical symptoms-related sleep inefficiency after 12 weeks gymnastic exercise were significantly decreased in the experimental group compared with the control group.
   Relevance to clinical practice: The findings can be used to encourage postnatal women to perform moderate intensity gymnastic exercise in their daily life to reduce their stress, fatigue and improve sleep quality.

AB Purpose: Sudden infant death syndrome is the most common cause of death during the post-neonatal period. Factors such as sleeping position, bed sharing, pillow use, smoking during pregnancy and the breastfeeding period constitute risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome. This study aims to identify the risky behaviors of mothers with infants that may put their children at risk for sudden infant death syndrome.
   Design and methods: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was developed by the researchers. The questionnaire was filled out by 456 mothers who applied to the family health center between October 2014 and January 2015.
   Results: The greatest risk factor is the infant's sleeping position. A total of 77.9% of the mothers put their babies in bed in a non-supine position; 65.8% used a pillow when they put their babies in bed, 52.9% used a soft mattress, and 28.5% shared their beds with their babies. Prone sleeping was more likely to occur when smokewas present in the home or a pillow was used.
   Conclusion: Nurses should notify families of the risky behaviors that can cause sudden infant death syndromeand plan appropriate nursing care. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This propensity toward heightened insulin resistance in OSA patients has not been well characterized and may be related to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The aim of this study was to (1) assess the prevalence of OSA in pregnant women with GDM, (2) evaluate whether HPA axis dysregulation relates to OSA, and (3) investigate the relation between insulin resistance and OSA. We hypothesized that OSA is prevalent among pregnant women with GDM and that women with OSA will have higher levels of insulin resistance and dysregulation of the HPA axis.
   Methods: Twenty-five pregnant women in whom GDM was diagnosed were enrolled. Subjects answered sleep questionnaires and underwent in-home sleep studies using a level III device. The presence of OSA was defined by apnea-hypopnea index >= 5 events/h. Homeostasis Model Assessment of insulin resistance was derived from measurements of fasting glucose and C-peptide levels. Three salivary cortisol levels were obtained across 1 day to assess circadian variation. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between variables.
   Results: The sample consisted of 54% Caucasian pregnant women with a median body mass index of 36.1 and interquartile ratio of 10.6 kg/m(2). OSA was diagnosed in 17% of participants. Circadian variation of cortisol was preserved in women with OSA. Women with OSA displayed blunted cortisol awakening responses.
   Conclusions: OSA is prevalent in women with GDM. OSA is associated with preserved circadian variation and blunted cortisol awakening responses.

AB The life of a human female is characterized from teenage years by monthly menstruation which ceases (the menopause) typically between the age of 40 and 60 years. The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management. The standardization and harmonization of assays are being addressed. Many women now choose to develop their career before bearing children, and the health service has had to change services around this. This review does not cover screening for and tests during pregnancy. The review is timely since the population is aging and there will be more demand on healthcare services.

AB The Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family plays a central role in the generation and regulation of inflammatory responses, in both innate and adaptive immunity. Although the IL-1 molecules are traditionally considered to be classical proinflammatory cytokines, their functions are not restricted to inflammation, and they have also been shown to play a key role in a wide range of additional physiological and pathological functions, including learning modulation, sleep, pregnancy, depression, appetite, hematopoiesis, metabolism, and many others. Since their effect as cytokines and regulators of inflammation is so pleiotropic, any shift of the biological balance between agonistic and antagonistic signals has the potential to cause disease. Here, we consider the genetic influence of interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in the context of susceptibility to human diseases. We review known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL-1 genes linked to human diseases, and suggest how exploring biological effects of IL-1 gene cluster polymorphism may lead to new directions in understanding and diagnostic of disease and effective treatment.

AB Background: Sleep is one of the most basic human requirements. This research aims at determining the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life among high-risk pregnant women in Tabriz, Iran, in 2015.Materials and methods: This research was a sectional study done on 364 qualified women in 28-36 weeks of pregnancy suffering from mild preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The sampling was done as convenience. Personal-social-midwifery questionnaire, Pittsburg sleep quality, and quality of life in pregnancy (QOL-ORAV) were used for gathering data. Multivariate linear regression model was used for determining the relationship between sleep quality and its subsets with quality of life and controlling confounders.Findings: In the current study, the prevalence of sleep disturbance was 96.4%. Mean (SD) of the total score of sleep quality was 10.1 (4.1) and the total score of quality of life was 61.7 (17.3). According to Pearson's correlation test, there was statistically significant relationship between quality of life and sleep quality and all its subsets except sleep duration and use of sleep medication (p<0.001). Meanwhile, according to the multivariate linear regression model, sleep latency, day time dysfunction, health status, and home air-conditioning were related with quality of life.Discussion: The findings of current research show that sleep quality is low among high-risk pregnant women and quality of life is medium. So, it is necessary that required training is given by health cares for improving sleep quality and quality of life to mothers.

AB ObjectiveTo report maternal sleep practices in women who experienced a stillbirth compared with controls with ongoing live pregnancies at similar gestation.
   DesignProspective case-control study.
   SettingForty-one maternity units in the United Kingdom.
   PopulationWomen who had a stillbirth after 28weeks' gestation (n=291) and women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of interview (n=733).
   MethodsData were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire that included questions on maternal sleep practices before pregnancy, in the four weeks prior to, and on the night before the interview/stillbirth.
   Main outcome measuresMaternal sleep practices during pregnancy.
   ResultsIn multivariable analysis, supine going-to-sleep position the night before stillbirth had a 2.3-fold increased risk of late stillbirth [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.31, 95% CI 1.04-5.11] compared with the left side. In addition, women who had a stillbirth were more likely to report sleep duration less than 5.5hours on the night before stillbirth (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.68), getting up to the toilet once or less (aOR 2.81, 95% CI 1.85-4.26), and a daytime nap every day (aOR 2.22, 95% CI 1.26-3.94). No interaction was detected between supine going-to-sleep position and a small-for-gestational-age infant, maternal body mass index, or gestational age. The population-attributable risk for supine going-to-sleep position was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5-9.2).
   ConclusionsThis study confirms that supine going-to-sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. Further work is required to determine whether intervention(s) can decrease the frequency of supine going-to-sleep position and the incidence of late stillbirth.

AB Objective: To quantify the quality of life (QoL) and visit-specific satisfaction of pregnant women. Design: A prospective cohort within a practice-based research network (PBRN). Setting/locations: Individual chiropractic offices. Subjects: Pregnant women (age 18 years) attending chiropractic care. Intervention(s): Chiropractic care (i.e., The Webster Technique, spinal adjustments, and adjunctive therapies). Main outcome measures: The RAND VSQ9 to measure visit-specific satisfaction and the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS (R))-29 to measure QoL. Results: A convenience sample of 343 pregnant patients (average age=30.96 years) comprised their study population. They were highly educated with 75% attaining a 2-year associate's degree or higher. The pregnant patients presented for chiropractic care with a mean week of gestation of 25.67 weeks (median=28 weeks; range=0-42 weeks) and parity (i.e., the number of live births) of 0.92 live births (median=1; range=0-6). From baseline (i.e., at study entrance with minimum first visit) and comparative (i.e., following a course of chiropractic care), the VSQ9 measurements revealed increasingly high satisfaction on the part of the subjects (i.e., the mean difference of baseline minus comparative measures=-0.7322; p<0.005). The median number of visits (i.e., visits attended) at baseline and comparative measures was 1.00 (standard deviation [SD]=22.69) and 3.30 (SD=22.71), respectively. Across outcomes, QoL improved from baseline to comparative measurement after holding constant for visit number and time lapse, trimester of pregnancy, and care provider type. There was a reduction in mean T scores associated with fatigue (p<0.05), pain interference (p<0.05), sleep disturbance (p<0.05), and an improvement in satisfaction with social roles (p<0.05). A significant decrease was also found with pain interference (p<0.05). No evidence was found that anxiety (p=0.1404) or depression (p=0.8785) changed. Conclusion: A PBRN study was successfully implemented among chiropractors to find pregnant patients highly satisfied and their QoL scores improving with care beyond chance.

AB In two studies, the relationship between sleep and working memory performance was investigated in children born very preterm (i.e., gestation less than 32weeks) and the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. In Study 1, parent-reported measures of snoring, night-time sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness were collected on 89 children born very preterm aged 6 to 7years. The children completed a verbal working memory task, as well as measures of processing speed and verbal storage capacity. Night-time sleep quality was found to be associated with verbal working memory performance over and above the variance associated with individual differences in processing speed and storage capacity, suggesting that poor sleep may have an impact on the executive component of working memory. Snoring and daytime sleepiness were not found to be associated with working memory performance. Study 2 introduced a direct measure of executive functioning and examined whether sleep problems would differentially impact the executive functioning of children born very preterm relative to children born to term. Parent-reported sleep problems were collected on 43 children born very preterm and 48 children born to term (aged 6 to 9years). Problematic sleep was found to adversely impact executive functioning in the very preterm group, while no effect of sleep was found in the control group. These findings implicate executive dysfunction as a possible mechanism by which problematic sleep adversely impacts upon cognition in children born very preterm, and suggest that sleep problems can increase the cognitive vulnerability already experienced by many of these children.

AB Background: it is well established that fatherhood has a long term positive and protective effect on men's health. However, there is also evidence that the transition to fatherhood can be complex and demanding and can lead to distress, anxiety and increased risk of depression.
   Objective: this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of paternal postnatal depression, and to examine associations with a range of demographic and clinical factors.
   Methods: a cross-sectional study design was used to collect primary data from 100 fathers, whose partner gave birth to an infant in the previous 12 months. Data were collected using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
   Results: the prevalence of paternal postnatal depression was 12% using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale cut off score of 12 or above, when the cut off score was reduced to 9 or above the prevalence was 28%. The factors found to increase the risk of paternal postnatal depression included having an infant with sleep problems, a previous history of depression, a lack of social support, poor economic circumstances, not having paternity leave and not being married.
   Conclusion: the results add to the growing body of evidence that paternal postnatal mental health is a significant public health issue, and indicates a need for assessment and support for fathers during this life stage.

AB Pregnant women and their fetuses represent susceptible populations to environmental contaminants. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among pregnant women may contribute to adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth. Multiple previous studies have assessed airborne sources of PAHs among pregnant women but few have measured urinary PAH metabolites which can capture total. exposure through multiple routes. The aim of this study was to bridge this knowledge gap by assessing longitudinal urinary PAH metabolite concentrations over two time points in pregnancy cohorts in Boston (N = 200) and Puerto Rico (N = 50) to better understand exposure distributions throughout pregnancy and how they relate to demographic factors. Urine samples were analyzed for 1-NAP, 2-NAP, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 2,3-PHE, 4-PHE, 9-PHE, and 1-PYR. Concentrations of 2-NAP, 1-PYR, and 4-PHE were higher in Puerto Rico, while all other metabolites were present in higher concentrations in Boston. In Puerto Rico, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were weak to moderate, ranging from 0.06 to 0.42. PAH metabolite concentrations were significantly higher among younger, heavier (except 1-NAP and 9-PHE), and less educated individuals in Boston only. Consistent significant associations between PAH concentrations and measured covariates were not found in Puerto Rico. Our results suggest that potentially important differences in PAH exposure exist between these two populations. Additionally, our results indicate that multiple urinary measurements are required to accurately assess PAH exposure throughout pregnancy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Approximately 3.3% of women in pregnancy have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 4% of women postpartum PTSD. The impact of maternal PTSD during the perinatal period (from conception until one year postpartum) on child outcomes has not been systematically examined.
   Method: A systematic review was conducted to synthesize and critically evaluate quantitative research investigating the association between perinatal PTSD and child outcomes. Databases EMBASE, BNI, Medline, PsycInfo and CINAHL were searched using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Results: 26 papers reporting 21 studies were identified that examined associations between perinatal PTSD and postpartum birth outcomes, child development, and mother-infant relationship. Studies reviewed were heterogeneous, with poor-to-medium scores of methodological quality. Results showed that maternal postpartum PTSD is associated with low birth weight and lower rates of breastfeeding. Evidence for an association between maternal PTSD and preterm birth, fetal growth, head circumference, mother-infant interaction, the mother-infant relationship or child development is contradictory. Associations between maternal PTSD and infant salivary cortisol levels, and eating/sleeping difficulties are based on single studies, so require replication. Limitations: Methodological weaknesses of the studies included insufficient sample size, use of invalidated measures, and limited external validity.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that perinatal PTSD is linked with some negative child outcomes. Early screening for PTSD during the perinatal period may be advisable and onward referral for effective treatment, if appropriate. Future research using larger sample sizes, validated and reliable clinical interviews to assess PTSD, and validated measures to assess a range of child outcomes, is needed.

AB Background: Evidence suggests a relation between plasma tryptophan concentrations and sleep and mental wellbeing. As no studies have been performed in pregnant women, we studied the relation of plasma tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy with sleep quality, and mood during and after pregnancy.
   Methods: Pregnant women (n = 572) from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes study completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) at 26-28 weeks gestation and three months post-delivery. Plasma tryptophan concentrations were measured at 26-28 weeks gestation. Poisson regressions estimated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association between tryptophan and poor sleep quality (PSQI global score> 5), probable antenatal depression (EPDS = 15) and probable anxiety (STAI-state = 41) were calculated adjusting for covariates.
   Results: Mean plasma tryptophan concentrations was 48.0 ae mol/L (SD: 8.09). Higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a lower prevalence of antenatal poor sleep quality adjusting for covariates [PR: 0.88 (95% CI 0.80, 0.97) per 10 mu mol/L], especially in those participants who also suffered from anxiety symptoms [PR: 0.80 (95% CI 0.67, 0.95)]. No associations were observed between tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy and postnatal sleep quality or mental well-being. Limitation: Subjective measures were used to assess sleep and mental well-being.
   Conclusions: We observed that higher plasma tryptophan concentrations were associated with a 12% lower prevalence of poor sleep quality during pregnancy, in particular among those with anxiety symptoms. These findings suggest the importance of having adequate tryptophan concentrations during pregnancy.

AB Background: Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses following childbirth (i.e. "postpartum psychosis", PP) and there is a need to identify which factors underlie this increased risk. Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD).
   Methods: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss.
   Results: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47-2.97, p < 0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526).
   Limitations: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes.
   Conclusions: In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.

AB Greater fish consumption is associated with improved cognition among children, but the mediating pathways have not been well delineated. Improved sleep could be a candidate mediator of the fish-cognition relationship. This study assesses whether 1) more frequent fish consumption is associated with less sleep disturbances and higher IQ scores in schoolchildren, 2) such relationships are not accounted for by social and economic confounds, and 3) sleep quality mediates the fish-IQ relationship. In this cohort study of 541 Chinese schoolchildren, fish consumption and sleep quality were assessed at age 9-11 years, while IQ was assessed at age 12. Frequent fish consumption was related to both fewer sleep problems and higher IQ scores. A dose-response relationship indicated higher IQ scores in children who always (4.80 points) or sometimes (3.31 points) consumed fish, compared to those who rarely ate fish (all p < 0.05). Sleep quality partially mediated the relationship between fish consumption and verbal, but not performance, IQ. Findings were robust after controlling for multiple sociodemographic covariates. To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that frequent fish consumption may help reduce sleep problems (better sleep quality), which may in turn benefit long-term cognitive functioning in children.

AB Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. Maternal position affects FBS with supine position being associated with an increased likelihood of fetal quiescence consistent with the human fetus adapting to a lower oxygen consuming state. Several studies have now confirmed the association between sleep position and risk of late intrauterine death. We designed this study to observe the effects of maternal sleep positions overnight in healthy late gestation pregnancy. Twenty-nine healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings overnight. Two blinded observers assigned fetal states in 5min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Maternal position was determined from infrared video recording. Compared to state 2F (active sleep), 4F (active awake-high activity) occurred almost exclusively when the mother was in a left or right lateral position. State 1F (quiet sleep) was more common when the mother was supine [odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.52] and less common on the maternal right side with the left being the referent position (OR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.70-0.93). State 4F was more common between 21.00 and 01.00h than between 01.00 and 07.00h (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.32-3.47). In each fetal state, maternal position had significant effects on fetal heart rate and measures of FHRV. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal sleep position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are probably fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.
   Fetal behavioural state in healthy late gestation pregnancy is significantly affected by maternal position overnight. Maternal left lateral position is the one most frequently adopted at sleep onset. The maternal position at sleep onset is maintained the longest overnight. Fetal state 1F is more common in maternal supine positions overnight. Fetal state 4F is less common in maternal supine sleep positions. Fetal state and maternal sleep position are independently associated with fetal heart rate variability. Maternal sleep position significantly affects fetal heart rate and heart rate variability and affects circadian fetal heart rate patterns.

AB Background: Depression during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal morbidity and mortality, and subsequent possible adverse effects on the cognitive, emotional and behavioral development of the child. The aim of the study was to identify maternal characteristics associated with poor mental health, in a group of overweight/obese pregnant women in nine European countries, and thus, to contribute to better recognition and intervention for maternal depression.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, baseline data from early pregnancy (< 20 weeks) of the DALI (Vitamin D and Lifestyle Intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention) study were analyzed. Maternal mental health was assessed with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Women were classified as having a low (WHO-5 <= 50) or high wellbeing.
   Results.: A total of 735 pregnant women were included. The prevalence of having a low wellbeing was 27.2%, 95% CI [24.0, 30.4]. Multivariate analysis showed independent associations between low wellbeing and European ethnicity, OR = .44, 95% CI [.25, .77], shift work, OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.11, 2.93], insufficient sleep, OR = 3.30, 95% CI [1.96, 5.55], self-efficacy, OR = .95, 95% CI [.92, .98], social support, OR = .94, 95% CI [.90, .99], and pregnancy-related worries (socioeconomic: OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.02, 1.15]; health: OR = 1.06, 95% CI [1.01, 1.11]; relationship: OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.05, 1.31]).
   Conclusions: Mental health problems are common in European overweight/obese pregnant women. The identified correlates might help in early recognition and subsequent treatment of poor mental health problems during pregnancy. This is important to reduce the unfavorable effects of poor mental health on pregnancy outcomes.

AB The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity has increased in most countries the last decades. Considering this in a simplistic way, we can say that obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Moreover, the environment from conception to childhood could influence the child's future health. The first 1000 days of life start with woman's pregnancy, and offer a unique window of opportunity to contribute to obesity prevention. In light of the actual literature, the aim of our article is to discuss a proposal of 10 good practices to minimize obesity in the first 1000 days emerging from published science. (1) Both the mother's and the father's behaviors are important. A balanced diet with appropriate fat and protein intake, and favoring fruits and vegetables, is recommended for both parents during the conception period and pregnancy. Furthermore, overweight obese women who are planning to become pregnant should reduce their weight before conception. (2) During pregnancy, at birth, and during early life, body composition measurements are crucial to monitor the baby's growth. (3) Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended at the beginning of life until six months of age. (4) Four to six months of age is the optimal window to introduce complementary feeding. Until one year of age, breast milk or follow-on commercial formula is the main recommended feeding source, and cow's milk should be avoided until one year of age. (5) Fruit and vegetable introduction should begin early. Daily variety, diversity in a meal, and repeated exposure to the food, up to eight times, are efficient strategies to increase acceptance of food not well accepted at first. There is no need to add sugar, salt, or sugary fluids to the diet. (6) Respect the child's appetite and avoid coercive "clean your plate" feeding practices. Adapt the portion of food and don't use food as reward for good behavior. (7) Limit animal protein intake in early life to reduce the risk of an early adiposity rebound. Growing-up milk for children between one and three years of age should be preferred to cow's milk, in order to limit intake and meet essential fatty acid and iron needs. (8) The intake of adequate fat containing essential fatty acids should be promoted. (9) Parents should be role models when feeding, with TV and other screens turned-off during meals. (10) Preventive interventions consisting of promoting physical activity and sufficient time dedicated to sleep should be employed. In fact, short sleep duration may be associated with increased risk of developing obesity. Based on literature reviews, and given the suggestions described in this manuscript, concerted public health efforts are needed to achieve the healthy objectives for obesity and nutrition, and to fight the childhood obesity epidemic.

AB This study aimed to identify the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to examine its associations with social and behavioral factors, maternal body mass index (BMI), anemia, and hypertension. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed on data collected from 2345 pregnant women from 16 hospitals in five selected provinces in mainland China. Results: Prevalence of GDM was as follows: overall: 3.7%; pregnant women in the first pregnancy: 3.4%; pregnant women in the second pregnancy: 4.6%. Compared with early pregnancy women, late-stage pregnant women were more likely to have GDM (OR = 4.32, 95% CI (1.82, 10.27)). Compared with 18-25 years old pregnant women, women aged 36-45 years were more likely to have GDM (OR = 3.98, 95% CI (1.41, 11.28). Compared with non-hypertensive patients, hypertensive patients were more likely to have GDM (OR = 6.93, 95% CI (1.28, 37.64)). However, second pregnancy, high maternal BMI, prolonged screen time (TV-viewing time, computer-using time, and mobile-phone using time), insufficient and excessive sleep duration, poor sleep quality, smoking, and secondhand smoke exposure were not significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Conclusions: Women in the second pregnancy do not appear to predict an increased risk for developing GDM than women in the first pregnancy. High-risk groups of GDM included women in their late pregnancy, aged 36-45 years old, and with hypertension. The findings will contribute to an improved understanding of social and behavioral determinants of GDM in Chinese population and contribute to the development of health-prevention promotion interventions to address GDM.

AB The objective of the current study was to compare general health in pregnant women with gestational diabetes and healthy pregnant women. The method of this study was descriptive following a casual-comparative design. The statistical population included 9666 pregnant women referred to healthcare centers in Zahedan in 2016. The method of sampling was multistage cluster sampling, such that among all healthcare centers in Zahedan, 5 healthcare centers were randomly selected. Afterwards, using the convenience sampling method, the research questionnaires were distributed among 50 pregnant women with a history of gestational diabetes and 50 healthy pregnant women without such a history. To collect data, Goldberg and Hillier General Health Questionnaire (1979) was used. The results of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that somatic symptoms, anxiety symptoms/sleep disorders, and depression symptoms were more prevalent among women with gestational diabetes compared to healthy pregnant women (P <= 0.05). However, considering social dysfunction symptoms, no significant difference was found between these two groups of pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes (P >= 0.05).

AB The phenomenon of delayed childbearing in general, and of the increasing age of women using assisted reproduction techniques (ART) in particular, occurs in all Western countries. This article addresses the question of a maximum legal age for accessing ART. We argue that the question of setting a maternal age limit is related to the cultural context and is influenced by social representations of motherhood. The dominant discourses around the question of the necessity of an age limit are inevitably infused with social expectations. First, the arguments in favour of and against setting a maternal age limit will be analysed, such as reproductive autonomy, equality, the wellbeing of the child and her parents, the best interests of women, and the State's responsibility. Secondly, the principal models adopted in Western countries will be explored. Three models of normative frameworks can be identified: in the first, an explicit maternal age limit of eligibility has been set by law. In the second, such a limit has not been set explicitly, but 'soft' legal conditions, guidelines, and financial coverage restrictions have been introduced. In the third, no maternal age conditions have been stipulated at all. Thirdly, the possible grounds or explanations underlying these frameworks will be discussed. To this extent, arguments such as reproductive autonomy, nature, and the child's welfare will be analysed, as well as some political factors as pro-natalist policy and the issue of financial coverage.

AB Aim/Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological and sleep disorder. Metabolic disorders are known to be related to sleep disorders. We prospectively evaluated whether obesity and its possible cofactors were related to the presence of RLS.
   Materials and Methods: The study included 143 obese and 94 non-obese individuals. Obese patients had a BMI of 30 and over, while non-obese patients had a BMI lower than 30. Patients with arthritis and pregnancy were excluded but not those with diabetes mellitus. Participants who met diagnostic criteria recommended by the International RLS Study Group were diagnosed as having RLS. Depression, anxiety, daytime sleepiness, insomnia and sleep quality were evaluated in detail.
   Results: The mean age of obese patients was 40.52years and that of non-obese patients was 39.76years. The mean body mass index was 36.77 in the obese group and 25.71 in the non-obese group. The occurrence of depression, anxiety, sleep quality, and insomnia scores were significantly higher in obese individuals. The evaluations of daytime sleepiness, sleep efficiency and sleep latency were not significantly different between the groups.
   Discussion: Although the presence of RLS was correlated with obesity and vascular risk factors at a significant level, it was also shown that depression, anxiety and insomnia were significantly frequent in obese patients (although not daytime sleepiness). Further studies are needed.

AB Several studies have shown that mental health is positively associated with religious orientation, cognitive-emotional regulation and sleep quality. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between university students' anxiety and depression with religious orientation, quality of sleep and their emotional cognitive adjustment. The statistical population of this study included all students of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. A total number of 235 students participated in the study. The psychological characteristics of volunteers, including their psychological health, stress level, and sleep/awakening, were measured by interviewing. Beck Anxiety and Depression questionnaire, Granefski's Cognitive Emotion questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Allport and Ross Questionnaire were used to collect required data; collected data was analyzed using Spss-v21, Pearson correlation coefficient and stepwise regression analysis. Based on the results of the present study, internal and external religious orientation - accounted for 57-61% of changes in depression variance, 53-54% changes in anxiety variance, 29-38% of changes in sleep quality variance, and 12-14% of changes in emotional cognitive regulation variance. The findings of the present study showed that the more external the religious orientation, the higher the level of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality; additionally, the more internal the religious orientation, the lower the level of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. However, the more internal the religious orientation, the higher the level of emotional cognitive regulation and the more external the religious orientation, the lower the level of emotional cognitive adjustment. Students' mental health promotion depends on their beliefs, their sleep quality and their emotional cognitive configurations. In this regard, it is necessary to pay more attention to the teaching of theoretical, psychological, religious and cognitive principles regarding the quality of students' sleep.

AB Sleep and pregnancy are dynamic processes with unique and evolving physiological substrates. Given the restorative hypothesis of sleep as an anabolic process essential for cellular and tissue regeneration, the largely unexplored role of sleep in gestational physiology and pregnancy outcomes promises to be a fascinating topic. Emerging literature suggests that objectively measured or self-reported short sleep duration may be a risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), gestational hypertension, and cesarean delivery. In this review, we discuss obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS), two sleep disorders prevalent in pregnancy. OSA is especially likely in high-risk pregnancy where it is associated with comorbid cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances. We review new data strongly suggesting that OSA is an independent risk factor for GDM and gestational hypertension. It remains to be seen if sleep disruption, whether or not in the context of gestational RLS and gestational OSA, is a modifiable factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Clinicians are encouraged to query sleep symptoms in pregnant women and to have a low threshold to pursue investigations for OSA, including the subjective symptoms of snoring, witnessed apneas, and daytime sleepiness, and also medical comorbidities, such as chronic hypertension.

AB Background: For many women, pregnancy-related sleep disturbances and pregnancy-related anxiety change as pregnancy progresses and both are associated with lower maternal quality of life and less favorable birth outcomes. Thus, the interplay between these two problems across pregnancy is of interest. In addition, psychological resilience may explain individual differences in this association, as it may promote coping with both sleep disturbances and anxiety, and thereby reduce their mutual effects. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to examine whether sleep quality and sleep duration, and changes in sleep are associated with the level of and changes in anxiety during pregnancy. Furthermore, the study tested the moderating effect of resilience on these associations.
   Methods: At gestational weeks 14, 24, and 34, 532 pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study in Finland filled out questionnaires on general sleep quality, sleep duration and pregnancy-related anxiety; resilience was assessed in week 14.
   Results: Parallel process latent growth curve models showed that shorter initial sleep duration predicted a higher initial level of anxiety, and a higher initial anxiety level predicted a faster shortening of sleep duration. Changes in sleep duration and changes in anxiety over the course of pregnancy were not related. The predicted moderating effect of resilience was not found.
   Conclusions: The results suggested that pregnant women reporting anxiety problems should also be screened for sleeping problems, and vice versa, because women who experienced one of these pregnancy-related problems were also at risk of experiencing or developing the other problem.

AB The late gestation fetal ECG (fECG) has traditionally been difficult to characterize due to the low fECG signal relative to high maternal noise. Although new technologies have improved the feasibility of its acquisition and separation, little is known about its development in late gestation, a period in which the fetal heart undergoes extensive maturational changes. Here, we describe a method for the chronic implantation of radiotelemetry devices into late gestation ovine fetuses to characterize parameters of the fECG following surgery, throughout late gestation, and in the perinatal period. We found no significant changes in mean aortic pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), or ECG in the 5 days following implantation; however, HR decreased in the first 24 h following the end of surgery, with associated increases in RR, PR, and QRS intervals. Over the last 14 days of fetal life, fetal MAP significantly increased, and HR significantly decreased, as expected. MAP and HR increased as labor progressed. Although there were no significant changes over time in the ECG during late gestation, the duration of the PR interval initially decreased and then increased as birth approached. These results indicate that although critical maturational changes occur in the late gestation fetal myocardium, the mechanisms that control the cardiac conduction are relatively mature in late gestation. The study demonstrates that radiotelemetry can be successfully used to assess fetal cardiac function, in particular conduction, through the process of labor and delivery, and may therefore be a useful tool for study of peripartum cardiac events.

AB background: Excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems are likely to emerge from the complex interplay of various factors.
   Aims: To investigate the role of infant (e.g., temperament), maternal (e.g., anxiety and depressive disorders), and familial (e.g., social support) factors as potential precursors of infant regulatory problems.
   Study Design: Prospective-longitudinal study. Subjects: 286 mother-infant dyads were investigated from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum via questionnaires and interviews.
   Outcome measures: Regulatory problems at 2, 4 and 16 months postpartum assessed by standardized diagnostic interviews.
   Results: Fussy infant temperament and maternal anxiety disorders were associated with excessive infant crying (OR=1.16, 95%CI:1.05-1.29, OR=3.28, 95%CI:1.16-9.26) and feeding problems (OR=1.05, 95%CI:1.01-1.11, OR=2.27, 95%CI:1.36-3.80) whereas maternal depressive disorders were associated with infant sleeping problems (OR=2.55, 95%CI:1.06-6.11). Moreover, high maternal age (OR=0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.98) was associated with a lower risk for excessive crying and being a single mother (OR=0.16, 95%CI:0.03-0.73) and cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions (OR: 0.59, 95%CI:0.36-0.96) was associated with a lower risk for sleeping problems.
   Conclusion: Excessive infant crying and feeding problems may be related to interactional deficits of anxious mothers who perceive their infants as "difficult" during soothing or feeding situations. Sleeping problems may be transmitted already during pregnancy by an altered sleep-wake-rhythm of mothers with a history of depression or by a genetic predisposition. Therapeutic interventions should focus on maternal anxiety and depression, behavior management techniques to cope with difficult situations with "fussy" infants and potential protective factors (e.g. favorable maternal emotion regulation) to address crying, feeding and sleeping problems.

AB After childbirth, women may develop symptoms of depression with the associated sleep disturbances. This study assessed the relationship between insomnia and both depression symptoms and blood estradiol levels in women during the early postpartum period. 84 patients were assessed 24-48 h after labor. The main assessment methods were the following psychometric scales: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Serum estradiol levels were measured using ELISA assay. Women who developed postpartum insomnia significantly more often reported insomnia during pregnancy (P = 0.001), were more likely to have suffered from depression in the past (P = 0.007) and had significantly higher BDI (P = 0.002) and EPDS (P = 0.048) scores. Our study demonstrated no significant association between Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and postpartum insomnia. The groups of women with and without postpartum RLS showed no significant differences in the incidence of postpartum insomnia. No significant differences in estradiol levels were observed in women with and without postpartum insomnia. The study showed the following factors to play a major role in development of postpartum insomnia: an increase in Beck Depression Inventory score, a history of depression and a history of insomnia during pregnancy.

AB This review aims to evaluate the performance of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) screening questionnaires during pregnancy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using MEDLINE Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane library. A bivariate meta-analysis was applied for pooling of diagnostic parameters. Six of the total 4719 articles met the inclusion criteria. The Berlin questionnaire (BQ, N = 604) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS, N = 420) were the most frequently used screening tools during pregnancy. The pooled prevalence of OSA during pregnancy was 26.7% (95% CI: 16.9%, 34.4%, I-2 = 83.15%). BQ performance was poor to fair with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.83; I-2 = 78.65%) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.75; I-2 = 81.55%), respectively. BQ performance was heterogeneous depending on type of reference test and pregnancy. Sensitivity increased if diagnosis was based on polysomnography (0.90), and respiratory disturbance index (0.90). However, sensitivity decreased if screening was performed in early pregnancy (<= 20 weeks gestation: 0.47), and high-risk pregnancy (0.44). Performance of ESS was poor with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.56; I-2 = 32.8%) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.75; I-2 = 81.55%), respectively. In conclusion, BQ and ESS showed poor performance during pregnancy, hence a new OSA screening questionnaire is needed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: To examine oxidative & nitrosative stress (O & NS) biomarkers at the end of term in relation to perinatal affective symptoms, neuro-immune biomarkers and pregnancy-related outcome variables.
   Methods: We measured plasma advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), -sulfhydryl (-SH), peroxides (LOOH) and paraoxonase (PON)1 activity in pregnant women with and without prenatal depression and non-pregnant controls.
   Results: Pregnancy is accompanied by significantly increased AOPP and NOx, and lowered TRAP, -SH and LOOH. Increased O & NS and lowered LOOH and -SH levels are associated with prenatal depressive and physiosomatic symptoms (fatigue, pain, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal symptoms). Increased AOPP and NOx are significantly associated with lowered -SH, TRAP and zinc, and with increased haptoglobin and C-reactive protein levels. Increased O & NS and lowered TRAP and PON 1 activity, at the end of term predict mother (e.g. hyperpigmentation, labor duration,'caesarian section, cord length, breast milk flow) and baby (e.g. sleep and feeding problems) outcome characteristics.
   Conclusions: Pregnancy is accompanied by interrelated signs of O & NS, lowered antioxidant defenses and activated neuro-immune pathways. Increased O & NS at the end of term is associated with perinatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms and may predict obstetric and behavioral complications in mother and baby.

AB We examined the effect of chronic prenatal alcohol exposure on certain neuronal systems involved with the sleep-wake cycle of C57BL/6J mice exposed to prenatal alcohol once they had reached 56 days post-natal. Pregnant mice were exposed to alcohol, through oral gavage, on gestational days 7-16, with recorded blood alcohol concentration (BAC)s averaging 1.84 mg/ml (chronic alcohol group, CA). Two control groups, an oral gavage sucrose control group (chronic alcohol control group, CAc) and a non-treated control group (NTc), were also examined. At 56 days post-natal, the pups from each group were sacrificed and the whole brain sectioned in a coronal plane and immunolabeled for cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), serotonin (5HT) and orexin-A (OxA) which labels cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic structures respectively. The overall nuclear organization and neuronal morphology were identical in all three groups studied, and resemble that previously reported for laboratory rodents. Quantification of the estimated numbers of ChAT immunopositive (+) neurons of the pons, the TH+ neurons of the pons and the OxA+ neurons of the hypothalamus showed no statistically significant difference between the three experimental groups. The stereologically estimated areas and volumes of OxA+ neurons in the CA group were statistically significantly larger than the groups not exposed to prenatal alcohol, but the ChAT+ neurons in the CA group were statistically significantly smaller. The density of orexinergic boutons in the anterior cingulate cortex was lower in the CA group than the other groups. No statistically significant difference was found in the area and volume of TH+ neurons between the three experimental groups. These differences are discussed in relation to the sleep disorders recorded in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).

AB Background: An increasing number of children are exposed to road traffic noise levels that may lead to adverse effects on health and daily functioning. Childhood is a period of intense growth and brain maturation, and children may therefore be especially vulnerable to road traffic noise. The objective of the present study was to examine whether road traffic noise was associated with reported inattention symptoms in children, and whether this association was mediated by sleep duration.
   Methods: This study was based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Parental reports of children's inattention at age 8 were linked to modelled levels of residential road traffic noise. We investigated the association between inattention and noise exposure during pregnancy (n = 1934), noise exposure averaged over 5 years (age 3 to 8 years; n = 1384) and noise exposure at age 8 years (n = 1384), using fractional logit response models. The participants were children from Oslo, Norway.
   Results: An association with inattention at age 8 years was found for road traffic noise exposure at age 8 years (coef = .0083, CI = [.0012, .0154]; 1.2% point increase in inattention score per 10 dB increase in noise level), road traffic noise exposure average for the last 5 years (coef = .0090, CI = [.0016, .0164]; 1.3% point increase/10 dB), and for pregnancy road traffic noise exposure for boys (coef = .0091, CI = [.0010, .0171]), but not girls (coef = -.0021, CI = [-.0094, .0053]). Criteria for doing mediation analyses were not fulfilled.
   Conclusion: Results indicate that road traffic noise has a negative impact on children's inattention. We found no mediation by sleep duration.

ID ETHIOPIA
AB Background: Malaria is the leading cause of disease burden across the world, especially in African countries. Ethiopia has designed a five year (2011-2015) plan to cover 100% of the households in malarious areas with one insecticide treated net (ITN) for every two persons, and to raise consistent ITN utilization to at least 80%. However, evidence on ownership of ITN among malarious rural households in northwest Ethiopia is quite limited. Hence, the present study aimed at assessing ownership of ITN and associated factors among rural households at risk of malaria at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site, northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: A cross sectional re-census was carried out in Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site during peak malaria seasons from October to December, 2014. Data for 15,088 households at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site were used for the analysis. Descriptive measures and binary logistic regression were carried out.
   Results: Among those who owned at least one ITN, 53.4% were living at an altitude > 2500 m above sea level. However, out of households living at an altitude <2000 m above sea level, 15.8% (95% CI 14.4%, 17.3%) owned ITN at an average of 4.3 +/- 2.1 persons per ITN. Of these, 69.5% (95% CI 64.7%, 74.1%) used the ITN. Among utilizing households at malarious areas, 23.7% prioritized pregnant women and 31.4% children to use ITN. The availability of radio receiver/mobile (AOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08, 2.35) and secondary/above educational status of household member (AOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19, 2.04) were predictors of ownership of ITN.
   Conclusion: Rural households at risk of malaria did not own a sufficient number of ITN though the utilization is promising. Moreover, prioritizing children and pregnant women to sleep under ITN remains public health problems. Programmers, partners and implementers should consider tailored intervention strategy stratified by altitude in distributing ITN. ITN distribution should also be accompanied by using exhaustive promotion strategies that consider people without access to any source of information, and educating households to prioritize pregnant and under five children to sleep under ITN.

AB Background: Despite the known effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in providing protection against malaria, high level of ownership and use are very difficult to achieve and maintain. Nearly 40,000 LLINs were distributed in 2014 as an intervention tool against malaria transmission in 80 villages of Keshkal sub-district in Chhattisgarh, India. This study assessed LLIN coverage, access, utilization pattern, and key determinants for the net use 1 year after mass distribution.
   Methods: In 2015, a cross-sectional household survey was carried out in 80 study clusters (whole village or part of village). From each cluster, 40 households were randomly selected and interviewed using a structured questionnaire adapted from the malaria indicator survey of Roll Back Malaria guidelines. Information on demographic characteristics, LLIN ownership, and its use on the night before the survey, and physical condition of LLINs were recorded.
   Results: 2970 households were interviewed with a total of 15,003 individuals present in the households during the night before the survey. Nearly 98% of households had at least one LLIN and 59.4% of the surveyed population reportedly used an LLIN the previous night. LLIN use varied from 41 to 94% between the study clusters. Nearly 89% of the LLINs were found in good physical condition (without holes). However, proportion of household with at least one LLIN per two persons was only 39%.
   Conclusion: Universal coverage of LLINs was inadequate in the study clusters making it difficult for all household members to use an LLIN. LLIN use varied between clusters and was highest in children under 5 years of age. Health education campaigns and creating awareness about the benefit of sleeping under the LLINs in providing protection against malaria is required not only to high risk groups of pregnant women and children below 5 years of age but all the members of the family to have an epidemiological impact of this intervention at the community level. Relatively high net use despite poor access to LLINs indicates an overall desire to use nets when they are available. The main barrier to increased use of nets is the low coverage at household level.

AB Introduction Women at high inherited risk of ovarian cancer are advised to undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) at age 40-45 years or when their families are complete. Most women are premenopausal at this age, so RRBSO will induce surgical menopause. Despite the clear benefits of RRBSO for cancer risk reduction, much less is known about the impact on non-cancer outcomes that contribute to health and well-being and inform surveillance and management strategies.
   Methods and analysis This will be a multicentre, prospective cohort study of 105 premenopausal high-risk women undergoing RRBSO and an age-matched comparison group of 105 premenopausal women not planning oophorectomy or pregnancy in the next 2 years. The aim of this study is to measure the impact of RRBSO on sexual function (primary outcome) at 24 months in high-risk premenopausal women compared with the comparison group. Secondary outcomes include menopausal symptoms and menopause-related quality of life, mood, sleep quality, markers of cardiovascular disease and pre-diabetes, bone density and markers of bone turnover, and the impact of hormone replacement therapy use on these outcomes. Data analysis methods will include logistic and linear regression using general estimating equations accounting for the repeated outcome measurements within each participant.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by institutional ethics committees at each participating centre. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and national and international networks of centres managing high-risk women, and will inform national and international clinical guidelines.

AB Introduction. One indicator for fetal risk of mortality is intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Whether markers reflecting the impact of growth restriction on the cardiovascular system, computed from a Doppler-derived heart rate signal, would be suitable for its detection antenatally was studied. Material and methods. We used a cardiotocography archive of 1163 IUGR cases and 1163 healthy controls, matched for gestation and gender. We assessed the discriminative power of short-term variability and long-term variability of the fetal heart rate, computed over episodes of high and low variation aiming to separate growth-restricted fetuses from controls. Metrics characterizing the sleep state distribution within a trace were also considered for inclusion into an IUGR detection model. Results. Significant differences in the risk markers comparing growth-restricted with healthy fetuses were found. When used in a logistic regression classifier, their performance for identifying IUGR was considerably superior before 34 weeks of gestation. Long-term variability in active sleep was superior to short-term variability [area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 72% compared with 71%]. Most predictive was the number of minutes in high variation per hour (AUC of 75%). A multivariate IUGR prediction model improved the AUC to 76%. Conclusion. We suggest that heart rate variability markers together with surrogate information on sleep states can contribute to the detection of early-onset IUGR.

AB Evidence on the association between sleep, diet, and eating behaviors in pregnant women is lacking. We examine this in a cohort of apparently healthy pregnant women. At 26-28 weeks gestation, 497 participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep and a 24-h recall to assess dietary intake. Diet quality was assessed by the Healthy Eating Index for pregnant women in Singapore (HEI-SGP) score and previously derived dietary patterns (vegetables-fruit-rice, seafood-noodles, and pasta-cheese-meat pattern). Eating behaviors studied included the longest night-time fasting interval, frequency of consumption occasions, energy from discretionary foods, and nighttime eating. Adjusted means were estimated between poor/good quality and short/normal sleepers using linear regressions, including covariates. Good sleep quality versus poor sleep quality, was associated with better diet quality (mean HEI-SGP 54.6 vs. 52.0; p = 0.032), greater adherence to the vegetables-fruit-rice pattern (mean 0.03 vs. -0.15; p = 0.039), lesser adherence to the seafood-noodle pattern (mean -0.14 vs. 0.03; p = 0.024), and a trending lower calories from discretionary foods (mean 330.5 vs. 382.6 kcal; p = 0.073), after adjusting for covariates. After additional adjustment for anxiety, only sleep quality and the seafood-noodle pattern remained significantly associated (p = 0.018). Short sleep was not associated with any diet or eating behavior. In conclusion, good sleep quality is associated with a better diet quality and a greater adherence to the vegetable-fruit-rice pattern, but with lesser adherence to the seafood-noodle diets in pregnant women.

AB Objectives: Sleep apnea in pregnancy is known to adversely affect birth outcomes. Whether in utero exposure to maternal sleep apnea is associated with long-term childhood consequences is unclear.
   Methods: Population-based longitudinal study of singleton infants born during 2002-2012 was conducted using linked birth, hospital, death, developmental, and educational records from New South Wales, Australia. Maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy was identified from hospital records. Outcomes were mortality and hospitalizations up to age 6, developmental vulnerability in the first year of school (aged 5-6 years), and performance on standardized tests in the third year of school (aged 7-9 years). Cox proportional hazards and modified Poisson regression models were used to calculate hazard and risk ratios for outcomes in children exposed to maternal apnea compared with those not exposed.
   Results: Two hundred nine of 626 188 singleton infants were exposed to maternal sleep apnea. Maternal apnea was not significantly associated with mortality (Fisher's exact p = .48), developmental vulnerability (adjusted RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.75-2.21), special needs status (1.58; 0.61-4.07), or low numeracy test scores (1.03; 0.63-1.67) but was associated with low reading test scores (1.55; 1.08-2.23). Maternal apnea significantly increased hospitalizations in the first year of life (adjusted HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.40-2.34) and between the first and sixth birthdays (1.41; 1.14-1.75). This is partly due to admissions for suspected pediatric sleep apnea.
   Conclusions: Maternal sleep apnea during pregnancy is associated with poorer childhood health. Its impact on developmental and cognitive outcomes warrants further investigation.

AB Objective: To examine the relation of the health-related practices of expectant mothers during pregnancy and fatigue in mother and prenatal attachment.
   Study Design: Descriptive study.
   Place and Duration of Study: Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, between February and April 2016.
   Methodology: The study sample consisted of pregnant women (at least 20-week gestation) aged 18 years or above (n=211) who applied to prenatal care services and agreed to participate in the study. The data were collected through a Personal Information Form, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and the Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI).
   Results: The PAI medians of the participants were 55 [42-64], and the BFI medians were 30 [23-42], and a negative, statistically significant relationship was found between BFI and PAI (r= -0.184, p=0.007).
   Conclusion: Expectant mothers who develop positive health behaviors during pregnancy feel less fatigue and positively affect the prenatal attachment. It is important to evaluate prenatal attachment and identify the mother with low attachment scores.

AB Background: Women with diabetes experience an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
   Aim: We aim to describe and quantify the psychological impact of the diagnosis of diabetes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to each other and to their counterparts without diabetes.
   Design: This is a survey-based study with prospective collection of pregnancy outcome data.
   Methods: A total of 218 pregnant women (50% with diabetes) were administered questionnaires relating to psychological health. Maternal and neonatal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were collected. Associations between key psychometric and health outcome variables were examined.
   Results: At least 25% of women in all three pregnancy groups had scores indicating affective distress in at least one domain. Compared to those with type 1 diabetes, women with GDM evidenced a greater number of uplifts in pregnancy (U = 94, P = 0.041), but also higher levels of overall anxiety (U = 92, P = 0.03) and stress (U = 82, P < 0.01). Women with GDM also had significantly elevated overall depression scores, compared with the control group (U = 34, P = 0.02). Both groups of women with diabetes had clinically elevated levels of diabetes-related distress. There were no associations between maternal psychological variables and pregnancy outcomes.
   Conclusions: This work highlights a potential role for targeted psychological interventions to address and relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women with diabetes.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was shown to be associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, prevalence of OSA in GDM women, its relationship to metabolic control, and predictive factors have not been studied.
   Material and methods: Eighty-two obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation participated. The Berlin questionnaire was used to assess OSA symptoms. OSA was diagnosed using an overnight monitor. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were obtained. Those with OSA underwent meal tolerance test (MTT) to assess their metabolic parameters. Classification tree analysis was used to develop a screening tool for OSA.
   Results: At a median gestational age of 29 weeks, OSA was diagnosed in 52.4% of the women, with a median apnea hypopnea index of 9.4 (interquartile range 6.4, 12.4). More severe OSA was significantly correlated with higher fasting glucose but not HbA1c. For those with OSA, sleep parameters related to oxygen desaturation significantly correlated with higher fasting insulin resistance and more severe b-cell dysfunction, as evaluated by MTT. A screening tool involving two variables, neck circumference and Berlin Questionnaire score, was developed. The sensitivity and specificity were 86% and 51%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%.
   Conclusion: OSA is prevalent in obese pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM in the late second to early third trimester. OSA severity, especially the degree of oxygen desaturation, correlated with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and b-cell function. A simple screening tool involving the Berlin Questionnaire and neck circumference can aid in predicting OSA in this patient group. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of a 15-month intervention on dietary intake conducted among obesity-prone normal-weight pre-school children.
   Design: Information on dietary intake was obtained using a 4 d diet record. A diet quality index was adapted to assess how well children's diet complied with the Danish national guidelines. Linear regression per protocol and intention-to-treat analyses of differences in intakes of energy, macronutrients, fruit, vegetables, fish, sugar-sweetened beverages and diet quality index between the two groups were conducted.
   Setting: The Healthy Start study was conducted during 2009-2011, focusing on changing diet, physical activity, sleep and stress management to prevent excessive weight gain among Danish children.
   Subjects: From a population of 635 Danish pre-school children, who had a high birth weight (>= 4000 g), high maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (>= 28.0 kg/m(2)) or low maternal educational level (<10 years of schooling), 285 children completed the intervention and had complete information on dietary intake.
   Results: Children in the intervention group had a lower energy intake after the 15-month intervention (group means: 5.29 v. 5.59 MJ, P = 0.02) compared with the control group. We observed lower intakes of carbohydrates and added sugar in the intervention group compared with the control group after the intervention (P = 0.002, P = 0.01).
   Conclusions: The intervention resulted in a lower energy intake, particularly from carbohydrates and added sugar after 15 months of intervention, suggesting that dietary intake can be changed in a healthier direction in children predisposed to obesity.

AB Biological and environmental changes to maternal and newborn microbiomes in the postnatal period can affect health outcomes for the mother-baby dyad. Postpartum sleep deprivation and unmet dietary needs can alter commensal bacteria within the body and disrupt gut-brain communication. Perineal injury and breast infections also change microbial community composition, potentiating an environment favoring pathogen growth. The gut microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms working in harmony. Disruptions within the gut microbiome and gut-brain communication may lead to postpartum depression, a potentially devastating sequela. Postnatal newborn changes to the gut and skin microbiome materialize quickly after birth and are profoundly influenced by mode of birth, feeding method, and bathing and skin care practices. During the newborn period, infant microbiomes are highly vulnerable and susceptible to multiple influences. Maternal-newborn nurses have a valuable role in helping mothers and newborns promote healthy microbiomes. Factors that influence the rapidly changing postnatal microbiome of the mother and her newborn, and the role nurses have to positively influence immediate and long-term health outcomes are presented.

AB Aim: This study aimed to determine whether measures of intermittent hypoxia derived from 24-hour oximetry correlate with measures of apnoea derived from modified nap polysomnography undertaken for preterm infants before discharge.
   Methods: Infants born 32 weeks of gestation were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit and had a modified polysomnography to assess their respiratory stability once they were 35 weeks of postmenstrual age. Infants were defined as unstable if they had more than 10 obstructive events per hour or any apnoea of >20 seconds in length. Infants also had a 24-hour oximetry performed during this period. The results of the 24-oximetry desaturation index (DSI) were compared to nap polysomnography results for central and obstructive apnoea indices and correlations tested.
   Results: Twenty-four infants completed the study. There were 15 (63%) infants defined as unstable by the modified polysomnography. The 3% DSI and 4% DSI from the 24-hour oximetry were significantly higher in the unstable infants, and values for all infants correlated with the obstructive index and the central apnoea index from the modified polysomnography.
   Conclusion: The 3% DSI and 4% DSI values from a 24-hour oximetry study may provide noninvasive measures of respiratory stability in preterm infants ready for discharge.

AB Since the inception of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure (HF) guidelines in 2006, much has changed in the care for patients with HF. Over the past decade, the HF Guidelines Committee has published regular updates. However, because of the major changes that have occurred, the Guidelines Committee believes that a comprehensive reassessment of the HF management recommendations is presently needed, with a view to producing a full and complete set of updated guidelines. The primary and secondary Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF panel members as well as external experts have reviewed clinically relevant literature to provide guidance for the practicing clinician. The 2017 HF guidelines provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management (self-care, pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, device, and referral) that should aid in day-to-day decisions for caring for patients with HF. Among specific issues covered are risk scores, the differences in management for HF with preserved vs reduced ejection fraction, exercise and rehabilitation, implantable devices, revascularization, right ventricular dysfunction, anemia, and iron deficiency, cardiorenal syndrome, sleep apnea, cardiomyopathies, HF in pregnancy, cardio-oncology, and myocarditis. We devoted attention to strategies and treatments to prevent HF, to the organization of HF care, comorbidity management, as well as practical issues around the timing of referral and follow-up care. Recognition and treatment of advanced HF is another important aspect of this update, including how to select advanced therapies as well as end of life considerations. Finally, we acknowledge the remaining gaps in evidence that need to be filled by future research.

AB Recent literature has reported an association between maternal supine sleep position and stillbirth during late pregnancy. In this position the gravid uterus almost completely obstructs the inferior vena cava. A small number of women experience supine hypotension, thought to be due in part to inadequate collateral venous circulation. The aim of this paper is to review the literature describing the anatomy of the collateral venous system and in particular the azygos system, the abdominal portion of which has not been well studied. A systematic review was conducted using the electronic databases: Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Relevant anatomical and radiological literature concerning the azygos system in particular was reviewed. The search was limited to adult human studies only. The collateral venous system can be divided into superficial, intermediate and deep systems. The azygos system in particular provides immediate collateral venous circulation in the event of acute inferior vena caval obstruction. The abdominal portion of this pathway, including the ascending lumbar vein, has not been well studied and there are certain variations that can render it ineffective. In conclusion, the collateral venous system provides an alternative route for blood to flow back to the systemic circulation when acute occlusion of the inferior vena cava occurs in the supine position during late pregnancy. However, certain anatomical variations can render this pathway ineffective, and this could have implications for the development of supine hypotension and stillbirth in late pregnancy. Clin.

AB Introduction: Delayed respiratory depression is a feared complication of intrathecal morphine in patients undergoing cesarean delivery. The incidence, timing and risk factors for hypoxia in this population are not known.
   Methods: Patients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia at a tertiary care center from October 2012 to March 2016 were included in the study. The Berlin sleep apnea Questionnaire was completed before surgery. Oxygen saturation was recorded every second for 24 hours after the initiation of spinal anesthesia. Desaturation events were defined as a median saturation of < 90% (mild) or < 85% (severe) across a 30-s period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine predictors of a desaturation event.
   Results: A total of 721 patients were included in the analysis. Within this cohort, 169 women (23%) experienced at least one mild desaturation event, 91 (13%) experienced two or more mild desaturations, and 26 (4%) suffered a severe desaturation event. After the administration of intrathecal morphine, the median times to first mild or first severe desaturation were 7.4 (IQR 4.1-13.5) h and 12.0 (IQR 5.4-19.6) h, respectively. Patients who screened positive for sleep apnea had increased odds of having a mild desaturation event (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.40 to 3.79, P=0.001), as did patients who were obese (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.09, P=0.033).
   Conclusions: Mild hypoxemia occurred frequently in women receiving intrathecal morphine 150 mu g for post-cesarean analgesia. Desaturations were observed most frequently 4-8 hours after administration of intrathecal morphine. Obesity and a positive Berlin Questionnaire were risk factors for hypoxemic events.

AB Background: Although medication is generally avoided wherever possible during pregnancy, pharmacotherapy is required for the treatment of pregnancy associated hypertension, which remains a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The long-term effects to the child of in-utero exposure to antihypertensive agents remains largely unknown.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review published studies on adverse outcomes to the child associated with in-utero exposure to antihypertensive medications.
   Methods: OVID, Scopus, EBSCO Collections, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant publications published between January 1950 and October 2016 and a total of 688 potentially eligible studies were identified.
   Results: Following review, 47 primary studies were eligible for inclusion. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist was used to assess study quality. Five studies were of excellent quality; the remainder were either mediocre or poor. Increased risk of low birth weight, low size for gestational age, preterm birth, and congenital defects following in-utero exposure to all antihypertensive agents were identified. Two studies reported an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder following exposure to labetalol, and an increased risk of sleep disorders following exposure to methyldopa and clonidine.
   Conclusion: The current systematic review demonstrates a paucity of relevant published high-quality studies. A small number of studies suggest possible increased risk of adverse child health outcomes; however, most published studies have methodological weaknesses and/or lacked statistical power thus preventing any firm conclusions being drawn.

AB BACKGROUND: Although a meta-analysis has confirmed the association between antidepressant exposure in utero and subsequent poor neonatal adaptation, few identified studies included drug levels or standardized measures and only two studies followed up children who developed symptoms beyond infancy.
   METHODS: The study draws on the Mercy Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study and reports on 42 women/infant pairs at delivery. In all, 31 women continued to take antidepressants until delivery and 11 ceased earlier in pregnancy. Poor neonatal adaptation was assessed twice daily for up to 6 days by using the Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (NASS). Drug levels were analyzed in umbilical cord blood and maternal blood obtained at delivery.
   RESULTS: In total, 76% (32 of 42) of neonates exposed to antidepressants had symptoms observed on the NASS. These symptoms occurred up to 5 days postpartum with 25% having symptoms that persisted for more than 3 days. The most frequent symptoms were correlated most closely to antidepressant drug levels. Elevated NASS scores were found to be associated with poorer fine motor development at 6 months of age.
   CONCLUSIONS: Poor neonatal adaptation may be more common than previously recognized. The NASS was observed to be an effective assessment and monitoring measure. Research following symptomatic infants beyond the neonatal period is required.

TI BMAL1 facilitates trophoblast migration and invasion via

AB The underlying mechanism about rhythms and epigenetics leading to aberrant trophoblast migration and invasion in recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) remains unknown. Brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (BMAL1) is considered as a crucial role in fertility, and polymorphism of BMAL1 gene has been reported to be associated with risk of miscarriage. However, the functional role of BMAL1 in RSA is not fully understood. Previous study shows the descended expression of DNA 5'-cytosine-methyltransferases 1 (DNMT1) in the villous of early pregnancy loss. Thus, understanding of the regulation of DNMT1 expression may be of significance for the elucidation of the process of RSA. Using HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cell lines, we certified the induction of specificity protein 1 (SP1) to DNMT1 and DAB2 interaction protein (DAB2IP), respectively, both of which further activated matrix metallo-proteinase 2/9 (MMP2/9), bringing out changes in trophoblast migration and invasion. Notably, BMAL1 functioned as a positive upstream factor of SP1 only in HTR-8/SVneo cells but not in JEG-3 cells, inducing SP1-DNMT1/DAB2IP pathway and facilitating migration and invasion of trophoblasts. In addition, progesterone might restore the down-regulation of BMAL1 and downstream pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Last but not least, the decreased abundance of BMAL1 was correlated positively with that of SP1, DNMT1, DAB2IP, MMP2 and MMP9 in human villous specimens of RSA. Our results demonstrate that the induction of BMAL1 to SP1 contributes to the expression of DNMT1 and DAB2IP, respectively, activating trophoblast migration and invasion. The deregulation of the BMAL1-mediated pathway in RSA can be rescued by progesterone.

AB This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify "red flag symptoms" suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.

AB The medial preoptic area (mPOA) is a brain structure classically related to both non-REM (NREM) sleep and maternal behavior. Although the dopaminergic system is known to play a role in the control of the states of sleep and wakefulness, its effects within the mPOA on sleep are still not clear. Microinjection of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist Raclopride into the mPOA has been shown to promote nursing postures in lactating dams with no effects on active maternal behavior. We hypothesized that the facilitation of nursing postures may be also associated with the promotion of NREM sleep. In order to test the hypothesis, Raclopride was microinjected into the mPOA and maternal behavior and sleep were assessed in lactating rats. The changes observed included a reduction of the latency to start nursing and an increase of the time to reunite the entire litter. Contrary to our hypothesis, NREM sleep was not affected by Raclopride. On the other hand, REM sleep and its transitional stage from NREM sleep, were significantly reduced by this pharmacological agent. These data suggest that dopamine D2 receptors within the mPOA are involved in the transition from NREM to REM sleep.

AB Maternal hypothyroidism (MH) is the most common cause of transient congenital hypothyroidism. Different animal models are used for assessing developmental effects of MH in offspring. The severity and status of hypothyroidism in animal models must be a reflection of the actual conditions in humans. To obtain comparable results with different clinical conditions, which lead to MH in humans, several factors have been suggested for researchers to consider before designing the experimental models. Regarding development of fetal body systems during pregnancy, interference at different times provides different results and the appropriate time for induction of hypothyroidism should be selected based on accurate time of development of the system under assessment. Other factors that should be taken into consideration include, physiological and biochemical differences between humans and other species, thyroid hormone-independent effects of anti-thyroid drugs, circadian rhythms in TSH secretion, sex differences, physical and psychological stress. This review addresses essential guidelines for selecting and managing the optimal animal model for MH as well as discussing the pros and cons of currently used models.

   Design: Randomised controlled trial.
   Setting: Online and telephone.
   Population or sample: Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 10-28 at intake) currently suffering from major depressive disorder.
   Methods: 42 pregnant women (gestational week 12-28) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care.
   Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used. Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed.
   Results: The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post treatment (p < 0.001, Hedges g = 1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e. achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004). Measures of treatment credibility, satisfaction, utilization, and adherence were comparable to implemented ICBT for depression.
   Limitations: Small sample size and no long-term evaluation.
   Conclusion: Pregnancy adapted ICBT for antenatal depression is feasible, acceptable and efficacious. These results need to be replicated in larger trials to validate these promising findings.

   BEHAVIOR; TRACKING; YOUTH
AB Background
   There is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of primary interventions aiming to prevent excess weight gain among young children. Evaluating behavioral changes, such as physical activity (PA), may add to future development of efficient interventions. The objective was to evaluate the effect on PA outcomes of the 15 month Healthy Start intervention that focused on changing diet, PA, sleep and stress management among normal weight but obesity-prone preschool children. Children were defined as obesity-prone if they had a birth weight > 4,000 g, mothers with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of > 28 kg/m(2), or mothers with <= 10 years of schooling.
   Method
   From a baseline study population of 635 normal weight 2-6 year old preschool children from the greater Copenhagen area, parents of 307 children had given information on PA at both the baseline and follow-up examinations. PA was obtained from a 7 days recording in the Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire. Time used for sport activities were combined with outdoor playing time to achieve a proxy of total PA level of moderate to vigorous intensity.
   Results
   Linear regression analyses revealed that at follow-up the intervention group spent more time on sports and outdoor activities combined per week than the control group (ITT analyses: intervention: 400 min/week; 95% confidence interval (CI): 341, 459 versus control: 321 min/week; 95% CI: 277, 366; p = 0.02), although no significant intervention effects were seen for each of the subcategories, e.g. sports participation, outdoor activities, screen time, or commuting frequency.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that the overall time spent on sports and outdoor activities combined was increased at follow-up among normal weight obesity-prone children, as a result of the Healthy Start intervention.

   DEPRESSION; RHYTHMS; BRAIN; NEUROENDOCRINE; RISK; DISTURBANCES;
   MECHANISMS
AB It remains unknown whether chronic circadian disturbance (CCD) during pregnancy can lead to mood disorders in the offspring. Here we show that pregnant mice in the F0 generation that were exposed to CCD stress displayed depression-like behaviors, and produced offspring in the F1 and F2 generations that also exhibited mood-associated behavioral phenotypes despite the lack of direct stressful experiences during their postnatal or adult period. Prenatal CCD stress was correlated with the elevation of plasma corticosterone levels in F1 mice. Furthermore, the diurnal expression profiles of core circadian clock genes were disrupted in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of F1 mice. Proteomics analysis revealed that prenatal CCD stress resulted in distinct changes in protein expression in the hypothalamus of female F1 mice, in particular proteins that were associated with cellular activities, metabolism, development and diseases. Sex-specific differences in melanocortin 4 receptor expression were apparent in the CCD F1 generation. We conclude that maternal exposure to chronic circadian disturbance during pregnancy can lead to sex-specific mood disorders that persist for at least two filial generations. The underlying mechanisms may depend on transgenerational changes in plasma corticosterone levels, circadian pacemaking, and hypothalamic protein expression.

AB Background: It has been reported that in 13-32% of patients with chronic low back pain, the pain may originate in the sacroiliac (SI) joints. When treatment of these patients with analgesics and physiotherapy has failed, a surgical solution may be discussed. Results of such surgery are often based on small series, retrospective analyses or studies using a minimal invasive technique, frequently sponsored by manufacturers.
   Purpose: To report the clinical outcome concerning pain, function and quality of life following anterior arthrodesis in patients presumed to have SI joint pain using validated questionnaires pre- and post-operatively. An additional aim was to describe the symptoms of the patients included and the preoperative investigations performed.
   Material and methods: Over a 6 year period we treated 55 patients, all women, with a mean age of 45 years (range 28-65) and a mean pelvic pain duration of 9.1 years (range 2-30). The pain started in connection with minor trauma in seven patients, pregnancy in 20 and unspecified in 28. All patients had undergone long periods of treatment including physiotherapy, manipulation, needling, pelvic belt, massage and chiropractic without success, and 15 had been operated for various spinal diagnoses without improvement. The patients underwent thorough neurological investigation, plain X-ray and MRI of the spine and plain X-ray of the pelvis. They were investigated by seven clinical tests aimed at indicating pain from the SI joints. In addition, all patients underwent a percutaneous mechanical provocation test and extra-articular local anaesthetic blocks against the posterior part of the SI joints. Before surgery all patients answered the generic Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, the disease specific Balanced Inventory for Spinal Disorders (BIS) questionnaire and rated their level of pelvic and leg pain (VAS, 0-100). At follow-up at a mean of 2 years 49 patients completed the same questionnaires (89%).
   Results: At follow-up 26 patients reported a lower level of pelvic pain than before surgery, 16 the same level and six a higher level. Applying Svensson's method RPpelvic pain = 0.3976, with 95% CI (0.2211, 0.5740) revealed a statistically significant systematic improvement in pelvic pain. At follow-up 28 patients reported a higher quality of life and 26 reported sleeping better than pre-operatively. In most patients the character of the pelvic pain was dull and aching, often accompanied by a stabbing component in connection with sudden movements. Referred pain down the leg/s even to the feet and toes was noted by half of the patients and 29 experienced frequency of micturition.
   Conclusions: It is apparent that in some patients the SI joints may cause long-term pain that can be treated by arthrodesis. We speculate that continued pain despite a healed arthrodesis may be due to persistent pain from adjacent ligaments. The next step should be a prospective randomized study comparing posterior fusion and ligament resection with non-surgical treatment.
   Implications: Anterior arthrodesis can apparently relieve pain in some patients with presumed SI joint pain. The problem is how to identify these patients within the low back pain group. (C) 2017 Scandinavian Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction. Neonatal autopsy is a valuable, critical diagnostic method to provide genetic counseling for future pregnancies.
   Population and methods. Retrospective study including all neonatal autopsies performed on deceased neonates at Clinica y Maternidad Suizo Argentina between January 1998 and December 2006. The rate of autopsies was established; the diagnosis indicated in the medical record was compared to autopsy findings.
   Results. Out of 227 deceased infants, 135 autopsies were performed (rate: 59.5%). Concordance was complete in 25% of autopsies. New information was found in 26%, which had significant implications for genetic counseling.
   Conclusions. The rate of autopsies was 59.5%. Pathological and clinical correlation and unsuspected findings with implications for genetic counseling demonstrate the relevance of performing neonatal autopsies systematically.

TI Tick-borne relapsing fever in British Columbia: A 10-year review
   (2006-2015)

   DISCRIMINATION; INTERSTATE OUTBREAK; LYME BORRELIOSIS; GRAND-CANYON;
   DISEASE; CANADA; PENICILLIN; ETHIOPIA
AB Background: Tick-borne relapsing fever is one of the oldest tick-borne diseases identified in British Columbia. The causative agent is the spirochete Borrelia hermsii, which is transmitted to humans by the night-feeding soft-shelled tick Ornithodoros hermsi found in southeastern British Columbia and the northwestern United States. The identification of this illness is made difficult by the fact that tick-borne relapsing fever is not a reportable illness in BC and laboratory diagnosis can be challenging. The innocuous feeding pattern of the vector tick means bites can go unnoticed, while the typical 7-day delay in symptoms means patients often do not become ill until after they have left a disease-endemic area where physicians are more likely to recognize the illness. Identification and treatment of this illness is important because it can cause long-term sequelae, including cardiac and renal disturbances, peripheral nerve disturbances, ophthalmitis, and complications during pregnancy. A report on a 10-year review of cases in BC was proposed to alert physicians to the presence of this infectious disease and explain how to submit blood samples for testing to the BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory.
   Methods: From 2006 to 2015, the BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory received 112 samples from 100 patients suspected to have tick-borne relapsing fever. These samples were analyzed using dark field microscopy, immunofluorescence assay, western blot testing, and polymerase chain reaction assay. A review of the laboratory findings was conducted and the diagnostic challenges and sample requirements were considered.
   Results: The 100 patients (57 male, 43 female) whose 112 samples were analyzed during the review period ranged in age from 6 to 83 years, and most (67%) were either young or middle-aged adults (20 to 60 years). Of these patients, 19 tested positive for B. hermsii (12 female, 7 male). Except for 2009 and 2014, at least one case of tick-borne relapsing fever was identified each year, with the top year being 2007 (seven cases). Most of the positive cases were associated with the Thompson-Okanagan region. Polymerase chain reaction assay and Giemsa stain testing yielded the highest proportion of positive results (4 of 11 samples) followed by immunofluorescence assay for IgG antibodies (19 of 109).
   Conclusions: The high proportion of positive results (19%) may be due to the submission of mainly very characteristic samples received from an endemic area. Many physicians may not be aware of the presence of B. hermsii tick-borne relapsing fever in BC and therefore do not request testing. Physicians should note that patients are unlikely to report a painless tick bite received during sleep and that the key symptom is a sudden, high fever (39.2 degrees C or higher) that follows an incubation period of approximately 7 days and lasts 3 to 7 days. An asymptomatic period of 7 days is then followed by an average of two relapses. General infections considered in the differential diagnosis should include salmonellosis, bartonellosis, tularemia, and leptospirosis. Patients should also be asked about foreign travel to rule out a range of other infections such as malaria, kala azar, yellow fever, and sand fly fever. Blood samples for identifying the causative agent for a recurrent fever should be collected while the patient is febrile and prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. The appropriate samples are 7 mL of blood in a red-top serum separator tube for serology and 7 mL of blood in an EDTA tube for Giemsa staining and polymerase chain reaction assay. Patients diagnosed with tick-borne relapsing fever have been shown to respond effectively to doxycycline/tetracycline, macrolides such as erythromycin, and penicillin. Approximately one-half of patients will experience some sort of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction and should be monitored for this. In future, molecular testing, an organized approach to diagnosis, and a greater physician awareness of this illness should allow for more rapid and confident diag-noses and effective treatment of patients with this tick-borne illness.

AB Background: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a frequent disorder and its severity superfats as pregnancy progresses. The exact prevalence or incidence of such disorder in pregnant women is still unknown.
   Objectives: To assess the incidence and severity of OSA in pregnant women and to discover the risk factors for OSA during pregnancy.
   Methods: A total of 30 pregnant women and 30 age matched controls completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Stop-Bang questionnaire. SDB diagnosis was based on polysomnography.
   Results: The incidence of OSA among our studied pregnant women was 36.7% and 53.3% of pregnant women were snorers. They demonstrated significantly higher AHI (4.38 +/- 4.45) and ODI (3.72 +/- 4.03). There was a significant positive correlation between gestational age and ESS, BMI, AHI and ODI, as they are of their highest levels among cases in the third trimester. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that gestational age and body mass index were independent risk factors with odds ratio (2.23 & 4.99) and 95% CI (1.05-5.32 & 1.75-33.28) respectively while the neck circumference and ESS were considered as dependent risk factors.
   Conclusion: Pregnancy is a risk condition for OSA which aggravated by neck circumference and base line BMI. The susceptibility and severity increase by increasing gestational age. (C) 2017 The Egyptian Society of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB Hypertension can originate from early-life insults, whereas maternal melatonin therapy can be protective in a variety of models of programmed hypertension. We hypothesize that melatonin or melatonin receptor agonist agomelatine can prevent programmed hypertension in adult offspring induced by maternal exposure to continuous light. Female Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats randomly divided into four groups: controls, rats exposed to continuous light, exposed to continuous light plus treated with agomelatine (50 mg/day i.p.), and exposed to continuous light plus treated with 0.01% melatonin in drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation period. Male offspring (n = 10/group) from three litters were examined at 12 weeks of age. Maternal continuous light exposure-induced hypertension in male offspring, which was prevented by melatonin or agomelatine therapy. Continuous light exposure did not affect melatonin pathway in adult offspring kidney. Genes that belong to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), sodium transporters, AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and circadian rhythm were potentially involved in the maternal exposure to continuous light-induced programmed hypertension. Maternal agomelatine therapy decreased Ace expression but increased Agtr2 and Mas1. Maternal melatonin therapy prevented the increases of Slc9a3, Slc12a3, and Atp1a1 expression induced by maternal continuous light exposure. In conclusion, maternal melatonin or agomelatine therapy prevents programmed hypertension induced by maternal exposure to continuous light. Agomelatine and melatonin reprogram the RAS and sodium transporters differentially, to prevent negative programming of continuous light. Our data highlight candidate genes and pathways in renal programming as targets for therapeutic approaches to prevent programmed hypertension caused by early-life disturbance of the circadian rhythm.
   Summary Sentence
   Exposure of the mother to continuous light-induced programmed hypertension in adult offspring, which was prevented by maternal agomelatine or melatonin therapy via regulating renin-angiotensin system, sodium transporters, AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and circadian rhythm.

AB Neonatal sleep is a crucial state that involves endogenous driven brain activity, important for neuronal survival and guidance of brain networks. Sequential EEG-sleep analysis in preterm infants provides insights into functional brain integrity and can document deviations of the biologically pre-programmed process of sleep onto genesis during the neonatal period.
   Visual assessment of neonatal sleep-EEG, with integration of both cerebral and non-cerebral measures to better define neonatal state, is still considered the gold standard. Electrographic patterns evolve over time and are gradually time locked with behavioural characteristics which allow classification of quiet sleep and active sleep periods during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Near term age, the neonate expresses a short ultradian sleep cycle, with two distinct active and quiet sleep, as well as brief periods of transitional or indeterminate sleep. Qualitative assessment of neonatal sleep is however challenged by biological and environmental variables that influence the expression of EEG-sleep patterns and sleep organization. Developing normative EEG-sleep data with the aid of automated analytic methods, can further improve our understanding of extra-uterine brain development and state organization under stressful or pathological conditions. Based on those developmental biomarkers of normal and abnormal brain function, research can be conducted to support and optimise sleep in the NICU, with the ultimate goal to improve therapeutic interventions and neurodevelopmental outcome.

AB In reproductive physiology research, experimental animals are often subjected to stressful procedures, including blood sampling and biopsy. In this present study, presence of pain or distress induced by four different procedures was examined using a measurement of salivary cortisol levels and activity observations in sows. The treatments were: 1) PAL: The ovary was palpated through the rectum without snaring, 2) TUB: transvaginal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the ovary was conducted without snaring, 3) SNA: a soft rope snare was placed around the maxilla, 4) CAT: A soft rope snare was placed around the maxilla, and an intravenous catheter was inserted through the ear vein of the sows. Activities, social cohesion and other pain-related behaviour, and salivary cortisol concentrations were recorded. Salivary cortisol concentrations in CAT sows increased in response to the procedure (P < 0.05), whereas the other treatments did not trigger a significant response. The CAT sows had higher cortisol concentrations than the other groups for 10 min after initiation of the procedures (P < 0.01), and they maintained higher cortisol levels than the PAL and TUB groups 15 min post-treatment (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the CAT sows showed the highest frequency of head shaking (P < 0.001) and trembling behaviour (P < 0.05) during the 1 h post-treatment. Summarizing, the catheterization procedure might induce a short-term pain or stress response during and after the procedure in terms of pain-related behaviour and salivary cortisol status. We suggest that TUB might not cause appreciable pain or distress. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Daily torpor is a physiological adaptation in mammals and birds characterized by a controlled reduction of metabolic rate and body temperature during the resting phase of circadian rhythms. In laboratory mice, daily torpor is induced by dietary caloric restriction. However, it is not known which nutrients are related to daily torpor expression. To determine whether dietary protein is a key factor in inducing daily torpor in mice, we fed mice a protein-restricted (PR) diet that included only one quarter of the amount of protein but the same caloric level as a control (C) diet. We assigned six non-pregnant female ICR mice to each group and recorded their body weights and core body temperatures for 4 weeks. Body weights in the C group increased, but those in the PR group remained steady or decreased. Mice in both groups did not show daily torpor, but most mice in a food-restricted group (n=6) supplied with 80% of the calories given to the C group exhibited decreased body weights and frequently displayed daily torpor. This suggests that protein restriction is not a trigger of daily torpor; torpid animals can conserve their internal energy, but torpor may not play a significant role in conserving internal protein. Thus, opportunistic daily torpor in mice may function in energy conservation rather than protein saving.

AB Khat (Catha edulis) is a evergreen flowering shrub that is cultivated at high altitudes, especially in East Africa and the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. The plant contains alkaloids, of which cathinone and cathine have structural similarity and pharmacological action similar to amphetamines. The leaves are, therefore, consumed in some regions as a psychoactive stimulant due to cultural beliefs and misperceptions on the health benefits of khat consumption. This resulted in a growing prevalence of khat consumption among pregnant women. The myriad of physiological changes associated with pregnancy impairs sleep and memory. Moreover, khat has also been shown to have adverse effects on memory and sleep. Therefore, its use during pregnancy may further aggravate those impairments. The purpose of this mini-review is to summarize the changes in sleep and memory during pregnancy and the evidence supporting a relationship between khat consumption and neurocognitive deficits and sleep dysfunctions. The misperceptions of beneficial effects of khat, the high prevalence of consumption among pregnant women, and the possibility of under-reporting of khat abuse do necessitate the development of alternative methodologies to identify cases of unreported khat abuse in pregnant women. It is proposed that screening for sleep problems and memory deficits may help identify under-reported cases of khat abuse in pregnant women.

AB Aims Pregnancy is a phenomenon associated with dynamic changes in physical, mental and biochemical status of body and demands increased nutritional intake for developing foetus. The level of various micronutrients which act as co-factors for antioxidant enzymes or it-self as antioxidants gets altered with the progression of pregnancy. The present longitudinal study summarized the trend of selected micronutrients level in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP) supplemented with daily and weekly oral iron folic acid (IFA) tablet during pregnancy and postpartum.
   Methods A total of 200 primigravida {N = 100; NAP (Hb > 11 g/dl) and N = 100 AP (Hb = 8-11 g/dl) assigned daily (N = 50) and weekly (N = 50) supplementation} were recruited and overnight fasting blood samples were withdrawn at 13-16 weeks, after 3 months and 6 weeks postpartum. The serum iron, copper, zinc, magnesium and manganese were estimated by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometer.
   Results Serum manganese (p < 0.05) at baseline and magnesium (p < 0.01) at postpartum was significantly different between NAP and AP supplemented with daily IFA tablets. The trend of copper found to be increased during pregnancy and later declined at postpartum in both the groups. Daily supplementation resulted in significantly high iron (p < 0.05) in NAP during third trimester.
   Conclusion sHypozincemia and hypomagnesemia was observed in anaemic pregnancy supplemented with weekly and daily IFA respectively. Clear evidence of altered micronutrients levels during healthy and anaemic pregnancy was seen. The reference values may be drawn from this study for the nutritional assessment during pregnancy for healthy pregnancy outcomes.

AB Excessive crying is a common complaint in young infants, especially in those less than 3 mo of age. Altered circadian rhythm, immaturity of central nervous system and alteration of intestinal microbiota are some of the proposed mechanisms for this problem. Although it is commonly benign, crying can be the only clinical manifestation of many serious underlying illnesses, thus warranting careful clinical examination for ruling out organic causes. Urgent care clinics are best suited for evaluation and treatment of benign etiologies and promptly referring children with red flags to an emergency department. Routine investigations are not indicated in an afebrile infant with no signs of illness on history and physical examination. Excessive crying due to colic often results in parental stress and exhaustion. Treatment in such cases revolves more on reassuring the parents and avoiding drugs with uncertain action and potential side-effects.

AB AimTo investigate the relationship between maternal mindfulness and maternal anxiety 1 month after childbirth.
   MethodsA cross-sectional design was used, featuring anonymous questionnaires that were completed between July and December 2014 at two Japanese hospitals. The participants (n = 151) completed the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (Japanese version) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form X (Japanese version). The data analysis was carried out by using a hierarchical multiple regression.
   ResultsThe state and trait anxiety scores showed significant relationships with mindfulness, the mother's age, and the perceived difference between the expectations of motherhood before childbirth and the reality of post-partum daily life. Furthermore, the amount of average sleep time in the past week (including naps) showed a negative association with the state anxiety score, whereas the marital relationship showed a positive association with trait anxiety. Finally, at 1 month post-partum, the mothers with greater mindfulness scores showed lower anxiety.
   ConclusionsImprovements in mindfulness could help mothers to reduce their post-partum anxiety.

AB Background: Up to 18% of men experience depression and/or anxiety during the transition to parenthood. Interventions designed specifically to promote the mental health of men during the transition to parenthood are scarce. Internet-delivered interventions may be acceptable and far-reaching in enhancing mental health, parenting knowledge, and healthy behaviors in expectant or new fathers.
   Objective: To guide the development of Healthydads. ca, a website designed to enhance mental health and healthy behaviors in expectant fathers, a needs assessment was conducted to identify fathers' perspectives of barriers to seeking help for emotional wellness, informational needs, and factors affecting the decision to visit such a website.
   Methods: One hundred and seventy-four men whose partners were expecting, or had recently given birth, in 3 Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta) completed a Web-based survey inquiring about information needs related to psychosocial aspects of the transition to parenthood, lifestyle behaviors, parenting, and factors associated with the decision to visit a father-focused website.
   Results: Most men (155/174, 89.1%) reported accessing the Internet to obtain information on pregnancy and spent an average of 6.2 hours online per month. Seeking information about parenting on the Internet was reported by 67.2% (117/174) of men, with a mean of 4.4 hours per month of online searching. Top barriers to seeking help to improve emotional wellness during the perinatal period were: no time to seek help/assistance (130/174, 74.7%), lack of resources available in the health care system (126/174, 72.4%), financial costs associated with services (118/174, 67.8%), and feeling that one should be able to do it alone (113/174, 64.9%). Information needs that were rated highly included: parenting/infant care (52.9-81.6%), supporting (121/174, 69.5%) and improving (124/174, 71.3%) relationship with their partner, work-family balance (120/174, 69.0%), improving sleep (100/174, 57.5%), and managing stress (98/174, 56.3%). Perceiving the website as personally relevant (151/174, 86.8%), credible (141/174, 81.0%), effective (140/145, 80.5%), and having an easy navigation structure (141/174, 81.0%) were identified as important factors related to a first website visit. Providing useful (134/174, 77.0%) and easy to understand (158/174, 90.8%) information, which was also free of charge (156/174, 89.7%), were considered important for deciding to prolong a website visit. Providing the possibility to post questions to a health professional (133/174, 76.4%), adding new content regularly (119/174, 68.4%), and personal motivation (111/174, 63.8%) were factors identified that would encourage a revisit.
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that there is substantial interest among expectant and new fathers for using Internet-delivered strategies to prepare for the transition to parenthood and support their mental health. Specific user and website features were identified to optimize the use of father-focused websites.

ID POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; HEART-FAILURE; APNEA
AB Sleep related breathing disorders include central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sleep-related hypoventilation, and sleep-related hypoxia. These disorders are frequent and growing in clinical relevance. The related chapter of the S3 guideline Non-restorative sleep/Sleep disorders, published by the German Sleep Society (DGSM), has recently been updated in November 2016. Epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutic procedures, and classification of sleep related disorders have been revised. Concerning epidemiology, a considerably higher mortality rate among pregnant women with OSA has been emphasized. With regards to diagnostics, the authors point out that respiratory polygraphy may be sufficient in diagnosing OSA, if a typical clinical condition is given. For CSA, recommendations were changed to diagnose CSA with low apnea rates present. Significant changes for treating CSA in patients with left ventricular dysfunction have been introduced. In addition, there is now to be differentiated between sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxaemia. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is discussed in more detail. This article sums up and comments on the published changes.

AB Objective: Pregnancy and the obesity epidemic impacting women of reproductive age appear to predispose women to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy. The aim of this study is to examine the association between OSA and adverse maternal outcomes in a national cohort.
   Methods: The National Perinatal Information Center in the US was used to identify women with a delivery discharge diagnosis of OSA from 2010 to 2014. We used the International Classification of Diseases, ninth Revision to classify OSA diagnosis and maternal outcomes.
   Measurements: The sample consisted of 1,577,632 gravidas with a rate of OSA of 0.12% (N = 1963). There was a significant association between OSA and preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.94-2.54), eclampsia (aOR 2.95, 1.08-8.02), and gestational diabetes (aOR 1.51, 1.34 -1.72) after adjusting for a comprehensive list of covariates which includes maternal obesity. OSA status was also associated with a 2.5-3.5-fold increase in risk of severe complications such as cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. Length of hospital stay was significantly longer (5.1 + 5.6 vs 3.0 + 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and odds of an admission to an intensive care unit higher (aOR 2.74, 2.36-3.18) in women with OSA.
   Conclusions: Compared to pregnant women without OSA, pregnant women with OSA have a significantly higher risk of pregnancy-specific complications such as gestational hypertensive conditions and gestational diabetes, and rare medical and surgical complications such as cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and hysterectomy. OSA diagnosis was also associated with a longer hospital stay and significantly increased odds for admission to the intensive care unit. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Experimental and epidemiologic data suggest that among nonpregnant adults, sleep duration may be an important risk factor for chronic disease. Although pregnant women commonly report poor sleep, few studies objectively evaluated the quality of sleep in pregnancy or explored the relationship between sleep disturbances and maternal and perinatal outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration, timing, and continuity (measured via wrist actigraphy) and maternal cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity specific to pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study of nulliparous women. Women were recruited between 16 0/7 and 21 6/7 weeks' gestation. They were asked to wear a wrist actigraphy monitor and complete a daily sleep log for a period of 7 consecutive days. The primary sleep exposure variables were the averages of the following over the total valid nights (minimum 5, maximum 7 nights): short sleep duration during the primary sleep period (< 7 h/night), late sleep midpoint (midpoint between sleep onset and sleep offset >5 AM), and top quartile of minutes of wake time after sleep onset and sleep fragmentation index. The primary outcomes of interest were a composite of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (mild, severe, or superimposed preeclampsia; eclampsia; or antepartum gestational hypertension) and gestational diabetes mellitus. We used x(2) tests to assess associations between sleep variables and categorical baseline characteristics. Crude odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from univariate logistic regression models to characterize the magnitude of the relationship between sleep characteristics and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. For associations significant in univariate analysis, multiple logistic regression was used to explore further the association of sleep characteristics with pregnancy outcomes.
   RESULTS: In all, 901 eligible women consented to participate; 782 submitted valid actigraphy studies. Short sleep duration and a later sleep midpoint were associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-4.53; and odds ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-5.36, respectively) but not of hypertensive disorders. A model with both sleep duration and sleep midpoint as well as their interaction term revealed that while there was no significant interaction between these exposures, the main effects of both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes remained significant (adjusted odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.19; and adjusted odds ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-4.97, respectively). Additionally, after adjusting separately for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity, both short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint remained associated with gestational diabetes. No associations were demonstrated between the sleep quality measures (wake after sleep onset, sleep fragmentation) and hypertensive disorders or gestational diabetes.
   CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a relationship between short sleep duration and later sleep midpoint with gestational diabetes. Our data suggest independent contributions of these 2 sleep characteristics to the risk for gestational diabetes in nulliparous women.

AB Background: Few studies have addressed obesity prevention among low-income families whose infants are at increased obesity risk. We tested a Facebook peer-group intervention for low-income mothers to foster behaviors promoting healthy infant growth.
   Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 87 pregnant women (Medicaid insured, BMI 25kg/m(2)) were randomized to the Grow2Gether intervention or text message appointment reminders. Grow2Gether participants joined a private Facebook group of 9-13 women from 2 months before delivery until infant age 9 months. A psychologist facilitated groups featuring a curriculum of weekly videos addressing feeding, sleep, parenting, and maternal well-being. Feasibility was assessed using the frequency and content of participation, and acceptability using surveys. Maternal beliefs and behaviors and infant growth were assessed at birth, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months. Differences in infant growth between study arms were explored. We conducted intention-to-treat analyses using quasi-least-squares regression.
   Results: Eighty-eight percent (75/85) of intervention participants (42% (36/85) food insecure, 88% (75/85) black) reported the group was helpful. Participants posted 30 times/group/week on average. At 9 months, the intervention group had significant improvement in feeding behaviors (Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire) compared to the control group (p=0.01, effect size=0.45). Intervention group mothers were significantly less likely to pressure infants to finish food and, at age 6 months, give cereal in the bottle. Differences were not observed for other outcomes, including maternal feeding beliefs or infant weight-for-length.
   Conclusions: A social media peer-group intervention was engaging and significantly impacted certain feeding behaviors in families with infants at high risk of obesity.

AB AimsTo explore the experiences of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes, and the relationships between perceptions of glucose control, attitudes to technology and glycaemic responses with regard to closed-loop insulin delivery.
   MethodsWe recruited 16 pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes [mean sd age 34.1 4.6 years, duration of diabetes 23.6 7.2 years, baseline HbA(1c) 515 mmol/mol (6.8 0.6%)] to a randomized crossover trial of sensor-augmented pump therapy vs automated closed-loop therapy. Questionnaires (Diabetes Technology Questionnaire, Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey) were completed before and after each intervention, with qualitative interviews at baseline and follow-up.
   ResultsWomen described the benefits and burdens of closed-loop systems during pregnancy. Feelings of improved glucose control, excitement and empowerment were counterbalanced by concerns about device visibility, obsessive data checking and diminished attentiveness to hyper- and hypoglycaemia symptoms. Responding to questionnaires, eight participants felt less worry about overnight hypoglycaemia and that diabetes did not run their lives'; however, five reported that closed-loop increased time thinking about diabetes, and three felt it made sleep and preventing hyperglycaemia more problematic. Women slightly overestimated their glycaemic response to closed-loop therapy. Most became more positive in their technology attitudes throughout pregnancy. Women with more positive technology attitudes had higher degrees of overestimation, and poorer levels of glycaemic control.
   ConclusionsWomen displayed complex psychosocial responses to closed-loop therapy in pregnancy. Perceptions of glycaemic response may diverge from biomedical data.

AB This study examined the course of antidepressant use, sleep quality, and depression severity from pregnancy through 6-month postpartum in women with and without a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Women (N = 215) were interviewed during pregnancy, 1- and 6-month postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality, and depression severity. Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements in depression severity by 6-month postpartum. In contrast, the depression severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout. Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. When prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore, antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

AB The purpose of this study was to reveal the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety among Chinese pregnant women. Pregnant women were recruited in Zhoushan Pregnant Women Cohort at Zhoushan Maternal and Child Care Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Self-rating depression scales (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scales (SAS) were used for evaluating depression and anxiety status at each trimester; corresponding sleep quality and duration were reported by pregnant women. Ordinary or multilevel linear and logistic regression model were used to estimate the cross-sectional or longitudinal association of sleep with depression and anxiety. The prevalence rates were 35.64, 24.23, and 26.24% for depression and 22.57, 17.41, and 21.04% for anxiety at 1st (T1), 2nd (T2), and 3rd trimester (T3), respectively. Controlling for potential confounders, it revealed significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of sleep with depression and anxiety status. In cross-sectional analysis, women who slept less than 8 h/day had higher risk of depression (T1: OR (95%CI) = 1.75 (1.39, 2.20); T2: 1.52 (1.26, 2.05); T3: 1.60 (1.18, 2.05)) and anxiety (T1: 2.00 (1.57, 2.55); T2: 1.86 (1.37, 2.54); T3: 1.33 (0.99, 1.79)). In the longitudinal analysis, multilevel model revealed that women with subjective "fair" or "bad" sleep quality had elevated risk of depression (OR ranging from 1.54 to 3.71) and anxiety (2.38 to 7.53) during pregnancy. Prenatal depression and anxiety status were prevalent in pregnant women. Sleep quality was associated with depression and anxiety status in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, implying that improving sleep quality should benefit for mental health of pregnant women.

AB Dim light exposure of the mother during pregnancy has been proposed as one of the environmental factors that affect the fetal brain development in schizophrenia. Melatonin circulating levels are regulated by the environmental light/dark cycle. This hormone stimulates neuronal differentiation in the adult brain. However, little is known about its role in the fetal human brain development. Olfactory neuronal precursors (ONPs) are useful for studying the physiopathology of neuropsychiatric diseases because they mimic all the stages of neurodevelopment in culture. Here, we first characterized whether melatonin stimulates neuronal differentiation in cloned ONPs obtained from a healthy control subject (HCS). Then, melatonin effects were evaluated in primary cultures of ONPs derived from a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZ) and an age-and gender-matched HCS. Axonal formation was evidenced morphologically by tau immunostaining and by GSK3 beta phosphorylated state. Potassium-evoked secretion was assessed as a functional feature of differentiated neurons. As well, we report the expression of MT1/2 receptors in human ONPs for the first time. Melatonin stimulated axonal formation and ramification in cloned ONPs through a receptor-mediated mechanism and enhanced the amount and velocity of axonal and somatic secretion. SZ ONPs displayed reduced axogenesis associated with lower levels of pGSK3 beta and less expression of melatonergic receptors regarding the HCS ONPs. Melatonin counteracted this reduction in SZ cells. Altogether, our results show that melatonin signaling is crucial for functional differentiation of human ONPs, strongly suggesting that a deficit of this indoleamine may lead to an impaired neurodevelopment which has been associated with the etiology of schizophrenia.

AB Preterm birth (PTB) occurs among 1:11 U.S. white women and 1:7.5 African American women and is a significant driver of racial disparities in infant mortality. Maternal stress is the most common clinical phenotype underlying spontaneous PTB. Specific patterns of stress and biological mediators driving PTB remain unclear. We examined the effect of childhood stress on birth timing among African American women and evaluated maternal cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. A prospective observational design was employed, with a single study visit at 28-32 weeks gestation and medical record review. The Stress and Adversity Inventory was administered, which provides a comprehensive estimate of childhood stress, stress in adulthood, and five core characteristic subscales (interpersonal loss, physical danger, humiliation, entrapment, role disruption). Venipuncture was performed between 11:00am and 4:00pm and plasma cortisol quantified by ELISA. Analyses controlled for stress in adulthood. Among a final sample of 89, cumulative childhood stress predicted birth timing (p = 0.01). The association was driven by stress related to interpersonal loss and physical danger, with support for maternal cortisol as a biological mediator (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.045]; ab = 0.02, 95% CI [0.001, 0.043], respectively). Results were similar, overall, in sub-group analyses among spontaneously laboring women (n = 53); however, role disruption arose as an additional predictor, as mediated by cortisol elevations (ab = 0.03, 95% CI [0.005, 0.074]). Of note, cortisol was no longer supported as a mediator linking physical danger to birth timing after adjusting for sleep quality and hours awake prior to venipuncture (ab = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.0001, 0.046]). We provide preliminary evidence that, independent of stress in adulthood, childhood stress of specific core characteristics may shape birth timing, with cortisol elevation as a biological mediator. Further investigation is warranted and may bolster the development of biologically-informed screening tools for the prediction and targeted prevention of stress-related PTB.

AB 216 women admitted for labour induction were recruited to evaluate sleep duration and other sleep measures on Caesarean delivery risk. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Berlin (Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, International Restless Leg Syndrome, Insomnia Symptom Questionnaires were applied. Short sleep duration was defined as reported night sleep length in the previous month below the study population median of 6 hours. After binomial analysis, Caesarean delivery after labour induction is associated with short sleep duration (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, P = 0.018), nulliparity, Bishop Score, prepregnant BMI and birth weight at P < 0.05. After adjustment for nulliparity, Bishop Score, prepregnant BMI and birth weight, short sleep duration remains independently predictive of Caesarean delivery AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.0, P = 0.026. Women at high risk for OSA has a non-significant result on binomial analysis, RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.7, P = 0.073. In a sensitivity analysis which includes OSA in the multivariable logistic regression model, OSA's predictive effect is attenuated AOR 1.2, 95% CI 0.4-3.2, P = 0.782 whilst short sleep duration remains significant AOR 2.3 95% CI 1.0-5.1, P = 0.039. Other evaluated sleep measures are not predictive of Caesarean delivery.

AB Background
   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or habitual snoring is known to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes among both men and non-pregnant women. We examined the association of habitual snoring during early pregnancy with risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   Methods
   A cohort of 1,579 women was interviewed during early pregnancy. We collected information about snoring frequency during early pregnancy. Results from screening and diagnostic tests for IGT and GDM were abstracted from medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of IGT and GDM associated with snoring in early pregnancy.
   Results
   Overall, women who snored "most or all of the time" had a 2.1-fold increased odds of IGT (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.31-3.35) and a 2.5-fold increased odds of GDM (OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.34-4.67) as compared with women who never snored. Compared with lean women (pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m(2)) who did not snore, lean snorers had a 2-fold increased odds of GDM (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.07-3.68). The odds of GDM risk was particularly elevated among overweight women (BMI-25 kg/m(2)) who snored (OR = 5.01; 95% CI 2.71-9.26). However, there was no evidence of an interaction between overweight and snoring with GDM risk (p-value = 0.144).
   Conclusions
   These findings, if confirmed, may have important implications for tailoring prenatal care for overweight pregnant women, and/or those with a history of habitual snoring in early pregnancy.

AB Background : Ecosystems with seasonal fluctuations in climate and food availability present physiological challenges to resident mammals and may cause "stress." The two predominant physiological responses to stressors are (1) the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and (2) the modulation of the autonomic nervous system. To date, the primary indicator for "stress" in wildlife-and zoo animal research are glucocorticoid levels. By measuring the autonomic regulation of cardiac activity, particularly the vagal tone, heart rate variability (HRV) is presently emerging as a suitable indicator of "stress" in farm-and domestic animal research.
   Objective : The aim of this study was to use HRV, a novel method in wildlife research, to assess seasonal patterns of "stress" in a group of free-ranging Przewalski's horses (Equus ferus przewalskii).
   Methods : Six pregnant Przewalski's horses from one harem within the Hortobagy National Park in Hungary were subjected to the study. We used a dedicated telemetry system consisting of a subcutaneously implanted transmitter and a receiver and storage unit in a collar to record HRV, heart rate (HR), subcutaneous body temperature, and activity throughout a one-year study period-climate data was also collected. We defined "stress" as a decrease in parasympathetic nervous system tone and calculated RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) as a measure of HRV. Linear mixed effects models with random intercept per individual were used for statistical analysis.
   Results : HRV and HR varied considerably throughout the year. Similar to temperate ruminants and hibernating mammals, Przewalski's horses experienced lower HR and HRV during winter, when resources are limited indicating decreased metabolic rates coupled with " stress." In spring, we observed a drop of HRV along with a peak in HR indicating an increase of allostatic load that is most likely associated with increased energy demands during pregnancy and/or seasonal routines such as the adjustment of the gastrointestinal system to better quality diet.
   Conclusion : Measuring telemetric HRV is a proven method to study undisturbed reactions of wild animals to their changing environment over the long term. Przewalski's horses experience a loss of complexity in cardiovascular dynamics over the winter and particularly during spring, indicating seasonal "stress."

AB Habitual midday napping is a common habit in China, especially for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to examine whether duration and frequency of maternal habitual midday napping were associated with high birthweight (HBW). A total of 10,482 participants from Healthy Baby Cohort were include in our analysis. The information of the mothers and their infants were abstracted from medical records, or obtained from questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of habitual midday napping duration and frequency with HBW. Of the participants, 8,705 (83.0%) reported having habitual midday napping. Duration and frequency of napping had a positive association with HBW without adjustment. After controlling for potential confounders, increasing risk of HBW was observed in participants who napped 1.5-2 hours (OR, 1.50, 95% CI, 1.14, 1.98), and >= 2 hours (OR, 1.35, 95% CI, 1.03, 1.78) compared with no habitual midday napping. Participants who took naps >= 5 days/week had a higher risk of HBW (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.07, 1.77) compared with the women without naps. This suggests that longer (>= 1.5 hours) and more frequent (>= 5 days/week) maternal habitual midday napping were associated with an increased risk of HBW.

AB Mother rats spend most of their time nursing their litter during the early stages of the postpartum period, only occasionally leaving the nest. The suckling stimulus from the pups elicits the adoption of nursing postures, during which milk ejection occurs, an event associated with the occurrence of non-REM (NREM) sleep in the rat. Despite this evidence, the characteristics of sleep during different nursing postures along the postpartum period remain unknown. The present study aims to describe the sleep pattern of mother rats while nursing, hovering over their pups and when being away from the pups. For this purpose, lactating females were implanted with electrodes for chronic polysomnographic recording. Simultaneous recordings of sleep-wakefulness cycle and maternal behaviors were performed in both the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks. Results indicate that while mothers were most of the time awake when hovering over pups and when staying away from pups, they mainly remained in NREM sleep when adopting low kyphosis posture, the most common nursing posture. The sleep-wake pattern during most maternal behaviors was quite stable between the light and dark phases of the first and second postpartum weeks. In addition, the sleep fragmentation was higher during the nursing bouts compared to that observed when mother rats slept without the pups, but sleep depth did not differ between these behaviors. Our results provide an original description of how mother rats synchronize their own sleep-wakefulness cycle with the maternal care of the pups during the postpartum period.

DE Catatonia; negativism; pregnancy; vesical globe
ID CATATONIA
AB Negativism is known as resistance to instructions, contrary comportment to what asked. Negativism is mostly associated with catatonia. Genitourinary complications like urinary retention or urinary incontinence or infections can be seen in catatonia. Here we describe a case of negativism associated urinary bladder overdistension without catatonia. We aim to call attention that urinary bladder overdistension may be associated with negativism without catatonia.
   A 37 years old female patient had a history of psychotic depression for seven years. She had been on olanzapine treatment during last year until she learnt that she was pregnant six weeks ago. In the past ten days, the patient has not talked, eaten, drunk or slept so she was hospitalized in psychiatry inpatient clinic. Abdominal ultrasound revealed that her bladder volume was nearly 1500 cc and compressing on uterus. A urinary catheter was placed and urinary bladder overdistension resolved. After seven sessions of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), she recovered completely. Pulmonary complications like pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and aspiration; gastrointestinal complications like constipation due to decreased food intake and dehydration; dental complications due to decreased oral hygiene; genitourinary complications like urinary retention or urinary incontinence or infections; flexion contractures, postural nerve palsies and rhabdomyolysis due to immobilization can be seen in catatonia. Urinary bladder overdistension was associated with catatonia in literature but in our case urinary bladder overdistension was associated with negativism without full criteria of catatonia.

AB Introduction and Aims. There is limited research regarding the effects of alcohol consumption by breastfeeding mothers on infant development. This study examined the frequency, correlates and outcomes of alcohol use during lactation. Design and Methods. Data were from an Australian cohort study. Maternal demographics and substance use were assessed during pregnancy and at 8 weeks and 12months postpartum. Breastfeeding duration, infant feeding, sleeping and development (Ages and Stages Questionnaire) were also assessed postpartum. Logistic regression and general linear model analyses examined characteristics of women who drank during breastfeeding, and the association between alcohol use during breastfeeding and infant outcomes. Results. Alcohol use was reported by 60.7% and 69.6% of breastfeeding women at 8 weeks and 12months postpartum, respectively. Breastfeeding women who consumed alcohol were more likely to be born in Australia or another English-speaking country, be tertiary educated and have higher household incomes. Most drank at low levels (<= 14 standard drinks per week, <3 per occasion) and employed strategies (e.g. timing of alcohol use) to minimise alcohol passed onto infants via breastmilk. Alcohol consumption was unrelated to breastfeeding duration, infant feeding and sleeping behaviour at 8weeks, and most infant developmental outcomes at 8weeks or 12months, after adjusting for confounders. The only significant association showed that infants whose mothers drank at 8 weeks postpartumhad more favourable results for personal-social development at 12months compared with those whose mothers abstained. Discussion and Conclusions. Low level drinking during breastfeeding is not linked with shorter breastfeeding duration or adverse outcomes in infants up to 12 months of age.

AB This cross-sectional study aims to determine the prevalence and determinants of depressive symptoms in first-time expectant fathers during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. As part of a prospective study examining depressive symptoms in men over the first postnatal year, 622 men (mean age = 34.3 years, +/- 5.0 years) completed standardized online self-report questionnaires measuring depressed mood, physical activity, sleep quality, social support, marital adjustment, life events, financial stress, and demographics during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. The Edinburgh Depression Scale was used to assess depressed mood. Partners also completed the Edinburgh Depression Scale in the third trimester. The results revealed that 13.3% of expectant fathers exhibited elevated levels of depressive symptoms during their partner's third trimester of pregnancy. Significant independent factors associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in men were poorer sleep quality, family history of psychological difficulties, lower perceived social support, poorer marital satisfaction, more stressful life events in the preceding 6 months, greater number of financial stressors, and elevated maternal antenatal depressive symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of including fathers in the screening and early prevention efforts targeting depression during the transition to parenthood, which to date have largely focused only on women. Strategies to promote better sleep, manage stress, and mobilize social support may be important areas to address in interventions tailored to new fathers at risk for depression during the transition to parenthood.

AB The long-term consequences of early life nicotine exposure are poorly defined. Approximately 8-10% of women report smoking during pregnancy, and this may promote aberrant development in the offspring. To this end, we investigated potential enduring effects of perinatal nicotine exposure on murine sleep and affective behaviors in adulthood (similar to 13-15 wk of age) in C57Bl6j mice. Mothers received a water bottle containing 200 mu g/ml nicotine bitartrate dihydrate in 2% wt/vol saccharin or pH-matched 2% saccharin with 0.2% (vol/vol) tartaric acid throughout pregnancy and before weaning. Upon reaching adulthood, offspring were tested in the open field and elevated plus maze, as well as the forced swim and sucrose anhedonia tests. Nicotine-exposed male (but not female) mice had reduced mobility in the open field, but no differences were observed in anxiety-like or depressive-like responses. Upon observing this male-specific phenotype, we further assessed sleep-wake states via wireless EEG/EMG telemetry. Following baseline recording, we assessed whether mice exposed to nicotine altered their homeostatic response to 5 h of total sleep deprivation and whether nicotine influenced responses to a powerful somnogen [i.e., lipopolysaccharides (LPS)]. Males exposed to perinatal nicotine decreased the percent time spent awake and increased time in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, without changes to REM sleep. Nicotine-exposed males also displayed exaggerated responses (increased time asleep and NREM spectral power) to sleep deprivation. Nicotine-exposed animals additionally had blunted EEG slow-wave responses to LPS administration. Together, our data suggest that perinatal nicotine exposure has long-lasting effects on normal sleep and homeostatic sleep processes into adulthood.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL FOR THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID BRITAIN; SCIENCE; 1980S; FILM
AB This article uses the case of pregnancy testing in Britain to investigate the process whereby new and often controversial reproductive technologies are made visible and normalized in mainstream entertainment media. It shows how in the 1980s and 1990s the then nascent product placement industry was instrumental in embedding pregnancy testing in British cinema and television's dramatic productions. In this period, the pregnancy-test closeup became a conventional trope and the thin blue lines associated with Unilever's Clearblue rose to prominence in mainstream consumer culture. This article investigates the aestheticization of pregnancy testing and shows how increasingly visible public concerns about 'schoolgirl mums', abortion and the biological clock, dramatized on the big and small screen, propelled the commercial rise of Clearblue. It argues that the Clearblue close-up ambiguously concealed as much as it revealed; abstraction, ambiguity and flexibility were its keys to success.

TI On the difference of cardiorespiratory synchronisation and coordination
SO CHAOS
LA English
DT Article
ID HEART-RATE
AB Cardiorespiratory phase synchronisation (CRS) is a type of cardiorespiratory coupling that manifests through a prediliction for heart beats to occur at specific points relative to the phase of the respiratory cycle. It has been under investigation for nearly 20 years, and while it seems to be mostly occurring in relaxed states such as deep sleep and anesthesia, no clear clinical implications have been established. Cardiorespiratory coordination (CRC) is a recent development in this field where the relationship between the respiratory onset and heart beat is analysed in the time domain and the possible relationship of each heart beat is considered for both the previous and the next respiratory onset. This ostensibly closely related effect must not only show relevant information content but also do so independent of CRS in order to be relevant for future studies. In this paper, we investigate CRC and its relation to CRS mainly using graphical and statistical methods on two exemplary datasets: measurements from a pregnant woman participating in a preeclampsia study and those from a man suffering from sleep apnea. We show fundamental differences between the results of both approaches and are able to show a formerly unknown dependency between the heart activity and respiratory rate, potentially indicating heartbeat-initiated inspiration. Despite their differences, methods developed for the quantification of CRS can be adapted to CRC. Completing the comparison is an investigation into the relationship between CRC and respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Similar to previous results for CRS, the two effects are found to be orthogonal, meaning that they can be observed independently or in conjunction. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Caesarean sections, and especially elective Caesarean sections, are on the increase worldwide.
   The grey-matter volume of the foetal brain undergoes a linear increase of 1,4% per week from 29 weeks until 40 weeks of gestation. This is followed by an accelerated period of brain growth, during which 50% of the increase in cortical volume occurs, between 34 and 40 weeks of gestation. Between 37 and 40 weeks of gestation, cortical grey matter increases by 50% and myelinated white matter increases three-fold.
   According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a baby is born prematurely if it is delivered before 37 completed weeks' gestational age (GA), or before 259 days after the last normal menstrual period. As a result, the American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (ACOG) has adopted a new maturity classification that refers to babies born from 37 to 39 weeks as 'early term'. Early-term neonates are at increased risk of morbidity.
   Prematurity is associated with impaired cortical development, and ex-premature infants never achieve the same degree of cortical folding as that seen in babies born at term. Prematurity is also a major risk factor for cerebral palsy, which occurs in 35% of cases. The increased risk is directly proportional to decreasing GA. The global prevalence of cerebral palsy is 2/1 000 births. Between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation, the risk increases to 6.75/1 000 births. Importantly for the timing of elective Caesarean section, there is still an increased risk of 1.35/1 000 births even after 36 weeks of gestation. Babies who are born in the early term period (between 37 and 39 weeks GA) will later constitute 5,5% of children with special educational needs (SEN). Even those babies born at 39 weeks GA carry an elevated risk and constitute 1,7% of total SEN cases.
   Normal vaginal delivery is associated with neonatal acquisition of a maternally derived microbiome that has a rich diversity. Through bacterial peptides, the microbiome stimulates immune, endocrine and neuronal cells to release cytokines and neurotransmitters, which access the central nervous system via the blood or the vagal nerve. In this way, enteric bacteria can influence mood and behaviour, sleep-wake cycles and feeding patterns. During Caesarean section, however, the foetus is colonised instead by bacteria from the mother's skin. The microbiome that results from this has far less richness and diversity. This in turn is associated with significant risk for chronic inflammatory disorders in later life. New to our understanding of chronic inflammatory disorders that result from dysbiosis is a range of neuro-developmental problems in childhood and adults.

AB Objective: Research has demonstrated that exposure to violence and adversity has negative effects on both mental health and biobehavioral outcomes, such as sleep health. Research examining the relationship between past and recent violence exposure and mental health suggests that the effects of childhood adversity are especially pernicious, but to date, no studies have attempted to disentangle the direct, indirect and relative effects of past year versus childhood exposure to violence and adversity on sleep. The objective of the current study was to examine the direct effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and past year intimate partner violence (IPV) on different aspects of sleep health in pregnant women.
   Method: A sample of high-risk pregnant women (n = 101) were interviewed. Mediation analysis with bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals was used to evaluate direct and indirect effects.
   Results: Findings indicated that while ACEs had significant direct effects on mental health, past year IPV had stronger effects on sleep quality, latency, and efficiency. ACEs did, however, indirectly affect subjective sleep quality via past year psychological IPV.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that sleep disturbance may be a regulatory stress response that is most clearly linked to past year violence and trauma. That is, though long-term sleep disturbance may be evident following childhood adversity, it is likely that this relationship is better explained by the role of childhood adversity in predicting adulthood revictimization or due to long-term mental health difficulties associated with early trauma.

AB Introduction: Treatment of mild to moderate hypertension might not benefit maternal or fetal outcome. This pessimistic point of view may have come about by using non-validated methods for measuring blood pressure in pregnancy combined with inadequate methodology for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring effects.
   Aim: To determine the association between AASI in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and preeclampsia, and to assess the ability of AASI to diagnose preeclampsia.
   Material and methods: Repeated 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed three times during pregnancy and once three months postpartum in 151 women with T1DM and 50 control women without diabetes. Circadian rhythm was evaluated as the night day ratio, night blood pressure divided by day blood pressure.
   Results: Of the T1DM women, 33 developed preeclampsia, which was associated with AASI in the 3rd trimester (p < 0.05). The best predictor of preeclampsia in TI DM was an AASI of 0.35. The diurnal blood pressure was significantly higher in all trimesters in women who later had preeclampsia. A flattened circadian rhythm was present in T1DM women with preeclampsia compared to women without preeclampsia (night-day ratio: systole 2nd trimester: 0.94 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.05, women with and without preeclampsia, respectively, p = 0.015; diastole 2nd trimester: 0.89 +/- 0.07 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.07, p = 0.003). AASI was higher during pregnancy compared to postpartum in women with T1DM (0.31 +/- 0.16, 0.31 +/- 0.16 and 0.33 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.17; 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester vs. postpartum).
   Conclusion: Women with Tl DM and preeclampsia demonstrate increased arterial stiffness and had early manifestations in the non-dipping of blood pressure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Modern technology may have desensitised the 'biological clock' to environmental cues, disrupting the appropriate co-ordination of metabolic processes. Susceptibility to misalignment of circadian rhythms may be partly genetically influenced and effects on sleep quality and duration could predispose to poorer health outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is associated with obesity traits, which are brought on by an increased opportunity to eat and/or a shift of hormonal profile promoting hunger. We hypothesised that increased sleep duration will offset susceptible genetic effects, resulting in reduced obesity risk.
   Methods: We recruited 643 (male: 338; female: 305) European children born to participants in the New Zealand centre of the International Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints sleep study. Ten genes directly involved in the circadian rhythm machinery and a further 20 genes hypothesised to be driven by cyclic oscillations were evaluated by Sequenom assay. Multivariable regression was performed to test the interaction between gene variants and average sleep length (derived from actigraphy), in relation to obesity traits (body mass index (BMI) z-scores and percentage body fat (PBF)).
   Results: No association was found between average sleep length and BMI z-scores (p = 0.056) or PBF (p = 0.609). Uncorrected genotype associations were detected between STAT-rs8069645 (p = 0.0052) and ADIPOQ-rs266729 (p = 0.019) with differences in average sleep duration. Evidence for uncorrected gene-by- sleep interactions of the CLOCK-rs4864548 (p = 0.0039), PEMT-936108 (p = 0.016) and GHRELIN-rs696217 (p = 0.046) were found in relation to BMI z-scores but not for PBF.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that children may have different genetic susceptibility to the effects of sleep duration on obesity. Further confirmatory studies are required in other population cohorts of different age groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the relationship between sleep state development across the preterm and early post-term periods and subsequent growth trajectories from 1 to 27 months corrected age.
   STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively from 111 preterm infants (<= 34 weeks gestation) who participated in a multi-site longitudinal study. Separate longitudinal parallel process models were calculated for each sleep state (active and quiet sleep) and growth (weight, length and body mass index (BMI) Z-scores) variable to estimate the associations between their developmental trajectories.
   RESULTS: Significant associations were identified between the trajectories of quiet sleep and weight, active sleep and weight, quiet sleep and BMI, and active sleep and BMI. No statistically meaningful associations were identified between the trajectories of early childhood length and the preterm sleep states.
   CONCLUSION: Faster preterm period sleep development appears to predict more favorable early childhood growth trajectories, particularly for weight, indicating preterm sleep may be an important biomarker for subsequent growth outcomes.

AB Neonatal lambs, as with human and other neonates, have low arrhythmic endogenous levels of melatonin for several weeks until they start their own pineal rhythm of melatonin production at approximately 2 weeks of life. During pregnancy, daily rhythmic transfer of maternal melatonin to the fetus has important physiological roles in sheep, nonhuman primates, and rats. This melatonin rhythm provides a circadian signal and also participates in adjusting the physiology of several organs in preparation for extrauterine life. We propose that the ensuing absence of a melatonin rhythm plays a role in neonatal adaptation. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of imposing a high-amplitude melatonin rhythm in the newborn lamb on (1) clock time-related changes in cortisol and plasma variables and (2) clock time-related changes of gene expression of clock genes and selected functional genes in the adrenal gland and heart. We treated newborn lambs with a daily oral dose of melatonin (0.25 mg/kg) from birth to 5 days of age, recreating a high-amplitude melatonin rhythm. This treatment suppressed clock time-related changes of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, clock gene expression, and functional genes in the newborn adrenal gland. In the heart, it decreased heart/body weight ratio, increased expression of Anp and Bnp, and resulted in different heart gene expression from control newborns. The interference of this postnatal melatonin treatment with the normal postnatal pattern of adrenocortical function and heart development support a physiological role for the window of flat postnatal melatonin levels during the neonatal transition.

AB Doe rabbits nurse the litter only once a day, for around 3min, with circa 24-h periodicity. To explore the participation of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in regulating this behavior, we lesioned it bilaterally with kainic acid on lactation day 7. Bilateral lesions, comprising less than 50% of the total PVN volume, abolished nursing behavior (4/8 does) or severely disrupted its normal periodicity (4/8 does). In the latter case, duration of nursing bouts was normal. Body weight, food and water intake were not significantly affected by bilateral PVN lesions. Unilateral lesions of the PVN or lesions located outside this nucleus did not significantly alter nursing periodicity or any other behavioral parameter. Results indicate an important role of the PVN for (i) maintaining maternal behavior, and (ii) the periodic display of nursing across lactation in rabbits.

AB Study objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of "apple body type" to the STOP BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Sleep center setting.
   Patients: Two hundred and eight subjects who were referred for an evaluation of possible OSA at Tulane Comprehensive Sleep Center. The exclusion criteria were age < 18 years old, incomplete or absent questionnaire, incomplete body type identification, polysomnography (PSG) refusal, and pregnant women.
   Interventions: STOP-BANG items and body type data were collected on the initial clinic visit. An overnight PSG was performed on every participant.
   Measurements: Descriptive analyses of the demographic data and PSG variables were performed. The predictive parameters of STOP and STOP-BANG without and with body type score (STOP-Apple and STOPBANG-Apple) were compared.
   Main results: The STOP questionnaire's sensitivity/specificity/positive likelihood ratio (+LR) (cut-off = 2) was 96%/11%/1.1, respectively whereas the STOP-Apple questionnaire (cut-off = 3) was 88%/39%/1.5. The STOP-BANG's sensitivity/specificity/+LR (cut-off = 3) was 96%/19%/1.2, respectively whereas the STOP-BANG-Apple questionnaire (cut-off = 4) was 90%/39%/1.5. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of STOP-Apple was comparable to the STOP-BANG (P = 0.25). The addition of the apple body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire in participants with a score 3 led to increased specificity (67.4%), increased the odds ratio of having OSA of 2.5 (95% CI, 12-5.3) and odds ratio of having moderate-severe OSA of 4.7 (95% CI, 2.5-8.7).
   Conclusion: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background. Psychosocial stress during pregnancy has been proposed as a major contributor of glucocorticoid-mediated programming of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, with later adverse health consequences. However, evidence linking maternal stress to maternal cortisol values during pregnancy is inconclusive. A possible explanation for this is that other maternal factors overshadow any potential effects of stress on cortisol levels. We studied a large cohort of pregnant women with extensive data on pregnancy characteristics to determine the respective contributions of biological, environmental and psychosocial stress factors to cortisol levels in pregnancy.
   Methods: We used data from 3039 women from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development-study cohort. Serum cortisol was measured in blood, collected at the first prenatal visit, at different gestational ages (median = 91 days, range = 40-256 days), and at various time points during the day (median = 11:45 h, range = 08:00-18:30 h). We assessed associations between maternal serum cortisol in pregnancy and biological factors, lifestyle factors and stress factors, including depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, work stress, parenting stress and fatigue.
   Results: In multivariable analysis, variables that were associated with higher cortisol levels in pregnancy were lower maternal age [1.5 nmol/l, 95%CI (0.6-2.4)], being nulliparous [21.5 nmol/l (15.9-27.1)], lower pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) [1.3 nmol/l (0.3-2.4)], higher C-reactive protein (CRP) [1.0 nmol/l (0.4-1.5)], carrying a female fetus [9.2 nmol/l (1.8-16.5)], non-smoking [14.2 nmol/l (0.6-27.7)], sufficient sleep [8.5 nmol/l (0.9-16.1)], and being unemployed [12.7 nmol/l (2.2-23.2)]. None of the psychosocial stressors was significantly associated with serum cortisol levels in pregnancy. A total of 32% of all variance in cortisol was explained by gestational age, maternal age, time of day, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, CRP, fetal sex, smoking behavior, self-reported sleep sufficiency, and employment.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that maternal cortisol during pregnancy is mainly affected by biological and lifestyle factors, but not by psychosocial factors. We suggest that psychosocial stress in pregnancy might program the fetus through other mechanisms than through altering maternal cortisol levels.

AB OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the possible association between fetal gender and long-term pediatric neurological morbidity. METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective cohort analysis comparing the risk of long-term neurological morbidity (up to age 18 years) of children born during the years 1991 to 2013 according to their gender. Neurological morbidity evaluated included hospitalizations in childhood involving pervasive developmental disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and infantile spasms and disorders of eating as recorded in the hospital files. Multiple pregnancies and fetal congenital malformations were excluded. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed to compare the cumulative neurological morbidity over the study period. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to control for obstetrical confounders, including gestational age at birth, birth weight, and maternal factors. RESULTS: During the study period, 240,953 newborns were included in the long-term analysis: 51.0% (n = 122,840) males and 49.0% (n = 118,113) females. Hospitalizations for neurological problems (up to age 18 years) were significantly more common in males compared with females (1.1% vs 0.8%, respectively, odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 12 to 1.4, P < 0.001). Specifically, pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea were found to be significantly more common in males, and cerebral palsy reached borderline significance (0.1% vs 0.04%, odds ratio 139, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.9, P = 0.06). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated males to have a significantly higher cumulative incidence of total neurological morbidity as well as of pervasive developmental disorder and obstructive sleep apnea (all log-rank test P values <0.001). In the Cox regression model, male gender exhibited an independent association with long-term neurological morbidity, while adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, and other confounding variables (adjusted hazard ratio 129, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Males are at an increased risk for pediatric neurological morbidity independent of gestational age at birth and birth weight.

AB Objective: Our goal is to test the efficacy of a family-based, multi-component intervention focused on infants of African-American (AA) mothers and families, a minority population at elevated risk for pediatric obesity, versus a child safety attention-control group to promote healthy weight gain patterns during the first two years of life.
   Design, participants, and methods: The design is a two-group randomized controlled trial among 468 AA pregnant women in central North Carolina. Mothers and study partners in the intervention group receive anticipatory guidance on breastfeeding, responsive feeding, use of non-food soothing techniques for infant crying, appropriate timing and quality of complementary feeding, age-appropriate infant sleep, and minimization of TV/media. The primary delivery channel is 6 home visits by a peer educator, 4 interim newsletters and twice-weekly text messaging. Intervention families also receive 2 home visits from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant. Assessments occur at 28 and 37 weeks gestation and when infants are 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months of age.
   Results: The primary outcome is infant/toddler growth and likelihood of overweight at 15 months. Differences between groups are expected to be achieved through uptake of the targeted infant feeding and care behaviors (secondary outcomes) and change in caregivers' modifiable risk factors (mediators) underpinning the intervention.
   Conclusions: If successful in promoting healthy infant growth and enhancing caregiver behaviors, "Mothers and Others" will have high public health relevance for future obesity-prevention efforts aimed at children younger than 2 years, including interventional research and federal, state, and community health programs.

AB OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that sleep disorder diagnosis would be associated with increased risk of preterm birth and to examine risk by gestational age, preterm birth type, and specific sleep disorder (insomnia, sleep apnea, movement disorder, and other).
   METHODS: In this observational study, participants were from a cohort of nearly 3 million women in California between 2007 and 2012. Inclusion criteria were women with singleton neonates liveborn between 20 and 44 weeks of gestation without chromosomal abnormalities or major structural birth defects linked to a hospital discharge database maintained by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development and without mental illness during pregnancy. Sleep disorder was defined based on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code (n=2,265). Propensity score matching was used to select a referent population at a one-toone ratio. Odds of preterm birth were examined by gestational age (less than 34 weeks, 34-36 weeks, and less than 37 weeks of gestation) and type (spontaneous, indicated).
   RESULTS: Prevalence of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of gestation) was 10.9% in the referent group compared with 14.6% among women with a recorded sleep disorder diagnosis. Compared with the referent group, odds (95% CI, P value, percentage) of preterm birth were 1.3 (1.0-1.7, P=.023, 14.1%) for insomnia and 1.5 (1.2-1.8, P<.001, 15.5%) for sleep apnea. Risk varied by gestational age and preterm birth type. Odds of preterm birth were not significantly increased for sleep-related movement disorders or other sleep disorders.
   CONCLUSION: Insomnia and sleep apnea were associated with significantly increased risk of preterm birth. Considering the high prevalence of sleep disorders during pregnancy and availability of evidence-based nonpharmacologic interventions, current findings suggest that screening for severe presentations would be prudent.

AB Objectives: To examine the association between residential road traffic noise and fecundity estimated by time to pregnancy (TTP).
   Design: We identified 65,201 mothers from the Danish National Birth Cohort with self-reported information on TTP collected through computer assisted telephone interviews. Road traffic noise was modelled at all historical addresses and expressed as time-weighted means for periods corresponding to individual TTP. Associations were analyzed using logistic regression for analyses of dichotomous outcomes and ordinal logistic regression for TTP in four categories, adjusting for maternal age at conception, disposable household income, education and air pollution (NOx).
   Results: Ordinal logistic regression showed a 10 dB increase in road traffic noise to be associated with a 8% increased risk of 6-12 month TTP (95% CI: 1.03; 1.12) whereas we found no statistically significant associations for >= 12 months TTP (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.99; 1.09) when compared to 0-2 months TTP. Similarly, when exploring TTP as a binary outcome we found a 10 dB higher road traffic noise to be associated with a 5% higher risk of TTP of 6 months or more (95% CI: 1.01; 1.08) as compared with < 6 months TTP, whereas when the cut point was 12 months TTP no association was found.
   Conclusion: Road traffic noise was associated with an increased risk of 6-12 month TTP, but not with risk of longer TTP, indicating that noise may have a small impact on sub-fecundity.

AB Background
   Madagascar conducted the first two phases of a national free mass distribution campaign of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) during a political crisis in 2009 aiming to achieve coverage of two LLINs per household as part of the National Malaria Control Strategy. The campaign targeted households in 19 out of 91 total health districts.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional household survey using a three-stage cluster sample design was conducted four months post campaign to assess LLIN ownership, access and use. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with household LLIN access and individual LLIN use.
   Results
   A total of 2211 households were surveyed representing 8867 people. At least one LLIN was present in 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.6-95.5%) of households and 74.8% (95% CI, 71.0-78.6%) owned at least two LLINs. Access measured as the proportion of the population that could potentially be covered by household-owned LLINs was 77.2% (77.2% (95% CI, 72.9-81.3%) and LLIN use by all individuals was 84.2% (95% CI, 81.2-87.2%). LLIN use was associated with knowledge of insecticide treated net use to prevent malaria (OR = 3.58, 95% CI, 1.85-6.94), household ownership of more LLINs (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.85-4.3), presence of children under five (OR = 2.05, 95% CI, 1.67-2.51), having traveled to the distribution point and receiving information about hanging a bednet (OR = 1.56, 95% CI, 1.41-1.74), and having received a post-campaign visit by a community mobilizer (OR = 1.75, 95% CI, 1.26-2.43). Lower LLIN use was associated with increasing household size (OR = 0.81 95% CI 0.77-0.85) and number of sleeping spaces (OR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.44-0.68).
   Conclusions
   A large scale free mass LLIN distribution campaign was feasible and effective at achieving high LLIN access and use in Madagascar. Campaign process indicators highlighted potential areas for strengthening implementation to optimize access and equity.

AB White matter microstructure, essential for efficient and coordinated transmission of neural communications, undergoes pronounced development during the first years of life, while deviations to this neurodevelopmental trajectory likely result in alterations of brain connectivity relevant to behavior. Hence, systematic evaluation of white matter microstructure in the normative brain is critical for a neuroscientific approach to both typical and atypical early behavioral development. However, few studies have examined the infant brain in detail, particularly in infants under 3 months of age. Here, we utilize quantitative techniques of diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging to investigate neonatal white matter microstructure in 104 infants. An optimized multiple b-value diffusion protocol was developed to allow for successful acquisition during non-sedated sleep. Associations between white matter microstructure measures and gestation corrected age, regional asymmetries, infant sex, as well as newborn growth measures were assessed. Results highlight changes of white matter microstructure during the earliest periods of development and demonstrate differential timing of developing regions and regional asymmetries. Our results contribute to a growing body of research investigating the neurobiological changes associated with neurodevelopment and suggest that characteristics of white matter microstructure are already underway in the weeks immediately following birth.

AB Background: Considering the lack of evidence on incidence and continuity of sleep problems from adolescence to young adulthood, this study explores sleep problems' incidence and their continuation rates from 14 to 21 years.
   Methods: Sleep data from the 14-year (n = 4,924) and 21-year (n = 3660) follow-up of the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy cohort were used. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and psychological conditions were explored for their role in sleep problems. Modified Poisson regression with a robust error variance was used to identify predictors. Inverse probability weights were used to account for attrition.
   Results: Of all subjects, 26.0% of the subjects at 14 years and 28.3% of the subjects at 21 years reported "often" sleep problems, with 41.7% of adolescent sleep problems persisting at 21 years. Perinatal and early-life maternal factors, for example, drug abuse (incidence rate ratio (IRR), 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.71), smoking, depression, and anxiety, were significant predictors of adolescent sleep problems. Female sex (IRR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.55-2.94), advanced pubertal stages, and smoking were the important predictors of sleep problems at 21 years. Adolescent depression/anxiety supported the continuity of sleep problems (IRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.40), whereas exercise was seen to exert a protective effect.
   Conclusion: This study indicates high rates of sleep problems in young subjects, with around half of sleep problems originating in adolescence persisting in young adulthood. Therefore, early interventions are needed to manage sleep problems in young subjects and prevent further progression to other life stages. Future studies should explore if sleep problems in young adults also persist in later life stages and identify the factors supporting the continuity of sleep problems.

AB Objective: This research examined the association between perceived everyday racial discrimination, as a psychosocial stressor, and perinatal sleep quality.
   Design: Cross-sectional (N = 640) and longitudinal associations (N = 133) between everyday experiences of discrimination and sleep quality were examined using a pregnancy and postpartum data registry.
   Participants: We studied a sample of 640 unique women from the Perinatal Research Repository (PRR), a longitudinal study of mothers, fathers, and babies recruited from Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.
   Measurements: Discrimination and sleep quality were assessed using the Experiences of Discrimination Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively.
   Results: Overall, everyday discrimination was associated with poorer global sleep quality and all but three sleep sub-measures of the PSQI cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. When stratified, the adverse effects of everyday discrimination varied by race and perinatal time period. Increases in everyday discrimination were independently associated with poorer sleep initiation, poorer sleep maintenance and poorer daytime dysfunction.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that the immediate stressors of everyday racial discrimination were independently associated with poorer sleep quality among pregnant women cross-sectionally. Poorer sleep quality has been associated with numerous adverse perinatal outcomes and this association may be important in understanding racial discrimination as a risk factor. Our failure to identify a longitudinal association makes the direction of causation uncertain, however. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to clarify the association, given the potential importance of poor sleep quality in the pathogenesis of pregnancy complications.

AB The paper discusses the processing of the motherhood experience through the dream recalling. Themes emerged from 40 pregnant women's dream narratives were compared for period (first/third trimester) and experience of pregnancy (primipara/pluripara). The narratives of dreams were analyzed as a text through a lexical analysis of specificities and a thematic analysis of elementary contexts, both provided by T-Lab (Lancia, 2004). Four clusters (Challenge, Psychic/sensorial, Anxieties, Caesura), organized in the factorial mapping, show three vectors of meaning representing the functions of dream (To contain/To Throw out, To assemble psychic material, Transformations). Differences appear according to the period and the experience of pregnancy.
