N2  - Extreme obesity (BMI ≥ 40) is thought to complicate approximately 5% of deliveries in the United States. Extreme obesity puts a pregnant woman at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure; respiratory disease, including obstructive sleep apnea and asthma; as well as pregnancy-specific diseases including pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. Extreme obesity also puts a parturient at a significantly increased risk of requiring cesarean delivery. For the anesthesiologist, the physiologic changes of obesity combined with the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy can make for a complex and challenging case. This review will focus on the anesthetic approach to the extremely obese parturient undergoing scheduled operative delivery. With proper planning and a detailed understanding of the patient[U+05F3]s comorbidities, a safe and effective anesthetic can be achieved.

N2  - Short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and insomnia frequently characterize sleep in pregnancy during all three trimesters. We aimed: (i) to review the clinical evidence of the association between conditions of sleep loss during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) to discuss the potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may be involved. A systematic search of cross-sectional, longitudinal studies using Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO, and MeSH headings and key words for conditions of sleep loss such as 'insomnia', 'poor sleep quality', 'short sleep duration', and 'pregnancy outcome' was made for papers published between January 1, 1960 and July 2013. Twenty studies met inclusion criteria for sleep loss and pregnancy outcome: seven studies on prenatal depression, three on gestational diabetes, three on hypertension, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, six on length of labor/type of delivery, eight on preterm birth, and three on birth grow/birth weight. Two main results emerged: (i) conditions of chronic sleep loss are related to adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) chronic sleep loss yields a stress-related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and abnormal immune/inflammatory, reaction, which, in turn, influences pregnancy outcome negatively. Chronic sleep loss frequently characterizes sleep throughout the course of pregnancy and may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Common pathophysiological mechanisms emerged as being related to stress system activation. We propose that in accordance to the allostatic load hypothesis, chronic sleep loss during pregnancy may also be regarded as both a result of stress and a physiological stressor per se, leading to stress 'overload'. It may account for adverse pregnancy outcomes and somatic and mental disorders in pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Study Objective: To assess the validity of using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System (ARES) Unicorder for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women. Methods: Sixteen pregnant women, mean age (SD) = 29.8 (5.4) years, average gestational age (SD) = 28.6 (6.3) weeks, mean body mass index (SD) = 44.7 (6.9) kg/m2 with signs and symptoms of OSA wore the ARES Unicorder during one night of laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG was scored according to AASM 2007 criteria, and PSG AHI and RDI were compared to the ARES 1%, 3%, and 4% AHIs calculated with the ARES propriety software. Results: Median PSG AHI and PSG RDI were 3.1 and 10.3 events/h of sleep, respectively. Six women had a PSG AHI ≥ 5 events/h of sleep and 11 had a PSG RDI ≥ 5 events/h of sleep. PSG AHI and RDI were strongly correlated with the ARES AHI measures. When compared with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, the ARES 3% algorithm provided the best balance between sensitivity (1.0 for PSG AHI, 0.91 for PSG RDI) and specificity (0.5 for PSG AHI, 0.8 for PSG RDI) for detecting sleep disordered breathing in our sample. Conclusions: The ARES Unicorder demonstrated reasonable consistency with PSG for diagnosing OSA in this small, heterogeneous sample of obese pregnant women.

N2  - Summary: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been used in pregnancy for just over 20 years now and is generally well tolerated. Normal values have been established for different gestations; these are slightly higher than conventional blood pressure (BP) in normal pregnancy, presumably reflecting greater activity during the 24 h of ABPM recordings. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a better predictor than conventional BP for the development of pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, but it is not sensitive or specific enough to be recommended for these purposes in routine practice. Studies of ABPM have shown that sleep hypertension is common in women with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia, but detecting this in routine clinical practice does not aid usual decision making in the pregnancy, including timing of delivery. Studies using ABPM have found that pregnant women who are working outside the home have higher BP than non-working women, but these data should not be interpreted to mean that not working during pregnancy will prevent gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. The best role for ABPM is to determine whether women with office hypertension in early pregnancy have true (usually essential) hypertension or white-coat hypertension. The latter can be managed without antihypertensives and pregnancy outcomes appear good, although possibly with a slightly increased incidence of pre-eclampsia. Women who have had pre-eclampsia are at greater life-time risk for cardiovascular diseases; several years postpartum these women have slightly higher ABPM-measured BP than women who had normal pregnancies and a greater propensity to metabolic syndrome. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

N2  - Background: Cardiometabolic (CM) risk factors are linked to increased morbidity. Disturbed sleep is associated with CM risk factors in late pregnancy, but little is known about sleep in early pregnancy and CM risk factors. Methods: Diary and actigraphy-assessed sleep information, as well as CM outcomes (blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI)), were collected thrice from pregnant women (N= 161) in early pregnancy: T1 (10-12. weeks), T2 (14-16. weeks) and T3 (18-20. weeks). The sleep variables evaluated included sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO) and total sleep time (TST). Sleep variables were dichotomised using established clinical cut-offs. Results: BMI and BP significantly changed across time. Women with persistent SOL. ≥. 20. min had greater BMI than women without persistent SOL. ≥. 20. min prior to covariate adjustment at T1 and T2, but at T3 the BMI values converged. Similar results were observed for persistent WASO. ≥. 30. min. Persistently long WASO, as measured by actigraphy, was associated with elevated SBP, after controlling for covariates. Conclusions: Consistent with anecdotal evidence, it appears as if a subset of women report substantial difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep during early pregnancy and this may augment the risk of higher BP and BMI. Understanding these relationships is important as CM risk factors are linked to maternal and infant morbidity. Assessing sleep in early pregnancy may bestow time necessary for appropriate intervention. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to clarify the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and its associated factors among pregnant women in Japan. Of the 940 randomly selected survey locations identified by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 344 obstetric institutions participated in the survey. The study was conducted on women with confirmed pregnancies who had had a second or subsequent consultation at one of these institutions. The survey items included age, highest educational achievement, trimester of pregnancy, number of pregnancies, employment status, smoking, alcohol consumption, restless sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, sleep duration, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and restless leg syndrome. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was used to assess the level of excessive daytime sleepiness. We calculated the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness and then examined its associated factors using χ2 test and multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness among pregnant women was 6.2%. The results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly higher among younger women and those in an earlier trimester of pregnancy. The odds ratio with regard to excessive daytime sleepiness was also significantly higher for women in their first pregnancy, full-time workers, and current alcohol consumers. Women indicating the presence of sleep-related issues, including restless sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, napping, snoring or breathlessness, and symptoms of restless leg syndrome, reported significantly higher levels of excessive daytime sleepiness. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during 24 hours shows a blood pressure variability. The prevalence of chronic hyperten sion in pregnant women is 1-5%, so it is important to know the changes in blood pressure and cardiovascular risk and prevent complications to the mother and fetus.
Objetive: To know the circadian rhythm of the blood pressure in the chronic hypertensive pregnant patients, through the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.
Material and methods: A cross-sectional and descriptive study included chronic hypertensive pregnant patients, with > 20 weeks of gestation. Assessment of factors related to gynaecologic characteristics, according to the inclusion criteria underwent a washout period of two weeks and they were monitored with a Spacelabs 90207 monitor blood pressure. Quantitative variables by Student t test, one-way ANOVA and Pearson correlation were analysed.
Results: 16 chronic hypertensive pregnant patients were included, whose ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the systolic blood pressure in 24 hours averaged 117.12 ± 5.85 mmHg; 24 hours diastolic blood pressure 71.31 ± 5.89 mmHg; daytime systolic blood pressure 120.18 ± 5.75 mmHg, nocturnal systolic blood pressure 110.31 ± 8.41 mmHg; daytime diastolic blood pressure 75.43 ± 7.32 mmHg, nocturnal diastolic blood pressure 64.25 ± 8.27 mmHg. Significant differences between daytime and night time were found.
Conclusion: 56% of chronic hypertensive pregnant patients had no nocturnal reduction in systolic blood pressure and 43.75% had no nocturnal changes on diastolic blood pressure. The fact that 50% of patients were non-dippers force us to use long-action antihypertensive therapy and obtain control of the blood pressure for 24 hours.

N2  - Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and may be influenced by a multitude of factors. Pregnancy physiology may predispose to sleep disruption but may also result in worsening of some underlying sleep disorders, and the de novo development of others. Apart from sleep disordered breathing, the impact of sleep disorders on pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes is poorly understood. In this article, we review the literature and discuss available data pertaining to the most common sleep disorders in perinatal women. These include restless legs syndrome, insomnia, circadian pattern disturbances, narcolepsy, and sleep-disordered breathing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Sleep fragmentation (SF) is a common condition among pregnant women, particularly during late gestation. Gestational perturbations promote the emergence of adiposity and metabolic disease risk in offspring, most likely through epigenetic modifications. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) expression inversely correlates with obesity and insulin resistance. The effects of SF during late gestation on metabolic function and AdipoQ expression in visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) of offspring mice are unknown. Male offspring mice were assessed at 24 weeks after dams were exposed to SF or control sleep during late gestation. Increased food intake, body weight, VWAT mass, and insulin resistance, with reductions in AdipoQ expression in VWAT, emerged in SF offspring. Increased DNMT3a and -b and global DNA methylation and reduced histone acetyltransferase activity and TET1, -2, and -3 expression were detected in VWAT of SF offspring. Reductions in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and H3K4m3 and an increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K9m2 in the promoter and enhancer regions of AdipoQ emerged in adipocytes from VWAT and correlated with AdipoQ expression. SF during late gestation induces epigenetic modifications in AdipoQ in male offspring mouse VWAT adipocytes along with a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype. Thus, altered gestational environments elicited by SF impose the emergence of adverse, long-lasting metabolic consequences in the next generation.

N2  - Purpose of review: The evidence of a putative causal effect of sleep apnea-induced intermittent hypoxia on the pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is mounting. The present review presents the evidence of current literature and questions whether an early diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Recent findings: Although pathophysiological pathways remain to be more clearly defined, recent studies shed light on the association of sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. For the first time, a recent prospective study revealed that obstructive sleep apnea increases over the course of pregnancy and that it is common during the third trimester. In this study, age and BMI have been identified as independent predictors of gestational obstructive sleep apnea. Summary: An association between sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia has been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment during pregnancy on hypertension and preeclampsia. Further studies are required to ascertain whether continuous positive airway pressure can be a useful adjunct treatment for pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia.

N2  - This study examined the association between measures of objective sleep (OS) and subjective sleep (SS) to postpartum mood in healthy women from the third trimester of pregnancy to 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Twenty-nine pregnant women completed self-report measures of mood and SS, and wore actigraphs for 7 continuous days during the third trimester (Time 1), within 15 days (Time 2), and 10 to 12 weeks postpartum (Time 3). The subjective perception of marked daytime dysfunction was associated with low mood during Time 1 and Time 3. Poor nighttime SS was related to low mood only at Time 2, whereas poor nighttime OS influenced stress during the same assessment time. These data indicate a stronger association between postpartum mood and the subjective perception of sleep than with OS quality and duration in healthy, non-depressed women, and highlight the awareness of poor daytime functioning as a significant contributor to new mothers' emotional wellbeing.

N2  - Objective Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are increased in pregnancy compared to the nongravid state. Maternal SDB may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but this is still under investigation. We performed a systematic literature review, and where feasible, a metaanalysis, to evaluate whether women with SDB in pregnancy have a higher risk of specific adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with women without SDB. Study Design Original studies published until June 2012 evaluating the association between gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight infants, and maternal SDB, defined either by symptoms or the reference standard polysomnography, were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data were extracted on study design and outcome estimates. When appropriate, effect estimates from each study were pooled using a random-effects model. Results Of the 4386 studies identified, 31 met the defined criteria. Twenty-one studies, all observational in design, reported dichotomous outcomes; 9 of these adjusted for potential confounders. Maternal SDB was significantly associated with gestational hypertension/preeclampsia (pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60-3.09; 5 studies), and gestational diabetes (pooled aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; 5 studies). Conclusion Based on published observational studies to date, maternal SDB is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes after adjusting for potential confounders. However, large-scale, prospective cohort, and interventional studies are needed to further elucidate the relationship between maternal SDB and adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2014 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - We report a patient with pregnancy related obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA]; apnea hypopnea index [AHI] 18/h) early after delivery, with improvement of AHI by 87% following 45-degree elevation in body position compared with the non-elevated position. Improvement associated with this position may be explained, at least in part, by an increased upper airway diameter (as measured during wakefulness). Sleep apnea in this patient resolved at 9 months postpartum. This observation suggests that 45-degree elevated body position may be an effective treatment of pregnancy related OSA during the postpartum period.

N2  - Study Objective: To evaluate all patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation in combination with laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Design: Case controlled retrospective study performed between January 2009 and March 2014. Setting: University based tertiary care medical center. Patients: Four reproductive age women undergoing bariatric surgery with desire for permanent surgical sterilization. Intervention: Laparoscopic vertical gastric sleeve procedure and laparoscopic tubal ligation. Measurements and Main Results: Four combined laparoscopic tubal ligations and gastric sleeve procedures were attempted. All four cases were successfully completed using a minimally invasive approach. The mean age of the patients was 44.25 years; the mean BMI was 49.25 kg/m2 (mean weight 303.75 lbs). The mean parity was 2.25 and none of the patients were nulliparous. Two patients had one prior cesarean section. Co -morbid conditions included hypertension, sleep apnea, polycystic ovarian disorder, type II diabetes mellitus, and gastro esophageal reflux disease. All patients successfully underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation as well as laparoscopic vertical gastric sleeve procedure. There were no intraoperative complications were noted in any of the cases. Post-surgical complications were reported in one of the four patients. Complications were related to intraabdominal adhesive disease and development of a paraesophageal hernia. This patient underwent lysis of adhesions and paraesophageal hernia repair with mesh. This complications were not thought to be related to the tubal ligation. Conclusion: Performing tubal occlusion at the time of bariatric surgery is a safe and effective way to eliminate the risk of future pregnancy. Fifty percent of pregnancies are undesired despite adequate and available contraception. Pregnancy presents additional risk to obese patients and those who have undergone bariatric surgery. It is therefore reasonable to screen patients for their desire for future child bearing and offer combined surgical tubal ligation in patients planning to undergo bariatric weight loss surgery.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common condition in postreproductive females. Key risk factors for later-life CVD include gestational hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia (PE). Although several risk factors of hypertension in pregnancy are well recognized, a novel risk factor that has emerged recently is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a condition characterized by repeated closure of the upper airway during sleep with disrupted ventilation and sleep fragmentation. In the nonpregnant population, SDB is now known to play a causal role in future CVD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to propose the hypothesis that occult SDB during pregnancy may play a role in long-term CVD in women who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This study is a review and synthesis of empirical evidence that links SDB to GHTN/PE and GHTN/PE to future CVD. RESULTS: An increasing body of evidence supports the relationship between SDB and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy via mechanisms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with long-term risk for CVD via similar mechanisms. However, no studies have addressed the potential role of SDB in long-term outcomes of women with GHTN/PE during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Given the suggested mechanisms that explain these associations, it is plausible that SDB during pregnancy may increase long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. RELEVANCE: Pregnancy may offer a window of opportunity for identification and treatment of SDB, which could provide substantial health benefit for many years to come. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to evaluate the current evidence regarding the frequency of SDB in pregnancy, its risk factors, subsequent outcomes, and treatment. © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Research indicates that poor sleep quality is linked to and may precede depressive symptomatology in pregnancy, complicating screening for either condition. Pregnancy onset may also contribute to the development of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). For the first time, the link between SDB and depression was examined in pregnancy. A total of 189 pregnant women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality and the Berlin Questionnaire for SDB. Women were also asked what they felt was the cause of their symptoms. PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and self-perceived depression were strongly associated with EPDS scores of probable depression (X2 13.39; p<0.001). Berlin-assessed risk of SDB was also associated with probable depression (X2 9.20 p<0.01), though this was attenuated following multivariate analysis. There was a significant relationship between total PSQI score and the tendency for participants to attribute 'sleep-related causes' to their low mood (X 2 20.78; p<0.001). This study confirms the link between PSQI-assessed poor sleep quality and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, suggesting the two questionnaires assess the same or overlapping conditions. Although there was a relationship between probable depression and high risk SDB, the effect was attenuated after accounting for other depression risk factors, including body mass index (BMI). © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: OSA has been associated with adverse perinatal outcomes; definitive diagnosis requires polysomnography (PSG). We and others have recently published on the poor performance of commonly employed screening measures for OSA in pregnancy. Given the time, inaccessibility, and expense of PSG testing, a pregnancy-specific OSA screening measure is needed. Our aim was to create and assess the validity of a new pregnancy-specific questionnaire (POQ) employing a robust population-based prospective cohort. STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire comprised of two accepted sleep screening questionnaires (the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS))- with additional questions about napping frequency, duration, and feelings of wakefulness-was administered to over 1500 subjects. Subjects who screened positive on either the BQ or ESS were referred to a sleep center for PSG or completed an in-hospital modified sleep study with a four-channel sleep-screening device. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: 1509 subjects were enrolled. Generalized linear models from 1153 subjects were adjusted for covariates. Items with the highest adjusted relative-risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes were used to create a novel 12-item measure. Each positive item garnered one point on our new Pregnancy-OSA Questionnaire (POQ). Positive scores of 5, 6, and 7 were tested for subjects with diagnostic testing (n=58). The sensitivities and specificities of this measure are shown; ROC curves were not significant. CONCLUSION: BQ and ESS are poorly predictive of OSA among gravidae, necessitating development of a pregnancy-specific OSA screening tool. We have designed and tested a POQ with high specificity, which may be beneficial when screening a population with poor access to diagnostic testing and treatment. By employing measures associated with poor perinatal outcomes from our population based cohort of over 1500 subjects, our POQ has the capacity to target gravidae that may benefit from diagnosis and intervention.

N2  - Objective: The majority of women develop sleep impairments during pregnancy, but alterations in dream experiences remain poorly understood. This study aimed to assess prospectively and comparatively the recall of dreaming and of disturbed dreaming in late pregnancy. Methods: Fifty-seven nulliparous, third-trimester pregnant women (mean age. ±. SD, 28.7. ±. 4.06. years) and 59 non-pregnant controls (mean age. ±. SD, 26.8. ±. 4.21. years) completed demographics and psychological questionnaires. A 14-day prospective home log assessed sleep and dream characteristics and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire measured retrospective dream and disturbed dream recall. Results: Even though pregnant and non-pregnant women showed similar prospective dream recall (P= 0.47), pregnant women reported prospectively more bad dreams (P= 0.004). More pregnant women (21%) than non-pregnant women (7%) reported a nightmare incidence exceeding moderately severe pathology (>1/week) (P= 0.03). Pregnant women also reported overall lower sleep quality (P= 0.007) and more night awakenings (P= 0.003). Higher prospective recall of bad dreams (r= -0.40, P= 0.002) and nightmares (r= -0.32, P= 0.001) both correlated with lower sleep quality in pregnant women. Conclusions: Late pregnancy is a period of markedly increased dysphoric dream imagery that may be a major contributor to impaired sleep at this time. Further polysomnographic assessments of pregnant women are needed to clarify relationships between sleep and disturbed dream production in this population. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Data from non-pregnant populations suggests that sleep disruption can negatively impact glucose metabolism. Moreover, several studies have found associations between shortened sleep duration and impaired glucose metabolism in pregnancy. However, interpretation of the pregnancy data is limited given the lack of objective sleep measures. Our goal was to describe the relationship between objectively assessed sleep duration and fasting blood glucose in women recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM). STUDY DESIGN: Women recently diagnosed with GDM were enrolled immediately after they attended a GDM education class. At the time of enrollment none of the subjects were on insulin or glyburide, and all received the same standardized teaching by trained diabetic educators. They were instructed on the use of a glucometer, timing of glucose testing, and nutritional principals of a GDM diet. Women were asked to wear an actigraph (ActiWatch, Phillips Respironics) and to complete a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Blood glucose records were compared against the objective sleep data. A linear mixed model analysis was used to estimate the effect of sleep duration on morning fasting blood glucose. RESULTS: 17 participants provided sleep data and morning fasting blood glucose values. 68 nights of complete data were available for analysis. Median fasting blood glucose was 94.5 mg/dL (IQR 89.5- 102.5) and median sleep duration was 7.1 hours (IQR 6.2-7.8). 24% of nights had sleep durations of less than 6 hours. Sleep duration was negatively associated with fasting blood glucose (p=.038). There was a 2 mg/dL decrease in fasting blood glucose for each additional hour of sleep. CONCLUSION: Longer sleep durations are associated with lower fasting blood glucose in women with gestational diabetes. Educating women on healthy sleep and screening for and treating sleep disorders during pregnancy may have a role in optimizing blood glucose control in gestational diabetes.

N2  - Objectives To determine the incidence of admission in labor after morphine sleep (therapeutic rest), patient characteristics associated with labor, and adverse outcomes associated with treatment. Methods We reviewed medical records of women treated with morphine sleep from December 2005 to December 2009. Variables evaluated included medications used for treatment, cervical examination, maternal demographic characteristics and obstetric history, fetal heart rate patterns, and maternal/neonatal outcomes. These characteristics were compared between those admitted in labor after morphine sleep versus those discharged. Results Fifty-eight women received morphine sleep: 36 (62%) were admitted in labor, 17 (29%) were discharged, and 5 (9%) were admitted secondary to category II fetal heart rate tracings. All fetuses had category I fetal heart rate tracings prior to treatment. Median dose of morphine sulfate was 20 mg. Those with effacement > 50% (p < 0.01) and carrying term gestations (p < 0.01) were more likely to be admitted in labor after treatment. There were no adverse maternal outcomes. There were no significant differences in neonatal outcomes. Conclusion Sixty-two percent of women were admitted in labor after morphine sleep. Admission effacement > 50% and term gestational age were associated with admission in labor. There were no significant differences in maternal or neonatal morbidity in those admitted versus discharged home after treatment with morphine sleep.©2014 by Thieme Medical.

N2  - With the aim of comparing the circadian characteristics of blood pressure (BP) in normotensive pregnant women and preeclampsia, a total of 35 pregnant women with gestational age more than 20 weeks (age: 18-40 years) were recruited from the patients admitted in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Queen Mary's Hospital, King George's Medical University, Lucknow. In these patients, systolic (S) BP was 140 mmHg or above and diastolic (D) BP was 90 mmHg or above on 2 consecutive occasions, with measurements taken 6 hours apart. Thirty five agematched pregnant women were diagnosed as 'normotensive', when their casual BP was always below 140/90 mmHg on at least 3 different occasions were included as Controls. We analyzed BP records obtained by ABPM (TM-2430 monitors from the A&D Company, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days, observing all the required precautions and after getting their informed consent and proper counseling. Compared with normotensive pregnancies, a statistically significant elevation of the circadian rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR, a rhythmadjusted average value) of BP was observed in preeclampsia (p<0.001 for both SBP and DBP). © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

N2  - With the aim of comparing the circadian characteristics of blood pressure (BP) in normotensive pregnant women and preeclampsia, a total of 35 pregnant women with gestational age more than 20 weeks (age: 18-40 years) were recruited from the patients admitted in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Queen Mary's Hospital, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow. In these patients, systolic (S) BP was 140 mmHg or above and diastolic (D) BP was 90 mmHg or above on 2 consecutive occasions, with measurements taken 6 hours apart. Thirty five age-matched pregnant women were diagnosed as 'normotensive', when their casual BP was always below 140/90 mmHg on at least 3 different occasions were included as Controls. We analyzed BP records obtained by ABPM (TM-2430 monitors from the A&D Company, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days, observing all the required precautions and after getting their informed consent and proper counseling. Compared with normotensive pregnancies, a statistically significant elevation of the circadian rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR, a rhythm-adjusted average value) of BP was observed in preeclampsia (p<0.001 for both SBP and DBP).

N2  - To determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in a population of Nigerian women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. A prospective cross-sectional design. Participants' were interviewed at the antenatal clinic with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep during and before pregnancy and to appraise disturbance in their sleep according to the trimester. Two hundred and three pregnant women participated in the survey and were evaluated at one of three points in pregnancy: 1st trimester (n=57), 2nd trimester (n=71) and 3rd trimester (n=75). Overall, the prevalence of sleep disorder in the population surveyed was 35.5% (72/203), more women experienced sleep disturbances in the first (42.1%) and third (40%) trimester of pregnancy compared to the second (25.3%). In terms of types of sleep disorders; 96(47.3%) reported insomnia, 32(15.8%) sleep breathing disorders, 86(42.4%) excessive daytime sleepiness, 172(84.7%) mild sleepiness and 64(31.5%) significant specific awakenings. The most common reason for specific awakening was frequent urination (78.6%). These sleep disorders were more common in the third trimester of pregnancy but only insomnia and specific awakenings showed statistical significance, p=0.007 and 0.031 respectively. Logistic regression model showed that nulliparity, increased BMI and previous adverse obstetric events had significant independent associations with sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are common in pregnancy, notably in the first and third trimesters.

N2  - Of the problems that complicate child-bearing, hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), or severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), is likely one of the most painful with unrelenting retching and vomiting that can lead to measurable injuries such as Mallory-Weiss Syndrome and esophageal rupture, and/or subtle maternal cognitive impairments related to starvation and dehydration. Recognized hallmarks of HG include dehydration, ketonuria, weight loss over 5%, and electrolyte abnormalities not attributable to other causes.Historically providers regarded the hyperemetic as a difficult to treat patient with potentially underlying psychological problems. Sick patients who experience pain and suffering present challenges to care, not excepting NVP. Ill patients can be demanding and agitated. Agitation can be one of the early signs of delirium or altered mental status (AMS). AMS can include previously diagnosed psychiatric conditions as well as new onset of Wernicke's encephalopathy, deliria, insomnia, hallucinations and autoscopy, resulting from various etiologies including and not limited to medications, pain including pain from hunger, vomiting and retching, constipation, dehydration, altered electrolytes, hypoglycemia, malnutrition and sleep deprivation.AMS may have a subtle waxing and waning trajectory, making the condition difficult to diagnosis in early stages. What have not been well elucidated in AMS are subjective images and/or experiences. Whether all AMS experiences are similar is unknown. We believe there may be a transient alteration of cognitive status or "altered sensorium gestosis" (ASG), attributed to the direct insults of hyperemesis gravidarum which will be discussed herein. How prevalent ASG might be is unknown and needs further investigation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Objective:We sought to ascertain the validity of two screening scales for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnancy and to establish the prevalence of OSA in pregnancy.Study Design:In this prospective observational study, two screening scales were administered. Screen positive subjects were referred for diagnostic polysomnography (PSG); if admitted for antepartum care, screen positive subjects underwent a modified study with a type 3 device (T3D).Result:A total of 1509 subjects underwent OSA screening; 58 completed diagnostic testing. Neither measure was a reliable diagnostic tool for OSA as determined by T3D or PSG (detection rates of 10.3% and 18.0%, respectively). Among screen positive subjects undergoing PSG or T3D testing, 15.5% ultimately met 'gold standard' OSA diagnostic criteria for an estimated point prevalence of 4.9%.Conclusion:In this prospective trial, screening positive on the Berlin questionnaire or Epworth sleepiness scale was poorly predictive of OSA among gravidae and was associated with a high false referral rate. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

N2  - Sleep disturbances, including sleep insufficiency and sleep fragmentation, have been linked to abnormal glucose metabolism and increased diabetes risk. Well-controlled laboratory studies have provided insights regarding the underlying mechanisms. Several large prospective studies suggest that these sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. Whether glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea remains controversial. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy and their relationship to gestational diabetes and hyperglycemia have received considerable attention owing to potential adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, evidence from animal models has identified disruption of the circadian system as a putative risk factor for adverse metabolic outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current state of knowledge linking sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and glucose metabolism. Experimental, prospective, and interventional studies are discussed. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.

N2  - The treatment of opiate-dependent women during pregnancy is a common problem. Maintenance treatment with methadone is the best-established treatment, although a few case reports demonstrate the possible advantages of buprenorphine and slow release morphine in limiting the intensity of the postnatal, neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Here we report on the course of pregnancy and the postnatal withdrawal symptom of the son of a 25-year-old, first childbearing woman in her 38th week of pregnancy under diamorphine-assisted treatment (HAT=heroin-assisted treatment). Until the beginning of her pregnancy Mrs. X was maintained on diamorphine for about a year; apart from diamorphine, the only medicinal treatment was low dosages of quetiapine ad libitum, which were prescribed to treat nightmares and sleep-onset disorder. The pregnancy under diamorphine maintenance caused no major problems, and childbirth by Caesarean section took place in the 38+2 week of her pregnancy, although Mrs. X’s son’s neonatal withdrawal syndrome turned out to be more severe, and to show an earlier onset compared with methadone or buprenorphine treatments.

N2  - Neuroactive steroid concentrations are remarkably high in the foetal brain during late gestation. These concentrations are maintained by placental progesterone synthesis and the interaction of enzymes in the placenta and foetal brain. 5α-Pregnane-3α-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) is a key neuroactive steroid during foetal life, although other 3α-hydroxy- pregnanes may make an additional contribution to neuroactive steroid action. Allopregnanolone modulates GABAergic inhibition to maintain a suppressive action on the foetal brain during late gestation. This action suppresses foetal behaviour and maintains the appropriate balance of foetal sleep-like behaviours, which in turn are important to normal neurodevelopment. Neuroactive steroid-induced suppression of excitability has a key role in protecting the foetal brain from acute hypoxia/ischaemia insults. Hypoxia-induced brain injury is markedly increased if neuroactive steroid levels are suppressed and there is increased seizure activity. There is also a rapid increase in allopregnanolone synthesis and hence levels in response to acute stress that acts as an endogenous protective mechanism. Allopregnanolone has a trophic role in regulating development, maintaining normal levels of apoptosis and increasing myelination during late gestation in the brain. In contrast, chronic foetal stressors, including intrauterine growth restriction, do not increase neuroactive steroid levels in the brain and exposure to repeated synthetic corticosteroids reduce neuroactive steroid levels. The reduced availability of neuroactive steroids may contribute to the adverse effects of chronic stressors on the foetal and newborn brain. Preterm birth also deprives the foetus of neuroactive steroid mediated protection and may increase vulnerability to brain injury and suboptimal development. These finding suggest replacement therapies should be explored. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Pregnancy and steroids © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - To analyze which Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Postpartum Depression Screening Scores (PDSS) total and dimensional scores, as well as symptomatic answers proportions significantly differ between women in the perinatal period (pregnant/postpartum) without major depression, with major depression and women outside the perinatal period. Methods 572 pregnant women in the third trimester completed Beck Depression Inventory-II and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale and were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. 417 of these were also assessed (with the same instruments) at three months postpartum. Ninety non-pregnant women or that did not have a child in the last year (mean age=29.42±7.159 years) also filled in the questionnaires. Results Non-depressed pregnant women showed lower scores than depressed pregnant women and higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the BDI-II total score and in its Somatic-Anxiety dimension. Non-depressed postpartum women showed significantly higher scores than women outside the perinatal period only at Sleep/Eating Disturbances. Compared to women outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without depression presented higher scores only in the somatic items. Women with vs. without depression in the postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and sleep changes. Limitations Women outside the perinatal period were not diagnosed for the presence of a depressive disorder, but their BDI-II mean score was similar to the figures reported worldwide regarding women in childbearing age. Conclusion In the perinatal period, most particularly at pregnancy, women experience significant somatic changes even if not clinically depressed. Cognitive-affective symptoms are more useful when assessing the presence of perinatal depression. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the joint effects of maternal ppBMI and GDM on adverse pregnancy/ birth outcomes and hospitalization costs. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a linked maternal-infant database covering over 1.2 million infant born alive to Florida-resident mothers from 2004-09. Births were classified according to maternal ppBMI (underweight, normal, overweight, and obese classes I-III) and GDM status. Outcomes were identified using a combination of International Classification of Diseases 9th Edition, codes in hospital discharge records and indicators on the birth certificate. Using multivariable logistic regression, we compared the adjusted odds of each outcome across different levels of ppBMI and GDM. We also converted hospital charges into refined cost estimates and compared hospitalization costs among these groups. We excluded multiple births, infants with chromosomal anomalies, and mothers with pre-pregnancy diabetes. RESULTS: Among 1,057,678 pregnancies 52,000 (4.9%) had GDM, 43.6% were either overweight or obese, and 3.3% were overweight/ obese with GDM. GDM and ppBMI tended to have a synergistic effect on the odds of adverse birth outcomes (e.g., macrosomia, brachial plexus injury, congenital heart defect, hypoglycemia, shoulder dystocia [Table 1]), and maternal conditions (e.g., depression, eclampsia, gestational hypertension, sleep apnea, and delivery by cesarean section [Table 2]). Women with GDM and severe/ morbid obesity experienced the highest rates of poor outcomes, which translated into significantly higher mean maternal (GDM/ obese III: $5614 vs. No GDM/normal BMI: $4297) and infant (GDM/obese III: $4393 vs. No GDM/normal BMI: $3177) hospitalization costs. CONCLUSION:Women with high ppBMI and GDM are at an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. These findings suggest the importance of extensive BMI reduction interventions for those at risk of GDM.

N2  - Conclusions: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.
Background: Low maternal choline intake and blood concentration may be risk factors for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD); however, the data are inconsistent. This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved by folic acid.
Objective: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionally could reduce NTD rates.
Design: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first prenatal visit.
Results: Mean (±SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the AP (2.8 ± 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 ± 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of phosphatidylethanolamine-Nmethyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P = 0.02).

N2  - Study Objective: To describe sleep duration and quality in the fi rst month postpartum and compare the sleep of women who exclusively breastfed at night to those who used formula. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study in a predominantly low-income and ethnically diverse sample of 120 fi rst-time mothers. Both objective and subjective measures of sleep were obtained using actigraphy, diary, and self-report data. Measures were collected in the last month of pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Infant feeding diaries were used to group mothers by nighttime breastfeeding behavior. Results: Mothers who used at least some formula at night (n = 54) and those who breastfed exclusively (n = 66) had similar sleep patterns in late pregnancy. However, there was a significant group difference in nocturnal sleep at one month postpartum as measured by actigraphy. Total nighttime sleep was 386 ± 66 minutes for the exclusive breastfeeding group and 356 ± 67 minutes for the formula group. The groups did not differ with respect to daytime sleep, wake after sleep onset (sleep fragmentation), or subjective sleep disturbance at one month postpartum. Conclusion: Women who breastfed exclusively averaged 30 minutes more nocturnal sleep than women who used formula at night, but measures of sleep fragmentation did not differ. New mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed exclusively since breastfeeding may promote sleep during postpartum recovery. Further research is needed to better understand how infant feeding method affects maternal sleep duration and fragmentation.

N2  - Sleeping disorders are a common problem in pregnant women, as up to 78% have reported that their sleep was significantly more disturbed during pregnancy than in a non-pregnant condition. These sleeping disorders are related to anatomical, physiological, hormonal and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. This manuscript presents an overview of the current research on sleeping disorders in pregnancy. First, a definition of sleeping disorders is presented and the most common symptoms are described. Next, the different causes are discussed as well as the risk factors and the consequences for mother and child. Both objective and subjective criteria are used to establish a diagnosis. Until now, a polysomnography remains the golden diagnostic standard. The first step in the treatment of sleeping disorders is a lifestyle improvement. If this does not yield enough progress, medical treatments like a dental device or a surgical procedure such as a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty can be considered. Most promising is the "continuous positive airway pressure" (CPAP) as therapy.

N2  - Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a frequently occurring sleep disorder with an adverse effect on the patient's quality of life. Moreover, OSA is associated with numerous comorbidities, such as hypertension. CPAP generates a positive pressure, preventing the airways from narrowing or closing. The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the OSA symptoms and its associated complications are counteracted by this treatment. It is already known that the treatment of patients with OSA by means of CPAP exerts positive effects on the blood pressure. During pregnancy, sleep disorders such as OSA can develop or even worsen. This often results in increased snoring, which is related to a higher risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Studies have shown that hypertension during pregnancy is associated with an adverse fetal and maternal outcome. CPAP is a safe treatment for sleep disorders in pregnant women. Moreover, CPAP is able to normalize the blood pressure during the entire pregnancy. The research on the effects of CPAP during pregnancy is limited, but the obtained results so far are promising.

N2  - The impact of pregnancy and lactation on ultradian rhythms (URs) and circadian rhythms (CRs) of locomotor activity was assessed in circadian rhythmic and arrhythmic Siberian hamsters maintained in a long-day photoperiod (16. h light/day). Progressive decrements in CR robustness and amplitude over the course of gestation were accompanied by enhanced URs. Dark-phase UR period and amplitude increased during early gestation and complexity and robustness increased during late gestation. The persistence of pregnancy-associated enhancements of URs in circadian arrhythmic (ARR) hamsters suggests that reproductive modulation of the UR waveform is not dependent on coherent circadian organization. The increased incidence of dark-phase URs appeared more rapidly in ARR dams than entrained (ENTR) dams. Throughout gestation, the percentage of dams with dark-phase URs was significantly greater in the ARR group. Gestational increases in UR complexity and robustness emerged earlier and were greater in ARR than ENTR dams. The attenuation of CRs during lactation is correlated with increased expression of URs. Relaxation of circadian control of the dam's behavior may increase fitness by permitting more efficient interactions with circadian arrhythmic pups. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Although many studies have shown the evolution of sleep parameters across the lifespan, not many have included a representative sample of the general population. The objective of this study was to describe age-related changes in sleep structure, sleep respiratory parameters and periodic limb movements of the adult population of São Paulo. Methods: We selected a representative sample of the city of São Paulo, Brazil that included both genders and an age range of 20-80. years. Pregnant and lactating women, people with physical or mental impairments that prevent self-care and people who work every night were not included. This sample included 1024 individuals who were submitted to polysomnography and structured interviews. We subdivided our sample into five-year age groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare age groups. Pearson product-moment was used to evaluate correlation between age and sleep parameters. Results: Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow wave sleep showed a significant age-related decrease (P<. 0.05). WASO (night-time spent awake after sleep onset), arousal index, sleep latency, REM sleep latency, and the percentage of stages 1 and 2 showed a significant increase (P<. 0.05). Furthermore, apnea-hypopnea index increased and oxygen saturation decreased with age. The reduction in the percentage of REM sleep significantly correlated with age in women, whereas the reduction in the percentage of slow wave sleep correlated with age in men. The periodic limb movement (PLM) index increased with age in men and women. Conclusions: Sleep structure and duration underwent significant alterations throughout the aging process in the general population. There was an important correlation between age, sleep respiratory parameters and PLM index. In addition, men and women showed similar trends but with different effect sizes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is the most common movement disorder in pregnancy, which can be idiopathic or secondary. There are limited comparative data regarding these two forms of RLS. The aim of this study was to compare clinical features of idiopathic and secondary RLS in pregnant women. Methods: Over a period of 3 months, 443 women who admitted for delivery in two clinical centers were screened for RLS using four diagnostic criteria of the international RLS study group. A total of 79 subjects diagnosed with RLS were consecutively enrolled in the present study. All of them were interviewed for medical history and complaints during pregnancy and responded to self-administer international RLS rating scale. Results: Ten subjects (12.9%) out of 79 pregnant women with RLS had idiopathic form, and their mean age was significantly higher than patients with secondary RLS (30.6 ± 7.3 years vs. 26.4 ± 4.6 years, P = 0.0260). Compared with women with secondary RLS, sleep duration in pregnancy was significantly decreased in idiopathic RLS group (P = 0.0460), whereas RLS severity score was similar in both groups. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of other sleep complaints, the positive family history of RLS, parity, duration of pregnancy, or frequency of cesarean section (P > 0.0500). Conclusion: Idiopathic and secondary RLS have relatively similar courses and features during pregnancy. However, the idiopathic form may have more negative impact on sleep in pregnancy. Careful screening and effective treatment of idiopathic RLS before pregnancy is recommended to limit these disturbances.

N2  - This review aims to discuss how endogenous and exogenous testosterone exposures in men and estrogens/progesterone exposures in women interact with sleep regulation. In young men, testosterone secretion peaks during sleep and is linked to sleep architecture. Animal and human studies support the notion that sleep loss suppresses testosterone secretion. Testosterone levels decline slowly throughout the aging process, but relatively few studies investigate its impact on age-related sleep modifications. Results suggest that poorer sleep quality is associated with lower testosterone concentrations and that sleep loss may have a more prominent effect on testosterone levels in older individuals. In women, sex steroid levels are characterized by a marked monthly cycle and reproductive milestones such as pregnancy and menopause. Animal models indicate that estrogens and progesterone influence sleep. Most studies do not show any clear effects of the menstrual cycle on sleep, but sample sizes are too low, and research designs often inhibit definitive conclusions. The effects of hormonal contraceptives on sleep are currently unknown. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased sleep disturbances, but their relation to the hormonal milieu still needs to be determined. Finally, studies suggest that menopausal transition and the hormonal changes associated with it are linked to lower subjective sleep quality, but results concerning objective sleep measures are less conclusive. More research is necessary to unravel the effects of vasomotor symptoms on sleep. Hormone therapy seems to induce positive effects on sleep, but key concerns are still unresolved, including the long-term effects and efficacy of different hormonal regimens.

N2  - Objective: This prospective observational study explored the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and sleep studies. Study Design: Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen-positive subjects were referred for polysomnography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to estimate the relative risks of associations. Result: One thousand one hundred and fifty-seven subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models (adjusted relative risk=1.90, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.37). Conclusion: In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggests that the BQ but not the ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others. However, causative association of BQ with OSA cannot be assumed.

N2  - Inconsistent information exists in the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and perinatal outcomes. This study was intended to investigate whether OSA in pregnant women has a potential to elevate the incidence of the maternal and neonatal outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of all available cohort studies. Five cohort studies including 977 participants were eligible for inclusion. The association between OSA and the risk of perinatal outcomes was expressed as relative risks (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Our results revealed that OSA group was associated with more frequent preeclampsia (RR 1.96; 95% CI 1.34 to 2.86), preterm birth (RR 1.90; 95%CI 1.24 to 2.91), cesarean delivery (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.29) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 2.65; 95% CI 1.86 to 3.76). On analyzing data for the prevalence of gestational diabetes and small gestational age (SGA) < 10th percentile (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.62 to 3.19, and RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.33 to1.24, respectively), there were no significant differences in both group. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that OSA in pregnant women significantly increases the incidence of maternal and neonatal outcomes, which is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, preterm birth, cesarean delivery and NICU admission.

N2  - The rapidly increasing rates of obesity among women of childbearing age, not only in the United States but also across the globe, contribute to increased risks during pregnancy and childbirth. Overweight and obesity are quantified by body mass index (BMI) for clinical purposes. In 2010, 31.9% of U.S. women aged 20 to 39 years met the definition of obesity, a BMI of 30 kg/m or greater. Across the life span, obesity is associated with increased risks of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, and other diseases. During pregnancy, increasing levels of prepregnancy BMI are associated with increases in both maternal and fetal/neonatal risks. This article reviews current knowledge about obesity in pregnancy and health risks related to increased maternal BMI, addresses weight stigma as a barrier to care and interventions that have evidence of benefit, and discusses the development of policies and guidelines to improve care.

N2  - Individual differences in sleep patterns of children may have developmental origins. In the present study, two factors known to influence behavioural development, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype and prenatal Fe-deficient (ID) diet, were examined for their influences on sleep patterns in juvenile rhesus monkeys. Sleep patterns were assessed based on a threshold for inactivity as recorded by activity monitors. Pregnant monkeys were fed diets containing either 100 parts per million (ppm) Fe (Fe sufficient, IS) or 10 ppm Fe (ID). At 3-4 months of age, male offspring were genotyped for polymorphisms of the MAOA gene that lead to high or low transcription. At 1 and 2 years of age, sleep patterns were assessed. Several parameters of sleep architecture changed with age. At 1 year of age, monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype demonstrated a trend towards more sleep episodes at night compared with those with the high-MAOA genotype. When monkeys reached 2 years of age, prenatal ID reversed this trend; ID in the low-MAOA group resulted in sleep fragmentation, more awakenings at night and more sleep episodes during the day when compared with prenatal IS in this genotype. The ability to consolidate sleep during the dark cycle was disrupted by prenatal ID, specifically in monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype.

N2  - Introduction: Gestational hypertension is seen in 10% of pregnant women and is associated with fetal and maternal complications such as preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, asphyxia, fetal death, pre-and postpartum hemorrhage and maternal mortality. Sleep apnea is one of the factors that may be associated with Gestational hypertension. The present study has been implemented to investigate the relationship between sleep apnea and gestational hypertension. Methods: This case-control study was conducted on 15 hypertensive diabetic and 45 normotensive diabetic pregnant women referred to diabetes center in Saqqez, Iran in 2013. Berlin questionnaire and blood pressure chart were used to collect data. Data were analyzed by SPSS software (version 18), independent t-test, chi-square and Fisher exact tests. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: 9 cases (20%) of the normotensive diabetic pregnant mothers and 8 cases (53.3%) of hypertensive diabetic pregnant women and had sleep apnea, and the risk of hypertension in mothers with sleep apnea was 4.5 times higher than mothers without sleep apnea. Conclusion: There is a relationship between sleep apnea and hypertension among women with gestational diabetes.

N2  - Background. Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health problem in Nigeria especially in malaria-endemic areas. It increases the risk of low birth weight and child/maternal morbidity/mortality. This paper addresses the impact of radio campaigns on the use of insecticide-treated bed nets among pregnant women in Nigeria. Methods. A total of 2,348 pregnant women were interviewed during the survey across 21 of Nigeria's 36 states. Respondents were selected through a multistage sampling technique. Analysis was based on multivariate logistic regression. Results. Respondents who knew that sleeping under ITN prevents malaria were 3.2 times more likely to sleep under net (OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 2.28 to 4.33; P < 0.0001). Those who listened to radio are also about 1.6 times more likely to use ITN (OR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.28; P = 0.020), while respondents who had heard of a specific sponsored radio campaign on ITN are 1.53 times more likely to use a bed net (P = 0.019). Conclusion. Pregnant women who listened to mass media campaigns were more likely to adopt strategies to protect themselves from malaria. Therefore, behavior change communication messages that are aimed at promoting net use and antenatal attendance are necessary in combating malaria. © 2014 A. Ankomah et al.

N2  - Objective: This study examined prospectively whether maternal orientation (Facilitator/Regulator) in pregnancy predicted maternal orientation and mothering practices at six months postpartum. Background: A woman's preferred approach to infant care, present prior to the birth, has been proposed to explain individual differences in mothering behaviour. Method: At 30 weeks gestation, 192 women completed two questionnaire measures assessing maternal orientation. At six months postpartum, maternal orientation and maternal caretaking behaviours were assessed by interview and questionnaire. Results: Bivariate analyses indicated small but significant correlations among measures of antenatal and postnatal maternal orientation. In addition, as predicted, lower Regulator scores in pregnancy were associated with greater likelihood of breastfeeding exclusively, less scheduling of infant feeds and sleeps, and less likelihood of leaving baby to cry to sleep. Associations were found between mother-infant night-time proximity and postnatal (but not antenatal) maternal orientation. Conclusions: Findings offer modest support for the stability and construct validity of maternal orientation assessed in pregnancy and reveal antenatal attitudinal factors that influence maternal caregiving trajectories. © 2014 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.

N2  - Although sleep complaints are very common among pregnant women, the potential adverse effects of sleep disturbance on the offspring are not well studied. Growing evidence suggests that maternal stress can induce an inflammatory environment on the fetal development. But people are not sure about the consequences of prenatal stress such as the inflammatory responses induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD). In the present study, we investigated the effects of MSD on long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences in offspring and its underlying inflammatory response pathway. The pregnant Wistar rats received prolonged sleep deprivation (72h) on gestational day (GD) 4, 9, and 18, respectively. The post-natal day (PND) 21 offspring showed impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze task and anhedonia in sucrose preference experiment. Quantification of BrdU+ and DCX+ cells revealed a significant decrease in hippocampus neurogenesis in prepuberty offspring, especially for the late MSD (GD 18) group. Real-time RT-PCR showed that after MSD, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα) increased in the hippocampus of offspring on PND 1, 7, 14 and 21, whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 reduced at the same time. Immunofluorescence found that the cells of activated microglia were higher in the brains of MSD offspring. Taken together, these results suggested that the MSD-induced inflammatory response is an important factor for neurogenesis impairment and neurobehavioral outcomes in prepuberty offspring. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular changes common in pregnancy including left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial enlargement and other vascular adaptations are thought to regress postpartum. We hypothesized that the effect of these changes may persist in women who experience multiple pregnancies, resulting in an increased risk for atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF). STUDY DESIGN: A survey based case-control study using participants ≥ 40 years old in the Kentucky Women's Health Registry was undertaken from December 2009 to June 2011. Cases were defined as women reporting AF (n=118) and controls women reporting no arrhythmia (n=591). Exposure was defined as pregnancy lasting > 20 weeks. Statistical analysis including chi-square, t-test, and logistic regression were performed with SAS 9.3. RESULTS: Compared to controls, women with AF were older (62.4±10.6 vs. 56.7±9.0 years, p<0.001) and more likely to have hypertension (62.1% vs. 38.1%, p<0.0001); heart failure (9.7% vs. 0.2%, p<0.0001); coronary artery disease (9.8% vs. 4.6%, p=0.02); and sleep apnea (20.2% vs. 7.6%, p<0.0001). Any parity was associated with an increased risk for AF, even after adjusting for age (OR 2.4, CI 1.5-3.9). There was a J-shaped dose response relationship between parity and AF, with the nadir at 3 pregnancies (Figure). CONCLUSION: Parity, specifically 4 or more pregnancies, is associated with an increased risk for AF. Further studies are indicated to ascertain the cumulative effect of multiple pregnancies on long term cardiac structure and function. (Figure presented).

N2  - Objectives: This study investigated whether psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are prevalent amongst women in pregnancy and/or in the early postnatal phase, and whether the predictors identified in the literature for non-puerperal psychosis apply in a general sample of perinatal women. Method: 101 women in their third trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaire measures of mood, subjective well-being, sleep, expectations about labour, and PLEs. 66 of these participants also completed questionnaires shortly after giving birth. The main outcome measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R). Results: During pregnancy, 80% of the samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and 52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted. Conclusions: The results of this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

N2  - Aim To explore the role of maternal personality (hardiness), sleep-related cognitions and bedtime involvement in child sleep behaviour during the second post-natal year in a sample of spontaneous and assisted conception first-time mothers. Method Mothers (n = 134 (spontaneous (n = 81); assisted (n = 53) conception)) reported on a resilience measure (hardiness) during pregnancy and child sleep at 7 and 19 months post-partum. At 19 months post-partum, mothers also reported on their cognitions and involvement around their child's bedtime, and half the sample used Actigraph monitors (Acitiwatch-16, Mini Mitter Co. Inc, Bend, OR, USA) to validate maternal report of child sleep. Results No significant differences were found between spontaneous and assisted conception mothers on any of the study variables; therefore, assisted and spontaneous samples were combined. Structural equation modelling confirmed that lower pre-birth maternal hardiness was associated with more problematic sleep-related cognitions (β = 0.23, P < 0.01) and involvement at bedtime (β = 0.29, P < 0.01) and poorer child sleep outcomes (β = -0.33, P < 0.001) during toddlerhood, even after considering concurrent maternal mood and child temperament. Conclusions Pre-birth maternal hardiness rather than mode of conception contributes to parenting cognitions and behaviour around child sleep and, ultimately, toddlers' sleep outcomes. Findings suggest that targeting negative maternal perceptions of control and efficacy through clinical interventions could benefit toddlers' sleep. © 2014 The Authors.

N2  - The present review considers aquaerobic as a form of therapeutic exercises for the prenatal preparation of the pregnant women. It is shown that aquaerobic improves the parameters characterizing the degree of physical preparedness and physical development of the pregnant women, normalizes their general well-being, mood, sleep, physical activity, and working capacity. Moreover, regular aquaerobic exercises prevent the development of pregnancy complications.

N2  - Circadian clocks regulate homeostasis and mediate responses to stressors. Lactation is one of the most energetically demanding periods of an adult female's life. Peripartum changes occur in almost every organ so the dam can support neonatal growth through milk production while homeostasis is maintained. How circadian clocks are involved in adaptation to lactation is currently unknown. The abundance and temporal pattern of core clock genes' expression were measured in suprachiasmatic nucleus, liver, and mammary from late pregnant and early lactation mice. Tissue-specific changes in molecular clocks occurred between physiological states. Amplitude and robustness of rhythms increased in suprachiasmatic nucleus and liver. Mammary rhythms of core molecular clock genes were suppressed. Attenuated rhythms appeared to be a physiological adaptation of mammary to lactation, because manipulation of timing of suckling resulting in significant differences in plasma prolactin and corticosterone had no effect on amplitude. Analysis of core clock proteins revealed that the stoichiometric relationship between positive (CLOCK) and negative (PER2) components remained 1:1 in liver but was increased to 4:1 in mammary during physiological transition. Induction of differentiation of mammary epithelial cell line HC11 with dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin resulted in similar stoichiometric changes among positive and negative clock regulators, and prolactin induced phase shifts in HC11 Arntl expression rhythm. Data support that distinct mechanisms drive periparturient changes in mammary clock. Stoichiometric change in clock regulators occurs with gland differentiation. Suppression of mammary clock gene expression rhythms represents a physiological adaptation to suckling cues. Adaptations in mammary clock are likely needed in part to support suckling demands of neonates. © 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

N2  - An appropriate pro-health behavior is a prerequisite of a normal course of pregnancy. An adequate diet, a sufficient amount of sleep and exercise as well as avoiding any stimulants (alcohol, nicotine, drugs etc.) constitute the basic pro-health conditions. However, statistical data reveal a very widespread use of stimulants among pregnant women, who cannot or frequently even do not attempt to overcome their addiction or harmful habits acquired before pregnancy, and are not aware of the consequences of their behavior. As surveys indicate, the improper behaviors in pregnancy are due to individual neglect on the patient's side as well as to insufficient health education and promotion. © GinPolMedProject.

N2  - This review summarizes studies on eating disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period that have been conducted as part of the broader Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Prior to the 2000s, empirical literature on eating disorders in pregnancy was sparse and consisted mostly of studies in small clinical samples. MoBa has contributed to a new era of research by making population-based and largesample research possible. To date, MoBa has led to 19 eating disorder studies on diverse questions including the prevalence, course, and risk correlates of eating disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum. The associations between eating disorder exposure and pregnancy, birth and obstetric outcomes, and maternal and offspring health and well-being, have also been areas of focus. The findings indicate that eating disorders in pregnancy are relatively common and appear to confer health risks to mother and her child related to sleep, birth outcomes, maternal nutrition, and child feeding and eating.

N2  - Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) affects up to 80 percent of pregnant women. This condition is usually self-limiting, but the symptoms can be distressing and interfere with work, social activities and sleep. Symptoms can often be managed by diet and lifestyle changes, but these interventions may not be successful for everyone. In April 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved doxylamine succinate 10 mg/pyridoxine hydrochloride 10 mg (Diclegis®) as the first medication to specifically treat NVP in more than 30 years. This article reviews the indications, dosage and nursing interventions associated with using doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine to treat NVP. © 2014 AWHONN.

N2  - Power spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability has been proposed to provide a non-invasive estimate of autonomic balance. However, there are few systematic data before birth. We therefore examined developmental changes in the frequency power spectrum at very low (0-0.04 Hz), low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequencies (0.15-0.4 Hz), as well as the ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LF/HF), in chronically catheterized, healthy fetal sheep at 0.6 (n= 8), 0.7 (n= 7) and 0.8 gestational age (ga; n= 11). In a second study, 0.8 ga fetuses received either atropine (4.8 mg bolus, then 4.8 mg h-1 for 30 min, n= 6) or 6-hydroxydopamine (20 mg ml-1 at 2.5 ml h-1 for 3 h; n= 9). Data were analysed by sleep state, defined by low-voltage-high-frequency (LV) or high-voltage-low-frequency (HV) EEG. Total spectral power increased with gestational age (P < 0.05), while LF/HF decreased from 0.6 to 0.7 ga. At 0.8 ga, heart rate and LF/HF were significantly higher during HV than LV sleep (P < 0.05). Consistent with this, although total spectral power was not significantly greater during HV sleep, there was a significant interaction between sleep state and frequency band (P= 0.02). Both atropine (P= 0.05) and 6-hydroxydopamine (P < 0.05) were associated with an overall reduction in spectral power but no significant effect on the LF/HF ratio. This study does not support substantial, consistent differences between the frequencies of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in late-gestation fetal sheep. © 2013 The Authors.

N2  - Amplitude integrated electroencephalogaphy (aEEG) is becoming an important tool for the assessment of cerebral activity in preterm newborns. Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological lesion/death. Preterm newbornswith a birth weight ≤1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and bandwidth (BW). Key outcomeswere severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV III/IHP, a lowvoltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological lesion/death. Absent SWCs during the first 72 h were also related to death. Conclusion: Early aEEG patterns can be predictive of neurological outcome in the preterm newborn. Low-voltage tracing and absence of SWCs are associated with severe neurological lesions/death.

N2  - A comparative study was conducted to assess the stress among working and non-working antenatal mothers in order to develop an information leaflet on antenatal stress management. Materials & Methods: Descriptive survey study was conductedamong working and non-working (30 each) antenatal mothers between the age group of 18-40 years in three local hospitals of Udupi district. The stress was assessed using stress assessment scale and selected a purposive sampling technique. Results: Data shows majority (47%) of the non-working antenatal mothers were in the age group of 18-25 years, 63% of them were primiparous mothers, among these (53%) were between 29-40 weeks of gestation. Most of the working (67%) participated were in the age group of 26-32 years, majority (73%) of them were moderate workers and primipara mothers, 57% of them were between 29-40 weeks of gestation. Stress assessment scale was used to assess the stress, 63% of working antenatal mothers sometimes felt that they had lack of strength, 67% of working and 50% of non-working antenatal mothers sometimes complaining of not getting adequate sleep at night, 50% of working antenatal mothers sometimes felt that they were lacking in socialization due to pregnancy. The t value showed that (p= 0.007) there was significant difference between working and non working antenatal mothers stress score. Conclusion: Since all antenatal mothers participated in this study had mild stress and there was significant difference among working and non-working antenatal mothers stress score. The researchers concluded that antenatal mothers are at more risk of developing stress during pregnancy.

N2  - MASA syndrome (OMIM 303350) is a rare X-linked recessive neurologic disorder, also called CRASH syndrome, spastic paraplegia 1 and Gareis-Mason syndrome. The acronym MASA describes four major signs: Mental retardation, Aphasia, Shuffl ing gait and Adducted thumbs. A more suitable name for this syndrome is L1 syndrome because the disorder has been associated with mutations in the neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1 (L1CAM) gene. The syndrome has severe symptoms in males, while females are carriers because only one X chromosome is aff ected. The aim of this report is to show similarities and diff erences in clinical manifestations between twins with the L1CAM gene mutation and to emphasize the importance of genetic counseling. Our patients were dizygotic twins born prematurely at 35 weeks of gestation. Pregnancy was complicated with early bleeding and gestational diabetes. Immediately after birth, hypertonia of lower extremities was observed in both twins. Sixteen-year clinical follow up showed spastic paraparetic form with shuffl ing gait, clumsiness, delayed speech development, lower intellectual functioning at the level of mild to moderate mental retardation, primary nocturnal enuresis, behavioral and sleep disorder (more pronounced in the second twin). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, complete lack of the anterior commissure, and internal hydrocephalus. Electroencephalograms showed nonspecifi c slower dysrhythmic changes. Kidney ultrasound showed mild dilatation in the channel system of both kidneys in both twins. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. Molecular genetic testing identifi ed homozygous intron 26 L1CAM gene IVS26-12G→A mutation in both twins. The mother is carrier of the same heterozygous mutations. In conclusion, our patients, fraternal twins, show similar clinical changes typical of the MASA syndrome. After identifying the specifi c genetic mutations, this family has become eligible for genetic counseling and informative for prenatal diagnosis.

N2  - Objective To examine the effects of high-fat (HF) diet-induced maternal obesity on follicular population and gene expression in adult offspring ovaries. Design Experimental mouse study. Setting Laboratory. Animal(s) Mice on HF diet. Intervention(s) Female C57BL/6J mice were fed an HF or standard chow (C) diet 6 weeks before conception, through pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were fed the C or HF diet from weaning, creating the HF/HF, HF/C, C/HF, C/C offspring groups. Main Outcome Measure(s) Follicular counts and gene expression in adult offspring ovaries. Result(s) Prenatal exposure to maternal HF nutrition resulted in the reduction of primordial, antral, and Graafian follicle numbers in offspring ovaries (both HF/C and HF/HF). Expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis (FoXO3a), follicular growth and development (Gdf9), and circadian rhythms generation (Clock and Bmal1) were elevated in the ovaries of HF/C and HF/HF offspring, while expression of the circadian clock genes Cry1 and Per1 were lower in HF/HF ovaries. Conclusion(s) Maternal obesity during pregnancy has long-term deleterious consequences on follicular growth and development in the adult offspring ovaries, which may impact their reproductive potential. © 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

N2  - Objective: To identify quantitative MEG indices of spontaneous brain activity for fetal neurological maturation in normal pregnancies and examine the effect of fetal state on these indices. Methods: Spontaneous MEG brain activity was examined in 22 low-risk fetal recordings with gestational age (GA) ranging from 30 to 37. weeks. As major quantitative characteristics of spontaneous activity, burst duration (BD) and interburst interval (IBI) were studied in correlation with GA and fetal state. Results: IBI showed a decrease with gestational age (-0.21 s/week, P=. 0.0031). This trend was only maintained in the quiet-sleep state. With respect to BD, no significant trends were detected with GA and state. Conclusion: IBI can be quantified as a fetal brain maturational parameter. The decrease in IBI over gestation was similar to the trend reported in the preterm neonatal EEG studies. Quiet sleep could be the optimal state to study such MEG maturational indices. Significance: With further investigation, indices extracted from spontaneous fetal brain activity may serve as an early warning for fetal neurological distress. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - Background/Objective:To evaluate the relation between docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) status and neurodevelopment in the offsprings of gestational diabetic mothers (ODMs).Subjects/Methods:A prospective cohort study was performed. The offspring of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 diet-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 19 insulin-treated GDM) were recruited. Maternal and venous cord plasma DHA percentages were analyzed. Skin temperature and activity in children were recorded for 72 h at 3 and 6 months of life. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development II (BSID II) at 6 and 12 months of age.Results:Cord plasma DHA percentage was significantly lower in the ODMs compared with that in the controls (Control 6.43 5.04-7.82 a; GDM+diet 5.65 4.44-6.86 ab; GDM+insulin 5.53 4.45-6.61 b). Both mental (Control 102.71 97.61-107.81 a; GDM+diet 100.39 91.43-109.35 a; GDM+insulin 93.94 88.31-99.57 b) and psychomotor (Control 91.52 81.82-101.22 a; GDM+diet 81.67 73.95-89.39 b; GDM+insulin 81.89 71.96-91.85 b) scores evaluated by the BSID II were significantly lower at 6 months in ODMs, even after adjusting for confounding factors such as breastfeeding, maternal educational level and gender. Cord plasma DHA percentage correlated with the psychomotor score from BSID II (r=0.27; P=0.049) and with the intra-daily variability in activity (r=-0.24; P=0.043) at 6 months. Maternal DHA was correlated with several sleep rhythm maturation parameters at 6 months.Conclusions:Lower DHA levels in cord plasma of ODMs could affect their neurodevelopment. Maternal DHA status was also associated with higher values in the sleep rhythm maturation parameters of children. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: To objectify indications for treatment with pantogam in premature infants with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury of the CNS. Material and methods: We studied 71 children, with GA (gestation age) 24-36 weeks (32,9±2,9 weeks), with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury of the CNS, I-II grades, and hyperexitability syndrome. The main group (33 patients) received pantogam in dose 50 mg/kg/day at the adjusted age (AA) 36-40 weeks from the conception. The comparison group included 38 patients. EEG day sleep monitoring was performed before and at the end of treatment. Results: Shortening of sleep cycle was observed in 78,8% children of the main group and in 78,9% of the comparison group. Duration of transitional sleep over 1 min was 78,79% and 81,58%. At AA 44-46 weeks, the frequency of sleep disorders decreased to 45,45% (p=0,012) and 52,63% (p=0,05). Duration of transitional sleep over 1 min was 45,45% and 65,79%. Duration of the latent period of the 2nd stage of slow wave sleep was 6,4±2,57 and 12,5±7,18 min (p=0,0004). Conclusion: The treatment reduced sleep disorders, changed the duration of transitional sleep stage and latent period of the 2nd stage of slow wave sleep.

N2  - The first urine in the morning (total 15 samples) and whole day urine (total 4 days, 17 samples) were collected from a young healthy woman during the pregnancy and lactation period, to examine the possible interactions of urine components (methanol extracts) with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). The interaction was evaluated by measuring the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine123, a P-gp substrate, in LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, or calcein, an MRP substrate, in Caco-2 cells in the absence and presence of urine components. Four first urine samples out of 12 collected before childbirth and one sample out of three collected after childbirth suppressed P-gp function significantly. The effect of pregnancy and lactation on P-gp inhibitory potencies of urine components was not observed. The whole day urine samples showed a clear circadian rhythm, in which three first urine samples in the morning out of four showed greater P-gp inhibitory potencies than other daytime samples. Interaction of urine components with MRPs was not detected. In conclusion, the concentration of endogenous P-gp inhibitor(s) was higher in the first urine in the morning, showing a clear circadian rhythm. Normal pregnancy and lactation appeared not to significantly affect the P-gp inhibitory potencies of urine components.

N2  - Objective. Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with adverse maternal and child outcomes and contributes to obesity in women. Our aim was to identify early pregnancy factors associated with excessive GWG, in a contemporary nulliparous cohort. Methods. Participants in the SCOPE study were classified into GWG categories ("not excessive" versus "excessive") based on pregravid body mass index (BMI) using 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Maternal characteristics and pregnancy risk factors at 14-16 weeks were compared between categories and multivariable analysis controlled for confounding factors. Results. Of 1950 women, 17% gained weight within the recommended range, 74% had excessive and 9% inadequate GWG. Women with excessive GWG were more likely to be overweight (adjOR 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.8)) or obese (adjOR 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5)) before pregnancy compared to women with a normal BMI. Other factors independently associated with excessive GWG included recruitment in Ireland, younger maternal age, increasing maternal birthweight, cessation of smoking by 14-16 weeks, increased nightly sleep duration, high seafood diet, recent immigrant, limiting behaviour, and decreasing exercise by 14-16 weeks. Fertility treatment was protective. Conclusions. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors for excessive GWG provides opportunities for intervention studies to improve pregnancy outcome and prevent maternal obesity. © 2014 Antonia Restall et al.

N2  - Objective: To assess how change in sleep duration is related to subsequent obesity. Methods: In this 10-year follow-up, 4903 non-pregnant participants answered a questionnaire on sleeping habits, obesity, and lifestyle factors (questions identical to baseline questionnaire). Habitual normal sleepers were defined as sleeping 6-9 h/night at both baseline and follow-up, whereas women sleeping <6 h/night or ≥9 h/night at both occasions were defined as habitual short sleepers and habitual long sleepers, respectively. Logistic regression was used to analyze associations between changes in sleep duration, general obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), weight gain (≥10 kg) and also, central obesity (waist circumference ≥88 cm), and increase in waist circumference (≥10 cm) at follow-up. Results: Among younger women (aged <40 years) both habitual short sleepers and habitual long sleepers had a higher prevalence of general (short: 31.3%, P < 0.0001; long: 38.1%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (short: 60.5%, P = 0.01; long: 82.4%, P = 0.01) compared with habitual normal sleepers (general obesity: 8.9%; central obesity: 35.9%) at follow-up. Younger women who were short sleepers at baseline but normal sleepers at the follow-up had a higher prevalence of both general (19.3%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (45.4%, P = 0.07) compared with habitual normal sleepers at follow-up. In adjusted analyses, both habitual short [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 6.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.71-17.0] and long (aOR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.09-19.8) sleep durations were risk factors for general obesity in younger women. In younger women habitual long sleep duration was a risk factor also for central obesity (aOR, 6.05; 95% CI, 1.19-30.7) whereas habitual short sleep duration was not (aOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.87-4.81). Similar results were seen also for weight gain and increased waist circumference as dependent variables. In addition, decreased sleep duration from normal to short duration was a risk factor for both weight gain (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14-3.02) and increased waist circumference (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.20-2.81). There were no associations between changes in sleep duration and any of the measures of obesity at the follow-up in women aged >40 years at baseline. Conclusion: In younger women, both habitual short and long sleep duration was a risk factor for obesity, whereas no such relationship was seen in older women.

N2  - Objective To assess whether gynecologists have impaired laparoscopic skills and/or reduced cognitive function after long on-call hours. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Norway.
Population 28 gynecologists working long shifts in a single department.
Methods Pre-training of laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality simulator. Simulator- and cognitive testing on two different occasions; one in the morning after a normal nights' sleep at home and one in the morning directly after 17.5 h on call. The virtual reality simulator test consisted of three repetitive salpingectomies in an ectopic pregnancy module. The cognitive test consisted of a standardized cognitive test battery (Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery).
Main outcome measures Simulated laparoscopic performance was assessed by time to perform the procedure, total length of instrument movement (tip trajectory) and blood loss. Cognitive function was assessed by reaction time, errors and total score.
Results No significant impairment in laparoscopic skills was found after 17.5 h on call. Cognitive testing revealed a statistically significant increase in reaction time post-call. Construct validity for the metrics "time to perform procedure" and "tip trajectory" in the ectopic pregnancy module was established in a validation study prior to our main study.
Conclusions We were not able to detect impaired laparoscopic skills among gynecologists tested by a virtual reality procedural module after 17.5 h on call. We found a small increase in reaction time but no other signs of reduced cognitive function. The study adds information on surgical performance of sleep-deprived gynecologists. © 2014 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

N2  - While the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) typically occurs during the childbearing years, many women living with MS are of perimenopausal age. There is frequent overlap between menopausal and MS-related symptoms and co-morbidities (e.g. sexual dysfunction, mood disorders and bladder function). Furthermore, some MS symptoms may be exacerbated by perimenopausal changes such as hot flashes or sleep disturbance. The MS neurologist may frequently be the first to become aware of these symptoms and to play a role in monitoring and managing them. In this review, we describe immunological and neurologic changes at menopause as they may impact MS. We then review common symptoms, including fatigue, depression, sexual function, pain and insomnia, and provide both behavioral and pharmacological suggestions for their management. Next, we discuss the need for osteoporosis and cancer screening in perimenopausal women with MS. Finally, we highlight important research gaps, including what effect, if any, the menopausal transition may play on MS disease course as well as the potential modulatory role of hormone replacement therapies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Overwhelming evidence reveals the close link between unwarranted weight gain among childbearing women and childhood adiposity. Yet current barriers limit the capacity of perinatal health care providers (PHCPs) to offer healthy lifestyle counselling. In response, today's Internet savvy women are turning to online resources to access health information, with the potential of revolutionising health services by enabling PHCPs to guide women to appropriate online resources. This paper presents the findings of a project designed to develop an online resource to promote healthy lifestyles during the perinatal period. The methodology involved focus groups and interviews with perinatal women and PHCPs to determine what online information was needed, in what form, and how best it should be presented. The outcome was the development of the Healthy You, Healthy Baby website and smartphone app. This clinically-endorsed, interactive online resource provides perinatal women with a personalised tool to track their weight, diet, physical activity, emotional wellbeing, and sleep patterns based on the developmental stage of their child with links to quality-assured information. One year since the launch of the online resource, data indicates it provides a low-cost intervention delivered across most geographic and socioeconomic strata without additional demands on health service staff. © 2014 Lydia Hearn et al.

N2  - Adequate bowel preparation is important for successful colonoscopic examination. Several effective colonic cleansing agents are available and routinely prescribed, but each carries its own limitations and benefits from particular dosing regimens. The most frequently prescribed colonic cleansing agent, the polyethylene glycol (PEG) cathartic solution, suffers from low patient compliance in general, due to its unpalatable taste and smell coupled with the large ingested volumes required. However, PEG is preferred over other cathartics for use in individuals of advanced age, sufferers of chronic kidney disease, heart failure and inflammatory bowel disease, and women who are pregnant or lactating. The laxative agents sodium phosphate (NaP) and sodium picosulfate plus magnesium citrate have been applied and have improved patient compliance and tolerance. NaP, however, should be avoided in individuals with impaired renal function or plasma clearance, such as those with chronic kidney disease, who are taking drugs that affect renal function, or who suffer from heart failure. Other special conditions that may affect an individual's tolerance of the cathartic agent or ability to complete the administration routine include stroke, severe constipation, hematochezia, suspicious lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and mental disorders such as dementia. All ingestible bowel preparation solutions can be instilled into the stomach and duodenum through nasogastric tube or esophagogastroduodenoscope with the aid of a water irrigation pump for patients with difficulties swallowing or ingesting the large volumes of fluid required. In addition, dietary regimens based on clear liquids and low-residue foods for 1-4 d prior to the colonoscopy may be supplemental bowel preparation strategies. Achieving an effective and safe cleansing of the bowel is important for successful colonoscopy in all patients, so full knowledge of the individual's condition and capabilities is necessary to select the most appropriate colonic cleansing agent and delivery regimen. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

N2  - Objective: This narrative review describes the differential diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, and provides an overview of the evidence for the associations between RLS and potential comorbidities. Secondary causes of RLS and the characteristics of pediatric RLS are also discussed. Finally, management strategies for RLS are summarized. Methods: The review began with a comprehensive PubMed search for 'restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease' in combination with the following: anxiety, arthritis, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, cardiac, cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, depression, end-stage renal disease, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, insomnia, kidney disease, liver disease, migraine, mood disorder, multiple sclerosis, narcolepsy, neuropathy, obesity, pain, Parkinson's disease, polyneuropathy, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorder, somatoform pain disorder, and uremia. Additional papers were identified by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved publications. Results and Conclusions: Although clinical diagnosis of RLS can be straightforward, diagnostic challenges may arise when patients present with comorbid conditions. Comorbidities of RLS include insomnia, depressive and anxiety disorders, and pain disorders. Differential diagnosis is particularly important, as some of the medications used to treat insomnia and depression may exacerbate RLS symptoms. Appropriate diagnosis and management of RLS symptoms may benefit patient well-being and, in some cases, may lessen comorbid disease burden. Therefore, it is important that physicians are aware of the presence of RLS when treating patients with conditions that commonly co-occur with the disorder. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Background: Though migraine and tension type headache are both commonly diagnosed in childhood, little is known about their determinants when diagnosed prior to puberty onset. Our aim was to determine psychosocial- and health-related risk factors of migraine and tension-type headache in 11 year old children.
Methods: 871 New Zealand European children were enrolled in a longitudinal study at birth and data were collected at birth, 1, 3.5, 7, and 11 years of age. Primary headache was determined at age 11 years based on the International Headache Society. Perinatal factors assessed were small for gestational age status, sex, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal perceived stress, and maternal school leaving age. Childhood factors assessed were sleep duration, percent body fat, television watching, parent and self-reported total problem behaviour, being bullied, and depression.
Results: Prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was 10.5% and 18.6%, respectively. Both migraine and TTH were significantly associated with self-reported problem behaviour in univariable logistic regression analyses. Additionally, migraine was associated with reduced sleep duration, and both sleep and behaviour problems remained significant after multivariable analyses. TTH was also significantly associated with antenatal maternal smoking, higher body fat, and being bullied. For TTH, problem behaviour measured at ages 3.5 and 11 years both remained significant after multivariable analysis. Being born small for gestational age was not associated with either headache group.
Conclusions: Although they share some commonality, migraine and tension-type headache are separate entities in childhood with different developmental characteristics. The association between primary headache and problem behaviour requires further investigation.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the effects of night work on the major stages of women's reproductive health, specifically the menstrual cycle, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. Current understanding suggests that night work (work that causes disruption of a worker's circadian [day/night] rhythms) adversely affects workers' health and well-being. A complex relationship exists between circadian rhythms and reproductive hormones, and this may potentially increase the vulnerability of women to the detrimental effect of night work, including during menopause. Methods: A systematic search was conducted (March-May 2011) via CINAHL, MEDLINE, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source Premier for primary research studies written in English using the key words "shift-work" and "female/women." Findings of identified articles were themed to pregnancy, fertility, aspects of menstrual cycles, and menopause. Results: Twenty articles were identified, (13 articles concerning pregnancy, 3 addressing fertility, and 4 addressing aspects of the menstrual cycle) but no studies addressing menopause were located. All identified articles demonstrated problematic approaches to the determination of night-work exposure. Discussion: Evidence of the impact of night work on female reproductive health as presented in the current literature is inconclusive. Moreover, available evidence needs to be interpreted with caution, given the various limitations and inconsistencies among the studies in the measurement of night-work exposure and shift-work patterns. Studies that focus specifically on night work are needed to facilitate an understanding of the impact of circadian disruption on the reproductive health of women undertaking night work. © 2013 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

N2  - Objective: The authors reviewed the published literature on the acute and long-term neurobehavioral effects on infants and children of either in utero exposure to maternal depression or in utero exposure to antidepressants. Data Sources: The PubMed electronic database was searched to locate 292 English-language studies from the first available year to October 2013 using the keywords pregnancy, antidepressants, depression, perinatal, and neurobehavioral. Study Selection: The authors reviewed only prospective studies that assessed the impact of maternal depression during pregnancy or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on (1) clearly defined short-term behavioral outcomes in infants (perinatal outcome) or (2) longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children (neurodevelopmental outcome). Data Extraction: Studies were included if they were prospective and assessed the impact of maternal depression or maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on clearly measurable, objective short-term and longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children. Results: Untreated depression during pregnancy is associated with short-term neonatal effects, including increased distress after delivery, less than optimal orientation and motor activity, and disrupted sleep. Longer-term effects on neurobehavioral outcome have also been reported, including disruptive social behavior, depression, and changes in the period of sensitivity for language discrimination. Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse short-term perinatal symptomatology, including effects on autonomic and motor activity, habituation, and sleep. Longer-term studies of neurobehavioral outcomes of in utero antidepressant exposure suggest potential effects on gross motor function and language development but not cognition. Conclusions: In utero exposure to either maternal depression or antidepressants carries risks to the developing fetus. Treatment decisions regarding whether and how to treat depression during pregnancy must be made on an individual basis, with careful consideration of the impact of these decisions on both mother and infant.

N2  - Our goal was to revise the literature about external nasal dilators (ENDs) as to their definition, history, and current uses. We reviewed journals in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases. The current uses hereby presented and discussed are physical exercise, nasal congestion and sleep, snoring, pregnancy, cancer, and healthy individuals. Numerous studies have shown that ENDs increase the cross-sectional area of the nasal valve, reducing nasal resistance and transnasal inspiratory pressure and stabilizing the lateral nasal vestibule, avoiding its collapse during final inspiration. These effects also facilitate breathing and are beneficial to patients with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, END use is simple, noninvasive, painless, affordable, and bears minimum risk to the user. Most studies have limited sample size and are mainly focused on physical exercise. In conclusion, ENDs seem useful, so further studies involving potential effects on the performance of physical tests and improvements in sleep quality are necessary, especially in children and teenagers.

N2  - Objective To determine whether maternal mental health mediates the relationship between eczema or asthma symptoms and mental well-being in children. Study design Analysis of 7250 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high 'internalizing' (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/ hyperactive) problems (high was >90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were 'none'; 'early onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at school age); and 'late onset' (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old. Results Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74, 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep, attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15; internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62, 1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association. Conclusions Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

N2  - Introduction: Menopause is a period of life that a permanent cessation of menstruation occurs due to loss of ovarian follicular activity. This study was done to determine the level of physical activity and its relationship with the severity of menopausal symptoms. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on 600 menopause women in 2013. Cases were selected randomly through cluster sampling method. Data were gathered based on a self-made questionnaire on demographic characteristics(Age, education, occupation, socioeconomic status, marital status, and number of pregnancies), international physical activity questionnaire and menopausal symptoms. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 21andKolmogorov-Smirnovand Spearman correlation coefficient tests. P value less than 0.01 was considered significant and p value less than 0.05 was also synchronous. Results: Most women complained of menopausal symptoms in moderate, severe and very severe scales were sleep disorders (39%), myalgia (42.5%) and flushing (23.2%). Daily work, transportation and leisure showed inverse association with hot flashes, heart problems, sleep disorders, depression, decreased libido, incontinence, vaginal dryness and muscle pain and working at home was also showed significant inverse association with heart problems and muscle pain (p<0.05). Conclusion: Exercise is very important to stabilize the natural circulation and other physiological activities in postmenopausal women. © 2014 - Journal Management System.

N2  - Introduction and Aim: Obesity is becoming one of the important problems of the community and individual health because of different factors such as false nutrition and low physical aktivity. Although incidence of obesity is higher in USA and EU compared to Turkey, nowadays it is increasing especially in cities. For healthy generation causes of obesity must be well studied and suggestions for the solution must be developed. Unfortunately, obesity in childhood is ignored by their families but they must be made aware that obesity may be the cause of a serious illness in the future. Therefore, in this study we aimed to determine the causes of the childhood obesity. Material-Methods: Patients visiting Hospital outpatient clinic aging between 6-18 without any known chronic metabolic disease were included to our study. 109 obese as study group and 109 non-obese as control group were chosen. Obesity was described by using percentile curve developed for Turkish children depending on BMI, gender and age, over 95. percentile. Results: According to the results mean values of existence of obese member in the family, weight and BMI values of both parents, duration for eating, physical training, fastfood and vegetable consumption in a week, daily sleep time, feeding time and skipped meals were significantly different between two groups (p<0,05). Smoking during pregnancy, duration time on television-computer, parents education and working status were statistically not significant between the groups (p>0,05). Conclusion: The incidence of obesity is increasing in our community, therefore to prevent it, we have to lean on child nutrition plus routine physical activity.

N2  - Rationale: Better phenotypic descriptions are needed for chronic lung disease among surviving premature infants. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of respiratory inductance plethysmography in characterizing respiratory system mechanics in preterm infants at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Methods: Respiratory inductance plethysmography was used to obtain the phase angle, φ, to describe rib cage and abdominal dyssynchrony in 65 infants born between 23 and 28 weeks gestation, all of whom were studied at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. Up to 60 breaths were evaluated for each subject. Sources of intrasubject variability in φ arising from our methods were explored using mechanical models and by evaluating interobserver agreement. Measurements and Main Results: The mean φ from infants ranged from 5.8-162.9°, with intrasubject coefficients of variation ranging from 11-123%. On the basis of the mechanical model studies, respiratory inductance plethysmography recording and analysis software added <2.3% to the intrasubject variability in φ. Potential inconsistencies in breaths selected could have contributed 8.1%, on average, to the total variability. The recording sessions captured 22.8 ± 9.1 minutes of quiet sleep, and enough breaths were counted to adequately characterize the range of φ in the session. Conclusion: φ is quite variable during even short recording sessions among preterm infants sleeping quietly. The intrasubject variability described herein arises from the instability of the rib cage and abdominal phase relationship, not from the recording and analytical methods used. Despite the variability, φ measurements allowed the majority (80%) of infants to be reliably categorized as having relatively synchronous or dyssynchronous breathing. Respiratory inductance plethysmography is easy to use and should prove useful in quantifying respiratory mechanics in multicenter studies of preterm infants.

N2  - Non-dipping circadian blood pressure (BP) is a common finding in preeclampsia, accompanied by adverse outcomes. Melatonin plays pivotal role in biological circadian rhythms. This study investigated the relationship between melatonin secretion and circadian BP rhythm in preeclampsia. Cases were women with preeclampsia treated between January 2006 and June 2007 in the University Hospital of Larissa. Volunteers with normal pregnancy, matched for chronological and gestational age, served as controls. Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP monitoring was applied. Serum melatonin and urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were determined in day and night time samples by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Measurements were repeated 2 months after delivery. Thirty-one women with preeclampsia and 20 controls were included. Twenty-one of the 31 women with preeclampsia were non-dippers. Compared to normal pregnancy, in preeclampsia there were significantly lower night time melatonin (48.4±24.7 vs. 85.4±26.9pg/mL, p<0.001) levels. Adjustment for circadian BP rhythm status ascribed this finding exclusively to non-dippers (p<0.01). Two months after delivery, in 11 of the 21 non-dippers both circadian BP and melatonin secretion rhythm reappeared. In contrast, in cases with retained non-dipping status (n=10) melatonin secretion rhythm remained impaired: daytime versus night time melatonin (33.5±13.0 vs. 28.0±13.8pg/mL, p=0.386). Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels were, overall, similar to serum melatonin. Circadian BP and melatonin secretion rhythm follow parallel course in preeclampsia, both during pregnancy and, at least 2 months after delivery. Our findings may be not sufficient to implicate a putative therapeutic effect of melatonin, however, they clearly emphasize that its involvement in the pathogenesis of a non-dipping BP in preeclampsia needs intensive further investigation. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of nocturia according to the International Continence Society (ICS) definition in Turkish women and to determine the associated risk factors and the correlation of other voiding symptoms with nocturia. Materials and Methods: A prospective epidemiological study was carried out by use of self-reported questionnaires in 4,250 reproductive-aged women from January 2013 to May 2013. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form and a questionnaire developed by the researchers according to the ICS were administered to define nocturia and other lower urinary tract symptoms. Other physical, reproductive, and health characteristics were also recorded concurrently. Results: Overall, 1,636 women were included in the final analyses. The women had an average age of 34.4±5.26 years. The overall prevalence of nocturia was 34.7% (567 of 1,636 women). Women with nocturia were older (p<0.001), had a higher body mass index (p=0.026), and had more children (p<0.001). Nocturia occurred more frequently in women with a history of nocturnal enuresis (p<0.001). Three or more pregnancies, 3 or more deliveries, and age >40 years were significant risk factors for nocturia. We also found that other lower urinary tract symptoms correlated significantly (p<0.001) with nocturia. Conclusions: Although the prevalence of nocturia is higher with increasing age, younger adults are also affected. Nocturia may cause sleep disorders, mood disturbances, reduced quality of life, and distractibility. Thus, even if one void nightly causes a patient to experience bother, nocturia should be queried about and should be treated if necessary according to the cause of the disease. © The Korean Urological Association, 2014.

N2  - Study Objectives: The study was performed to evaluate the hypothesis that the extremely obese manifest sleep disordered breathing with a preponderance of hypopneas and relative paucity of obstructive apneas. Methods: Retrospective review of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) matched for age and gender, comparing two groups, Group A: body mass index (BMI) < 35, Group B: BMI ≥ 45. Exclusion criteria: age < 18 years, pregnancy, ≥ 5 central apneas/hour, BMI ≥ 35 < 45. Primary Outcome Measure: Hypopnea/apnea ratio (HAR); secondary measures: obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index (HI), oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), and presence of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Statistical methods: t-test for independent samples; Mann-Whitney, linear regression with natural log transformation, and Kruskal-Wallis χ2. Descriptive statistics were expressed as interquartile range, median and mean ± standard deviation, p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: Group A (n = 45): age = 50.6 ± 11.5 years, BMI = 28.9 ± 4 kg/m2; Group B (n = 45): age = 47.4 ± 12.7 years, BMI = 54.5 ± 8 kg/m2. HAR was significantly higher in Group B (38.8 ± 50.7) than Group A (10.6 ± 16.5), p = 0.0006, as was HI (28.7 ± 28.6 in B vs 12.6 ± 8.4 in A, p = 0.0005) and AHI (35.5 ± 33.8 vs 22 ± 23, p = 0.03), but not apnea index. HAR was significantly higher in Group B regardless of race, gender, or presence of OHS. The BMI was the only significant predictor of HAR (adjusted r2 = 0.138; p = 0.002) in a linear regression model with natural log transformation of the HAR performed for age, gender, race, BMI, and PetCO2. Conclusion: Extremely obese patients manifest OSAHS with a preponderance of hypopneas.

N2  - Although progesterone is most commonly regarded in terms of its role in the female estrous cycle, reproductive behavior, and pregnancy, progesterone is also a precursor to corticosterone (CORT) and is released from the adrenal glands of both sexes in response to stress. However, the relationship between plasma CORT and progesterone during times of stress has not been well established. To better characterize dynamic changes in progesterone release as a result of stressor exposure, plasma progesterone levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay under multiple conditions, including after stress exposure (footshock, restraint, and forced swim), manipulations of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (injection of metyrapone or dexamethasone, or adrenalectomy), and in response to CRH and ACTH injections. When plasma levels of ACTH, CORT, and progesterone were analyzed across studies, CORT and progesterone were found to be highly correlated and rarely dissociated. Additionally, it appears that in male rats, the adrenal glands are the principle source of circulating progesterone in response to stress. Interestingly, a detailed time course indicated lack of a circadian rhythm of progesterone secretion, despite a robust rhythm of circulating CORT. The current studies provide critical new information on the coincident release of progesterone and CORT in response to stress and their somewhat paradoxical dissociation across the circadian rhythm. These findings provide an important foundation for future studies that will examine the role of stress-induced progesterone in behavioral, neuroimmune, and neuroendocrine responses to stress.

N2  - Internal temporal organisation properly synchronised to the environment is crucial for health maintenance. This organisation is provided at the cellular level by the molecular clock, a macromolecular transcription-based oscillator formed by the clock and the clock-controlled genes that is present in both central and peripheral tissues. In mammals, melanopsin in light-sensitive retinal ganglion cells plays a considerable role in the synchronisation of the circadian timing system to the daily light/dark cycle. Melatonin, a hormone synthesised in the pineal gland exclusively at night and an output of the central clock, has a fundamental role in regulating/timing several physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion and energy metabolism. As such, metabolism is severely impaired after a reduction in melatonin production. Furthermore, light pollution during the night and shift work schedules can abrogate melatonin synthesis and impair homeostasis. Chronodisruption during pregnancy has deleterious effects on the health of progeny, including metabolic, cardiovascular and cognitive dysfunction. Developmental programming by steroids or steroid-mimetic compounds also produces internal circadian disorganisation that may be a significant factor in the aetiology of fertility disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Thus, both early and late in life, pernicious alterations of the endogenous temporal order by environmental factors can disrupt the homeostatic function of the circadian timing system, leading to pathophysiology and/or disease. © 2014 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.

N2  - Aim The aim of this study was to measure the brain activity of preterm infants treated with caffeine citrate and doxapram for preterm apnoea, using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG), to identify any adverse effects on cerebral function. Methods We analysed the aEEG tracings of 13 preterm infants <30 weeks of gestation before, during and after doxapram treatment, with regard to background activity (percentages of continuous and discontinuous patterns), occurrence of sleep-wake cycling and appearance of electrographic seizure activity. They were also compared with 61 controls without doxapram treatment. Results During doxapram treatment, aEEG tracings showed an increase in continuous background activity (19 ± 30% before treatment, 38 ± 35% during treatment) and a decrease in discontinuous patterns. In addition, they showed more frequent electrographic seizure activity (0% before treatment, 15 ± 37% during treatment) and less frequent sleep-wake cycling (92 ± 27% before treatment, 85 ± 37% during treatment) could be observed. These results were confirmed when compared to the control group. Conclusion Doxapram treatment influences aEEG in preterm infants, showing higher percentages of continuous activity as well as more electrographic seizure activity and less sleep-wake cycling. It should, therefore, be used with caution in very preterm infants. ©2014 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - In recent years, the negative impact of oxidative stress on fertility has become widely recognised. Several studies have demonstrated its negative effect on the number and quality of retrieved oocytes and embryos following in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). Melatonin, a pineal hormone that regulates circadian rhythms, has also been shown to exhibit unique oxygen scavenging abilities. Some studies have suggested a role for melatonin in gamete biology. Clinical studies also suggest that melatonin supplementation in IVF may lead to better pregnancy rates. Here we present a critical review and summary of the current literature and provide suggestions for future well designed clinical trials.

N2  - This study aimed to examine the transition to parenthood and mental health in first-time parents in detail and explore any differences in this transition in the context of parental gender and postpartum mental health. Semistructured clinical interviews (Birmingham Interview for Maternal Mental Health) were carried out with 46 women and 40 men, 5 months after birth. Parents were assessed on pre- and postpartum anxiety, depression, and postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a range of adjustment and relationship variables. One fourth of the men and women reported anxiety in pregnancy, reducing to 21% of women and 8% of men after birth. Pregnancy and postpartum depression rates were roughly equal, with 11% of women and 8% of men reporting depression. Postpartum PTSD was experienced by 5% of parents. Postpartum mental health problems were significantly associated with postpartum sleep deprivation (odds ratio [OR] = 7.5), complications in labor (OR = 5.1), lack of postpartum partner support (OR = 8.0), feelings of parental unworthiness (OR = 8.3), and anger toward the infant (OR = 4.4). Few gender differences were found for these variables. This study thus highlights the importance of focusing interventions on strengthening the couple's relationship and avoiding postnatal sleep deprivation, and to address parents' feelings of parental unworthiness and feelings of anger toward their baby. © 2014 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - Background and Objective: Duplications of the voltage-gated sodium channel (SCN) gene cluster on 2q24 are a recently identified cause of early onset epilepsy1. However, Ohtahara syndrome has never been reported with these duplications. Case Description: Daily seizures were noted soon after birth in a nondysmorphic male infant born normally following an unremarkable pregnancy (BW 2.75 kg: OFC 32.5 cm). At 5 weeks of age two types of seizures that lasted up to 60s were noted 10-20 times per day. 1 Sudden onset, from sleep or awake state, of lip smacking, followed by head turning and eye deviation to the left, followed by crying. 2 Head turning and eye deviation to the left, followed by arching of the back, with stiffness of arms and legs in extension, followed by skin mottling and crying. MRI brain scan and neurometabolic screen were normal. Interictal EEG showed markedly abnormal background with suppression burst activity, consistent with Ohtahara syndrome. Ictal Video-EEG showed tonic epileptic spasm with low amplitude fast activity (13-15 Mz) in all areas. An array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) revealed a de novo 8.5 Mb 2q24.3q31.1 duplication spanning the complete SCN gene cluster (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN7A, SCN9A). Seizures continued despite treatment with phenobarbitone, pyridoxine and vigabatrin. Carbamazepine was introduced at 16 weeks of age and there have been no reported seizures for 18 weeks. Conclusions: We show for the first time that Ohtahara syndrome is part of the extended phenotype of copy number gains of the 2q24 SCN gene cluster. Our observations confirm the suggestion that carbamazepine could be an effective anticonvulsant in such cases1. Array-CGH should be performed in early onset epilepsy, even in the absence of dysmorphic features.

N2  - The majority of children and adolescents with epilepsy are managed in the community setting by general paediatricians. However, there is a paucity of practical, relevant information and standardised management documents assisting paediatricians. In the era of sub-specialisation, an electronic educational resource developed by specialists in epilepsy and paediatrics enhances the interface between tertiary and secondary/primary care. We aimed to create a website (www.pennsw.com.au) designed to optimise the care of all children and adolescents living with epilepsy and to assess its clinical usefulness. The site provides clinicians and families an aligned resource, including key information on epilepsy syndromes, medication usage and adverse effects, safety (sleep deprivation, water sports), driving, pregnancy, psychosocial impact of epilepsy and coping skills. General paediatricians and carers completed a questionnaire, utilising rating scales and open ended questions, to evaluate design, content and clinical usefulness. Forty-nine general paediatricians with a median 12 years of paediatric practice participated. Thirty-two carers participated. Epilepsy syndrome was focal in 59% of the children and generalised in 41%. The majority of participants (paediatricians: 84-100%, families: 69-100%) rated the website as well designed, practical, informative and clinically useful. General paediatricians considered the "Medication" pages and "Epilepsy Management Documents" as practically useful. Carers recorded the "Family Resources", seizure recording documents, the support information on mental health, and the "Coping with Epilepsy" segment as most informative. General paediatricians and carers highly valued the website, reflected by 120,000 page views in 12 months since its launch.

N2  - Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental functioning, including the 11β-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines, compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the fetus.

N2  - Backgrounda Preterm infants are at risk of narrowing of the upper airway while restrained in infant car seats, leading to secondary apnea. However, some infants are able to maintain a normal airway. We hypothesized that this might reflect relatively smaller tongue size. Methodsa We retrospectively analyzed previously reported respiration-timed lateral radiographs of the upper airways of 17 preterm infants ready for discharge (32. 6â€‰±â€‰1.0 weeks gestation at birth, and 37.8â€‰±â€‰9.7 days old at study) taken during sleep, first in a car safety seat with an insert that allowed the head to remain upright, and then without the insert, when the head slumped forward. The presence of air above the tongue was used as an index of relative tongue size. Resultsa A smaller airspace around the tongue (relatively larger tongue) was associated with greater narrowing of the upper airway when the head was flexed forward in sleep (pâ€‰<â€ ‰0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between baseline airway size and change in airway size (r <sup>2</sup>â€‰=â€‰0.16, pâ€‰=â€‰0.11). Conclusiona The present study supports the hypothesis that the vulnerability of preterm infants to airways compromise while restrained in a car safety seat may be in part related to relative tongue size.

N2  - Objective. Chemokines exert different inflammatory responses which can potentially be related to certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The aim of the study was to determine the concentration of selected chemokines in plasma and amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down syndrome. Method. Out of 171 amniocentesis, we had 7 patients with confirmed fetal Down syndrome (15th-18th weeks of gestation). For the purpose of our control, we chose 14 women without confirmed chromosomal aberration. To assess the concentration of chemokines in the blood plasma and amniotic fluid, we used a protein macroarray, which allows the simultaneous determination of 40 chemokines per sample. Results. We showed significant decrease in the concentration of 4 chemokines, HCC-4, IL-28A, IL-31, and MCP-2, and increase in the concentration of CXCL7 (NAP-2) in plasma of women with fetal Down syndrome. Furthermore, we showed decrease in concentration of 3 chemokines, ITAC, MCP-3, MIF, and increase in concentration of 4 chemokines, IP-10, MPIF-1, CXCL7, and 6Ckine, in amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down syndrome. Conclusion. On the basis of our findings, our hypothesis is that the chemokines may play role in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome. Defining their potential as biochemical markers of Down syndrome requires further investigation on larger group of patients.

N2  - Objective: This study investigates whether maternal socio-demographic and clinical characteristics influence the site of placental implantation so that placental localization and associated abnormalities can be predicted.
Methods: This study reviews 500 healthy women with singleton pregnancy that were consecutively admitted to the study center and eventually delivered healthy newborns.
Results: The most frequently observed sites of placentation were anterior uterine wall (53.2%), posterior uterine wall (28.8%), lateral uterine walls (10.0%) and uterine fundus (8.0%), respectively. The women with fundal placentation had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.044 and p = 0.040, respectively). Supine sleeping position was more frequent in women with anterior placenta and (OR: 11.568, 95% CI: 2.720-49.193) and prone sleeping position was more frequent in women with posterior placenta (OR: 15.449, 95% CI: 2.151-52.978) (p = 0.001). The women who favored to sleep in right lateral position were more likely to have lateral placentation, while the women who used to sleep in left lateral position were more likely to have fundal placentation (p = 0.001).
Conclusions: Sleeping position in early pregnancy may influence placental implantation site. The probable mechanism may refer to the alterations in uterine perfusion which is induced by the change in systemic blood pressure and dominant sleeping position. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Rationale: Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) (EPM1) is a progressive myoclonus epilepsy with variable severity and course, and variable degrees of cognitive deterioration. The onset is usually 421 between 6 and 15 years of age with myoclonus and generalized tonicclonic seizures. With good antiepileptic management, the patients can now survive into their 50's and 60's. The gene for this disorder was identified in 1996 as cystatin B (CSTB), a cysteine protease inhibitor. The most common mutation is a dodecamer repeat, although rare point mutations have also been described. Methods: We present a 30-year-old female patient with a distant family history of Unverricht-Lundborg disease on the maternal side. She had seizure onset at 11 and carries a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). The patient and her partner presented for preconceptional genetic counseling. CGH array employing approximately 180 000 oligonucleotides was carried out in the patient. Carrier screening for the CSTB gene was carried out for both the patient and her partner, employing PCR for the dodecamer repeat, and sequencing of the CSTB gene to rule out point mutations. Results: A 30-year-old female patient had a single generalized tonicclonic seizure during sleep at the age of 11 years, and onset of myoclonic jerks on awakening at around the same time, which are well-controlled with valproic acid. She carries a clinical diagnosis of JME. The patient was born prematurely at 25 weeks'gestation weighing 750 grams. Her developmental milestones were normal, and she was on the honor roll at school in grade 10. She works as a highschool teacher for behaviourally challenged children. The parents were of Irish and French-Canadian origin from the Gaspé peninsula of Quebec. Four siblings of the maternal grandmother were diagnosed clinically with ULD and were known to us; three sisters died in their 20's and 30's, and one brother died at age 65. A third degree cousin of the mother had epilepsy and died at 18 years of age. A paternal uncle had a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure at the age of 7 years. A distant cousin of the paternal great grandmother was also said to have progressive myoclonic epilepsy. CGH array in the patient was normal. CSTB testing in the patient surprisingly revealed that she was a compound heterozygote for two mutations: an expansion of the dodecamer repeat and a splice site c.67-1G>C mutation in intron 1, predicting a deletion of the downstream exon 2 with in-frame deletion of 34 aminoacids (p.delV23-K56). This is the second most common mutation underlying EPM1, and the most common point mutation. The husband has a normal number of dodecamer repeats and no potential EPM1-causing sequence alterations. Conclusions: Although ULD is often confused with JME in the early stages of the disease, it is rare to find patients with ULD at age 30 who are as well controlled and high-functioning as this patient. Furthermore, other compound heterozygotes with the same combination of mutations have had more severe phenotypes with progressive deterioration.

N2  - This is the third version of the Egyptian Hypertension Society (EHS) Guidelines. The guidelines were developed by a working group of 28 members, including cardiologists, nephrologists and internal medicine specialists, who were divided into 6 writing groups and an implementation group. Members reviewed the recent world literature as well as other national and international guidelines. The working groups had a number of meetings over a period of one and half year, before finalizing the document. The Egyptian guidelines were based upon two principles: 1. Address practical issues, 2. Cost containment. They stressed the need for frequent office visits and careful measurement of blood pressure before making a diagnosis of hypertension. Higher threshold for diagnosis of hypertension (150/95 mmHg) was recommended. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was indicated in a selected group of patients. Laboratory work-up was kept to the minimum particularly when resources and facilities are limited. The need for lifestyle modification (LSM), controlling obesity and limiting salt intake were stressed. Initiation of pharmacologic treatment, duration of blood pressure monitoring and frequency of office visits were based upon the global cardiovascular risk profile, level of blood pressure and response to LSM. In low risk patients, no drug therapy is recommended when blood pressure is less than 160/100 mmHg. Shorter period of blood pressure monitoring and lower blood pressure threshold (140/90 mmHg) is advised in moderate and high risk patients. In absence of compelling indications any of the five standard pharmacologic groups (diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) can be selected as initial therapy preferably a thiazide diuretic. In absence of satisfactory control of blood pressure, it is recommended to ensure patient's adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes and that he is not taking pressor medications. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), white coat hypertension, inadequate diuretic therapy and secondary forms have to be considered as causes for resistant hypertension. Pharmacologic therapy should be modified according to the presence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure and severity of hypertension. The guidelines addressed management of hypertension in special groups such as obese subjects, the elderly, pregnant women, hypertensive emergencies and patients with valvular heart disease. © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Egyptian Society of Cardiology.

N2  - The spontaneous brain activity exhibits long-range spatial correlations detected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in newborns when (1) long neuronal pathways are still developing, and (2) the electrical brain activity consists of developmentally unique, intermittent events believed to guide activity-dependent brain wiring. We studied this spontaneous electrical brain activity using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) of premature and fullterm babies during sleep to assess the development of spatial integration during last months of gestation. Correlations of frequency-specific amplitudes were found to follow a robust bimodality: During low amplitudes (low mode), brain activity exhibited very weak spatial correlations. In contrast, the developmentally essential high-amplitude events (high mode) showed strong spatial correlations. There were no clear spatial patterns in the early preterm, but clear frontal and parieto-occipital modules at term age. A significant fronto-occipital gradient was also seen in the development of the graph measure clustering coefficient. Strikingly, no bimodality was found in the fMRI recordings of the fullterm babies, suggesting that early EEG activity and fMRI signal reflect different mechanisms of spatial coordination. The results are compatible with the idea that early developing human brain exhibits intermittent long-range spatial connections that likely provide the endogenous guidance for early activity-dependent development of brain networks.

N2  - Context: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move legs that usually occur during inactivity and at night. This neurologic condition is associated with increased risk of nocturnal hypertension as well as cardiovascular events and affects patient’s sleep, which leads to anxiety, depression, and decreases quality of life. Presence of RLS in patients on hemodialysis is associated with higher mortality rate. Most of the times, patients have indescribable symptoms. The aim of this review was to provide physicians with information to be aware and turn their attention to the patient’s symptoms, which are the most important clue to diagnosis of RLS.
Evidence Acquisition: For data extraction, we reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, the Cochrane collaboration, and Up to Date databases with the keywords of restless legs syndrome, sleep disorders, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The most recent review articles, clinical trials, and cross-sectional studies with large sample sizes that had used International RLS Study Group criteria (IRLSSG) and had focused on demographic characteristics and renal function were included. This situation has described in primary and secondary forms. The former usually occurs in younger patients and seems to have genetic tendencies and the latter is due to the iron deficiency state, pregnancy, and ESRD.
Results: Two major theories are developed regarding the pathophysiology of RLS. The first one concerns central nervous system dopamine imbalance and the second one concerns intracellular iron dysregulation. The most common used pharmacologic agents in treatment of RLS are dopamine agonists. Other used therapeutic agents include levodopa, Alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands, opioids, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, clonidine, iron therapy in low levels of serum ferritin, and nonpharmacologic therapies.
Conclusions: The most important factor in diagnosis is physician’s attention and clinical experience with this condition and using IRLSSG.

N2  - The notion that 'older' mothers experience elevated risks during pregnancy and childbirth has proliferated since the mid-twentieth century. In this article, we take the contemporary concern with age as a starting point from which to historicise and contextualise the concept of maternity risk. To this end, we examine maternal hygiene manuals (self-help guidebooks on motherhood and pregnancy) published between 1880 and 1920 in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. Our analysis of these manuals indicated that pregnancy during this period was presented as a potentially dangerous affair that required constant surveillance by the self (and others) to ensure favourable pregnancy outcomes. A dominant theme that emerged from the manuals was that the expectant mother was morally responsible for mitigating a range of risk factors, including adequate exercise, sleep, fresh air, as well as for choosing an appropriate father and ensuring his health. At the same time, the manuals indicated that the failure to seek out expert advice and take up responsible practices was linked to adverse consequences for the expectant mother's health, and her newborn's health and moral character later in life. We conclude this article by discussing how findings from our historical data can provide an important context for understanding risk discourses around pregnancy as historically specific and culturally contingent, especially with respect to risks associated with maternal advanced age. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Seizures are observed with a frequency of 3-21% in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). However, clinical, neuroradiologic, and electroencephalography (EEG) features are poorly described. In this study, 13 patients with FASD and epilepsy or seizures were identified retrospectively from the databases of seven Italian pediatric neurology divisions. Eleven children were affected by epilepsy, and two had at least one documented seizure. Both generalized and focal seizures were observed. EEG showed diffuse or focal epileptic activity; two children developed electric status epilepticus during sleep (ESES). Structural brain anomalies, including polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia, atrophy, and Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation, were discovered in almost 50% of patients. Control of seizures was not difficult to obtain in 11 cases; one patient showed pharmacoresistant epilepsy. EEG and clinical follow-up are recommended in children with FASD and epilepsy, since severe conditions requiring aggressive treatment, such as in ESES, may develop. Neuroradiological evaluation is warranted because several types of brain anomalies could be associated with maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of maternal presence on the physiological and behavioral status of the preterm infant when exposed to recorded music versus ambient sound.
DESIGN: Repeated-measures randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Special care nursery (SCN) in a tertiary perinatal center.
PARTICIPANTS: Clinically stable preterm infants (22) born at > 28 weeks gestation and enrolled at > 32 weeks gestation and their mothers.
METHODS: Infants were exposed to lullaby music (6 minutes of ambient sound alternating with 2x 6 minutes recorded lullaby music) at a volume within the recommended sound level for the SCN. The mothers in the experimental group were present for the first 12 minutes (baseline and first music period) whereas the mothers in the control group were absent overall.
RESULTS: There was no discernible infant response to music and therefore no significant impact of maternal presence on infant's response to music over time. However during the mothers' presence (first 12 minutes), the infants exhibited significantly higher oxygen saturation than during their absence p = .024) and less time spent in quiet sleep after their departure, though this was not significant.
CONCLUSION: Infants may have been unable to detect the music against the ambient soundscape. Regardless of exposure to music, the infants' physiological and behavioral regulation were affected by the presence and departure of the mothers.

N2  - Objective: The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum. Background: The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence. Methods: A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament. Results: Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy.

N2  - Septo-Optic Dysplasia (SOD) is a rare disorder with postulated genetic and environmental etiology. Whilst initially considered as a very rare disease (defined as incidence of approx. 1 in 50,000 births) recent data gave a reported incidence of 1 in 10,000, with equal sex distribution. The diagnosis of SOD is predominantly a clinical one, and made with the presence of two or more features of the classic triad: 1) hypopituitarism, 2) optic nerve hypoplasia, and 3) midline brain defects, typically absence or hypoplasia of the septum pellucidum and/or corpus callosum. Hypopituitarism ranges from isolated to multiple hormone deficits, with diabetes insipidus in a minority. The condition is heterogeneous and may also manifest additional brain defects. Although homozygous mutations in the homeobox gene HESX1 have been identified in SOD, these are uncommon and genetic diagnosis can be made in only <1% of patients with autosomal recessive inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported. SOX2, SOX3 and OTX2 mutations have also been identified in some forms of SOD. The aetiology of SOD is uncertain but viral infections, environmental teratogens and vascular or degenerative damage have been postulated to account for its sporadic occurrence. Other factors (endogenous or exogenous) include parental age, parity, smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, antenatal bleeding, and ethnicity. Cocaine abuse during pregnancy, which is a potent vasoconstrictor has recently been identified as a potential external cause. The phenotype of SOD is highly variable; the clinical picture may include visual impairment, short stature, obesity and sleep-wake inversion. Approximately 75-80% of patients exhibit optic nerve hypoplasia, which may be the first presenting feature. Pituitary insufficiency may evolve over time, and children with possible SOD must be kept under careful endocrine follow-up. Untreated hormonal abnormalities will further jeopardize neurodevelopment of children with SOD and could also lead to life-threatening adrenal crises. The attention should be focussed on early diagnosis and treatment and education of paediatricians how to recognize this complex disorder.

N2  - Sleep disturbances in the general population are associated with elevated blood pressure. This may be due to several mechanisms, including sympathetic activation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbance. Elevated blood pressure in pregnancy can have devastating effects on both maternal and fetal health and is associated with increased risk for preeclampsia and poor delivery outcomes. Preliminary evidence suggests that mechanisms linking sleep and blood pressure in the general population may also hold in the pregnant population. However, the effects of disturbed sleep on physiologic mechanisms that may directly influence blood pressure in pregnancy have not been well studied. The role that sleep disturbance plays in gestational blood pressure elevation and its subsequent consequences warrant further investigation. This review evaluates the current literature on sleep disturbance and elevated blood pressure in pregnancy and proposes possible treatment interventions.

N2  - Mental health is an important medical issue in perinatal care, and there is increasing evidence that insomnia during pregnancy is associated with postpartum depression (PPD). Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of insomnia treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy on PPD symptoms. Fifty-four pregnant women with insomnia were randomly assigned to trazodone, diphenhydramine, or placebo treatment. Sleep quality was measured by actigraphy at baseline, and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, depression was assessed 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. Trazodone and diphenhydramine improved sleep profile compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Further, depressive symptoms were reduced 2 and 6 weeks after delivery in trazodone and diphenhydramine groups compared to placebo. No differences in depressive symptoms were observed between the trazodone and diphenhydramine groups. These findings indicate that insomnia treatment with trazodone or diphenhydramine during the third trimester of pregnancy may prevent PPD. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and distressing sensorimotor disorder of unknown etiology. While the epidemiology of RLS has been examined in several North American and European studies, research on RLS and RLS burden in poor, rural populations, including those residing in Appalachia, remains sparse. In this study, we investigated RLS prevalence in an Appalachian primary care population and examined the association of RLS to demographic factors, lifestyle characteristics, sleep quality, and mood disorders. Methods: Participants of this anonymous survey study were community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 18 years visiting one of 4 West Virginia primary care clinics. Data gathered included detailed information on sleep patterns, demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and health/medical history; the survey also included questions specific to RLS diagnosis and severity. Response rates were excellent, with 68% of eligible adults contacted returning completed surveys (N = 1,424/2,087). Pregnant women (N = 65) and those with missing data on key variables (N = 142) were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 1,217 participants included in the final analytic sample, 19.6% (18.2% with symptoms at least once/month) met the 4 IRLSSG diagnostic criteria in the absence of positional discomfort or leg cramps; 14.5% reported RLS symptoms at least once/week and 10.1% indicated symptoms ≥ 3x/week. Excluding respondents with diabetes, kidney disease, or anemia reduced these rates only slightly. Those with RLS were more likely to be older, female, lower income, unemployed, disabled, non-Hispanic white, and less likely to be college educated than those without RLS. Mood and sleep impairment were significantly elevated in those with RLS; after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle characteristics, health history, and other factors, those with RLS remained significantly more likely to indicate a history of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 2.6) and anxiety (OR = 1.6, CI 1.1, 2.2), to report sleep impairment both 4 (OR = 2.4, CI 1.6, 3.7) and 7 days/week (OR = 1.8, CI 1.3, 2.4), and a mean sleep duration < 5 h/night (OR = 1.7, CI 1.2, 2.3). These associations increased in both strength and magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (p's for trend ≤ 0.01). Conclusions: Findings of this preliminary anonymous survey study suggest that RLS prevalence is high in this Appalachian primary care population and that RLS is associated with significant burden in terms of both mood and sleep impairment.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep problems are common complaints among pregnant women. This study was designed to compare sleep problems in healthy pregnant, non-pregnant and preeclamptic women. We hypothesized that some sleep problems are more prevalent in females with preeclampsia. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 102 women with preeclampsia, 106 healthy pregnant women in the third trimester and 103 healthy non-pregnant women were recruited. Age and parity were matched in three groups. We used Global sleep assessment questionnaire (GSAQ) to check subjective sleep problems. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U and Pearson Chi-sqaure tests using SPSS 16.0 software. Results: Some types of sleep problems were more common in preeclamptic rather than the other two groups. For example, Initial insomnia occurred in 21.4% of the non-pregnant, 12.3% of the healthy pregnant and 26.5% of the preeclamptic subjects (P = 0.034). Additionally, we found significant differences in fragmented sleep (P = 0.022), snoring (P < 0.001), non-idiopathic insomnia (P = 0.045) and sadness and anxiety (P = 0.001) between three groups. Some sleep problems are more common in preeclampctic subjects in comarison to the others such as initial insomnia, fragmented sleep, snoring, sleep apnea and non-idiopathic insomnia. Conclusion: Females with preeclampsia reported more problems in falling asleep, staying asleep, snoring and non idiopathic insomnia than healthy non-pregnant and healthy pregnant subjects. These results showed that different kinds of sleep problems can occur in subjects with preeclampsia in comparison to the non-pregnant and healthy pregnant women. Sleep problems should be evaluated during pregnancy particularly in pregnant women with preeclampsia.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep problems in pregnancy are common, with most pregnant women reporting decreasing sleep quality and increased night awakening especially when they approach labor. Studies have found that 82-98% of women in late pregnancy report waking at night, and 64-86% report problems with sleep quality during pregnancy. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown an increased frequency of snoring and sleep disordered breathing as pregnancy progresses. Aims: This study aimed to assess sleep practices and sleep quality in high risk pregnancy women, and to document self-reported changes that occurred between the pre-pregnancy period and the time of inclusion in the study. Also to correlate the sleep findings with other sample data like parity and pre-pregnant sleep and family history of medical illness. Materials and methods: High risk pregnant females (N = 59) were recruited from Antenatal care Unit at Mansoura University Hospital. Questions included information about maternal demographics, perceived sleep quality, sleep difficulties, night awakening, snoring, daytime tiredness, and daytime napping In addition to medical conditions in the women and their families, pre-pregnant sleep duration and complaints of current sleep problems were reviewed. Questions relating to sleep quality were based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a 9-question self-rated test intended to measure sleep disturbances and quality of sleep. Participants also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to assess daytime sleepiness. The ESS asks people to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in eight different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily lives. The Insomnia Severity Index was also used. It has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score and categorize the degree of insomnia. Statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS v20 statistical package. Results: Respondents numbered (N = 59). The Mean age of participating women was (28.9, SD ± 6.7), 38.9% were illiterate while 47.7% were educated and 15.2% could only read and write. The mean gestational age was (30.26 week, SD ± 7.02). They were all high risk pregnancies. 79.6% were hypertensive, and pregnant women with other medical complications were around 50.8% of the sample. Mean number of sleeping hours before pregnancy was 7.8 h ( SD ± 2.16). The Mean score on PSQI was 7.12 (SD ± 3), the higher the candidates age the lower PSQI they got (r = -0.05), while the Mean on ESS was 8.68 (SD ± 4.79.) Insomnia and snoring was a frequent complaint. Candidates with Hypertension and other medical complications tended to have sleep problems prior to their pregnancy with excessive daytime sleepiness and poorer sleep quality. Conclusion: Sleep problems were common in this group of women in late pregnancy, and these disturbances were increased comparative to their pre-pregnancy experience. Improving sleep in pregnant ladies in general and those with high risk pregnancy specifically might lessen the impact of their medical condition on their health and fetal outcomes. Screening for sleep disorders during pregnancy with defined standards of good sleep hygiene for pregnant ladies should be a core item in antenatal care units.

N2  - Objective: Sleep deficiency is an emerging concept denoting a deficit in the quantity or quality of sleep. This may be particularly salient for pregnant women since they report considerable sleep complaints. Sleep deficiency is linked with morbidity, including degradations in psychosocial functioning, (e.g., depression and stress), which are recognized risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the frequency of sleep deficiency across early gestation (10-20 weeks) and whether sleep deficiency is associated with reports of more depressive symptoms and stress. Methods: Pregnant women (N=160) with no self-reported sleep or psychological disorder provided sleep data collected via diary and actigraphy during early pregnancy: 10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks' gestation. Sleep deficiency was defined as short sleep duration, insufficient sleep, or insomnia. Symptoms of depression and stress were collected at the same three time points. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the data. Results: Approximately 28%-38% met criteria for sleep deficiency for at least one time point in early gestation. Women who were sleep deficient across all time points reported more perceived stress than those who were not sleep deficient (p<0.01). Depressive symptoms were higher among women with diary-defined sleep deficiency across all time points (p=0.02). Discussion: Sleep deficiency is a useful concept to describe sleep recognized to be disturbed in pregnancy. Women with persistent sleep deficiency appear to be at greater risk for impairments in psychosocial functioning during early gestation. These associations are important since psychosocial functioning is a recognized correlate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep deficiency may be another important risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Survey questions are commonly used to assess sleep duration because of their low cost and convenience. Responses to these questions correlate moderately with objectively measured sleep duration in nonpregnant individuals, but little is known about the validity of self-reported sleep measures in pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to determine the extent to which self-reported gestational sleep duration assessed by questionnaire predicted objectively measured gestational sleep duration via actigraphy. Methods: We analyzed data from 80 mothers enrolled in an ancillary study of Project BABIES, a prospective cohort study of urban, pregnant women. Sleep measurements were collected in midpregnancy and included 7 days of wrist actigraphy, a sleep log, and survey questions about sleep time adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Mean measured gestational sleep duration derived from actigraphy was 6.87 h [standard deviation (SD) 0.87], and questionnaire-assessed nocturnal sleep time averaged 7.29 h (SD 1.84). While the difference between measures did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07 for paired samples t test), over half (62 %) of participants reported a habitual average nightly sleep time that differed more than 1 h from their average actigraphically measured sleep duration (39 % overestimated by more than an hour; 23 % underestimated by more than an hour). There was no correlation between measures (r = 0.007; 95 % confidence interval -0.21, 0.23). Conclusion: Questionnaire-derived reports of usual sleep hours do not reflect objectively measured sleep time in urban, pregnant women. Actigraphy is preferable to accurately assess gestational sleep duration. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The impact of impaired circadian rhythm on health has been widely studied in shift workers and trans-meridian travelers. A part from its correlation with sleep and mood disorders, biological rhythm impairment is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer. Preeclampsia is a major public health issue, associated with a significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. While the risks factors for this condition such as obesity, diabetes, pre-existing hypertension have been identified, the underlying mechanism of this multi-factorial disease is yet not fully understood. The disruption of the light/dark cycle in pregnancy has been associated with adverse outcomes. Slightly increased risk for "small for gestational age" babies, "low birth weight" babies, and preterm deliveries has been reported in shift working women. Whether altered circadian cycle represents a risk factor for preeclampsia or preeclampsia is itself linked with an abnormal circadian cycle is less clear. There are only few reports available, showing conflicting results. In this review, we will discuss recent observations concerning circadian pattern of blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive pregnancies. We explore the hypothesis that circadian misalignments may represent a risk factor for preeclampsia. Unraveling potential link between circadian clock gene and preeclampsia could offer a novel approach to our understanding of this multi-system disease specific to pregnancy. © 2013 Ditisheim, Dibner, Philippe and Pechére-Bertschi.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy may impair glucose mechanism. This study aimed to examine associations of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep, and nap duration with 1-h glucose challenge test (GCT) levels in pregnant women after controlling for known risk factors for gestational diabetes. Method:s This is a case-control study of 104 pregnant women. All women underwent full polysomnography and a GCT and completed the multivariable apnea prediction and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality indexes. The primary outcome was maternal hyperglycemia measured by GCT. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: Over 13 % subjects reported habitual snoring in the first trimester. Only 9.3 % women with normoglycemia (GCT<135) were habitual snorers, whereas 45.5 % women with hyperglycemia (GCT≥135) had habitual snoring (p< 0.001). Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (loud snoring, snorting/gasping, and apneas) (odds ratio (OR) 2.85; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.50-5.41; p=0.001) and total nap duration (OR 1.48; 95 % CI 0.96-2.28; p=0.08) were associated with hyperglycemia. After adjusting for confounders, sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (OR 3.37; 95 % CI 1.44-8.32; p=0.005) and nap duration (OR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.00-2.681.02; p=0.05) continued to be associated with hyperglycemia. However, the primary exposure measure, the apnea/hypopnea index in the first trimester was not significantly associated with hyperglycemia (OR 1.03; 95 % CI 0.83-1.28; p=0.77). Conclusion:s Sleep-disordered breathing symptoms and nap duration are associated with hyperglycemia. Sleep duration was not associated with hyperglycemia. Research is needed concerning whether women with sleep-disordered breathing and/or daytime napping are at risk for gestational diabetes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances during pregnancy affect delivery outcomes, including shorter pregnancies and longer labour (Okun, 2009). Studies also reveal associations between recall of negative dreams and shorter labour (Mancuso et al., 2008; Winget and Kapp, 1972). However, prospective longitudinal studies assessing the value of pregnancy dreams in predicting delivery outcomes are lacking. Whether dream measures constitute better predictors of delivery outcomes than do sleep measures also remains to be determined. This 2-stage longitudinal study assessed whether prospective dream measures during pregnancy (Time-1; T1) predict delivery outcomes (Time-2; T2) controlling for pregnancy, sleep and psychosocial risk factors. Materials and methods: Fifty-two 3rd trimester pregnant women (M = 29.78 ± 3.62 wks of gestation) aged 18-37 years (M = 28.48 ± 4.06 yrs) and not planning to undergo caesarean sections were followed-up post-delivery. At T1, pregnant women completed demographic and psychological questionnaires and a 14-day home log to assess sleep/dream characteristics. Gestational length and labour duration were assessed at T2. Deliveries occurred at 36-42 weeks of gestation (M = 39.29 ± 1.46); labour lasted 1-40 h (M = 13.62 ± 8.99). Four women had unplanned caesareans; their labour duration did not differ from women who delivered vaginally (M = 13.40 ± 9.28 vs. 16.25 ± 0.03; p = 0.60). Two sets of hierarchical multiple regression analyses were run to predict delivery outcomes from pregnancy dream variables (#dreams, positive-negative dreams ratio, dream clarity, dream impact), controlling for sleep (duration, quality, bedtime/rise time, night awakenings), demographic (age, employment status, family income, education) and psychosocial (mood/concerns, stress, history of emotional problems) characteristics. All demographic variables, prenatal psychosocial factors and sleep variables associated with outcomes at p < 0.1 were considered as potential confounders. Results: More negative dreams during pregnancy predicted shorter gestation (Beta = -0.61, p = 0.00002); no adjustment was required. Controlling for age, education, stress and sleep duration, later bedtime/ rise time predicted longer labour (Beta = 0.28, p = 0.04). Conclusion: The study provides new evidence that pregnant women who report more negative dreams are at greater risk for shorter pregnancies. Results are also consistent with the possibility that chronotype mediates relationships between sleep and labour duration.

N2  - Objective: Sleep problems are common complaints among pregnant women. This study was designed to compare subjective sleep problems in non-pregnancy condition, healthy and preeclamptic pregnancy as a major complication of pregnancy. We hypothesized that some sleep problems are more prevalent in females with preeclampsia. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 102 women with preeclampsia, 106 healthy pregnant women in the third trimester and 103 healthy non-pregnant women were selected through random sampling. Age and parity were matched in the three groups. We used Global sleep assessment questionnaire (GSAQ) to check the subjective sleep problems, and then we performed statistical analysis using Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson Chi-square tests. Results: Our findings revealed significant differences in initial insomnia (p = 0.034), fragmented sleep (p = 0.022), snoring (p<0.001), non-idiopathic insomnia (p = 0.045) and sadness and anxiety (p = 0.001) between the three groups. Some sleep problems were more common in preeclampctic compared to healthy pregnant women including initial insomnia, fragmented sleep, snoring, sleep apnea and non-idiopathic insomnia. Moreover, the subjects with preeclampsia revealed more fragmented sleep, snoring, sadness and anxiety and lack of getting enough sleep due to other activities compared to non-pregnant women. Conclusion: Different kinds of sleep problems can occur in subjects with preeclampsia in comparison with the non-pregnant and healthy pregnant subjects. Sleep problems should be evaluated during pregnancy, particularly in pregnant women with preeclampsia, and suitable treatment should be provided for any specific sleep problem.

N2  - Introduction: Nighttime shift-work has been found to be a culprit of negative consequences in terms of safety and performance. In nurses, these consequences also pose a threat to the care and safety of patients. Evidence suggests that a scheduled nap may be an effective countermeasure. However little is known about the effects of a brief planned nap on measures that reflect the performance of nurses during the actual night shift. This field study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a planned nap during the nadir of alertness, on cognitive performance, evaluation of duty transfer, and selfreported sleepiness and vigor, in nursing staff working eight hour night shifts in the hospital. Materials and methods: In this prospective, within subjects experimental study design, thirty female and male nurses working shifts were recruited by cluster sampling from several hospital wards at Bnei Zion Medical Center in Haifa. All nurses had an appointment of 75% and above and worked at least one night shift per week. Nurses who were pregnant, had a diagnosed sleep disorder or chronic medical condition that could affect sleep or functioning, were excluded. The study protocol was conducted in the course of nurses' usual work schedule, and included two nights with and two nights without a nap, intermittently. Cognitive testing, performed at 06:30, included the Letter Cancellation task (LCT) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST). At 07:00, they transferred the shift to the head nurse of the department, who completed a written evaluation of the duty transfer and was blinded to the experimental condition. During planned nap nights, nurses went to sleep in a dark quiet room at 04:00 for 30 min, and on non-nap nights they continued to work as usual. To monitor sleep patterns and duration, nurses wore an actigraph 24-h before and during the night shift. Results: Compared to non-nap nights, performance measures were significantly higher on the LCT (p < 0.05), and tended to be higher on the DSST (p < 0.08), and evaluation of duty transfer was improved (p < .05) on nap nights. Levels of sleepiness were lower at 05:00, 06:00 and 07:00 and measures of vigor were higher at 05:00 and 07:00 on nap vs. non-nap nights (p < 0.01). Conclusion: A planned nap is an effective, cheap and simple strategy to improve occupational safety and performance of the nursing staff and to improve the safety and quality of patient care.

N2  - Introduction: Different sleep disturbances occur as a result of physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes associated with pregnancy. An emergent body of literature has reported a distinct association between sleep apnea and preeclampsia. Despite reports of the various sleep problems, the exact nature and incidence of sleep disorders in pregnancy is not known. objective: To investigate the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing during the pregnancy in a sample of healthy pregnant subjects. Materials and methods: Thirty-five pregnant subjects completed the STOP, BERLIN and Epworth score questionnaires during the preg- nancy prospectively. Polygraphy was recorded and snore, index apnea-hipoapneas (IAH) and respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was calculated. Demographic characteristics and STOP was also retrospectively investigated. Results: Snoring presented before pregnancy in 8 cases and STOP was for high risk in a case. IAH>5 was present in 1 case (3%) in her first trimester, RDI>5 in 19 (54% )cases (x:6.6 ±6,1): 4 in first, 6 in second and 9 in thirsd. The STOP was positive for high risk in 6 (17.8%) cases and Berlin in 5 (17.8%). The sensibility (S) for STOP was 16% and the specifity (E) 93% and in the BERLIN S: 23% and E: 91%. Although 5 of 11 cases reported in STOP or BERLIN respectively habitual snoring during pregnancy in PCR it was recorded in 19. Among these, 42% were non-snorers before pregnancy. Daytime somnolence concerned 28,6% of the population with an Epworth score significantly increased after first trimester(P<0,01) but not as significant in cases with RDI>5 (37%). The body mass index >25 was present in 46% and the gain of weight during pregnancy 8,3 ± 4,2 and was not associated with RDI>5. Conclusion: Sleep-disordered breathing is frequent during pregnancy especially when the respiratory disturbance index is used. STOP and BERLIN questionnaires were low sensibility but it is possible due the little number of severe cases. Questioning of patients at the first prenatal visit and monitoring for increased snoring during gestation may help detect early signs and symptoms of OSA but we have considered that many of them do not know that they are snoring, as the PCR revealed. Our results demonstrated that the exact incidence of snoring and sleep apnea in pregnant women is uncertain and the criteria used to define them are unclear. Further investigations are needed to determine if criteria that are used to define sleep apnea in the general population should be applied to pregnant women.

N2  - Purpose: The sleep disorder in pregnant women remains unfamiliar to perinatal care providers, resulting in lack of appropriate care. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women and to identify the associated risk factors. Method:s Married pregnant women were enrolled from their first trimester and followed up until delivery. Nonpregnant married healthy women were selected as controls. A survey questionnaire was administered to each of them. Results: We successfully performed a survey to 1,993 pregnant women and 598 nonpregnant women. The overall prevalence of sleep disorder-related symptoms in pregnant women was significantly higher than the controls (56.1 vs. 29.9 %, P< 0.05). There was higher prevalence of snoring (30.2 %), observed sleep apnea (1.1 %), mouth breathing (23.7 %), nocturnal arousal (46.5 %), insomnia (35.1 %), and daytime sleepiness (52.6 %) in pregnant women. There were no significant differences of the prevalence of bruxism (7.0 vs. 6.7 %), sleep talking (8.1 vs. 7.2%), and sleep walking (0.4 vs. 0.2%) between the two groups (P>0.05). Nocturnal sleep time (8.0± 1.3 h) was less in the third trimester compared with the nonpregnant women (8.2±1.1 h) (P<0.05). Smoking (OR03.39), drinking (OR02.40), allergic rhinitis/asthma (OR01.71), an obvious difference in neck circumference (OR01.11), andwaistline (OR01.07) changes between the first and third trimesters were the risk factors for sleep disorder-related problems. Conclusion:s There is a high prevalence of sleep disorderrelated symptoms in pregnant women. Our data may provide a baseline for prevention and treatment of sleep disturbances in pregnant women. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) refers to apnea during sleep despite respiratory effort. Various maternal and fetal complications have been described to be associated with OSA. However large population studies are unavailable to pinpoint exact incidence, causative factors and associated complications. We describe a patient with OSA that we recently managed and attempt to streamline management principles. Case: Of 32-year-old primigravida, BMI 44, known to have OSA on CPAP at night. Antenatal care done jointly with the Respiratory team. GTT at 28 weeks was normal. She had serial growth scans from 28 weeks. At 36 weeks growth tailed off, monitored and induced at term, had a caesarean section for failure to progress at 4 cm. Discharged on day 3 but readmitted with wound infection on day 7. Joint management with tissue viability team resulted in satisfactory wound healing with secondary intent. (Table Presented) Discussion: During pregnancy physical and hormonal alterations affect normal sleep and the respiratory system predisposing women to the development or worsening of pre-existing OSA syndrome. The exact incidence/ prevalence of OSA in pregnancy remains uncertain. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for diagnosis. Obesity, pregnancy weight gain and increase in neck circumference are risk factors for OSA with the latter independent from body weight being used to predict OSA. Symptoms of OSA include daytime sleepiness, waking unrefreshed, memory/ concentration lapses and personality changes. Maternal complications include pre-eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension, gestational diabetes and preterm birth while fetal complications include reduced movements, growth restriction, low Apgar's and heart rate abnormalities. Questioning at first visit and monitoring for symptoms of snoring might detect early OSA. Pregnant women who are obese or develop hypertension might warrant evaluation for OSA. Management should involve a multidisciplinary team with primary care providers, specialist nurses, obstetricians, anesthetists and respiratory physicians. In the presence of significant OSA or related nocturnal hypoxemia, nasal CPAP is the therapy of choice.

N2  - Summary: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is reported commonly during pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but the majority of these data are based upon self-report measures not validated for pregnancy. This study examined the predictive value of screening questionnaires for SDB administered at two time-points in pregnancy, and attempted to develop an 'optimized predictive model' for detecting SDB in pregnancy. A total of 380 women were recruited from an antenatal clinic in the second trimester of pregnancy. All participants completed the Berlin Questionnaire and the Multivariable Apnea Risk Index (MAP Index) at recruitment, with a subset of 43 women repeating the questionnaires at the time of polysomnography at 37 weeks' gestation. Fifteen of 43 (35%) women were confirmed to have a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) > 5 h-1. Prediction of an RDI > 5 h-1 was most accurate during the second trimester for both the Berlin Questionnaire (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.50, positive predictive value 0.50 and negative predictive value 0.93), and the MAP Index [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.768]. A stepwise selection model identified snoring volume, a body mass index (BMI)≥32 kg m-2 and tiredness upon awakening as the strongest independent predictors of SDB during pregnancy; this model had an area under the ROC curve of 0.952. We conclude that existing clinical prediction models for SDB perform inadequately as a screening tool in pregnancy. The development of a highly predictive model from our data shows promise for a quick and easy screening tool to be validated for future use in pregnancy. © 2013 European Sleep Research Society.

N2  - We prospectively examined the associations of nighttime and daytime sleep during the third trimester of pregnancy with labor duration and risk of cesarean deliveries in a convenience sample of 120 nulliparous women who completed sleep-related questionnaires and wore wrist actigraphs for up to 7 days. Nap duration and 24-hour sleep duration were inversely associated with labor duration in women with vaginal delivery. Neither actigraphy-derived nor self-reported sleep variables were associated with type of delivery (e.g., vaginal, cesarean). Results showed a beneficial effect of sleep on labor duration and suggest that studies of sleep duration effects on labor and pregnancy outcomes require a consideration of the amount of both daytime and nighttime sleep. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness are classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This condition is associated with significant pathophysiologic sequelae, including intermittent hypoxemia and hypertension. Multiple factors present during pregnancy increase the risk for OSA, and the presence of OSA during pregnancy has been associated with untoward consequences to both the mother and fetus. We studied the impact of maternal OSA during pregnancy on a group of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Materials and methods: Our study group consisted of postpartum mothers who had delivered an infant admitted to the NICU within the previous 24 h. Data was collected between 6/09 and 3/12. Mothers were randomly selected and they were asked to complete two standardized questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Snoring Symptoms Inventory) to identify symptoms of OSA, specifically excessive daytime sleepiness and snoring. Maternal data regarding age, race, health status, pregnancy, labor, and delivery and infant data regarding gestational age, birthweight, and Apgar scores were collected. Results: We enrolled 115 mothers. Their mean age was 34 ± 5 years. Seventy percent were Caucasian, 18% Hispanic, 6% African American, and 5% Asian. Smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy were reported in 2%. Most deliveries were via elective csection (42%), followed by NSVD (32%), and emergency c-section in 24%. The relationship between the ESS and the SSI was analyzed using a Pearson Correlation Statistic (r). A high correlation between the two measures was seen (r = 0.506; p < 0.0001). The relationships among ESS totals and SSI totals and pregnancy outcomes were analyzed. Elevated scores on the SSI were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, most significantly with preeclampsia. Lower infant Apgar scores were also noted. Conclusion: Pregnant women who demonstrate excessive daytime sleepiness are more likely to have sleep disturbances associated with snoring. Elevated scores on the SSI are associated with adverse prenancy outcomes. We found symptoms of maternal OSA in a high percentage of infants requiring admission to a NICU. The potential for treatment of OSA using CPAP underscores the importance of early diagnosis in pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Maternal sleep disturbances and mood disorders during the pregnancy are significant stress factors that might be related to newborn wellbeing. Our aim was to study whether maternal sleep or mood disturbances during pregnancy have an impact on (1) child wellbeing after the delivery or (2) on mother's subjective experience of labor. Materials and methods: The study is based on the CHILD SLEEP - cohort that was set up during 2011-2012 in Tampere, Finland. It consists of 1678 families (1678 mothers, 1645 fathers). The parents filled during the third trimester several standardized questionnaires on sleep quality and symptoms of depression and anxiety (i.e. BNSQ, CESD, STAI and PSS). After the delivery, the course of the labor (incl. Apgar scores, birth weight, height, duration of labor), as well as maternal labor experiences were evaluated using a 7-point VASscale in an interview. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to describe prenatal factors related to negative birth outcomes and labor experience. Results: Difficulties to fall asleep during pregnancy were reported by 14.2% of the mothers, too early awakenings by 10.8%, and poor sleep quality by 27.4%. Nocturnal awakenings were very common (94.9%), and awakenings three or more times per night were reported by 37.1%. Snoring every night was reported by 8.9%. A quarter of the women (25.6%) reported sleeping much worse during pregnancy than before. Low Apgar scores (≤ 8) at five minutes after the delivery were found in 9.8% of the babies. Mothers' depressiveness with insomnia was related to low Apgar scores when birth weight, anxiety and prenatal stress were controlled (AOR 5.1, 95% CI 1.3-20.0; p = 0.021). Maternal depressiveness during pregnancy was directly related to negative labor experience (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0; p = 0.020) and symptoms of depression with insomnia to inadequate pain relief during the labor (AOR 4.2, 95% CI 1.2-15.4; p = 0.029). Conclusion: Mother's depressiveness and poor sleep quality during pregnancy were associated with low Apgar scores of the baby at the age of five minutes and negative labor experience.

N2  - Introduction: RLS affects 5-10% of the general population, but it affects 25% of pregnant women. Sleep disorders are common in RLS. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of RLS in pregnancy, its characteristics and associated sleep complaints. Materials and methods: 50 pregnant women followed at the gynecology department of Vistahermosa Hospital. They completed Stop, Berlin and Pittsburgh questionnaires. The IRLSSG criteria were investigated by self-administered questionnaire and by telephone interview by a sleep specialist. Polysomnograms were obtained with a recording of the movements of both legs. Results: 35 of 50 patients (70%) completed all questionnaires and polysomnograms was recorded in 100%. Middle age was 34 ± 4. 20% of the patients meeting IRLSSG criteria, 71% reporting the beginning of the symptoms at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy and 42% described sporadic symptoms before pregnancy (p < 0.05). 66% described a moderate-severe intensity of the symptoms, with a frequency of 4-7 nights/week (17%), 2-5 nights/week (33%) and 50% with a low frequency. One pregnant woman was evaluated in the second and the third trimester with worsening intensity and frequency of symptoms and she was completely asymptomatic the first night after delivery. Family history was present in the 45% of the cases and PLM >5 were found in 14%. Patients with RLS were younger (≤35 years) (p < 0.05). No correlation was found between RLS and time of sleep onset longer than 30 min, night awakenings or total sleep time, reporting sleep quality in the last month as good. RLS pregnant were not more sleepy during the day nor did they have a significant frequency of mood disorder. No differences were found in IAH, RDI or the presence of previous snoring. Of the patients who had delivered at the time (57%) reported resolution of the symptoms, 75% immediately after delivery and in the one case two weeks after it. Conclusion: RLS is frequent during pregnancy affecting 20% of pregnant woman especially in the second half and usually resolving after delivery. We want to highlight that a considerable number of patients reported RLS symptoms just before pregnancy and a family history was present. Our patients described symptoms mainly as moderate-high intensity, they didn't complain of sleep disturbances, perhaps because 50% of them reported a low frequency of symptoms (less than 2-5 nights/week).

N2  - Purpose This qualitative study aimed to explore how Turkish women experience nausea and vomiting in pregnancy based on the Roy Adaptation Model. Methods To collect data, in-depth interviews were undertaken with 35 pregnant women who had nausea and vomiting. The sample of the study included pregnant women who were in their first 12 weeks of gestation, did not have medical problems and had nausea, retching and/or vomiting for at least the last 3 days. Data were collected in semi-structured interview form based on the Roy Adaptation Model and with a background data sheet. Data were analyzed using direct content analysis. Results Data were classified into four adaptive modes according to the Roy Adaptation Model. The behaviors in the physiological mode were nausea, vomiting, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, inadequate nutrition, inguinal pain, burning sensation and irritation in the throat, ketosis, and urinary incontinence. The behaviors in the self-concept mode were feeling weak, crying, inadequate self-care, changes in sexual intercourse, and social isolation. The behaviors in the role function mode were being unable to fulfill the responsibilities at home and work. The behaviors in the interdependence mode were dissatisfaction with relationships. Conclusion The study findings help nursing staff detect the stimuli and the behaviors of pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Further research may evaluate the impact of a counseling program prepared under the guidance of a nursing model on nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. © 2013, Korean Society of Nursing Science.

N2  - Introduction: RLS affects 5-10% of the general population, but it also affects 25% of pregnant women. Although iron, genetics and central nervous dopamine have been shown to play a major role in RLS unrelated to pregnancy, it's etiology in pregnancy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determinate risk factors associated to RLS in pregnancy. Materials and methods: Healthy pregnant women treated at the Vistahermosa Hospital Gynecology Department were asked to complete IRLSSG criteria by self-administered questionnaire and a sleep specialist made the clinical diagnosis of RLS by telephone interview. PCR was registered with a recording of the movements of both legs. Ferritin levels were determined. Results: Fifty patients were registered and 35 (70%) completed all questionnaires and everyone was studied by PCR. Average age was 34 ± 4.20% were in the first trimester, 37% in the second and 43% in the third. Ferritin levels were determined in 66% of cases. 20% of the patients met IRLSSG criteria, when asked by both a self assessment questionnaire and when they had a telephone interview with a sleep specialist. 85% of them had iron supplementation during pregnancy. We found low ferritin levels (≤40 ng/dl) in a high percentage of pregnant women (75%) and 83% of RLS symptomatic patients had low ferritin levels. The difference was not significant. Family history was positive in 43% of the cases. Of the patients who had delivered at the time 57% reported resolution of the symptom, 75% immediately after delivery and in one case two weeks after it. Conclusion: Pregnancy is a period with special conditions affecting the development of RLS but it has not been well investigated. We have found a family history of RLS in almost 50% of the patients, results indicate a genetic predisposition maybe manifested for first time during pregnancy. We also investigated ferritin levels, and although low ferritin levels were frequent during pregnancy in our sample it was not significantly associated with RLS symptoms. Both results and the fact that symptoms usually resolved in the days after delivery, suggests in our opinion that there must be other mechanisms implicated.

N2  - Purpose: Snoring is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, and Cesarean deliveries. The purpose of this study was to assess whether excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) assessed by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) increases the risk of these complications further. Methods: Following institutional review board approval and informed consent, English-speaking women in the immediate postpartum period were systematically selected and recruited. Women answered a survey that included questions regarding symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using the multivariable apnea prediction index and excessive daytime sleepiness using ESS. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were collected by review of medical records. Standard statistical analysis with multivariable logistic regression was performed. ESS was evaluated both as a continuous variable and with various cutoffs given that pregnant women are likely more sleepy at baseline than the general population. Results: In patients who underwent planned Cesarean delivery, mean ESS was significantly higher than in those with uncomplicated vaginal delivery, even after adjusting for confounders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.08; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.15; p = 0.02). There was no significant association between EDS (defined as ESS of >10) and gestational diabetes or gestational hypertensive disorders in snorers or non snorers. However, a significant association with gestational diabetes was found in patients with an ESS of >16 compared to those with an ESS of ≤16, even after multiple adjustments (aOR, 6.82; 95 % CI, 1.19-39.27), but the number of subjects in an ESS of >16 category was small. Conclusions: There is an increased association between women with higher ESS and planned Cesarean delivery. Severe EDS was associated with gestational diabetes in pregnant women in a small sample size. Future studies in larger samples need to confirm the association of severe EDS and gestational diabetes and elucidate potential mechanisms of the links with adverse outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Background/Aims: Early life experiences are homeostatic determinants for adult organisms. We evaluated the impact of prenatal immune activation during late gestation on the neuroimmune-endocrine function of adult offspring and its interaction with acute stress. Methods: Pregnant Swiss mice received saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 17. Adult male offspring were assigned to the control or restraint stress condition. We analyzed plasmatic corticosterone and catecholamine levels, the monoamine content in the hypothalamus, striatum and frontal cortex, and the sleep-wake cycle before and after acute restraint stress. Results and Conclusion: Offspring from LPS-treated dams had increased baseline norepinephrine levels and potentiated corticosterone secretion after the acute stressor, and no effect was observed on hypothalamic monoamine content or sleep behavior. The offspring of immune-activated dams exhibited impairments in stress-induced serotonergic and dopaminergic alterations in the striatum and frontal cortex. The data demonstrate a distinction between the plasmatic levels of corticosterone in response to acute stress and the hypothalamic monoamine content and sleep patterns. We provide new evidence regarding the influence of immune activation during late gestation on the neuroendocrine homeostasis of offspring. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Introduction: Mental health is an important medical issue in perinatal care, and there is increasing evidence that insomnia during pregnancy is associated with postpartum depression (PPD). Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of insomnia treatment during the third trimester of pregnancy on PPD symptoms. Materials and methods: Fifty-three pregnant women with insomnia were randomly assigned to trazodone, diphenhydramine, or placebo treatment. Sleep quality was measured by actigraphy at baseline, and after 2 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, depression was assessed 2 and 6 weeks after delivery. Results: Trazodone and diphenhydramine improved sleep quality compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment. Further, depressive symptoms were reduced 2 and 6 weeks after delivery in trazodone and diphenhydramine groups compared to placebo. No differences in depressive symptoms were observed between the trazodone and diphenhydramine groups. Conclusion: These findings indicate that insomnia treatment with trazodone or diphenhydramine during the third trimester of pregnancy may prevent PPD.

N2  - Introduction: Background: The aim of this study was to estimate diagnostic accuracy of the minimum question set used to estimate the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) prevalence using self administered questionnaire. The original English version was published in 2003 by Richard P. Allen et al. in Sleep Medicine. The data set was constructed along with the diagnostic criteria and was indented to be used in epidemiology studies. The minimum set consists of three questions to diagnose RLS and the forth question estimating frequency of the symptoms. Materials and methods: The questions were translated to Czech language and blindly reversely translated to assure no shift in the original meaning. Pregnant women were asked to fill the questionnaire between 34-38 week of pregnancy at the Department of Obstetrics of the First Medical Faculty, Charles University in Prague. Subsequently and independently, the women were contacted over telephone by an sleep physician trained in diagnosing RLS. The results of both methods were compared to estimate the diagnostic profile of the minimum question set. Any women, answering first question as “no” were set to answer all three questions as negative. Results: In total 187 questionnaires were validated, in 57 the personal interview confirmed the diagnosis of RLS. When the patient answered all three questions positively, in twelve cases RLS was not confirmed by the telephone interview. Thus positivity of all three questions yields specificity of 90.8%, but only 79.0% both sensitivity and positive predictive value. When a patient answered “no” to the first question, then RLS was found to be present in only three women. Thus positivity of only the first question has sensitivity 94.7% and negative predictive value 97.4%. Conclusion: Diagnosing RLS using self-administered questionnaire is a fast and cheap method, representing a major advantage when screening larger population. Our study validated Czech version of the questions and found high total diagnostic accuracy, even when using only the first question, with highest sensitivity, thus being very usefull for screening. Adding the other two questions led to increase in specificity, but at the costs of losing some patients. Such approach is encouraged e.g. in genetic studies, where including a false positive patient may lead to distortion of the result.

N2  - The peripheral circadian oscillator plays an essential role in synchronizing local physiology to operate in a circadian manner via regulation of the expression of clock-controlled genes. The present study aimed to evaluate the circadian rhythms of clock genes and clock-controlled genes expressed in the rat uterus endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) during the stage of implantation by a DNA microarray. Of 12,252 genes showing significantly expression, 7,235 genes displayed significant alterations. As revealed by the biological pathway analysis using the database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery online annotation software, genes were involved in cell cycle, glutathione metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway, fatty acid metabolism, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, focal adhesion, and PPAR signaling pathway. The clustering of clock genes were mainly divided into four groups: the first group was Rorα, Timeless, Npas2, Bmal1, Id2, and Cry2; the second group Per1, Per2, Per3, Dec1, Tef, and Dbp; the third group Bmal2, Cry1, E4bp4, Rorβ, and Clock; the fourth group Rev-erbα. Eleven implantation-related genes and 24 placenta formation-related genes displayed significant alterations, suggesting that these genes involved in implantation and placenta formation are controlled under circadian clock. Some candidates as clock-controlled genes were evaluated by using RNA interference to Bmal1 mRNA. Down-regulation of Igf1 gene expression was observed by Bmal1 silencing, whereas the expression of Inhβa was significantly increased. During active oscillation of circadian clock, the apoptosis-related genes Fas and Caspase3 remained no significant changes, but they were significantly increased by knockdown of Bmal1 mRNA. These results indicate that clock-controlled genes are up- or down-regulated in rat UESCs during the stage of decidualization. DNA microarray analysis coupled with RNA interference will be helpful to understand the physiological roles of some oscillating genes in blastocyst implantation and placenta formation. © 2013 Tasaki, Zhao, Isayama, Chen, Yamauchi, Shigeyoshi, Hashimoto and Hattori.

N2  - Bipolar disorder presents special challenges to women of childbearing age as well as to their families and clinicians. Problems include lower fertility rates, strong genetic loading, and potential fetal teratogenic risks from medication to control the condition as well as high rates of premature mortality due largely to suicide but including also the effects of accidents, substance abuse, and general medical disorders. A common misconception is that pregnancy is protective against psychiatric symptoms. The majority of recent studies suggest that pregnancy is a period of substantial risk for recurrence with estimates of recurrence as high as 50%. Identifying and treating women prior to pregnancy might prevent negative outcomes. Illness history and reproductive safety of medications are the most important factors to consider when planning treatment. Factors associated with a higher risk of relapse during pregnancy include abrupt discontinuation of mood stabilizers, a history of four or more prior mood episodes, and prior intrapartum mood episode. Currently, a common clinical practice is to stop ongoing mood stabilizing treatment during pregnancy in order to avoid potential adverse fetal developmental effects and purported associated liability risk. However, some progress has been made lately in applying the limited information available to develop treatment guidelines for the clinical management of women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy. Women with more severe risk of relapse are recommended to continue medications. Medications used to treat BD (including valproate, carbamazepine, and lithium) are associated with increased risk of fetal anomalies and neurobehavioral abnormality. Compared with lithium, anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and valproic acid may pose even greater risks, including high rates (1%-5%) of neuraltube defects such as spina bifida as well as craniofacial anomalies, cardiac anomalies, microcephaly, and growth retardation. Despite the dearth of data, folic acid supplementation (4 mg daily) is recommended to prevent neural tube defects for patients being treated with anticonvulsants. Reproductive safety information about other, newer agents used to treat bipolar disorder remains very limited, leaving lithium as a plausible first-line option, especially during mid-to-late pregnancy. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), in an April 2008 Practice Bulletin, recommend that the use of valproate and carbamazepine during pregnancy should be avoided, when possible, particularly during the first trimester. They further recommend that a fetal echocardiogram should be considered in women exposed to lithium during the first trimester. Atypical antipsychotics are widely used in the treatment of BD; however, there are limited data about their use during pregnancy. High potency antipsychotics could be used if needed. In the other hand, in women with low risk of relapse, medication should be tapered slowly over the course of 6 weeks. It is also important to address the consumption of caffeine, nicotine, illicit drugs, and alcohol, as well as poor nutrition and the general level of stress and sleep deprivation. In conclusion, women of reproductive age with BD should be counseled that pregnancy is a time of substantial risk of relapse, particularly following discontinuation of ongoing mood stabilizing maintenance treatment. A relapse prevention and management strategy for bipolar disorder should be outlined before the patient attempts conception.

N2  - Women are at increased risk of developing mood disorders during the postpartum period, and poor postpartum sleep may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of depression. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between sleep variables and postpartum depression symptoms using wrist actigraphy and self-report surveys. Twenty-five healthy primiparous women were recruited from their outpatient obstetricians' offices from July 2009 through March 2010. Subjects wore wrist actigraphs for 1 week during the third trimester of pregnancy and again during the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th weeks postpartum while completing sleep logs and sleep surveys. Subjective assessments of mood were collected at the end of each actigraph week. Subjective sleep assessments were strongly predictive of depression severity scores as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) across all weeks (p < 0.001). Actigraphic measures of sleep maintenance, such as sleep fragmentation, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset, were also significantly correlated with EPDS scores postpartum. However, there was no relationship between nocturnal sleep duration and EPDS scores. This study provides additional evidence that poor sleep maintenance as measured by wrist actigraphy, rather than lesser amounts of sleep, is associated with EPDS scores during the postpartum period and that subjective assessments of sleep may be more accurate predictors of postpartum depression symptoms than wrist actigraphy. It also supports the hypothesis that disrupted sleep may contribute to the development and extent of postpartum depression symptoms. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Oviparous species are model organisms for investigating embryonic development of endogenous physiological circadian rhythms without the influence of maternal biorhythms. Recent studies have demonstrated that heart rates and metabolic rates of embryonic turtles are not constant or always maximal and can be altered in response to the presence of embryos at a more advanced stage of development within the nest. A first step in understanding the physiological mechanisms underpinning these responses in embryonic ectothermic organisms is to develop metabolic profiles (e.g., heart rate) at different temperatures throughout incubation. Heart beat and rhythmic patterns or changes in development may represent important signals or cues within a nest and may be vital to coordinate synchronous hatching well in advance of the final stages of incubation. We developed baseline embryonic heart-rate profiles of embryos of the short-necked Murray River turtle (Emydura macquarii) to determine the stage of embryogenesis that metabolic circadian rhythms become established, if at all. Eggs were incubated at constant temperatures (26°C and 30°C) and heart rates were monitored at 6-h intervals over 24 h every 7-11 days until hatching. Circadian heart rate rhythms were detected at the mid-gestation period and were maintained until hatching. Heart rates throughout the day varied by up to 20% over 24 h and were not related to time of day. This study demonstrated that endogenous metabolic circadian rhythms in developing embryos in turtle eggs establish earlier in embryogenesis than those documented in other vertebrate taxa during embryogenesis. Early establishment of circadian rhythms in heart rates may be critical for communication among embryos and synchrony in hatching and emergence from the nest. © 2013 The Author.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep problems can harmfully affect every aspect of a child's physical and psychological health, which has been recognized as a public issue in the whole world. While several studies in English shed some light on sleep problems among Chinese children, there exist similar studies in Chinese. These may be unavailable to non- Chinese practitioners and researchers due to the language barrier. The current study is to make a comprehensive review of these studies to bridge the gap. Materials and methods: Electronic searches of the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the most comprehensive search engine in China, were conducted by two authors. The time period for the searcheswas 1974 to June 2013. Keywords included “sleep”, “sleep disorder”, “sleep problems”, “sleep disturbances”, “infant”, “child”, “nursling”, “preschool-aged children”, “pupil”, “school-aged children” and extensions of these terms. A total of 553 potential studieswere initially identified, but only 98 studiesmet the criteria for this review: the child's age was from 0 to 18; studies published in Chinese language. Results: The selected studies can be organized into four major categories: Review of the current studies abroad (n = 10). Survey research (n = 62) subdivided into three subcategories: survey among general participants (n = 47), survey aimed at the special group who were fat, poor or suffering from diseases (n = 15), correlation analysis between sleep disorder and other characteristics (n = 13). Studies of some sleep disorders (n = 13) and 2 case studies. In general, the majority are based on studies abroad and lack empirical research. Except for questionnaires, only 4 of them have applied other methods such as EEG. While there is no uniform conclusion on the characteristics, influencing factors, and incidence rate of sleep problems in different areas of China, some common results do exist: sleep problems and short sleep patterns are common in Chinese children. Different ages and stages indicated different developmental features. The main influencing factors were family environment, pregnancy state, sleep habits, biological factors, parental pattern, and so forth. Conclusion: Although studies in the Chinese language regarding pediatric sleep problems are relatively limited, they definitely contribute to research and clinical settings of sleep medicine. Further endeavors should include making existing studies in Chinese language available to non-Chinese researchers and practitioners, and publishing new studies in Chinese, English and other languages.

N2  - Objective Obstructive sleep apnea, a breathing disorder caused by the repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep, results in a state of chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH). Although the etiology and consequences of CIH are extensively investigated in the adult, the developmental ramifications of this disease process are unknown. Design This study was done to investigate the effect of CIH during gestation on offspring development. Pregnant female Spraque-Dawley rats were exposed to daily CIH throughout the gestational period. Results Postnatal day-1 offspring from CIH mothers were asymmetrically growth restricted, with decreased body weights and elevated brain-weight:liver-weight ratios. Furthermore, CIH newborns had elevated heart- and brain-weight:body weight ratios, and decreased liver-weight:body weight ratios. By adulthood, body weights of growth restricted offspring were significantly greater, as were the liver-weight:body weight ratios. CIH offspring also had greater body fat deposition, were hyperglycemic and had elevated plasma levels of insulin during development into adults. Conclusion These data suggest that alteration of the maternal intrauterine environment by gestational CIH effects the long-term development of the offspring and increases the risk of the offspring to metabolic diseases in adulthood. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

N2  - More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience low-back pain (LBP) and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. Pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep. To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (18 July 2012), identified related studies and reviews from the Cochrane Back Review Group search strategy to July 2012, and checked reference lists from identified reviews and studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic auricular (ear) acupuncture significantly improved these outcomes more than sham acupuncture.When reported, adverse events were minor and transient. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbo-pelvic pain more than usual care alone, acupuncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain, and a 16- to 20-week training program was no more successful than usual prenatal care at preventing pelvic or LBP. Low-quality evidence suggested that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP.There was low-quality evidence from single trials for other outcomes because of high risk of bias and sparse data; clinical heterogeneity precluded pooling. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be ruled out.Physiotherapy, OMT, acupuncture, a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more than usual care alone. Acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy at relieving evening lumbo-pelvic pain and disability and improving pain and function when it was started at 26- rather than 20-weeks' gestation, although the effects were small.There was no significant difference in LBP and function for different support belts, exercise, neuro emotional technique or spinal manipulation (SMT), or in evening pelvic pain between deep and superficial acupuncture.Very low-quality evidence suggested a specially-designed pillow may reduce night-time LBP.Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates.  Future research would benefit from the introduction of an agreed classification system that can be used to categorise women according to presenting symptoms.

N2  - Introduction: Mandibular Advancement Devices (MAD) are employed in the treatment of mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) or in severe patients who do not tolerate the CPAP or who refuse surgery. The target of our study was to evaluate the response to a MAD designed by Orthoapnea in the treatment of OSAS in adults. Materials and methods: This is a prospective study, where we included 103 patients with mild or moderate OSAS diagnosed by respiratory polygraphy. We excluded those patients with serious comorbidity, severe obesity, anatomic problems that prevent MAD placing, high gag reflex and pregnant women. A polygraphy and a 3D i-CAT CT scans were performed before and after one month of treatment with MAD. We registered the following variables: sex, age, airway area and volume, total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) - in supine and other positions - total number of apneas, number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas, oxygen desaturation per hour index (ODI) and percentage of time during which the saturation was under 90% (CT90). We considered an effective treatment when the control polygraphy with MAD was normal (AHI lower than 5) or a significant reduction in the AHI was reached. The results were analyzed by Student's T- test for paired data, nonparametric Wilcoxon test and McNemar test. Results: Of the 103 patients included, 84 were men (81.6%) and 19 were women (18.4%). The average age was of 46.47 ± 9.71. The body mass index (BMI) average was of 27.36 ± 2.45 kg/m2. The airway area patency and volume increased after the treatment (area from 256 to 308 mm2; volume from 4533 to 6356 mm3). We obtained after treatment a statistically significant decreases (p < 0.05) in the following respiratory parameters: average AHI (from 16.2 to 6), both in supine (from 25.1 to 6.9) and other positions (from 7.8 to 3.9), average of total apneas (from 69.2 to 9.5), average of obstructive apneas (from 34 to 8.7), average of hypopneas (from 70.1 to 24.8), desaturation per hour index average (from 13.7 to 5.5) and average CT90 (from 1.6 to 0.6). In 72.80% of the cases the AHI was halved. In 90.30%, an AHI under 10 was reached and in 61.2%, under 5. Conclusion: In our opinion, the use of Orthoapnea MAD is an efficient therapeutic alternative in patients with mild and moderate OSAS, increasing airway area patency and volume, thus reducing the respiratory events as the AHI an desaturation and improving some of its pathophysiologic consequences.

N2  - Introduction: background: Sleep is vital important for early childhood development. A growing body of work has found that sleep problems in Taiwan are common for children aged 0-6 years. Short sleep duration in infancy has been identified to be associated with childhood obesity in Western literatures. However, limited longitudinal evidence exists regarding the association between sleep status and body weight changes in early childhood for Taiwanese children. Aim: To investigate the longitudinal association between sleep status and body weight changes in healthy children from birth to 3 years of age. Materials and methods: A convenience sampling technique is used to recruit interested primparous (singleton delivery) mother- newborn pairs at a medical center located in North Taiwan. The newborns are eligible for a 3-year follow-up (from 08/2010 to 07/ 2013) if the following criteria are met: (1) ≥ 37 weeks gestation, (2) birth weight ≥ 2500 g, (3) discharge from newborn nursery (baby-room) or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) without significant neonatal mobility, and 4) nursery or NICU stay less the 7 days. Eligible newborns are scheduled for collecting sleep, environmental light exposure, food intake, and anthropometric data every half-year from the 1st week after birth to 36-months of age. Sleep assessment is performed in the home environment by mother-reported infant sleep diary, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire, and an actiwatch to monitor movement of the child. Results: There were 102 infants recruited at their 1st week after birth. Among the 102 subjects, 46 subjects were followed for 12 months and 11 of them were followed for 24 months. The results show that (1) sleep efficiency, total time in bed, total sleep time and nocturnal sleep hours increase with age; (2) duration of night awaking decreases with age; (3) body weight is negatively correlated with total sleep time, total time in bed, diurnal sleep time and night awaking hours; (4) body weight is positively correlated with sleep efficiency and nocturnal sleep hours. Conclusion: Study results are anticipated to understand the contemporaneous changes in sleep with changes in body weight, and to provide an informative reference regarding the effect of sleep on body weight changes for children aged 0-3 years.

N2  - Introduction: There appears to be a difference in the pathophysiological development of dynamic upper airway obstruction manifested as hypopneas in contrast to the static obstruction of apneas. We designed a study to test the hypothesis that extremely obese patients manifest sleep-disordered breathing predominantly as hypopneas with very few apneas. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review of the data of 90 adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), and assigned them to one of two groups. Group B had a body mass index (BMI)P 45 kg/m2, while Group A had a BMI < 35 kg/m2, matched for age and gender with Group B. We excluded all those with age <18 years, pregnancy, BMIP 35 < 45 kg/m2 and those with P5 central apneas/h. The primary outcome measure was the hypopnea/ apnea ratio (HAR). The secondary measures were obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive and central apnea indices, hypopnea index, oxygen saturation (SpO2) nadir, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2), and presence or absence of obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Data were analyzed with t-test for independent samples, and results expressed as group mean ± standard deviation, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: There were 45 subjects in each group. The mean age was 50.6 ± 11.5 years in Group A and 47.4 ± 12.7 years in Group B. The meanBMIwas 28.9 ± 4 kg/m2 in GroupAand 54.5 ± 8 kg/m2 in Group B. There were 15 patients with OHS, 4 in Group A and 11 in Group B. The HAR was significantly higher in the extremely obese Group B (38.8 ± 50.7) compared to Group A (10.6 ± 16.5), p = 0.0008, as was the hypopnea index (28.7 ± 28.6 in Group B vs 12.6 ± 8.4 in Group A, p = 0.0005) and AHI (35.5 ± 33.8 vs 22 ± 23, p = 0.03), but not the apnea index (11.2 ± 23.5 in Group A and 6.7 ± 13.6 in Group B, p = 0.25). The SpO2 nadir was lower in Group B (79.1 ± 7.1% vs 83.1 ± 6.7%, p = 0.007). There were no significant differences in sleep capnometry or sleep architecture. The HAR was higher in Group B regardless of gender, race or presence of OHS. There were no significant differences in HAR between OHS and non-OHS subjects, even when matched for BMI. The difference in HAR between Groups A and B was more robust in men than in women. Conclusion: Sleep-disordered breathing in extremely obese (BMIP45 kg/m2) subjects is manifested predominantly by hypopneas rather than apneas. This suggests a different pathophysiology, with implications for potential directed treatment modalities.

N2  - Background: Of new mothers with a positive depression screening (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale- FEPDS410) 19.3 percent (n=1396) had thoughts of self-harm (Wisner et al, JAMA Psychiatry 2013). The high rate of suicidal ideation (SI) in new mothers is a major concern. Without proper treatment, mothers with SI are at increased risk for suicide. From the 1997-1999 UK Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Death suicide was the leading cause of maternal death from 42 days to 1 year postpartum; 28 percent of maternal deaths (n=242) resulted from suicide (Oates, 2003). In this cross-sectional study, the objective was to characterize potential risk factors for postpartum women with SI who were enrolled in the primary study to screen for postpartum depression (PPD)(Wisner et al, 2013). The aims were to examine the relationship between SI and childhood or adult history of trauma (physical abuse or sexual abuse) and sleep disturbances in new mothers within 4-6 weeks after delivery. The hypothesis was childhood trauma, current sleep disturbance and the interaction between childhood trauma and current sleep disturbance were associated with SI. Methods: Eligible subjects included new mothers who received an EPDS depression screen within 4-6 weeks after delivery and a completed home visit evaluation. The primary psychiatric diagnosis was confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Patients with Bipolar Disorders, primary psychotic disorders, alcohol or substance use disorders were excluded. We compared the groups with an EPDS item 10 ('The thought of harming myself has occurred to me')=0 ('never'), 1 ('hardly ever'), 2 or 3 ('sometimes' or 'quite often'). We recorded baseline demographic characteristics including age, race, educational level, marital status, health insurance and parity. We examined comorbid disorders, adult and childhood abuse history, onset of the current depressive episode, total depression scores on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Atypical Depression Symptoms Version (SIGH-ADS)Fa 29-item instrument that incorporates the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and a set of questions to assess atypical neurovegetative symptoms and the global assessment of function. For sleep disturbance we examined the SIGH-ADS sleep symptoms (insomnia-items H6, H7, H8 and wake time after sleep onset-WASO greater than 20 min). Results: Of 648 eligible mothers, 496 (77%) reported that they 'never' had thoughts of self-harm; 98 (15%) had SI 'hardly ever', and 34 (5%) had SI 'sometimes or quite often'. Younger mothers, African Americans and mothers with public health insurance were significantly more likely to have SI. Mothers with the onset of depressive episodes before pregnancy or in the post-partum, a history of physical abuse in childhood, and lowered global functioning were significantly more likely to have SI. Cumulative logistic regression models suggested a main effect for history of childhood physical abuse (odds ratio-OR=1.681, 95% confidence interval-CI=1.045, 2.704, p=0.032) and a marginally significant interaction of childhood physical abuse with WASO420 min (OR=1.576, 95%CI 0.950, 2.614, p=0.078). Conclusions: A high percentage of maternal deaths are from suicide (Oates, 2003). Our data suggested that among mothers with a positive depression screening, having a past history of childhood trauma and possibly having recent sleep disturbance contributed to increased risk for thoughts of suicide. Altered stress responses in patients with early life abuse could increase their susceptibility to suicide (Lupien et al, 2009). Patients with childhood abuse who completed suicide expressed reduced levels of glucocorticoid receptor- GR whereas non-abused patients who completed suicide did not express altered GR (McGowan, Meaney et al, 2009). New research is imperative to extend our knowledge of the relationship between abnormal responses to stress and the cognitive processes involved with making decisions and experience of reward (Dombrovski et al, 2013) which could underlie suicidal thoughts and precede suicide in postpartum mothers.

N2  - Health impairments, including reproductive issues, are associated with working nights or rotating shifts. For example, shift work has been associated with an increased risk of irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, infertility, miscarriage, low birth weight or pre-term delivery, and reduced incidence of breastfeeding. Based on what is known about circadian regulation of endocrine rhythms in rodents (and much less in humans), the circadian clock is an integral regulatory part of the reproductive system. When this 24-h program is disordered by environmental perturbation (such as shift work) or genetic alterations, the endocrine system can be impaired. The purpose of this review is to explore the hypothesis that misalignment of reproductive hormones with the environmental light-dark cycle and/or sleep-wake rhythms can disrupt menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and parturition. We highlight the role of the circadian clock in regulating human reproductive physiology and shift work-induced pathology within each step of the reproductive axis while exploring potential mechanisms from the animal model literature. In addition to documenting the reproductive hazards of shift work, we also point out important gaps in our knowledge as critical areas for future investigation. For example, future studies should examine whether forced desynchronization disrupts gonadotropin secretion rhythms and whether there are sleep/wake schedules that are better or worse for the adaptation of the reproductive system to shift work. These studies are necessary in order to define not only whether or not shift work-induced circadian misalignment impairs reproductive capacity, but also to identify strategies for the future that can minimize this desynchronization. © 2013 Gamble, Resuehr and Johnson.

N2  - Introduction: To evaluate the “natural history” of idiopathic restless legs syndrome (iRLS) by means of a structured questionnaire with 17 questions. Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty (150) patients with iRLS attending the Sleep Disorders Center of the San Raffaele hospital of Milan were consecutively enrolled. Eighty-four (56%) women, 66 (44%) men, age: 60.3 ± 14.38, age at onset 44.5 ± 17.66, IRLS 23.9 ± 6.42, PLMI 41.0 ± 48.21, ESS 6.7 ± 4.66, ferritin level 98.5±121.14. Secondary forms of RLS were excluded on the basis of clinical history data and neurologic examination. Results: Twenty-one % of patients reported RLS age onset between 46-55 years, 19% between 36-45 years and 15% between 26- 35 years. No family history for RLS in 45% of this sample was recorded, while 42% of patients reported a parent with RLS. Twenty-three % of RLS patients had never had any problems with sleep, while 21% had had sleep problems in the past 10 years. Among patients who had had sleep disturbances before the onset of RLS (57%), 85% suffered from insomnia. Thirty-seven % of subjects reported symptoms of RLS to be “sporadic” at onset, 30% “fluctuating”, and 15% “intermittent”. At onset, 46% of subjects reported the severity of RLS symptoms to be “mild”. The frequency of symptoms at onset was reported to be 61/week in 65% of patients, 2-3/week in 23%, and more than 3 times/week in 12% of patients. In 73% of patients symptoms tended to worsen over time and only in 19% they were stable. In 29% of patients, approximately 3-5 years occurred between RLS onset and diagnosis/treatment. In 73% of subjects therapy remained stable. Thirty-five % of subjects took only 1 drug for RLS treatment, 29% 2 drugs, ≥3 drugs were used by 22% of patients. At the time of this study, 69% of subjects reported RLS symptoms more than 3 times/week. The intensity of the symptoms was “moderate” in 55% and “severe” in 28%. Forty % of women had no pregnancies, 27% had one pregnancy and 29% had two pregnancies; 66% of women reported no variations on RLS symptoms during pregnancy, 10% a “mild” worsening, another 10% a “moderate” worsening while 6% complained a “severe” worsening. Conclusion: Despite the availability of drugs believed to be effective in RLS and their regular use in the majority of patients the RLS symptoms tend to persist. This points to the need of the development of new and more effective therapeutic strategies.

N2  - Jane Honikman is a Postpartum Parent Support Consultant from Santa Barbara, California. In 1977, she co-founded Postpartum Education for Parents (PEP). She founded Postpartum Support International (PSI) in 1987. 蠐 I was pregnant, single and alone. I gave birth in a foreign country, and never saw my baby. I had no emotional support 蠑. 蠐 I was married, and was finally pregnant. I gave birth, away from my extended family, but with a supportive husband. We had no emotional support 蠑 It is these contrasting, yet similar experiences, which have motivated Jane Honikman to become passionate about improving the outcomes for babies and their parents. After the birth of her second child, she co-founded, with some of her friends, Postpartum Education for Parents (PEP). It was conceived from their own needs as struggling young parents, removed from their families, and inundated with professional advice. It was about making friends, learning about community resources, and gaining confidence as new parents. The first ever warm line, staffed entirely by trained parent volunteers, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week was launched and it has been available since July 1, 1977. Communities are human systems where we live, work, learn, pray, and play together. We tend to gather together based on our cultural values and with a common purpose. It is during pregnancy that the first shift in emotional needs occurs. The arrival of the newborn does interrupt a new parent's existing community, as well as a good night's sleep. Social connections, our networks, exist within each community, yet how do expectant and new families find or create them? In general, our networks help us find employment, friendship, and provide emotional support and comfort. We may relish these natural human interactions, take them for granted, or in some cases, ignore them. Then, the new baby arrives. The need for community support takes on a different meaning. During this interactive course, Oguz Omay will interview Jane Honikman on how to build efficient and sustainable community networks for new families. The presenters will explore how best a perinatal psychiatry team may work with users' associations and the participants will be called to comment on challenges they perceive in their own cultural context.

N2  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is one of the most frequent neurological sleep disorders. Epidemiological studies have shown consistently that it is more frequent in females than in males with male-to-female ratios mostly in the range of 1:1.5-1:2.0 in adult populations. One of the main candidates involved in this gender gap is pregnancy and specifically the transient form of RLS during pregnancy that affects around 20 % of females. Not only does the risk for RLS increase with increasing numbers of pregnancies, but RLS symptoms during that period are also a significant gender-specific risk factor for the development of chronic, idiopathic RLS later in life. Iron deficiency anemia is a further risk factor that is gender-specific inasmuch as it is more prevalent in females although the probability to develop RLS with iron deficiency anemia does not differ between men and women. While it is unknown whether and how these two gender-specific risk factors, i.e., pregnancy and iron deficiency anemia, interact and to what extent their effects are mediated by an individual genetic predisposition, they can at least explain part of the observed prevalence differences between males and females. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Introduction: Studies indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among shift workers, yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not well understood. The hemostatic system significantly impacts CVD, and several hemostatic markers demonstrate circadian rhythmicity. Thus, circadian misalignment of hemostatic markers due to shift work may be involved in the increased risk of CVD. This study aimed to compare hemostatic markers among healthy shift working vs. daytime working female nurses. It was hypothesized that hemostatic markers are elevated in shift compared to day workers, beyond the effects of sleep disturbance and other factors known to detrimentally affect health in shift workers. Materials and methods: Thirty shift and 30 day working female nurses ages 30-45 were recruited by quota sampling at Rambam Health-Care Campus. Nurses were included if they were healthy, did not smoke, had a BMI'Ü26, had no family history of CVD at a young age, were not using medication regularly (except oral contraceptives), did not have a fever in the past month and were not pregnant. Shift workers had at least two non day shifts and one night shift per week. For all participants, blood was drawn at 07:00 in the morning (not following a night shift) for the measurement of seven markers of coagulation, including Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), heparanase procoagulant activity, tissue factor (TF) + heparanase complex, protein C, D- dimer, Von Willebrand factor (vWF) and fibrinogen. Sleep quality was assessed by self report (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Results: All coagulation markers were in the normative range. PAI- 1 levels were significantly higher among shift compared to day workers (36.6 ng/ml vs 24.3 ng/ml, p < 0.05). In shift workers, Heparanase procoagulant activity was 2- fold and TF + heparanase complex was 1.5-fold compared to day work nurses (both p < 0.05). Sleep quality was significantly lower for shift compared to day workers (p < 0.001). No group differences were found for Protein C, D-dimer, vWF and fibrinogen. Logistic regression analyses showed that shift work and poor sleep quality were significant predictors of high levels of PAI-1 (R2 = 0.17), heparanase procoagulant activity (R2 = 0.13) and TF + heparanase (R2 = 0.10). Conclusion: Elevated levels of PAI-1 and heparanase markers in healthy shift working nurses suggest subclinical disturbances in the hemostatic system, which together with reduced sleep quality may contribute to future cardiovascular morbidity.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the effect of chronic melatonin treatment on human reproductive function. We report here on the effect of 10 months treatment with a controlled-release melatonin preparation (Circadin, 2 mg) on spermatogenesis and gonadotropic hormone status in a pinealectomised patient whose melatonin secretion was abolished. METHODS: Semen analysis, hormone (Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), inhibin B, prolactin, testosterone and estradiol) and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHB G) concentrations were determined before and at the end of 4 and 10 months of, treatment. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, prolactin and inhibin B levels did not display significant variation with time, whereas FSH and LH levels showed a tendency to a decrease, but remained in the normal range. Sperm concentration and total spermatozoa count dropped below the lower limit of the reference range during melatonin treatment, whereas motility and normal form percentages remained in the normal range. Fertility was preserved, since the patients wife became pregnant during month 10 of melatonin treatment and gave birth to a healthy female baby. CONCLUSIONS: this isolated clinical observation shows that more investigations in large patient series are needed to document possible side-effects of melatonin administration on male reproductive function. One.should therefore be cautious about melatonin prescription for circadian rhythm sleep disorders in young males. ©2013 Neuroendocrmoloqy Letters.

N2  - Introduction: Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is part of a diffuse autonomic nervous system deregulation. Usually it presents as sleep hypoventilation with impaired responses to hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been described as an option in older children. We describe a case of an infant in whom pulmonary hypertension (PHT) was the first signal of disease, being NIV a successful option. Materials and methods: Chart review. Results: M.D., was a 2 month old female infant, the 3rd child of a healthy, non-related, young couple. Gestation, delivery and neonatal period were uneventfully. She was on exclusive breastfeeding with good weight gain. Parents described prostration in the previous 3 days, food refusal and cyanosis in the day before. She was examined by a pediatric cardiologist who diagnosed severe PHT and referred her to our hospital. Physical examination confirmed central and peripheral cyanosis and satO2 was 91% breathing room air; other aspects were unremarkable including alertness, tonus, thorax examination and pulmonary auscultation. Hematological and biochemistry evaluations were normal except capillary blood gases that revealed respiratory acidosis (pH 7,26 mmHg) with pCO2 79,6 mmHg; chest X-ray was normal. There was no polipneia and during sleep apneic episodes were identified. Polysomnography revealed central apneas with severe desaturation in NREM sleep and hypercapnia, with delayed arousal response. After an initial decompensation period with increasingly high pCO2 that needed invasive ventilation, she was started on nasal mask NIV with good adaptation and blood gases normalization, permitting rapid transition to home care. A genetic mutation on PHOX 2B confirmed CCHS. Actually, at one year old, she is clinically stable on sleep NIV with normal neurodevelopment and somatic progression and without PHT on cardiac evaluation. Conclusion: Sleep central apneas are the most frequent presentation of CCHS in childhood but it can presents differently as shown on this patient. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion to diagnose this rare disease. The NIV support is a less common approach in younger patients, but it may be a successful option, avoiding tracheostomy and prolonged hospitalization and improving quality of life.

Cases of colic were identified by applying Wessel's criteria, calculations were made using SPSS version 19, P-value, odds ratio and 95% Confidence interval were calculated and significance of various factors were evaluated. Results: Out of the 735 infants who visited the outpatient department for colic, only 125 infants that fulfilled Wessel's criteria were included in the study. Similarly 125 age matched controls were also selected. The factors that were found significantly associated with infantile colic include, stress during pregnancy, being first born, breast feeding, improper feeding/burping techniques, GER, umbilical/inguinal hernia and disturbed sleep pattern. However no statistical significance was found for the following factors, illness in pregnancy, nutritional status, mode of delivery, educational status, maternal pulses intake, socioeconomic status of family, parental age, birth weight & gestational and stool frequency. Conclusion: Reducing the maternal stress during pregnancy, educating the first time mother about handling of infant may be helpful in reducing colic in infants.

N2  - Background: Insomnia is symptomatic of most psychiatric disorders. Non-habit-forming agents such as trazodone and quetiapine are commonly used off-label to treat patients with insomnia. The safety and efficacy of trazodone and quetiapine as medications for treatment of insomnia have never been directly contrasted. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of trazodone to quetiapine among inpatient psychiatric patients by measuring the traditional sleep parameters of total sleep time, number of nighttime awakenings, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, length of hospitalization, and patient-reported side effects. Method: Participants were recruited from St Helena Hospital Center for Behavioral Health, Vallejo, California. Patient inclusion criteria were age 18 to 65 years, admitted between September 2011 and February 2012, and a physician order for trazodone or quetiapine for insomnia. Exclusion criteria included primary insomnia, pregnancy, concomitant order of trazodone and quetiapine, receiving trazodone or quetiapine up to 2 weeks prior to the study, and inability to coherently communicate. Subjective patient interviews and objective nursing sleep log reviews composed the data set. Results: On average, mean total sleep time hours were longer among patients receiving trazodone versus those receiving quetiapine according to patients' subjective reports (7.80 vs 6.75, respectively, P < .01) and the nursing sleep logs (9.13 vs 8.68, respectively, P = .04). Patients receiving trazodone experienced fewer mean nighttime awakenings versus those receiving quetiapine (0.52 vs 0.75, respectively, P = .04) according to the nursing sleep log report. Patients receiving trazodone reported more side effects of constipation, nausea, and diarrhea than patients receiving quetiapine. Conclusions: With respect to total sleep time and nighttime awakenings, trazodone was a more effective alternative than quetiapine. However, patients receiving trazodone experienced more gastrointestinal patient-reported side effects. © 2013 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

N2  - Objective: Several etiological factors such as genetic factors, pregnancy, infections, lymphoma and head trauma have been thought to play a role in the etiology of narcolepsy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of head trauma in patients diagnosed with narcolepsy. Method: The diagnosis of narcolepsy was made at sleep laboratory of a university hospital by polysomnographic studies (PSG) and multiple sleep latency (MSLT) tests. A form was filled with patients to determine the frequency of head trauma in their medical history. Results: A total of 45 patients were included in the study. 17 patients had a history of head trauma previously. This ratio was greater than normal population and was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion: It was shown that damage occurs at hypocretin neurons after traumatic brain injury and decreased CSF hypocretin levels may cause narcolepsy. The results of this study confirm the previous findings in the literature.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:To identify depressive manifestations in adolescent mothers; to identify personal factors related to mood and eating and sleeping habits; to describe mothers' emotional relationships with their families, partners and friends. METHODS: Descriptive mainly qualitative exploratory study in 75 adolescents screened by the Edinburgh scale for depression. Socio-demographic information was processed in Excel. Twenty-one random interviews were processed in ATLAS-ti 5.0. RESULTS: Adolescents were 16.5±1.6 years old; they belonged to socioeconomic strata 1 and 2 of 6. Just over half (39) had completed between 10 and 11 of 11 grades of schooling; 29 (38.6%) did not study. Thirty-nine (52%) were single and 35 (46.6%) lived with a boyfriend. They had initiated sex at 14.9±1.1 years. Pregnancy had been planned in 16 (21.3%) cases. Girls reported physical abuse in 11 (14.5%) cases, smoking in 21 (28%) and alcohol use in 25 (33.3%). In the social context, families were reconstituted with more than one adult for sustenance and the adolescent girl was living with boyfriend's family. Pregnancy was a concern. Birth experience was generally a thankless memory. Changes described in association with pregnancy and childbirth were: limited freedom, confinement to domestic space and limitation to role of caregiver, peer estrangement and alteration in relationships with parents and family. Child rearing generated insecurity, tiredness and guilt. Depressive manifestations detected were: sleep difficulties, concerns about weight and figure, irritability, and sadness. CONCLUSIONS: Elements of depression in teenage mothers can be overt and detected by screening tests; they can also be embedded in everyday life and manifest as changes in behaviour and interpersonal relationships.

N2  - This review includes six recent and influential papers that have appeared in the three leading psychiatry journals from the Arab region. The first paper examined the role of personality profile in the motivation to quit smoking and concluded that there is a positive correlation between Novelty seeking (NS), Persistence (P), Cooperativeness (C) and motivation to quit smoking. The second study discussed the prevalence of abuse history in patients with schizophrenia whether physical or sexual, and its impact on their condition and function. The third paper reported that patients with substance abuse problem show more risky sexual behaviors than normal controls. The fourth study high-lighted the similarities regarding complaints about sleep and polysomnographic changes in depression patients and somatoform disorder patients. The fifth paper, investigated the prenatal and perinatal risk factors in autistic disorders. The sixth and final article concluded that poor levels of maternal fetal attachment during the course of pregnancy should be managed in order to optimize fetal and maternal health. Overall, the papers describe a wide spectrum of research initiatives in the Arab world that are likely to have implications for global mental health. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - In pediatrics recording of EEG can range from premature infants aged just 25 weeks of gestation to young adults. Recording EEG in pediatrics ranges from 25 weeks of gestation premature in the incubator to young adults. Hence, recording conditions need to be adapted to very different situations, not only of age but also of environment, asepsis, and behavior.This requires that recording conditions be adapted to very different situations, not only of age but also of environment, asepsis and behavior. The two major determinants of EEG features are the level of vigilance and age. Standard examination includes spontaneous sleep until the age of 5 years, and hyperventilation and intermittent light stimulation in older children. Hyperventilation may modify the tracing in a physiological way until adolescence. One of the major characteristics of a child's EEG recording is its course over time that parallels rapid brain maturation. EEG changes are particularly rapid in early age and they involve both temporal and spatial organization. In premature babies modifications appear by two 2 weeks, in infancy by 1 month and in childhood by 1 year, before reaching the adult patterns at an age varying between 8 and 12 years of age. Apart from being aware of the normal EEG patterns according to thein children of different ages, it is important to recognize unusual patterns that are not linked to a pathological situation. Most important are the interpretation and the conclusion of the EEG tracing and any conclusions reached, for which and a precise knowledge besides clinical information is mandatory for this purpose is essential. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Entering of high-tech methods used in the treatment of premature infants carries the risk of increased invasiveness which causes the pain and stress in them. The aim of this literature review is to present the achievements in the study of neonatal pain, causes and responses to it, the short-term effects on their status and their later development, as well as the ways of pain's assessment. The newborn after 26-30 weeks of gestation has functionally mature pain receptor apparatus. Numerous invasive procedures cause in the prematurely born baby psycho-physiological abnormalities (changes in heart rate, breathing, blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and behavioral abnormalities (facial expression, motion activity of the body and extremities, sleep disturbances, characteristics of crying). The last mentioned are basis for creating a rating scale for procedural and prolonged pain. Future studies are aimed at creating an universal scales. At the time of intensive treatment, the premature infant is under the adverse effects of acute or repeated pain incentives. They worsen the status, prolong the hospital stay and influence the later neurological development and outcome of the premature infant. In everyday clinical practice, prevention of pain, establishing its severity and its evaluation reduce its negative effects on the newborn.

N2  - Epilepsy is the commonest chronic neurological disorder to complicate pregnancy, having an incidence of 0.15% to 10%. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is the principal cause of death, and seizure control is the key to minimizing this risk. The aim of antenatal care is to optimize seizure control. The lowest dose of antiepileptic medication that protects against seizures should be chosen. Non-adherence to treatment may present a greater risk to the developing fetus than antiepileptic drug exposure. Adequate rest and sleep is mandatory for epileptic women. The normal anti epileptic drug regimen should be continued during labor. An elective cesarean section should be considered if there have been frequent tonic clonic or prolonged complex partial seizures towards the end of pregnancy. Breast feeding is not contraindicated. Appropriate contraceptive advice should be given. The importance of pre conceptual care in a subsequent pregnancy should be reiterated.

N2  - Background: Many learning needs arise in the early postpartum period, and it is important to examine interventions used to educate new parents about caring for their newborns during this time. Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the effects of structured postnatal education delivered to an individual or group related to infant general health or care and parent-infant relationships. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013). Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials of any structured postnatal education provided to individual parents or groups of parents within the first two months post-birth related to the health or care of an infant or parent-infant relationships. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors (JB, CTB) assessed trial quality and extracted data from published reports. Main results: Of the 27 trials (3949 mothers and 579 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) reported useable data. Educational interventions included: five on infant sleep enhancement, 12 on infant behaviour, three on general post-birth health, three on general infant care, and four on infant safety. Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported. Of the outcomes analyzed, only 13 were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses. Of these 13 meta-analyses, only four were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect. Education about sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more night-time minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours at six weeks of age (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care. However, it had no significant effect on the mean difference in minutes of crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age. Education related to infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91). Authors' conclusions: The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear. Education related to sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep but appears to have no effect on infant crying time. Education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - The role of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in pregnancy is not well studied, but an increasing body of literature appears to indicate that there may be adverse maternal and foetal health effects of the disease. OSA is associated with a twofold risk of pre-eclampsia. The small size of the existing investigations still leave unanswered questions about the consequences of OSA as it relates to some other clinically relevant outcomes such as eclampsia, stillbirth and maternal mortality. A consistent body of literature has emerged demonstrating an increased risk of insulin resistance and diabetes associated with OSA. However, among pregnant women, the association appears to be related to short sleep duration. Well-designed and adequately powered studies are needed to further delineate the role of OSA and sleep duration on pregnancy outcome and the mechanisms of those effects. © Touch medical media 2013.

N2  - Both long-term and short-term exposure to ambient air pollution have been linked with increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, few studies have examined possible associations between air pollution and gestational hypertension. Gestational hypertensive disorders area leading cause of perinatal and maternal mortality, accounting for 2-8% of all pregnancy complications. The current study will examine associations between ambient air pollution and gestational hypertension in Halifax, Nova Scotia, using a retrospective cohort design. Information on gestational hypertension will be provided by the Nova Scotia Perinatal Atlee database which includes approximately 5,000 births per year from 1988 onward. Air pollution will be assessed using land-use regression (LUR) models and regulatory monitoring data collected by the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network. LUR modeling will provide household level estimates of maternal exposure, while NAPS data will be used to assess pollution concentrations at the community level for the study period. Air pollution data will be linked to the Perinatal Database based on six-digit postal code (LUR) and date (NAPS) in order to estimate the risk of developing gestational hypertension. The results of this study will help to characterize risks associated with exposure to air pollution during pregnancy.

N2  - Epidemiological studies demonstrated initially that maternal undernutrition results in low birth weight with increased risk for long-lasting energy balance disorders. Maternal obesity and diabetes associated with high birth weight, excessive nutrition in neonates, and rapid catchup growth also increase the risk of adult-onset obesity. As stated by the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease concept, nutrient supply perturbations in the fetus or neonate result in long-term programming of individual body weight set point. Adipose tissue is a key fuel storage unit involved mainly in the maintenance of energy homeostasis. Studies in numerous animal models have demonstrated that the adipose tissue is the focus of developmental programming events in a sex- and depot-specific manner. In rodents, adipose tissue development is particularly active during the perinatal period, especially during the last week of gestation and during early postnatal life. In contrast to rodents, this process essentially takes place before birth in bigger mammals. Despite these different developmental time windows, altricial and precocial species share several mechanisms of adipose tissue programming. Offspring from malnourished dams present adipose tissue with a series of alterations: impaired glucose uptake, insulin and leptin resistance, low-grade inflammation, modified sympathetic activity with reduced noradrenergic innerva-tions, and thermogenesis. These modifications reprogram adipose tissue metabolism by changing fat distribution and composition and by enhancing adipogenesis, predisposing the offspring to fat accumulation. Subtle adipose tissue circadian rhythm changes are also observed. Inappropriate hormone levels, modified tissue sensitivity (especially glucocorticoid system), and epigenetic mechanisms are key factors for adipose tissue programming during the perinatal period. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

N2  - Study Objective: This cohort study examined the impact of maternal snoring on key delivery outcomes such as mode of delivery, infant birth centile, and small-for-gestational age. Design: Cohort study. Setting: A large tertiary medical center. Patients or Participants: Pregnant women in their third trimester were recruited between March 2007 and December 2010. Measurements and Results: Women were screened for habitual snoring, as a known marker for sleep disordered breathing. Outcome data were obtained from medical records following delivery and birth centiles were calculated. Of 1,673 women, a total of 35% reported habitual snoring (26% with pregnancy-onset snoring and 9% with chronic snoring). After adjusting for confounders, chronic snoring was associated with small-for-gestational age (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.02-2.66, P = 0.041) and elective cesarean delivery (OR 2.25, 95%CI 1.22-4.18, P = 0.008). Pregnancy-onset snoring was associated with emergency cesarean delivery (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.22-2.30, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Maternal snoring during pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse delivery outcomes including cesarean delivery and small-for-gestational age. Screening pregnant women for symptoms of SDB may provide an early opportunity to identify women at risk of poor delivery outcomes.

N2  - We report on two pregnant women who either had de novo restless legs syndrome (RLS) or had marked enhancement of preexisting RLS symptoms during pregnancy. Both patients had ferritin values <50. μg/L at baseline. The patients had relevant sleep disorders and daytime symptoms caused by RLS. The women were treated in an open paradigm with intravenous iron sucrose. A few weeks after therapy, both patients experienced a significant reduction or even remission of RLS symptoms. Their quality of life and sleep substantially improved and no treatment-related adverse effects were observed. According to our initial experience, intravenous iron sucrose administration appears to be an effective therapy in RLS patients with low ferritin values during pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction: Back pain has become a worldwide problem and excessive, repetitive rotation has been shown to cause tissue damage [1]. A sleeping posture similar to the foetal position has been suggested to limit unnecessary rotation of the lumbar spine [2]. The RophiTM Cushion attempts to improve spinal alignment and sleeping posture. This study assesses the biomechanical alignment and subjective experience of pain and comfort when using the RophiTM cushion in participants with simple mechanical lower back pain (LBP). Patients/materials and methods: Fifteen participants (aged 44±9.7 years) with simple mechanical LBP were recruited using the Red Flags screening questionnaire [3].Ten QualisysTM Oqus cameras recorded movement of the thorax and lower limbs using the six degrees of freedom CAST technique [4] and a multi-segment spine model, whilst participants lay in a semi-foetal position, pre intervention. The Pain and Comfort During Sleep Assessment was carried out Pre/Post a 1 week intervention period with the RophiTM cushion [5]. Results: Kinematic results show the main significant difference in joint angles occurred at the hip in all three planes, and between the lower lumbar region and the pelvis in the coronal plane. Subjective experienceshoweda reduction in thenumberof days with poor sleep quality and a significant reduction in frequency and intensity of lower back pain and stiffness when waking. The RophiTM Cushion received 100% positive feedback with regards to it's comfort and benefit predominantly being skewed towards “excellent comfort” and “extremely beneficial” Discussion and conclusions: Through repositioning of the hips and lower lumbar spine, overall it appears the individual is moved towards a more neutral position when using the RophiTM cushion and a 1 week intervention shows a significant improvement in lower back pain on waking. The cushion appears to allow a more sustainable sleeping posture by decreasing pressure and increasing the contact area at the knee. Has an overall distinct benefit for those suffering with simple mechanical LBP. Improvement in pain and discomfort when sleeping may have further implications for other similar groups including pregnant women with LBP.

N2  - Objetive To determine whether full-term newborn infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) present immature/ disorganised EEG patterns in the immediate neonatal period, and whether there was any relationship with maternal glycaemic control. Design and setting Cohort study with an incidental sample performed in a tertiary hospital neonatal unit. Patients 23 IDM and 22 healthy newborns born between 2010 and 2013. Interventions All underwent video-EEG recording lasting >90 min at 48-72 h of life. Main outcome measures We analysed the percentage of indeterminate sleep, transient sharp waves per hour and mature-for- gestational age EEG patterns (discontinuity, maximum duration of interburst interval (IBI), asynchrony, asymmetry, ? brushes, encoches frontales and ?/? rolandic activity). The group of IDM was divided into two subgroups according to maternal HbA1c: (1) HbA1c?6% and (2) HbA1c<6%. Results Compared with healthy newborns, IDM presented significantly higher percentage of indeterminate sleep (57% vs 25%; p<0.001), discontinuity (2.5% vs 0%; p=0.044) and ? brushes in the bursts (6% vs 3%; p=0.024); higher duration of IBI (0.3 s vs 0 s; p=0.017); fewer encoches frontales (7/h vs 35/h; p<0.001), reduced ?/? rolandic activity (3/h vs 9/ h; p<0.001); and more transient sharp waves (25/h vs 5/h; p<0.001). IDM with maternal HbA1c?6% showed greater percentage of ? brushes in the burst (14% vs 4%; p=0.007). Conclusions Full-term IDM newborns showed video- EEG features of abnormal development of brain function. Maternal HbA1c levels<6% during pregnancy could minimise the risk of cerebral dysmaturity.

N2  - The atrioventricular block is a delay or interruption of the electrical impulse from the sinusal node, to level of the auricle-ventricular nodule. This is a congenital disease affecting 1 of every 20,000-25,000 born alive. It is secondary to an abnormal embryonic development of the node AV, and proximal branches of the bundle of His, associated with structural cardiac abnormalities or without structural malformations, for maternal isoimmunization with antibodies that cause immunological irreversible damage in the fetal heart tissue, by inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. Detected by fetal Doppler or echocardiography, between 16 and 30 weeks of gestation for persistent fetal bradycardia, with congestive heart failure or fetal dropsy with mortality of 20%. Factors of worst prognosis are: Coexistence with cardiovascular malformations, heart failure, ventricular frequency below 50 per minute during sleep, bradycardia less than 30 per minute, pacemaker under or changing and long QT. Medical treatment or pacemaker in newborns and breastfed infants is indicated with cardiac insufficiency and ventricular frequency below 50 per minute. In children and asymptomatic teenagers, follow-up with monitoring and echocardiography is recommended. Because our patient did not have them, we decided only to follow him with monthly echocardiogram and Holter every six months, unless there were data of low cardiac output.

N2  - Objectives: The behavioral phenotype observed during lactation is peculiar, mainly due to the rise of two specific behaviors: maternal aggressive behavior and maternal care. Current data reported are inconsistent regarding the relationship between these behaviors. Some studies propose a direct association, while others point to an inverse correlation. Additionally, sleep disturbances and other sources of stress may affect the maternal behavior phenotype during lactation. Thus, the present study evaluated the correlation between maternal behavior and maternal aggression, in both control and sleep-restricted female rats. Methods: Eighteen 90-days old female Wistar rats were distributed into two groups: 1) Control (n = 9) - not submitted to any manipulation during pregnancy, and 2) Sleep restriction (n = 9) - submitted to sleep restriction during the entire pregnancy. At the fifth day postpartum both maternal and aggression behavior were assayed by the resident intruder paradigm. Both behaviors were correlated by means of Pearson correlation matrices, independently for control and sleep-restricted groups. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between latency to lateral attack and frequency of maternal behavior and between latency to lateral attack and duration of maternal behavior, but only in the control group. Results: The present data indicate that maternal and aggressive behavior during lactation (represented by shorter latencies to attack) oppose each other, and that maternal care levels are proportional to the time taken until the first attack by the female. Conclusion: Sleep restriction prevented the correlations observed for the control group, probably due to an increase in maternal aggression accompanied by decreased or sustained maternal care.

N2  - In March 2012, an article in The Straits Times entitled 'Freezing eggs could reverse falling birth rate' suggested that employing the latest oocyte cryopreservation techniques could both foster individual women's reproductive autonomy and impact Singapore's fertility rate, which in recent years has consistently been among the world's lowest. The article cited both local and international fertility specialists' approval of elective oocyte cryopreservation for young women wishing to protect their reproductive potential against ageing and as a potential antidote to the contemporary 'delay and defer' model of family-building. Later in 2012, the Ministry of Health announced a review of oocyte cryopreservation policy taking into account related medical, scientific and ethical issues, while the Singapore College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists endorsed oocyte cryopreservation as an "important, safe and efficient technology". This paper outlines and analyses the arguments and empirical evidence used both to support and oppose offering elective oocyte cryopreservation as a routine fertility service, before concluding that this remains unjustifiable on the basis of insufficient evidence of its clinical efficacy and safety as regards either pregnancy rates or birth outcomes. If it is to be made available at all for these reasons in Singapore, it should be subjected to rigorous clinic-specific evaluation in accordance with accepted clinical and ethical norms.

N2  - Background: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder that may severely impair sleep. According to the results of Turkish Adult Profile and Epidemiology of Sleep Study (TAPES), the prevalence for RLS was reported as 5.2% in general population, with a higher risk for women (7.3%). Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the risk of RLS and to find out its range according to the trimesters and associated demographic and medical conditions in pregnant women in a Turkish population. Local Ethics Committee approved the study and informed consents were obtained from all cases before inclusion. Patients and methods: 241 pregnant women were included and given a face-to-face interview in the present study. The demographic features; past medical history; detailed history for the past gravidities, and the current pregnancy; sleep characteristics during the current pregnancy and the presence of RLS symptoms according to the International RLS Study Group criteria were recorded on a previously structured form. Results: RLS was diagnosed in 94 out of 241 pregnant (39%). The RLS diagnosis was aforementioned in only two out of 94 RLS cases. Long pregnancy period and having an associated chronic disease showed statistical significance in RLS cases (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Discussion: In accordance with the previous reports from other populations, the present study revealed that RLS risk is remarkably high in the pregnant women, with an increasing frequency towards delivery. It also disclosed that RLS is widely underdiagnosed. Increasing awareness of health professionals may change this situation.

N2  - Background: Previous studies have suggested differences in sleep quality between preterm and term born infants, and premature infants are at higher risk for sleep-disordered breathing. Objective: We aimed to evaluate sleep problems of preterm infants and compare the results with full-term infants based on the modified Chinese version brief infant sleep questionnaire (CBISQ). Methods and materials: To validate the modified CBISQ, we collected 69 6-months old full term infants and 177 premature infants born at <37 weeks of gestation. All parents completed a modified CBISQ. First we examined the test-retest reliability of the modified CBISQ. Then, we compared the questionnaire-responses with other subjective (sleep diary) and objective (actigraphy) measures of sleep. Finally, we evaluated the validity and potential usage of the questionnaire for diagnostic purpose by comparing results to those obtained through nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). Results: Test-retest reliability of CBISQ was acceptable. The nocturnal sleep duration, number of night wakening, daytime sleep duration, time spent with mouth breathing and loud-noisy breathing had significant correlation with sleep diary, actigraphy and polysomnography. The CBISQ showed that the sleep on infants' side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall asleep, number of night wakening, daytime sleep duration, subjective consideration of sleep problem, loud-noisy breathing and time spent with crying during night were significantly different between premature infants and full term infants. Conclusion: The CBISQ is a reliable and valid tool for the measurement of sleep problems in infants. Premature infants have more sleep problems compared to term born infants.

N2  - Objective: To describe a 32 year old male with encephalopathy and drug resistant epilepsy with frequent status epilepticus. Patient and methods: The patient was born at term by normal pregnancy after prolonged labor. A significant global developmental delay had been recognized since 6 years of age. At age 5 months he experienced the first epileptic seizure during hyperpyrexia characterized by a left hemiclonic seizure during sleep followed, a few hours later, by a tonic-clonic seizure. Since then he had monthly febrile and afebrile tonic-clonic seizures, mainly arising from sleep. Despite trials of several antiepileptic drugs, seizures increased on frequency, becoming weekly. Recurrent episodes of intractable status epilepticus worsened by phenylhydantoin were also reported. At our first assessment (32 years of age) the patient underwent a comprehensive clinical, neurophysiological and neuroradiological study. Results: Neurological examination showed craniofacial dysmorphism and severe delay in language and motor acquisition. Interictal EEG showed diffuse background slowing and independent epileptiform discharges over both the temporal regions. During prolonged video- EEG monitoring we recorded one of his typical status epilepticus clinically characterized by left arm clonic seizures and secondarily generalized seizures. BrainMRI disclosed a mild cerebellar atrophywith evidence of the cerebellar sulcus. Molecular analysis of SCN1A gene identified a de novo intronic mutation, causing nucleotide substitution c.338+3A>C. Conclusions: We describe a new de-novo mutation of SCN1A gene responsible for severe early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy with recurrent status epilepticus resistant to sodium blocker AEDs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent neurological disorder which predominantly affects women. Pregnancy is one of the most common conditions leading to secondary RLS. Severe symptoms of RLS may lead to complications of pregnancy and/or labor. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of RLS in pregnant women. METHODS: Women in the third trimester of gravidity filled out a simple questionnaire based on the official diagnostic criteria for RLS. Positive responders were interviewed in order to further characterize their symptoms. Afterwards information on changes in frequency and/or intensity of the symptoms after delivery was obtained by a telephone follow-up. All data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 300 questionnaires were completed. All 94 RLS-positives met the four diagnostic criteria (31.33%). There was no difference in age, body mass index, or the number of previous pregnancies between RLS-positives and RLS-negatives, but weight gain during pregnancy was significantly higher in RLS--positives. More than 30% of positives had clinically significant symptoms, and 50% reported sleep disturbances. Almost 75% of the cases of RLS were secondary, i.e., symptoms occurred only during pregnancy (with a peak in the third trimester). More complications of pregnancy or labor occurred in women with RLS, but this was only marginally significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the relatively high prevalence of RLS in pregnant women compared with the general population. Although almost three--fourths of the symptoms were only transient throughout pregnancy, the impact of the severe symptoms and sleep deprivation on the course of pregnancy and delivery was not negligible. Early detection and adequate treatment of severe RLS are necessary to prevent maternal discomfort and possible health risks. The questionnaire method is a simple, reliable diagnostic tool. © 2013 Neuroendocrinology Letters.

N2  - Background/Purpose: During pregnancy, women with fibromyalgia (FM) often experience worsening of symptoms, which include widespread pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive difficulties, and reduced daily functioning. Although the safety and efficacy of milnacipran in FM patients has been demonstrated in large clinical trials, these studies excluded pregnant women and milnacipran safety in this population is largely unknown. Milnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor approved in the US for the management of FM. As with other drugs in this class, milnacipran is currently designated by the FDA as a Pregnancy Category C drug. As FM disproportionally affects women and, as a result, there is potential for exposure to milnacipran in women of child-bearing age, a pregnancy registry was established in October 2009. Methods: This ongoing, voluntary, prospective, observational, US-based registry employs an exposure-registration cohort design that allows for the evaluation of birth defects and other pregnancy outcomes in women ≥18 years exposed to milnacipran at any time during pregnancy. Women are followed throughout pregnancy, with their infants followed until 1 year of age. Enrollment in the Registry is initiated by the woman or by her healthcare provider. Pregnancies with evidence of birth defects prior to enrollment are considered retrospective and excluded from the primary analysis to minimize selection bias. All data are reviewed at least yearly by the Registry's Scientific Advisory Committee. Results: To date, 2 prospective subjects have enrolled in the Registry. Both gave birth to premature infants (at 32 and 35 weeks of gestation, respectively). No birth defects have been reported at this time. Enrollment is considerably lower than projected, and is far from the goal of 350 exposed pregnancies and 196 live births. Postmarketing surveillance data from 01Nov11 to 31Oct12 indicate that milnacipran was primarily prescribed to women (88.7%); however, only 21.5% of these women were 18-40 years of age (ie, women with the highest childbearing potential). Healthcare utilization data suggest that the pregnancy rate in women prescribed milnacipran may be <0.5% per year, well below the estimated general population rate of 7%. Other reasons for low enrollment may include pregnancy avoidance due to FM symptoms, the Category C classification, or lack of interest in participating in a voluntary registry. Conclusion: Possibly due to the demographics of the target population, enrollment in the Registry has been challenging. The sample size is insufficient to reach conclusions about milnacipran safety in pregnancy. However, the Registry will continue to monitor milnacipran-exposed pregnancies for teratogenicity signals or other negative pregnancy outcomes. Increasing awareness of the Registry among pregnant women who have taken milnacipran and healthcare providers remains a major focus.

N2  - Introduction: Descriptions of sleep quality in pregnancy are mainly confined to women of European descent in well-resourced populations. The aim of this study was to describe the sleep characteristics of a cohort of under-served, mainly Maori women in late pregnancy, and to identify changes in sleep up to 6 mths postpartum. Methods: We collected maternal sleep data from 200 pregnant women who were recruited for the wahakura study, a study investigating a sleep device (wahakura) used during infant-parent bedsharing. Survey data, including questions on maternal sleep quality and quantity, was collected by Maori research nurses, during pregnancy > 22 weeks gestation (baseline) and at 1, 3 and 6 months postpartum. Baseline data is described in this paper. Results: Participants' mean age was 26.1 (SD 6.32) years, 34% had no children while 19% had ≥3, 71% identified as Maori, 59.9% had a NZ Dep Score of 9-10, (10 being most deprived) and 56% were smokers at the start of pregnancy. The median reported bedtime was 21:45, with a median sleep latency of 30 min and sleep time per night of 9.0 h (IQ range 8-10). 92% reported waking at night (median: 2, IQ range: 1-3 times/night). 36% self-reported occasional and 12% regular, snoring. Sleep quality was described as very good (13%), fairly good (65%), fairly bad (19%) and very bad (3%), while sleep quantity was reported as insufficient by 41%, and as “some problem” by 46% and a “major problem” by 6%. Sleep quality was associated with sleep quantity (p = 0.001), time taken to get to sleep (p = 0.005), number of awakenings (p = 0.008) and time to get back to sleep (p = 0.04), but in this sample there was no effect on sleep quality associated with social support, number of children, maternal snoring, depression score, chaos score, smoking or marital status, stress, ethnicity or NZ Dep score. Conclusions: Self-reported sleep quality in late pregnancy in this group of mainly Maori women from an under-served population was higher than that reported for studies of non- Maori in well-resourced cohorts, however > 40% suggesting that insufficient sleep was a stress during pregnancy. There was no association with socioeconomic and lifestyle factors as reported elsewhere, perhaps because this group was relatively homogenous with respect to these factors. Future analysis will compare sleep characteristics in the change to the postpartum period.

N2  - Context: Questionnaire studies linked symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Whether this association is present when OSA is assessed objectively by polysomnography is not known. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between pregnancy, OSA, and GDM. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted observational case-control studies using polysomnography in 15 nonpregnant, nondiabetic women (NP-NGT), 15 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (P-NGT), and 15 pregnant women with GDM (P-GDM). The groups were frequency matched for age and race/ethnicity. Pregnant women were studied during the late second to early third trimester. Main Outcome Measures: Comparisons of OSA diagnosis and sleep parameters between NP-NGT and P-NGT to assess the impact of pregnancy and between P-NGT and P-GDM to explore the association between GDM and OSA were measured. Results: Compared with NP-NGT, P-NGT women had a higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (median 2.0 vs 0.5, P =.03) and more disrupted sleep as reflected by a higher wake time after sleep onset (median 66 vs 21 min, P<.01) and a higher microarousal index (median 16.4 vs 10.6, P=.01). Among the pregnant women, P-GDM had markedly lower total sleep time (median 397 vs 464 min, P =.02) and a higher AHI (median 8.2 vs 2.0, P=.05) than P-NGT women. OSA was more prevalent in P-GDM than in P-NGT women (73% vs 27%, P =.01). After adjustment for prepregnancy body mass index, the diagnosis of GDM was associated with a diagnosis of OSA [odds ratio 6.60 (95% confidence interval 1.15-37.96)]. In pregnancy, after adjusting for prepregnancy body mass index, higher microarousal index significantly associated with higher hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose levels. Higher oxygen desaturation index was associated with higher fasting glucose levels. Conclusion: Pregnancy is associated with sleep disturbances. Sleep is more disturbed in GDM than in P-NGT women. There is a strong association between GDM and OSA. Copyright © 2013 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - PURPOSE: Progesterone, a respiratory stimulant is increased six to eight fold in pregnancy. Consequently, minute ventilation is increased about 50% above baseline by term and resting PaCO2 ranges between 27 and 32 in a normal pregnancy. As hypocapnia during sleep may suppress the respiratory drive leading to the development of central apneas, we sought to investigate whether physiologic hypocapnia of pregnancy results in a higher prevalence of central apneas during sleep in pregnant women suspected of sleep apnea. METHODS: Pregnant women referred for in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) for suspicion of sleep apnea were recruited following informed consent. All polysomnograms were scored by a single experienced PSG technician. Events were scored using the 2009 American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. Controls referred for suspicion of sleep apnea and matched for age, body mass index and apnea severity based on apnea hypopnea index (AHI) severity categories were retrospectively identified using a database from the Sleep Disorders Center. RESULTS: A total of 25 pregnant patients were recruited. Mean age was 31.1 +5.8 in cases and 31.3 + 5.8 in controls, p=0.64. Mean BMI was 43.8 + 6.73 in cases compared to 44.8 + 7.3 in controls, p=0.88. There were no significant differences in age or BMI in the two groups. Mean AHI was 5.2 +7.7 in cases compared to 9.1 + 19.1 in controls, p=0.32. Mean respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 12.1 + 16.2 in cases compared to 19.1 + 24.5 in controls, p=0.16. Mean central apnea index was significantly lower in cases compared to controls (0.012 + 0.06 vs. 0.78 + 1.8, respectively, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Despite physiologic hypocapnia, pregnancy does not result in an increased susceptibility to central apnea. It is possible that the PaCO2 does not reach the apnea threshold or that the apnea threshold is shifted in pregnancy. Future studies evaluating end-tidal or transcutaneous CO2 during in laboratory PSG may help elucidate this question further.

N2  - Introduction: Recent studies have reported that maternal sleep position may be associated with increased risk of Intra Uterine Growth Restriction and stillbirth. The suggested mechanism for this is compression of the inferior vena cava (which runs down the right side) by the uterus, particularly when the mother is supine. This in turn may result in reduced blood flow to the placenta, and a concurrent reduction in oxygen to the foetus. Thus, simply asking pregnant women to sleep on their left side may assist in the prevention of negative birth outcomes. The current study aimed to investigate the practicalities of asking women in late pregnancy to sleep on their left side. Methods: Thirty women (16-25 y = 27%; 26-30 y = 47%; 31- 40 y = 27%, first baby = 70%; other children = 30%) in their third trimester participated in at-home sleep monitoring for three nights using sleep diaries and video (total nights = 90). Participants also completed a questionnaire about their typical sleep habits, and their sleep during pregnancy. A subgroup wore wrist actigraphs (n = 17). Women were instructed to sleep on their left side. Results: Left side was reported among typical sleep positions for 43%, and among sleep positions since pregnant for 93% of the sample; with 53% agreeing that sleep on their left was comfortable (neutral = 27%; disagree = 20%). Video analysis indicated that an average of 59% (SD = 17%) of time in bed was spent on the left, with 17% (SD = 15%) spent supine. Individual differences in time on the left ranged from 11% to 98%. Those who included the left side among their typical sleep positions had a significantly higher amount of reported sleep during the study (7.81 h compared to 7.14 h, F1,28.2 = 4.19, p < 0.05). Actigraph analysis (n = 17) indicated an average Total Sleep Time (TST) of 6.6 h (SD = 1.4 h), with a sleep efficiency of 80% (SD = 11%). Participants overestimated actigraphically-determined TST by an average of 44 mins (SDdiff = 92 mins). Discussion: Results suggest that for some women, sleep on the left will not be comfortable, and even when instructed to sleep on the left side, women in late pregnancy will likely still spend time supine or on their right. Given the importance of sleep during pregnancy, and the difficulties associated with obtaining sleep during this time, investigating the potential impact of maternal sleep position for the foetus, and for the sleep of the mother, is important.

N2  - Changes to maternal sleep during pregnancy are a well recognised and widely reported phenomenon. In general, the first trimester is marked by increased total sleep time, decreased sleep quality and greater daytime sleepiness. In the second trimester sleep duration returns to pre-pregnancy levels, before reducing again in the third trimester. The prevalence of symptoms associated with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, Insomnia and Restless Legs Syndrome also increase during pregnancy. Despite growing evidence of ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in sleep health in both child and adult populations, there has been little scientific attention paid to investigating inequalities sleep across pregnancy and the implications of this for the future lives of the women and their children. The E Moe, Mama: Maternal Sleep and Health in Aotearoa/New Zealand study is a questionnaire-based longitudinal study hosted by the Sleep/ Wake Research Centre (Massey University, Wellington). The cohort was designed to enable an examination of inequalities in sleep health between Maori (indigenous New Zealanders) and non-Maori women and in particular to investigate sleep changes across the perinatal period and the relationship with maternal health and mood. Cohort members (n = 1,193) completed comprehensive questionnaires about sleep health and mood between 35-37 wks gestation and at 12 wks postpartum and took part in a brief telephone interview between 4-6 wks postpartum. Retention rates were above 90% for both Maori and non- Maori across each data collection wave. Clinical data related to the participants' birth event is also linked to the cohort. This presentation will summarise evidence of ethnic differences in sleep habits (e.g. sleep duration, quality, nature and frequency of disturbances) and sleep disorders across the perinatal period, identify the factors that contribute to these disparities and consider the implications for infant sleep, health and wellbeing. It will also explore some emerging areas of inquiry and consider how the theoretical and methodological approach underlying our programme of longitudinal research can increase scientific and public understanding of the importance of sleep for mother and child health and wellbeing.

N2  - Combined, three the most serious complications of pregnancy, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and pre-term birth, affect an estimated 13-27% of all pregnancies worldwide. These complications significantly increase fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality and continue to negatively impact on the health of both the mother and child later in life. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of these serious complications, their origins remain elusive and it is still not possible to predict all pregnancies that are at risk. A variety of risk factors have been identified that pre-dispose women to the development of these complications. Sleep or sleep disturbance is one factor given little attention however, several recent studies have found an association between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) or new onset of snoring in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly pre-eclampsia. Intriguingly, mechanisms associated with SDB share many similarities with mechanisms proposed to explain the origins of pre-eclampsia, including roles for oxidative stress, hypoxia, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. It is currently unclear whether SDB contributes to the development of pre-eclampsia or is merely associated with pre-eclampsia due to shared underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of both conditions. If SDB is proven to be a risk factor for the development of pregnancy complications, particularly pre-eclampsia, it has potential to provide a novel treatment target to improve maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy pathologies.

N2  - Introduction: The importance of maternal sleep, in particular sleep position, has been inferred in previous stillbirth studies [1]. The purpose of this study was to 1) test patient recall and validate questionnaires on sleep in pregnancy, and 2) describe sleep patterns and physiology in normal late pregnancy, with particular reference to maternal position. Methods: Women in late pregnancy (35-38 weeks gestation) underwent a L3 polysomnography (PSG) home assessment with infrared video and maternal-fetal heart rate (HR) monitoring. A researcher administered a brief sleep questionnaire the next morning. Results: Data analysis has been completed on 13 participants. A complete data set (n = 30) will be presented, including fetal HR data. Unless otherwise stated, results are presented as median ± IQR. Most participants (10/13) accurately recalled position at sleep onset and, to a lesser degree, on waking (8/13). The number of times out of bed was very similar between self recall and video (mean difference 0.15 ± 1.07, range -1-3). Participants' qualitative assessment of position changes over the night corresponded to the number recorded by video. All participants had an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI; 0.25 ± 0.4/hr) and BMI (28.9 ± 5.8) within the normal range, except one with a high BMI (42.0). This participant also demonstrated risk factors for stillbirth, including supine position at sleep onset and awakening and no position changes [1], in addition to observed flow restrictions, snoring and slightly increased AHI and ODI (3.9 and 15.6, respectively). Discussion: Participants accurately recalled their position at sleep onset and at awakening, and the frequency of awakenings and position changes; these being aspects of sleep in late pregnancy deemed important by previous stillbirth studies [1]. Researchers can be confident of patient recall of these variables in late pregnancy. PSG data suggested that some women in normal pregnancy exhibit interesting responses to sleep, consistent with those previously related to stillbirth [1]. The response to these maternal observations will be presented with the full data set, including the fetal response to prolonged maternal supine position and high ODI.

N2  - In a retrospective cohort study undertaken in 12 European countries, 249 female narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (n = 216) and without cataplexy (n = 33) completed a self-administrated questionnaire regarding pregnancy and childbirth. The cohort was divided further into patients whose symptoms of narcolepsy started before or during pregnancy (308 pregnancies) and those in whom the first symptoms of narcolepsy appeared after delivery (106 pregnancies). Patients with narcolepsy during pregnancy were older during their first pregnancy (P < 0.001) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) prior to pregnancy (P < 0.01). Weight gain during pregnancy was higher in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy (P < 0.01). More patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy during pregnancy had impaired glucose metabolism and anaemia. Three patients experienced cataplexy during delivery. The rate of caesarean sections was higher in the narcolepsy-cataplexy group compared to the narcolepsy group (P < 0.05). The mean birth weight and gestational age of neonates were within the normal range and did not differ across groups. Neonatal care was affected adversely by symptoms of narcolepsy in 60.1% of those with narcolepsy during pregnancy. This study reports more obstetric complications in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy during pregnancy; however, these were not severe. This group also had a higher BMI and higher incidence of impaired glucose metabolism during pregnancy. Caesarian section was conducted more frequently in narcolepsy-cataplexy patients, despite cataplexy being a rare event during delivery. Furthermore, symptoms of narcolepsy may render care of the infant more difficult. © 2013 European Sleep Research Society.

N2  - Background and objectives: To analyze the circadian rhythm maturation of temperature, activity and sleep during the first year of life in offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM) and their relationship with fatty acid profile and obesity markers. Methods: A prospective analysis of the children of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) controlled with diet and 19 GDM with insulin). Fetal abdominal circumference was evaluated ecographycally during gestation. Blood samples from the mother during the 3rd trimester and cord blood were collected for fatty acid analyses. Skin temperature and rest-activity rhythms were monitored for 3 consecutive days in children at 3 and 6 months of age. Anthropometrical parameters of the children were evaluated during the first year of life. Results: Children from the GDM groups tended to higher fetal abdominal circumference z-score than controls at the beginning of the last trimester (p=0.077) and delivery (p=0.078). Mean skin temperature, activity and sleep were not different among the groups. However, some of the parameters that define temperature maturation and also the circadian function index (CFI) from sleep, were significantly lower at 6 months in the GDM+insulin group. Fetal abdominal circumference z-score, as a predictor of fetal adiposity, correlated negatively with the circadian/ultradian temperature rhythm (P1/Pult ratio) and CFI of sleep at 6 months (r=-0.277, p=0.037). Maternal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at both recruitment and at delivery was positive correlated with the circadian periodicity of temperature at 3 months (P1/Pult) and with sleep rhythm maturation (CFI) at 6 months (r=0.3, p=0.038). Conclusions: Fetal adiposity correlated with a worse circadian rhythm regulation in ODM while maternal DHA levels were associated with higher sleep rhythm maturation in the children. In addition, ODM insulin-treated showed a disturbed pattern of the CFI of temperature-activity at 6 months of age.

N2  - Pregnancy can be a risky endeavor in cystic fibrosis (CF) which can be further complicated by psychosocial problems. Psychosocial problems are heterogeneous and may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes, or impede effective care for CF and the pregnancy. Prenatal care should include an assessment and development of a plan to respond to psychosocial problems or identified risks. Women are more likely to suffer from depression during pregnancy and for up to one year postpartum than any other time in their lives. Additionally, patients with CF are at increased risk for depression (1,2). Depression itself is an important exposure that may directly affect pregnancy outcomes, for example through stress dependent hormones. Depression can also indirectly affect a pregnancy through changes in appetite and sleep, stress, engagement in prenatal or CF care, or through such comorbid factors as substance use. Unfortunately, depression in pregnant women is under-diagnosed and undertreated. Untreated it is correlated with low birth weight and/or prematurity. Given pregnant women with CF represent a group at increased risk for depression it is recommended identifying possible depression in clinical encounters in the CF clinics. There are multiple screening tools available for use in pregnancy (3). Examples of highly sensitive tools include the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), which was used in the International Depression/Anxiety Epidemiological Study in CF. For guidelines on the treatment of depression during pregnancy see the American College of Obstetrics & Gynecologists and the American Psychiatric Association's joint practice guidelines (4). Anxiety has been identified as even more prevalent than antenatal and postpartum depression. In the third trimester, 1 of 5 women experience an anxiety disorder, and in the first 3 months postpartum, 11% have an anxiety disorder (5). Women with CF may have additional anxieties although no data exist on rates of mood or anxiety disorders in antenatal or postpartum women with CF. Additionally, the rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in pregnant and postpartum women are higher than in the general population (6). Negative responses to depression, anxiety, and stress include increased use of alcohol, smoking and drugs; all of which may adversely impact maternal CF as well as fetal development, delivery, and parenting. These findings emphasize the need to be alert for psychiatric disorders beyond depression in pregnant and postpartum women. Providers must also consider the effects of stressful life events on pregnancy. Potential life stressors include: unstable housing; unemployment; financial issues (including significant medical expenses); household strain; intimate partner violence; and for patients with CF, health related stress. A survey of 6,421 women from the Canadian Maternity Experiences Survey found that 12% of the women experienced high levels of perceived stress and 17% reported having three or more stressful life events in the year prior to the birth of their baby (7). Stressful life events, including depression, have been linked to lowbirth weight, decreased Apgar scores, and smaller head circumference (8). Additionally, a National Institutes of Health network study found stressful life events may increase the risk of stillbirth (9). Another important topic for women's mental health in CF is that of infertility and infertility treatment. Although females have a normal reproductive tract and sexual function they may have difficulties conceiving due to anovulatory cycles from impaired health or nutrition, alterations in cervical mucus, or endocervical polyps. Infertility has many psychological implications and can elicit a variety of negative emotions including denial, anger, and grief. Additionally, assisted reproductive techniques can evoke substantial distress. Rates of depression and anxiety are high prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF). One study found that at pretreatment, 25% of women were clinically at risk for depression and 50% clinically at risk for anxiety, and women whose IVF treatment failed were at an even greater risk for depression or anxiety in the months afterward (10). Being a woman with CF further complicates this as the health risks associated with pregnancy must be reviewed before consideration of assisted reproductive technologies and may preclude it. Pregnancy does not slow down CF, it continues to evolve. It is unpleasant to think about the possibility of not being able to raise a child to adulthood, but it is a possibility that must be considered. Given the foreshortened life expectancy, pregnancy and parenthood raises many ethical questions. The impact on a partner and other family members also needs to be considered. After the pregnancy, women may have continued anxiety about the health of children exposed in utero to CF-related treatments, the potential deterioration in their own health, or the challenges of parenthood when coping with a chronic, life limiting disease. Identification and interventions for psychosocial problems in pregnant women with CF are integral to optimize health and adherence to treatments. Pregnant women with CF receivemore intense monitoring and their treatment burden increases (11). Treatment burden should also be considered as the new mom needs to care for both herself and an infant.CF professionals must educatewomen about psychosocial problems and be aware of indications for a mental health referral. Guidelines on the management of pregnancy in women with CF includes a psychosocial checklist (12). Additionally, there are standardized tools that can be incorporated into the patient's care that can improve sensitivity to identifying mothers at risk of mental illness and can promote better outcomes for both mother and infant (3).

N2  - Objective-Recently, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been reported to be associated with the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Accordingly, as this is emergent area of research that has significant clinical relevance, the objective of this meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between SDB with GDM. Research design and methods-We searched several electronic databases for all of the studies published before January 2013 and reviewed references of published articles. Meta-analytic procedures were used to estimate the unadjusted and BMI-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using a random effects model. Significant values, weighted effect sizes, and 95% CIs were calculated, and tests of homogeneity of variance were performed. Results-Results from nine independent studies with a total of 9,795 pregnant women showed that SDB was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. Women with SDB had a more than threefold increased risk of GDM, with a pooled BMI-adjusted OR 3.06 (95% CI 1.89-4.96). Conclusions-These findings demonstrate a significant association between SDB and GDMthat is evident even after considered confounding by obesity. This meta-analysis indicates a need to evaluate the role of early recognition and treatment of SDB early during pregnancy. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.

N2  - Introduction. The aim of the present analyses was to investigate the association of sleep length misperception with subjective sleep quality and objective sleep length in a large sample of women. Methods. Ambulant PSG recordings were obtained in one occasion in 400 non-pregnant women that were randomly selected from a representative sample (oversampling of snorers). The present analyses included 248 women (mean age + SD: 49.4 + 11.3 years) with complete data. Sleep length misperception was defined as total sleep time (PSG) - self-rated sleep length. Subjective sleep quality was rated on a visual analogue scale the morning after the recording. Results. The average absolute sleep length misperception was 44.8 min (SD=44.4 min). Multiple regression analyses indicated that subjective sleep quality (cubic polynomials) and objective sleep duration significantly contributed to explaining variance in sleep length misperception. Very good sleep quality was associated to a slight overestimation of sleep length, whereas low sleep quality was associated to a pronounced underestimation of sleep length. Women reporting medium sleep quality displayed a less biased sleep length estimate. Increased objective total sleep time was associated to sleep length underestimation. Similar results were obtained when adjusting for age and apnea-hypopnea index in the analyses. Conclusions. The results indicate that sleep length misperception is significantly related to perceived sleep quality for the respective night in a large sample of women. Moreover, in line with previous results we found that sleep time underestimation was increased in women with longer objective sleep duration. Future analyses will address the role of sleep characteristics, such as for instance awakenings, and psychological background variables.

N2  - Bipolar disorder presents special challenges to women of childbearing age as well as to their families and clinicians. Problems include lower fertility rates, strong genetic loading, and potential fetal teratogenic risks from medication to control the condition as well as high rates of premature mortality due largely to suicide but including also the effects of accidents, substance abuse, and general medical disorders. A common misconception is that pregnancy is protective against psychiatric symptoms. The majority of recent studies suggest that pregnancy is a period of substantial risk for recurrence with estimates of recurrence as high as 50%. Identifying and treating women prior to pregnancy might prevent negative outcomes. Illness history and reproductive safety of medications are the most important factors to consider when planning treatment. Factors associated with a higher risk of relapse during pregnancy include abrupt discontinuation of mood stabilizers, a history of four or more prior mood episodes, and prior intrapartum mood episode. Currently, a common clinical practice is to stop ongoing mood stabilizing treatment during pregnancy in order to avoid potential adverse fetal developmental effects and purported associated liability risk. However, some progress has been made lately in applying the limited information available to develop treatment guidelines for the clinical management of women with bipolar disorder during pregnancy. Women with more severe risk of relapse are recommended to continue medications. Medications used to treat BD (including valproate, carbamazepine, and lithium) are associated with increased risk of fetal anomalies and neurobehavioral abnormality. Compared with lithium, anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and valproic acid may pose even greater risks, including high rates (1%–5%) of neural-tube defects such as spina bifida as well as craniofacial anomalies, cardiac anomalies, microcephaly, and growth retardation. Despite the dearth of data, folic acid supplementation (4 mg daily) is recommended to prevent neural tube defects for patients being treated with anticonvulsants. Reproductive safety information about other, newer agents used to treat bipolar disorder remains very limited, leaving lithium as a plausible first-line option, especially during mid-to-late pregnancy. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG), in an April 2008 Practice Bulletin, recommend that the use of valproate and carbamazepine during pregnancy should be avoided, when possible, particularly during the first trimester. They further recommend that a fetal echocardiogram should be considered in women exposed to lithium during the first trimester. Atypical antipsychotics are widely used in the treatment of BD; however, there are limited data about their use during pregnancy. High potency antipsychotics could be used if needed. In the other hand, in women with low risk of relapse, medication should be tapered slowly over the course of 6 weeks. It is also important to address the consumption of caffeine, nicotine, illicit drugs, and alcohol, as well as poor nutrition and the general level of stress and sleep deprivation. In conclusion, women of reproductive age with BD should be counseled that pregnancy is a time of substantial risk of relapse, particularly following discontinuation of ongoing mood stabilizing maintenance treatment. A relapse prevention and management strategy for bipolar disorder should be outlined before the patient attempts conception.

N2  - Introduction: Though Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard measure of sleep, actigraphy is becoming more widely used due to its simplicity, ease of use and low cost. Wrist and hip actigraphy have been widely used to assess sleep and physical activity, respectively. However it is unknown whether hip actigraphy can accurately measure sleep. Methods: 70 healthy young adults (35 females, 35 males) aged 22.5 ± 0.3 years were recruited from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study. Participants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG), while also wearing actigraphs (GTX3 +) on their hip and non-dominant wrist. Measurements were obtained from PSG, wrist and hip actigraphy of: total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were assessed on an epoch-by-epoch basis. (Table Presented) Results: Compared to PSG: TST and SE were overestimated by hip actigraphy; TST and SE were similar by wrist actigraphy; SOL was underestimated on both wrist and hip actigraphy and WASO was overestimated by wrist actigraphy but underestimated by hip actigraphy (see table). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of wrist actigraphy were 91 ± 6%, 43 ± 18% and 84 ± 7% respectively and of hip actigraphy were 99 ± 3%, 13 ± 12% and 86 ± 9%. Discussion: A hip-worn GT3X + actigraph cannot be used to accurately measure sleep variables in young adults due to its very poor ability to detect wakefulness during sleep. Although wrist actigraphy is widely used in both clinical and research settings the present study shows it to have a limited capacity to detect periods of wake during sleep.

N2  - Introduction: Significant advances in neonatal care have improved survival in preterm infants. However chronic neonatal lung disease (CNLD) continues to be a significant problem. There is very limited data in literature describing the cardiorespiratory variables at 35-36 weeks of infants who are born preterm. Aim: To collect sleep pattern and normative cardiorespiratory data in preterm infants born under 31 week's gestation at corrected gestation of 35-36 weeks using a bedside limited channel polysomnography. Methods: Using an in-house polysomnography system prospective data on respiratory effort using effort bands, pulse oximetry, actigraphy and visual scoring of sleep using video camera were collected in a cohort of preterm infants under 31 weeks gestation over a 6-10 hour period continuously. We analyzed the heart rate, oxygen saturations from the data collected on the pulse oximetry channel. The respiratory effort was collected by respiratory inductance pletyshmography and data analysed using Labchart software. Significant respiratory events - the central apnoeas were scored and central apnoea index was derived. The respiratory rate was also derived using the Labchart software. We are presenting heart rate, oxyhaemoglobin saturation and respiratory rate profile on 49 preterm infants. Results: The mean heart rate with 5,95th centiles was 158 (130-186). The mean oxyhaemoglobin saturation with 5, 95th centiles was 95.3 (87.0-99.0). The respiratory rate had significant variability between awake and sleep with the range between 32-100/min. The average respiratory rate was in the 50 s for this group of infants. Cumulative frequency curves constructed with the heart rate and oxyhaemoglobin data provides us with reference ranges for this specific group of preterm infants. Conclusion: The description of reference ranges for cardiorespiratory variables has provided us with objective data in management of CNLD infants and ascertaining home oxygen requirement. The ease of administering this test at the bedside provides us with a simple feasible test that could be used in neonatal units as screening before discharge and enables us to indentify infants at risk or borderline for CNLD.

N2  - Introduction: While population-wide interventions to prevent Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) have shown success, the rates in New Zealand remain high by international comparison. The control group of a large infancy intervention to prevent excessive weight gain provided an opportunity to examine infant safety during sleep at the population level. Aims: To describe safe sleep practices related to SUDI prevention messages and establish a risk score based on best practice recommendations. Methods: Within the 4-arm trial (n = 803), 209 families did not receive any extra antenatal or postnatal education in regard to sleep, feeding and activity (control group). Participants gave information antenatally and at 3, 7, 11, 15, 19 and 23 weeks after birth and we now report data on sleep position, place of sleep, smoking, pacifier use and breastfeeding. Results: In relation to best practice recommendations, 90% of infants were sleeping in the safest position (supine) at 19 weeks, 89% were receiving 'any breastfeeding' at 2 months, 19% were using a pacifier at 19 weeks and at 3 weeks 81% were adhering to the combined recommendation of no bedsharing and no smoking during pregnancy. Room sharing in a cot or bassinette at 3 weeks was common practice (65%) and transition to sleeping in a separate room increased over time. Bed sharing was practiced in 13% of participants at 3 weeks of age, reducing by almost half at 7 weeks and remaining relatively stable up to 19 weeks of age. Published meta-analyses were used to calculate individual risk scores. The risk ratio's used were: prone or side sleeping at 19 weeks (RR = 6.91), no pacifier use at 19 weeks (RR = 1.41), no breastfeeding at 2 months (RR = 2.63), bedsharing and smoking at 3 weeks (RR = 6.27), bedsharing without smoking (RR = 1.66), and smoking without bedsharing (RR = 1.98). Total risk was determined by multiplying these risks. The distribution of the total risk ratio was calculated with a median of 1.4 and only 11.8% had a risk ratio of 1.0 (lowest possible), largely due to the low use of pacifiers, while 3.6% had a risk ratio of above 10. Discussion: The development of SUDI risk scores at the population level will be useful for monitoring the safety during sleep of infants both between populations and over time and may help to identify which of the key messages has the greatest potential impact on risk.

N2  - Aim: To evaluate the impact of moderate noise on the sleep of very early preterm infants (VPI). Methods: Observational study of 26 VPI of 26-31 weeks' gestation, with prospective measurements of sound pressure level and concomitant video records. Sound peaks were identified and classified according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) above background noise. Prechtl's arousal states during sound peaks were assessed by two observers blinded to the purpose of the study. Changes in sleep/arousal states following sound peaks were compared with spontaneous changes during randomly selected periods without sound peaks. Results: We identified 598 isolated sound peaks (5 ≤ SNR < 10 decibel slow response A (dBA), n = 518; 10 ≤ SNR < 15 dBA, n = 80) during sleep. Awakenings were observed during 33.8% (95% CI, 24-43.7%) of exposures to sound peaks of 5-10 dBA SNR and 39.7% (95% CI, 26-53.3%) of exposures to sound peaks of SNR 10-15 dBA, but only 11.7% (95% CI, 6.2-17.1%) of control periods. The proportions of awakenings following sound peaks were higher than the proportions of arousals during control periods (p < 0.005). Conclusions: Moderate acoustic changes can disrupt the sleep of VPI, and efficient sound abatement measures are needed. ©2013 Foundation Acta Pædiatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - •PTSD symptoms indirectly predicted suicidal ideation via comorbid sleep disturbances, but had no direct effect.•Polyvictimization predicted sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation independently of PTSD or major depression.•No relationships were substantively altered after adjusting for comorbid major depression. We tested if the risk of suicidal ideation in individuals with PTSD symptoms was dependent on comorbid sleep disturbance. Our cross-sectional sample included 2465 participants with complete data from the 21 year follow-up of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), a birth cohort study of young Australians. Using structural equation modelling with indirect pathways we found that 12 month PTSD symptoms did not directly predict suicidal ideation at 21 when adjusting for major depression symptoms, polyvictimization and gender. However, PTSD symptoms had an indirect effect on suicidal ideation via past-month sleep disturbance. Our results suggest that increased suicidal ideation in those with PTSD may result from the fact that PTSD sufferers often exhibit other comorbid psychiatric conditions which are themselves known to predict suicidal behaviours. Sleep disturbance may be targeted in those who experience PTSD to help prevent suicidal ideation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background and objectives: The inability to return to prepregnancy weight after delivery contributes to obesity in women. This study sought to determine pregnancy weight gain and the predictors of postpartum weight change among Ghanaian women. Methods: It involved 125 women aged 19-39 years who participated in the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements Project in the Manya and Yilo Krobo districts of Ghana. Weight was measured at recruitment (≤20 gestational weeks) and 36 gestational weeks. In addition to baseline weight and weight gain during pregnancy, data were also collected on other factors hypothesized or previously shown to be associated with weight retention, including age, parity, a proxy for socio-economic status, birth weight, energy intake, recall of activity and sleep, and breastfeeding practices. Multiple regression analysis was used to estimate factors significantly associated with maternal weight change from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Results: In all, 116 women completed the study. Mean weight gain from enrolment to 36 gestational weeks was 6.7±3.4 kg (median 6.9 kg). Between 1 and 6 months, postpartum mean weight gain was 1.0±3.6 kg (median 0.7 kg). Weight gain was higher among women who were overweight at baseline, were unmarried, or had higher socio-economic status (p<0.05). There was a tendency for obese women to gain more (p=0.08) and for exclusively or predominantly breastfeeding women to gain less (p=0.07). Conclusions: Postpartum weight retention and weight gain merit public health attention in Ghana, with special focus on women who enter pregnancy overweight or obese.

N2  - We have investigated if biological rhythms, which affect many physiological and pathological events, influence the time of birth. Two hundred and sixty-three cases who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of active labor and who delivered vaginally were enrolled in the study. Information about the age, gravidity, parity, gestational age on admission, and time of onset of labor and birth was registered. A Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was administered for determining the patients' chronotypes and dividing them into a morning- or evening-type group. While 20 (35%) of the morning-types delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h, only 11 (19%) of them delivered between 06:00 and 12:00 h. From the evening types, 6 (33%) delivered between 18:00 and 24:00 h and 3 (17%) between 06:00 and 12:00 h. We conclude that there was no statistically significant difference between the chronotypes in terms of delivery time. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
