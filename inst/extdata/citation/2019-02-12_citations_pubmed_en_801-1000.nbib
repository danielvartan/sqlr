AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases remain the first cause of death in women.
      To improve women's health cardiologists and gynaecologists should work together
      on women's specific cardiovascular risk factor. METHOD: Our study evaluated a
      care pathway named "heart, arteries and women". One hundred and ninety-one women 
      were included for vascular (n=55) or hypertensive (n=136) explorations from
      January the first to December the 31st of 2013. We studied their clinical
      presentation and medical management. RESULTS: All women were at high
      cardiovascular risk (38% of them at very high risk). The average age was 52 years
      old. A woman on three had experienced high blood pressure or diabetes during
      pregnancy. One on two was postmenopausal woman. We stopped twelve
      estrogen-progesterone contraceptions; 60% didn't have gynaecological follow-up;
      146 had high blood pressures (73% at night, 50% had no dipping blood pressure
      profile and 15 were newly diagnosed for hypertension). Sleep apnoea syndrome was 
      suspected in half women. Medical therapies were optimized especially for women
      with atheroma in which 30 to 46% were properly treated (P=0.0005). Only 18% of
      the gynecologists received conclusive reports. CONCLUSION: At one year, our care 
      pathway "heart, arteries and women" allowed to optimize medical therapy and
      clinical management. Everyone should be aware of this program.

TI  - Trajectories of maternal sleep problems before and after childbirth: a
      longitudinal population-based study.
PG  - 129
LID - 10.1186/s12884-015-0577-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep problems are common during pregnancy and in the postnatal
      period, but there is still a lack of longitudinal population-based studies
      assessing the quantity and quality of sleep in these women. The aim of the
      current study was to examine the natural development and stability of insomnia
      and short sleep duration in women from pregnancy to two years postpartum.
      METHODS: This was a longitudinal cohort study (the Akershus Birth Cohort Study)
      of 1480 healthy women, who completed three comprehensive health surveys, at week 
      32 of pregnancy, week 8 postpartum and year 2 postpartum. The survey was composed
      of the following validated questionnaires: the Bergen Insomnia Scale, the
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.
      Differences in sleep characteristics between the three assessment points were
      compared using Analyses of Variance with repeated measures, and logistic
      regression analyses were used to examine the stability of sleep variables.
      RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and eighty women completed all three surveys, 
      and the mean age at birth was 30.7 (+/-4.9). The prevalence of insomnia remained 
      stable at 60 % at the first two time periods, and remained high at 41 % at year 2
      postpartum. The mean sleep duration at the three time periods was 7 h 16 min, 6 h
      31 min, and 6 h 52 min, respectively. Concurrent maternal depression could not
      explain the stability of sleep problems from during and immediately after
      pregnancy, to sleep problems 2 years postpartum. CONCLUSION: Both insomnia and
      short sleep duration were found to be very common both before and after
      pregnancy.

AB  - Systemic maternal inflammation is implicated in preterm birth and
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and may induce morbidities including reduced
      pulmonary function, sleep-disordered breathing, and cardiovascular disorders.
      Here we test the hypothesis that antenatal maternal inflammation per se causes
      altered alveolar development and increased chemoreflex sensitivity that persists 
      beyond infancy. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
      (150 mug/kg ip) to induce maternal inflammation or saline (SHAM) at embryonic day
      16 (randomized). Pups were weighed daily. On days 7, 28, and 60 (D07, D28, and
      D60), unrestrained wholebody plethysmography quantified ventilation and
      chemoreflex responses to hypoxia (10%), hypercapnia (7%), and asphyxia (hypoxic
      hypercapnia). Lungs were harvested to quantify alveolar number, size, and septal 
      thickness. LPS pups had reduced baseline ventilation per unit bodyweight (
      approximately 40%, P < 0.001) vs. SHAM. LPS increased ventilatory responses to
      hypoxia (D07: 66% vs. 28% increase in ventilation; P < 0.001) hypercapnia (170%
      vs. 88%; P < 0.001), and asphyxia (249% vs. 154%; P < 0.001); hypersensitive
      hypoxic responsiveness persisted until D60 (P < 0.001). LPS also increased apnea 
      frequency (P < 0.01). LPS caused thicker alveolar septae (D07, P < 0.001),
      diminished alveolar number (D28, P < 0.001) vs. SHAM, but effects were minimal by
      D60. Pups delivered from mothers exposed to antenatal inflammation exhibit
      deficits in lung structure and hypersensitive responses to respiratory stimuli
      that persist beyond the newborn period. Antenatal inflammation may contribute to 
      impaired gas exchange and unstable breathing in newborn infants and adversely
      affect long-term health.

LID - 10.1111/apa.13046 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To identify and describe infant deaths presenting suddenly and unexpectedly 
      in whom there was a history of maternal methadone consumption or misuse of drugs 
      during pregnancy. METHODS: Retrospective review of neonatal postmortem
      examinations between 2004 and 2011. RESULTS: A total of 138 autopsies were
      performed in infants up to 28 days. Thirty-two cases (23%) presented suddenly and
      unexpectedly. In 12 of 32 (37.5%), in whom the cause of death remained
      unexplained after a thorough postmortem, there was a history of methadone use
      and/or other drugs of abuse during pregnancy. Their mean age at death was 11 days
      (range 1-28 days). Multiple risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome were
      present in these 12 cases: smoking (10), prematurity (7), and inappropriate
      sleeping place (8). Five mothers were positive for hepatitis C. The history was
      inconsistent with the findings in only one case. CONCLUSION: An unexpectedly high
      proportion of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly in the first month had a
      history of maternal substance misuse. All had multiple risk factors, for sudden
      infant death syndrome many avoidable. We would stress the need to emphasise the
      'Safe Sleep' message with these families at every contact with health
      professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For a small but significant group, pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain
      may become persistent. While multiple factors may contribute to disability in
      this group, previous studies have not investigated sleep impairments, body
      perception or mindfulness as potential factors associated with disability
      post-partum. OBJECTIVES: To compare women experiencing no pain post-pregnancy
      with those experiencing pregnancy-related persistent lumbopelvic pain (either
      low- or high-level disability) across multiple biopsychosocial domains. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional. METHODS: Participants completed questionnaires for thorough
      profiling of factors thought to be important in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic
      pain. Specific measures were the Urinary Distress Inventory, Medical Outcomes
      Study Sleep Scale, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia,
      Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Pain
      Catastrophising Scale, The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire and the Mindful
      Attention Awareness Scale. Women where categorised into three groups; pain free
      (n = 26), mild disability (n = 12) and moderate disability (n = 12) (based on
      Oswestry Disability Index scores). Non-parametric group comparisons were used to 
      compare groups across the profiling variables. RESULTS: Differences were
      identified for kinesiophobia (p = 0.03), body perception (p = 0.02), sleep
      quantity (p < 0.01) and sleep adequacy (p = 0.02). Generally subjects in the
      moderate disability group had more negative findings for these variables.
      CONCLUSION: Disturbances in body-perception, sleep and elevated kinesiophobia
      were found in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain subjects with moderate
      disability, factors previously linked to persistent low back pain. The
      cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for identification of
      directional pathways between factors. The results support the consideration of
      these factors in the assessment and management of pregnancy-related lumbopelvic
      pain.

TI  - Lactation Consultant Support from Late Pregnancy with an Educational Intervention
      at 4 Months of Age Delays the Introduction of Complementary Foods in a Randomized
      Controlled Trial.
PG  - 1481-90
LID - 10.3945/jn.114.202689 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the WHO recommends that complementary feeding in infants
      should begin at 6 mo of age, it often begins before this in developed countries. 
      OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether lactation consultant (LC)
      support, with educational resources given at 4-mo postpartum, can delay the
      introduction of complementary foods until around 6 mo of age. METHODS: A total of
      802 mother-infant pairs were recruited from the single maternity hospital serving
      Dunedin, New Zealand (59% response rate) and randomly assigned to the following: 
      1) usual care (control group); 2) infant sleep education intervention (Sleep); 3)
      food, activity, and breastfeeding intervention (FAB); or 4) combination (both)
      intervention (Combo). Certified LCs delivered 3 intervention sessions (late
      pregnancy and 1-wk and 4-mo postpartum). The 4-mo contact used educational
      resources focused on developmental readiness for complementary foods. Age when
      complementary foods were introduced was obtained from repeated interviews
      (monthly from 3- to 27-wk postpartum). RESULTS: A total of 49.5% and 87.2% of
      infants received complementary foods before 5 and 6 mo of age, respectively.
      There was evidence of group differences in the number of infants introduced to
      complementary foods before 5 mo (P = 0.006), with those receiving support and
      resources (FAB and Combo groups combined; 55.6%) more likely to wait until at
      least 5 mo compared with controls (control and Sleep groups combined; 43.3%) (OR:
      1.52; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.16). However, there was no evidence they were more likely
      to wait until 6 mo of age (P = 0.52). Higher maternal age, higher parity, and a
      less positive attitude toward breastfeeding were positively associated, and
      drinking alcohol during pregnancy was negatively associated, with later age of
      introduction of complementary foods. CONCLUSIONS: Providing an LC and educational
      resources at 4-mo postpartum to predominantly well-educated, mainly European,
      women can delay the introduction of complementary foods until 5 mo of age, but
      not until the WHO recommendation of 6 mo. This trial was registered at
      clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00892983.

TI  - Differential effect of intrauterine growth restriction on childhood
      neurodevelopment: a systematic review.
PG  - 1062-72
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.13435 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasingly believed to originate
      from intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Current reviews exploring the
      neurodevelopmental effects of IUGR, however, are mostly based on birthweight, an 
      inadequate proxy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the association between IUGR
      documented in utero, and neurodevelopmental outcomes during childhood. SEARCH
      STRATEGY: Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Scopus were searched for relevant studies
      published after 1970. SELECTION CRITERIA: The analysis included studies that
      identified IUGR in utero, with follow-up assessments between 1 month and 12 years
      of age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was extracted for cognitive,
      behavioural, language, motor, hearing, vision or sleep outcomes. Studies were
      summarised separately for children born at <35 and >/=35 weeks gestation. MAIN
      RESULTS: Of 28 876 titles identified, 38 were suitable for inclusion. IUGR
      children born >/=35 weeks gestation scored on average 0.5 SD lower than non-IUGR 
      children across all neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children born <35 weeks 
      of gestation scored approximately 0.7 SD lower than non-IUGR children across all 
      neurodevelopmental assessments. IUGR children with evidence of fetal circulatory 
      redistribution (preferential perfusion of the brain) had more severe
      neurodevelopmental impairments than those born IUGR alone. CONCLUSIONS: IUGR
      increases the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment during childhood
      differentially across domains. IUGR children born preterm or with evidence of
      fetal circulatory redistribution are more severely affected. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: 
      IUGR is associated with an overall risk for neurodevelopmental delay in a range
      of neurodevelopmental domains.

TI  - Does Circadian Disruption Play a Role in the Metabolic-Hormonal Link to Delayed
      Lactogenesis II?
PG  - 4

AB  - Breastfeeding improves maternal and child health. The American Academy of
      Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, with continued
      breastfeeding for at least 1 year. However, in the US, only 18.8% of infants are 
      exclusively breastfed until 6 months of age. For mothers who initiate
      breastfeeding, the early post-partum period sets the stage for sustained
      breastfeeding. Mothers who experience breastfeeding problems in the early
      post-partum period are more likely to discontinue breastfeeding within 2 weeks. A
      major risk factor for shorter breastfeeding duration is delayed lactogenesis II
      (DLII; i.e., onset of milk "coming in" more than 72 h post-partum). Recent
      studies report a metabolic-hormonal link to DLII. This is not surprising because 
      around the time of birth the mother's entire metabolism changes to direct
      nutrients to mammary glands. Circadian and metabolic systems are closely linked, 
      and our rodent studies suggest circadian clocks coordinate hormonal and metabolic
      changes to support lactation. Molecular and environmental disruption of the
      circadian system decreases a dam's ability to initiate lactation and negatively
      impacts milk production. Circadian and metabolic systems evolved to be functional
      and adaptive when lifestyles and environmental exposures were quite different
      from modern times. We now have artificial lights, longer work days, and increases
      in shift work. Disruption in the circadian system due to shift work, jet-lag,
      sleep disorders, and other modern life style choices are associated with
      metabolic disorders, obesity, and impaired reproduction. We hypothesize that DLII
      is related to disruption of the mother's circadian system. Here, we review
      literature that supports this hypothesis, and describe interventions that may
      help to increase breastfeeding success.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the independent and joint relationships of poor subjective 
      sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation among pregnant
      women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 641 pregnant women
      attending prenatal care clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal
      ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Antepartum
      subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI). Logistic regression procedures were performed to estimate odds ratios
      (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) adjusted for confounders. RESULTS:
      Overall, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in this cohort was 16.8% and poor
      subjective sleep quality was more common among women endorsing suicidal ideation 
      as compared to their counterparts who did not (47.2% vs. 24.8%, P<.001). After
      adjustment for confounders including maternal depression, poor subjective sleep
      quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of >5 vs.
      </=5) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation
      (aOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.02-2.71). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit
      increase in the global PSQI score resulted in an 18% increase in odds for
      suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (aOR=1.18; 95% CI
      1.08-1.28). Women with both poor subjective sleep quality and depression had a
      3.5-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (aOR=3.48; 95% CI 1.96-6.18) as
      compared with those who had neither risk factor. CONCLUSION: Poor subjective
      sleep quality was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation.
      Replication of these findings may promote investments in studies designed to
      examine the efficacy of sleep-focused interventions to treat pregnant women with 
      sleep disorders and suicidal ideation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to explore gestational weight gain in healthy women in relation to
      pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet and physical activity. DESIGN: a
      cross-sectional survey was conducted among 455 healthy pregnant women of all
      gestational ages receiving antenatal care from an independent midwife in the
      Netherlands. Weight gain was assessed using the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
      guidelines and classified as below, within, or above the guidelines. A
      multinomial regression analysis was performed with weight gain classifications as
      the dependent variable (within IOM-guidelines as reference). Independent
      variables were pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index, diet (broken down into consumption 
      of vegetables, fruit and fish) and physical activity (motivation to engage in
      physical activity, pre-pregnancy physical activity and decline in physical
      activity during pregnancy). Covariates were age, gestational age, parity,
      ethnicity, family income, education, perceived sleep deprivation, satisfaction
      with pre-pregnancy weight, estimated prepregnancy body mass index, smoking,
      having a weight gain goal and having received weight gain advice from the
      midwife. FINDINGS: forty-two per cent of the women surveyed gained weight within 
      the guidelines. Fourteen per cent of the women gained weight below the guidelines
      and 44 per cent gained weight above the guidelines. Weight gain within the
      guidelines, compared to both above and below the guidelines, was not associated
      with pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index nor with diet. A decline in physical activity 
      was associated with weight gain above the guidelines (OR 0.54, 95 per cent CI
      0.33-0.89). Weight gain below the guidelines was seen more often in women who
      perceived a greater sleep deprivation (OR 1.20, 95 per cent CI 1.02-1.41). Weight
      gain above the guidelines was seen less often in Caucasian women in comparison to
      non-Caucasian women (OR 0.22, 95 per cent CI 0.08-0.56) and with women who did
      not stop smoking during pregnancy (OR 0.49, 95 per cent CI 0.25-0.95). KEY
      CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: a decline in physical activity was the
      only modifiable factor in our population associated with weight gain above the
      gain recommended by the guidelines. Prevention of reduced physical activity
      during pregnancy seems a promising approach to promoting healthy weight gain.
      Interventions to promote healthy weight gain should focus on all women,
      regardless of pre-pregnancy body mass index.

TI  - Maternal obesity programs offspring non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through
      disruption of 24-h rhythms in mice.
PG  - 1339-48
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2015.85 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity increases offspring propensity to metabolic
      dysfunctions and to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may lead to 
      cirrhosis or liver cancer. The circadian clock is a transcriptional/epigenetic
      molecular machinery synchronising physiological processes to coordinate energy
      utilisation within a 24-h light/dark period. Alterations in rhythmicity have
      profound effects on metabolic pathways, which we sought to investigate in
      offspring with programmed NAFLD. METHODS: Mice were fed a standard or an
      obesogenic diet (OD), before and throughout pregnancy, and during lactation.
      Offspring were weaned onto standard or an OD at 3 weeks postpartum and housed in 
      12:12 light/dark conditions. Biochemical and histological indicators of NAFLD and
      fibrosis, analysis of canonical clock genes with methylation status and locomotor
      activity were investigated at 6 months. RESULTS: We show that maternal obesity
      interacts with an obesogenic post-weaning diet to promote the development of
      NAFLD with disruption of canonical metabolic rhythmicity gene expression in the
      liver. We demonstrate hypermethylation of BMAL-1 (brain and muscle Arnt like-1)
      and Per2 promoter regions and altered 24-h rhythmicity of hepatic
      pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators. CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate
      disordered circadian rhythms in NAFLD and suggest that disruption of this system 
      during critical developmental periods may be responsible for the onset of chronic
      liver disease in adulthood.

TI  - Sleep disorders in pregnancy and their association with pregnancy outcomes: a
      prospective observational study.
PG  - 87-93
LID - 10.1007/s11325-015-1188-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sleep disturbances such as insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, restless legs
      syndrome, habitual snoring, and excessive daytime sleepiness are frequent during 
      pregnancy, and these have been linked to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.
      METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in high-risk Indian
      pregnant women. We used modified Berlin questionnaire (MBQ), Pittsburgh sleep
      quality index (PSQI), International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group 2011
      criteria, and Epworth sleepiness scale to diagnose various sleep disorders, such 
      as symptomatic OSA, poor sleep quality and insomnia, RLS, and excessive daytime
      sleepiness, respectively, in successive trimesters of pregnancy. Outcome
      variables of interest were development of gestational hypertension (GH),
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and cesarean delivery (CS); the Apgar
      scores; and low birth weight (LBW). The relationship between sleep disorders and 
      outcomes was explored using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Outcome data
      were obtained in 209 deliveries. As compared to nonsnorers, women who reported
      snoring once, twice, and thrice or more had odds ratios for developing GH-4.0 (95
      % CI 1.3-11.9), 1.5 (95 % CI 0.5-4.5), and 2.9 (95 % CI 1.0-8.2) and for
      undergoing CS-5.3 (95 % CI 1.7-16.3), 4.9 (95 % CI 1.8-13.1), and 5.1 (95 % CI
      1.9-14.9), respectively. Pregnant women who were persistently positive on MBQ had
      increased odds for GH and CS. CONCLUSIONS: Snoring and high-risk MBQ in pregnant 
      women are strong risk factors for GH and CS. In view of the significant morbidity
      and health care costs, simple screening of pregnant women with questionnaires
      such as MBQ may have clinical utility.

TI  - Circadian clock regulation of melatonin MTNR1B receptor expression in human
      myometrial smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 662-71
LID - 10.1093/molehr/gav023 [doi]
AB  - Circadian genes are expressed in virtually all cells and tissues, and circadian
      rhythms influence many bodily processes, including reproductive physiology. The
      expression of hMTNR1B is suppressed during pregnancy until late in term (much
      like the oxytocin receptor), at which time it is up-regulated to allow for the
      nocturnal melatonin/oxytocin synergy, which promotes strong nocturnal
      contractions. Little is currently known about the regulation of hMNTR1b, nor
      about its functional significance in the myometrium. We, therefore, aimed to
      elucidate some of the transcription factors that regulate hMNTR1b gene expression
      in the human myometrium and to determine if hMNTR1b is under circadian control.
      In this study, we used immortalized and primary myometrial cells that were
      assessed for circadian gene expression rhythms using real-time bioluminometry and
      quantitative PCR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation examined the binding of the clock
      gene product brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator
      (ARNT)-like protein 1 (BMAL1) to the promoter of the hMTNR1B gene. Overexpression
      studies tested the role of circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and
      its partner BMAL1 in regulating hMTNR1B expression. We confirmed circadian clock 
      gene expression in both immortalized human myometrial cells and primary
      myometrial cell cultures. We further showed that the hBMAL1 protein binds to an
      E-box motif in the proximal promoter of the hMTNR1B gene. Overexpression studies 
      demonstrated that the BMAL1/CLOCK complex activates expression of hMTNR1B leading
      to a circadian rhythm in phase with the E-box driven clock gene hPER2 (Period 2).
      These results indicate, for the first time, the presence of a functional
      circadian clock in the human myometrium with the hMTNR1B gene as a clock
      controlled target. Further investigations could open new vistas for understanding
      the regulation of uterine contractions and the timing of human labor.

AB  - We analyzed the association of sleep quality and glucose metabolism in women
      after gestational diabetes (pGDM) and in women after normoglycemic pregnancy
      (controls). Data during pregnancy and a visit within the first 15 months after
      delivery were collected from 61 pGDM and 30 controls in a prospective cohort
      study. This included a medical history, physical examination, questionnaires
      (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), and
      5-point oral glucose tolerance test with insulin measurements to determine
      indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. We used Spearman
      correlation coefficients and multivariate regression models for analysis.9.3 +/- 
      3.2 months after delivery, pGDM had significantly higher fasting and 2 h glucose 
      levels and lower insulin sensitivity than controls. There was no significant
      difference in age, BMI and sleep quality as assessed with the PSQI between the
      two groups. The PSQI score correlated with the ogtt-2 h plasma glucose in pGDM
      (delta = 0.41; p = 0.0012), but not in controls. This association was confirmed
      with a multivariate linear regression model with adjustment for age, BMI and
      months post-delivery. Perceived stress was an independent risk factor (OR 1.12;
      95% CI 1.02-1.23) for impaired sleep. Our findings suggest that post-delivery
      sleep quality significantly influences glucose tolerance in women after GDM and
      that impaired sleep is associated with increased stress perception. Measures to
      improve of sleep quality and reduce perceived stress should therefore be tested
      as additional strategies to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes after GDM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, upper airway resistance is increased, predisposing 
      vulnerable women to pregnancy-related OSA. Elevation of the upper body increases 
      upper airway cross-sectional area (CSA) and improves severity of OSA in a
      subgroup of nonpregnant patients (positional-dependent sleep apnea). We tested
      the hypothesis that elevated position of the upper body improves OSA early after 
      delivery. METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, we conducted a 
      randomized, crossover study on two postpartum units of Massachusetts General
      Hospital. Women during the first 48 h after delivery were included.
      Polysomnography was performed in nonelevated and 45 degrees elevated upper body
      position. Upper airway CSA was measured by acoustic pharyngometry in nonelevated,
      45 degrees elevated, and sitting body position. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were
      enrolled, and measurements of airway CSA obtained. Thirty patients completed
      polysomnography in both body positions. Elevation of the upper body significantly
      reduced apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from 7.7 +/- 2.2/h in nonelevated to 4.5 +/-
      1.4/h in 45 degrees elevated upper body position (P = .031) during sleep.
      Moderate to severe OSA (AHI > 15/h) was diagnosed in 20% of postpartum patients
      and successfully treated by elevated body position in one-half of them. Total
      sleep time and sleep architecture were not affected by upper body elevation.
      Change from nonelevated to sitting position increased inspiratory upper airway
      CSA from 1.35 +/- 0.1 cm2 to 1.54 +/- 0.1 cm2 during wakefulness.
      Position-dependent increase in CSA and decrease in AHI were correlated (r = 0.42,
      P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: Among early postpartum women, 45 degrees upper body
      elevation increased upper airway CSA and mitigated sleep apnea. Elevated body
      position might improve respiratory safety in women early after delivery. TRIAL

AB  - Fetal behavioral states are defined by fetal movement and heart rate variability 
      (HRV). At 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) the distinction of four fetal
      behavioral states represented by combinations of quiet or active sleep or
      awakeness is possible. Prior to 32 weeks, only periods of fetal activity and
      quiesence can be distinguished. The increasing synchronization of fetal movement 
      and HRV reflects the development of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) control.
      Fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) detects fetal heart activity at high temporal
      resolution, enabling the calculation of HRV parameters. This study combined the
      criteria of fetal movement with the HRV analysis to complete the criteria for
      fetal state detection. HRV parameters were calculated including the standard
      deviation of the normal-to-normal R-R interval (SDNN), the mean square of
      successive differences of the R-R intervals (RMSSD, SDNN/RMSSD ratio, and
      permutation entropy (PE) to gain information about the developing influence of
      the ANS within each fetal state. In this study, 55 magnetocardiograms from
      healthy fetuses of 24-41 weeks' GA were recorded for up to 45 min using a fetal
      biomagnetometer. Fetal states were classified based on HRV and movement
      detection. HRV parameters were calculated for each state. Before GA 32 weeks,
      58.4% quiescence and 41.6% activity cycles were observed. Later, 24% quiet sleep 
      state (1F), 65.4% active sleep state (2F), and 10.6% active awake state (4F) were
      observed. SDNN increased over gestation. Changes of HRV parameters between the
      fetal behavioral states, especially between 1F and 4F, were statistically
      significant. Increasing fetal activity was confirmed by a decrease in PE
      complexity measures. The fHRV parameters support the differentiation between
      states and indicate the development of autonomous nervous control of heart rate
      function.

AB  - During fetal development, different control systems mediated by the autonomic
      nervous system form functional connections over a wide range of time scales.
      Using multiscale multifractal analysis (MMA) of fetal heart rate variability
      (HRV), we describe fundamental relationships in the developing scale-wide
      adjustments within fetal behavior states as well as across state changes. MMA
      yields the local Hurst exponent surface h(q,s) with q as the multifractal
      parameter and s as the scale. In 30-minute recordings of healthy fetuses between 
      24 and 36weeks of gestation (n=25 in quiet sleep, n=29 in active sleep, n=30
      changing sleep state) we investigated the dependency of h(q,s) on gestation age. 
      In univariate models, we found a decreasing persistence for short scales and
      small amplitudes in the quiet (s1=39, q1=-0.7, R(2)=0.52) and in the active
      (s1=69, q1=-1.4, R(2)=0.23) sleep in contrast to an increasing persistency for
      long scales and large amplitudes (s1=147, q1=2.4, R(2)=0.29) in the mixed state. 
      Bivariate models (additional scales considered) presented increased coefficients 
      of determination R(2)=0.56, 0.4, and 0.43, respectively. Persistency increasing
      with age in connection with the sleep state changes (independent of the age
      related short range dependencies within the separate homogeneous sleep states) is
      reported here for the first time. The MMA indices obtained for the fetal HRV
      represent characteristics of the maturating scale-wide cardiovascular control in 
      the context of the evolving sleep state dynamics, which have so far not been
      considered. They should be incorporated in the search for HRV indices for
      prenatal diagnosis of developmental disorders and risk assessment.

AB  - Extensive research defines the impact of advanced maternal age on couples'
      fecundity and reproductive outcomes, but significantly less research has been
      focused on understanding the impact of advanced paternal age. Yet it is
      increasingly common for couples at advanced ages to conceive children. Limited
      research suggests that the importance of paternal age is significantly less than 
      that of maternal age, but advanced age of the father is implicated in a variety
      of conditions affecting the offspring. This review examines three aspects of
      advanced paternal age: the potential problems with conception and pregnancy that 
      couples with advanced paternal age may encounter, the concept of discussing a
      limit to paternal age in a clinical setting, and the risks of diseases associated
      with advanced paternal age. As paternal age increases, it presents no absolute
      barrier to conception, but it does present greater risks and complications. The
      current body of knowledge does not justify dissuading older men from trying to
      initiate a pregnancy, but the medical community must do a better job of
      communicating to couples the current understanding of the risks of conception

TI  - Adherence to physical activity guidelines in mid-pregnancy does not reduce
      sedentary time: an observational study.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s12966-015-0191-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) interventions designed to prevent prenatal
      complications have focused on increasing moderate PA yielding conflicting
      results. Minimal attention has focused on the evaluation of sleep, sedentary
      behavior (SB), light activity or total daily PA during pregnancy. The purpose of 
      this prospective, longitudinal study was to 1) objectively quantify and compare
      habitual PA and SB during the 2nd and 3rd trimester; and 2) evaluate differences 
      in activity patterns for women meeting prenatal PA guidelines versus those that
      did not. METHODS: Forty-six participants wore 2 PA monitors (SenseWear Mini and
      activPAL) during week 18 and week 35 of pregnancy. We compared differences in
      sleep duration, postural allocation, daily steps, and PA between the 2nd and 3rd 
      trimester and for women who met and did not meet PA guidelines. RESULTS: During
      the 2(nd) trimester, 30% of the women's day (24-hours) was total sleep; 52% SB;
      13% light; 3% moderate; and 0% vigorous PA. Light (P = 0.05), vigorous (P =
      0.02), and moderate-vigorous PA (MET-minutes; P = 0.02), decreased with a trend
      in increased SB (P = 0.07). Activity of other intensities and sleep duration did 
      not significantly change. Only 39% and 37% of participants slept between 7-9
      hours/night at week 18 and 35, respectively. Forty-six percent (n = 21) and 28%
      (n = 13) of participants met prenatal PA guidelines during the 2(nd) and 3(rd)
      trimester, respectively. At week 18, no differences in total sleep, SB, or light 
      PA existed for women who met PA guidelines versus those who did not; total PA was
      significantly greater for women who met guidelines. At week 35, women that met PA
      guidelines had significantly less SB (P < 0.005) than women who did not.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that pregnant women spend the majority of
      their day in SB. Significant reductions in total activity across pregnancy may be
      attributed, in part to shifts in light PA and increased SB. Based on the
      lifestyle of our sample, regardless of meeting PA guidelines in mid-pregnancy, no
      significant difference exists in time spent in SB, however meeting PA
      recommendations in late pregnancy may reduce SB. Future interventions should
      target reducing SB by increasing light and moderate PA beyond volitional
      exercise.

TI  - Sleep Quality Improves During Treatment With Bryophyllum pinnatum: An
      Observational Study on Cancer Patients.
PG  - 452-9
LID - 10.1177/1534735415580680 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Cancer patients frequently suffer from poor sleep quality.
      Bryophyllum pinnatum is a herbal medication used in anthroposophic medicine,
      which has been shown to be associated with improvements in sleep quality during
      pregnancy with only few and minor or moderate side-effects reported. In this
      study, the sleep quality of cancer patients during treatment with B pinnatum was 
      investigated. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective, observational study, cancer
      patients suffering from sleep problems were treated with B pinnatum (350 mg
      tablets, corresponding to 50% of leaf pressed juice [Weleda AG, Arlesheim,
      Switzerland], dosage at physician's consideration, but most frequently 2 tablets 
      with evening meal and 2 before going to bed). METHODS: Sleep quality (Pittsburgh 
      Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), daily sleepiness (Epworth Sleeping Scale [ESS]), and
      fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) were assessed at the beginning of the
      treatment and after 3 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the
      patients during the treatment were recorded. From the 28 recruited patients, 20
      completed both questionnaires and were considered in the present analysis. Data
      are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. RESULTS: Patients were 61 +/- 10.4 
      years old and the majority were female (17 out of 20). During treatment with B
      pinnatum, the PSQI decreased from 12.2 +/- 3.62 to 9.1 +/- 3.61 (P < .01), and
      ESS changed from 8.4 +/- 3.18 to 7.1 +/- 3.98 (P < .05). There was no change in
      FSS. The treatment was well tolerated by the majority of patients, with only 6
      patients reporting discomfort that might have been caused by B pinnatum (fatigue 
      n = 3, dry throat n = 1, agitation n = 1, difficult digestion n = 1). No serious 
      adverse drug reactions were detected. CONCLUSION: B pinnatum may be a suitable
      treatment for sleep problems of cancer patients. Controlled, randomized clinical 
      trials of the use of B pinnatum in sleep disorders are urgently needed.

TI  - Behavioural effects of fetal antidepressant exposure in a Norwegian cohort of
      discordant siblings.
PG  - 1397-407
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyv030 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Potential adverse effects of prenatal antidepressant exposure on child
      development are still debated. The possibility that associations are due to
      genetic or familial environmental risk factors rather than antidepressant use per
      se cannot easily be ruled out in conventional studies. Our objective was
      therefore to evaluate the association between prenatal antidepressant exposure
      and behavioural problems in a sibling controlled study. METHOD: This study used
      data on 20 180 siblings identified from the population-based Norwegian Mother and
      Child Cohort Study recruited between 1999 and 2008. The mothers were asked to
      report antidepressant use at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and 6 months
      post-partum. Child Behavioral Checklist syndrome scales were used to assess
      externalizing and internalizing behavioural problems by questionnaires sent to
      mothers at 18 and 36 months postpartum. We performed unmatched and matched
      sibling analyses using both random- and fixed-effects linear models,
      respectively, to determine potential behavioural effects of antidepressant
      exposure. RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to antidepressants was associated with
      increased levels of anxiety symptoms in 3 year old children after adjusting for
      maternal familial effects and confounding by indication (i.e. maternal
      depression). Effect of prenatal exposure to antidepressants was specific to
      anxiety, and not associated with emotional reactivity, somatic complaints, sleep 
      problems, attention problems or aggression. CONCLUSION: Using a sibling design,
      we showed that prenatal antidepressant use was specifically associated with
      increased anxiety symptoms after adjusting for maternal familial factors and
      confounding by indication.

TI  - Later emotional and behavioral problems associated with sleep problems in
      toddlers: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 575-82
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0187 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Childhood sleep problems have been linked to a range of adverse
      health outcomes, but there is limited knowledge as to the temporal association
      between sleep problems and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems in young 
      children. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether sleep problems in toddlers aged 18 months
      are related to both concurrent and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems
      in preschool children aged 5 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A large
      population-based longitudinal study was conducted in September 2014 using data
      from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted at the Norwegian
      Institute of Public Health from June 1, 1999, to December 31, 2008. A total of
      32662 children or pregnancies were included. EXPOSURES: Sleep was assessed by
      mother-reported child sleep duration and nocturnal awakenings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: Emotional and behavioral problems were measured with items from the
      Child Behavior Checklist and operationalized according to recommended clinical
      cutoffs, corresponding to T scores of greater than 65 (93rd percentile). Risk
      ratios (RRs) were calculated using negative binomial regression, controlling for 
      emotional and behavioral problems at 18 months and other relevant covariates.
      RESULTS: Short sleep duration (</=10 hours) in 556 children (1.7%) and frequent
      nocturnal awakenings (>/=3 times) in 1033 children (3.2%) at 18 months
      significantly predicted both concurrent and later incidence of emotional and
      behavioral problems at 5 years. The longitudinal RRs were generally larger for
      internalizing problems, with adjusted RRs of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.23-2.08) for both
      short sleep duration and 1.57 (95% CI, 1.28-1.93) for nocturnal awakenings; RRs
      for externalizing problems were 1.77 (95% CI, 1.37-2.30) and 1.25 (95% CI,
      1.00-1.58), respectively. Additional adjustment for emotional and behavioral
      problems at 18 months slightly reduced the strength of these associations, and
      all RRs remained significant in the fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: Early sleep problems predict later development of emotional and
      behavioral problems. Intervention studies are needed to examine whether sleep
      programs targeting early childhood may avert the onset of later adverse outcomes.

TI  - Impact of maternal melatonin suppression on forced swim and tail suspension
      behavioral despair tests in adult offspring.
PG  - 202-6
AB  - Melatonin is an essential hormone, which regulates circadian rhythms and has
      antioxidative and anticarcinogenic effects. As melatonin secretion is suppressed 
      by light, this effect was examined on the offspring of the Wistar rat females
      exposed to continuous light (500 lux) during the second half of the pregnancy
      (day 12 to 21). Control rats were kept under a 12:12 light-dark cycle. The
      resulted male offspring have been behaviorally assessed for depression after
      postnatal day 60 by using Forced Swim Test (FST) and Tail Suspension Test (TST). 
      Animals resulted from the melatonin deprived pregnancies have developed an
      abnormal response in the TST, but a normal FST behavior. Also, TST active
      movement was different in the melatonin suppression group compared to the control
      group. These findings suggest that intrauterine melatonin deprivation might be
      linked to the depressive like behavior in adult male offspring.

TI  - Psychometric Properties of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in a Cohort 
      of Peruvian Pregnant Women.
PG  - 869-77
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.4936 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor
      structure of the Spanish-language version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI) among pregnant Peruvian women. METHODS: A cohort of 642 women were
      interviewed at </= 16 weeks of gestation. During interview, we ascertained
      information about lifestyles, demographics, sleep characteristics, and mood
      symptoms. Stress induced sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety
      symptoms were evaluated using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test (FIRST), 
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7
      (GAD-7) assessment scales, respectively. Consistency indices, exploratory and
      confirmatory factor analyses, correlations, and logistic regressions were used.
      RESULTS: Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated a
      three-factor solution: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and sleep medication. We 
      observed significantly positive correlations of the PSQI with the FIRST (0.42),
      the PHQ-9 (0.49), and the GAD-7 (0.46). Poor sleepers (PSQI global score > 5) had
      significantly increased odds of experiencing stress-induced sleep disturbance
      (odds ratio, OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.40, 5.31), depression (OR = 5.48; 95% CI: 3.58,
      8.37), and generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 4.57; 95% CI: 3.08, 6.76).
      CONCLUSION: The Spanish-language version of the PSQI instrument was found to have
      good construct validity among pregnant Peruvian women. Consistent with some other
      studies, the PSQI was found to have a three-factor structure. Further assessment 
      and validation studies are needed to determine whether the three, factor-specific
      scoring of the PSQI is favored over the PSQI global score in diverse populations.

TI  - Poor Sleep Quality and Associated Inflammation Predict Preterm Birth: Heightened 
      Risk among African Americans.
PG  - 1259-67
LID - 10.5665/sleep.4904 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Poor sleep promotes inflammation. In turn, inflammation is a
      causal mechanism in term as well as preterm parturition. In the United States, a 
      persistent racial disparity in preterm birth exists, with African Americans
      showing approximately 1.5 times greater risk. This study examined associations
      among sleep quality, serum proinflammatory cytokines, and length of gestation in 
      a racially diverse sample of 138 pregnant women. DESIGN: Observational.
      MEASUREMENTS: Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and other
      psychosocial and behavioral measures during midpregnancy. Serum levels of
      interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were
      determined by high-sensitivity assays. Birth outcomes were determined via medical
      record review. RESULTS: Among African American women (n = 79), shorter gestation 
      was predicted by poorer overall sleep (rs = -0.35, P = 0.002) as well the
      following PSQI subscales: subjective sleep quality (rs = -0.34, P = 0.002), sleep
      latency (rs = -0.27, P = 0.02), and sleep efficiency (rs = -0.27, P = 0.02).
      African American women with poor sleep quality (PSQI > 5) had 10.2 times the odds
      of preterm birth compared to those with good sleep quality. In contrast, among
      European American women (n = 53), gestational length was not significantly
      predicted by sleep quality (Ps > 0.12). Bootstrapping analyses showed that, among
      African Americans, IL-8 significantly mediated the association between sleep
      quality and length of gestation (indirect effect estimate -0.029; 95% confidence 
      interval -0.06, -0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The data provide novel evidence that
      African American women exhibit greater inflammation in response to sleep
      disturbance than European American women and these effects correspond with length
      of gestation. Racial differences in susceptibility to sleep induced immune
      dysregulation may contribute to marked racial disparities in preterm birth.

TI  - Trajectories of Sleep Quality and Associations with Mood during the Perinatal
      Period.
PG  - 1237-45
LID - 10.5665/sleep.4900 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate trajectories of sleep quality
      and associations with mood in the perinatal period. Although it is commonly
      accepted that subjective sleep quality declines during pregnancy and the
      transition to parenthood, some women may follow qualitatively distinct
      trajectories. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Sleep quality was assessed by
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected from 293 women at 
      four time points: during early pregnancy, at Time 1 (T1; < 22 w gestational age
      [GA]; late pregnancy, at Time 2 (T2; 32 w GA); during the postnatal period at
      Time 3 (T3; 3 mo postpartum); and Time 4 (T4; 6 mo postpartum). A group-based
      semiparametric mixture model was used to estimate patterns of sleep quality
      throughout the perinatal period. RESULTS: Four trajectory groups were identified,
      including patterns defined by high sleep quality throughout (21.5%), mild
      decrease in sleep quality (59.5%), significant decrease in sleep quality (12.3%) 
      and a group with poor sleep quality throughout (6.7%). Women who had the worst
      sleep quality at Time 1 and those who experienced significant increases in sleep 
      problems throughout pregnancy were also the groups who reported the highest
      levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in early pregnancy and the lowest
      levels of social support. After controlling for covariates, the groups with worst
      subjective sleep quality during pregnancy were also the most likely to experience
      high symptoms of depression in the postpartum period. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the
      women in our sample reported mild sleep disturbances through the perinatal
      period. A subgroup of women reported a significant decline in sleep quality from 
      early to late pregnancy and another reported poor subjective sleep quality
      throughout pregnancy; these groups had the greatest risk of experiencing high
      symptoms of depression in the postpartum period.

AB  - Pregnancy is a period influenced by the interaction of several factors, therefore
      this study aimed to identify changes in lifestyles due to pregnancy and
      childbirth in Portuguese and immigrant women in Portugal. This is a qualitative
      study, using the semi-structured interview, with eighty-two Portuguese and
      immigrant women. Content analysis was used, with verbatim classification
      supported by Nvivo 10. It was authorized by an Ethics Commission. Results
      revealed that the primary changes in lifestyles due to pregnancy were in eating
      habits (nutrition), daily activity, exposure to danger, sleep and rest patterns, 
      social and family relationships, going out, self-care, work, clothing and
      footwear, travel, health monitoring and sexual activity and substances
      consumption. The main change after the birth, manifested by these women, was that
      their lives began to revolve around their baby.

      maternal sleep deprivation-induced cognitive impairment.
PG  - 9513
LID - 10.1038/srep09513 [doi]
AB  - Despite the potential adverse effects of maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) on
      physiological and behavioral aspects of offspring, the mechanisms remain poorly
      understood. The present study was intended to investigate the roles of microglia 
      on neurodevelopment and cognition in young offspring rats with prenatal sleep
      deprivation. Pregnant Wistar rats received 72 h sleep deprivation in the last
      trimester of gestation, and their prepuberty male offspring were given the
      intraperitoneal injection with or without minocycline. The results showed the
      number of Iba1(+) microglia increased, that of hippocampal neurogenesis
      decreased, and the hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were
      impaired in MSD offspring. The classical microglial activation markers (M1
      phenotype) IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, CD68 and iNOS were increased, while the
      alternative microglial activation markers (M2 phenotype) Arg1, Ym1, IL-4, IL-10
      and CD206 were reduced in hippocampus of MSD offspring. After minocycline
      administration, the MSD offspring showed improvement in MWM behaviors and
      increase in BrdU(+)/DCX(+) cells. Minocycline reduced Iba1(+) cells, suppressed
      the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, and reversed the reduction of M2
      microglial markers in the MSD prepuberty offspring. These results indicate that
      dysregulation in microglial pro- and anti-inflammatory activation is involved in 
      MSD-induced inhibition of neurogenesis and impairment of spatial learning and
      memory.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common complication of childbearing with 
      a 13% prevalence rate. Sleep disturbances are also common, particularly during
      early postpartum. In theory, l-tryptophan could improve sleep and reduce
      depressed mood in early postpartum; however, the first step in clinical
      development of tryptophan for use in postpartum is to measure the effect of oral 
      l-tryptophan on its concentrations in breast milk, which is presently unknown.
      The aims were to investigate the effect of oral l-tryptophan and
      alpha-lactalbumin, a protein with high tryptophan concentration, on total and
      free tryptophan levels in breast milk and plasma, and to compare free tryptophan 
      levels in breast milk with those in common infant formulas. Thirty healthy
      breastfeeding women were randomly allocated to receive 2g or 4g of l-tryptophan, 
      or, 20g or 40g of alpha-lactalbumin or no supplement. Free tryptophan levels were
      also measured in 12 different infant formulas. Total tryptophan in breast milk
      was unaffected by oral administration of l-tryptophan or alpha-lactalbumin
      (repeated measures of ANOVA (rANOVA), group effect: p=0.93). Both l-tryptophan
      and alpha-lactalbumin were associated with greater free tryptophan levels in
      breast milk (rANOVA, group effect: p<0.001) (representing 2% of total
      tryptophan), but these concentrations were within the range of commonly used
      infant formulas. In contrast to most sleep inducing medications, l-tryptophan
      does not affect its total concentration in breast milk. These results support
      further investigation of dietary l-tryptophan and alpha-lactalbumin as part of a 
      dietary supplementation approach to address sleep disturbances in postpartum and 
      reduce risk of PPD.

      Pregnancy.
PG  - 825802
LID - 10.1155/2015/825802 [doi]
AB  - Pregnancy is a complex and well-regulated temporal event in which several steps
      are finely orchestrated including implantation, decidualization, placentation,
      and partum and any temporary alteration has serious effects on fetal and maternal
      health. Interestingly, alterations of circadian rhythms (i.e., shiftwork) have
      been correlated with increased risk of preterm delivery, intrauterine growth
      restriction, and preeclampsia. In the last few years evidence is accumulating
      that the placenta may have a functional circadian system and express the clock
      genes Bmal1, Per1-2, and Clock. On the other hand, there is evidence that the
      human placenta synthesizes melatonin, hormone involved in the regulation of the
      circadian system in other tissues. Moreover, is unknown the role of this local
      production of melatonin and whether this production have a circadian pattern.
      Available information indicates that melatonin induces in placenta the expression
      of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, prevents the injury
      produced by oxidative stress, and inhibits the expression of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) a gene that in other tissues is controlled by clock genes.
      In this review we aim to analyze available information regarding clock genes and 
      clock genes controlled genes such as VEGF and the possible role of melatonin
      synthesis in the placenta.

TI  - Epigenomic profiling in visceral white adipose tissue of offspring of mice
      exposed to late gestational sleep fragmentation.
PG  - 1135-42
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2015.38 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep fragmentation during late gestation (LG-SF) is one of the major
      perturbations associated with sleep apnea and other sleep disorders during
      pregnancy. We have previously shown that LG-SF induces metabolic dysfunction in
      offspring mice during adulthood. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of late
      LG-SF on metabolic homeostasis in offspring and to determine the effects of LG-SF
      on the epigenome of visceral white adipose tissue (VWAT) in the offspring.
      METHODS: Time-pregnant mice were exposed to LG-SF or sleep control during LG
      (LG-SC) conditions during the last 6 days of gestation. At 24 weeks of age, lipid
      profiles and metabolic parameters were assessed in the offspring. We performed
      large-scale DNA methylation analyses using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
      (MeDIP) coupled with microarrays (MeDIP-chip) in VWAT of 24-week-old LG-SF and
      LG-SC offspring (n=8 mice per group). Univariate multiple-testing adjusted
      statistical analyses were applied to identify differentially methylated regions
      (DMRs) between the groups. DMRs were mapped to their corresponding genes, and
      tested for potential overlaps with biological pathways and gene networks.
      RESULTS: We detected significant increases in body weight (31.7 vs 28.8 g;
      P=0.001), visceral (642.1 vs 497.0 mg; P=0.002) and subcutaneous (293.1 vs 250.1 
      mg; P=0.001) fat mass, plasma cholesterol (110.6 vs 87.6 mg dl(-1); P=0.001),
      triglycerides (87.3 vs 84.1 mg dl(-1); P=0.003) and homeostatic model
      assessment-insulin resistance values (8.1 vs 6.1; P=0.007) in the LG-SF group.
      MeDIP analyses revealed that 2148 DMRs (LG-SF vs LG-SC; P<0.0001, model-based
      analysis of tilling-arrays algorithm). A large proportion of the DMR-associated
      genes have reported functions that are altered in obesity and metabolic syndrome,
      such as Cartpt, Akt2, Apoe, Insr1 and so on. Overrepresented pathways and gene
      networks were related to metabolic regulation and inflammatory response.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a major role for epigenomic regulation of pathways
      associated with the metabolic processes and inflammatory responses in VWAT.
      LG-SF-induced epigenetic alterations may underlie increases in the susceptibility
      to obesity and metabolic syndrome in the offspring.

TI  - Transition to parenthood and mental health in first-time parents.

LID - 10.1002/imhj.21443 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to examine the transition to parenthood and mental health in
      first-time parents in detail and explore any differences in this transition in
      the context of parental gender and postpartum mental health. Semistructured
      clinical interviews (Birmingham Interview for Maternal Mental Health) were
      carried out with 46 women and 40 men, 5 months after birth. Parents were assessed
      on pre- and postpartum anxiety, depression, and postpartum posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), and a range of adjustment and relationship variables. One fourth
      of the men and women reported anxiety in pregnancy, reducing to 21% of women and 
      8% of men after birth. Pregnancy and postpartum depression rates were roughly
      equal, with 11% of women and 8% of men reporting depression. Postpartum PTSD was 
      experienced by 5% of parents. Postpartum mental health problems were
      significantly associated with postpartum sleep deprivation (odds ratio [OR] =
      7.5), complications in labor (OR = 5.1), lack of postpartum partner support (OR =
      8.0), feelings of parental unworthiness (OR = 8.3), and anger toward the infant
      (OR = 4.4). Few gender differences were found for these variables. This study
      thus highlights the importance of focusing interventions on strengthening the
      couple's relationship and avoiding postnatal sleep deprivation, and to address
      parents' feelings of parental unworthiness and feelings of anger toward their
      baby.

      balanced by studies that could not confirm such association. We conducted a
      meta-analysis of all studies reporting on women exposed to TPM during pregnancy. 
      Of the 2327 publications reviewed, 6 articles met the inclusion criteria
      including 3420 patients and 1,204,981 controls. The odd ratio (OR) of OC after
      the first trimester exposure to TPM exposure was 6.26 (95% confidence interval:
      3.13-12.51; P = 0.00001). This study provides strong evidence that TPM is
      associated with an increased risk of OC in infants exposed to TPM during
      embryogenesis and should lead to a careful review of TPM use in women of
      reproductive ages.

AB  - The significance of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring during pregnancy
      has not been established. We performed a prospective study to elucidate whether
      ABP measures are associated with small-for-gestational-age birth weight (SGA). We
      studied 146 pregnant women who were seen for maternal medical checkups or
      suspected hypertension. ABP monitoring was performed for further assessment of
      hypertension. The outcome measure was SGA. The subjects were classified by their 
      medical history and ABP as having preeclampsia or gestational hypertension (n=68 
      cases), chronic hypertension (n=48) or white-coat hypertension (n=30). There were
      50 (34.2%) cases of SGA by the fetal growth reference standard. In multivariable 
      logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, body mass index, the presence of 
      prior pregnancy, current smoking habit and the use of antihypertensive
      medications, 24-h SBP (per 10 mm Hg (odds ratio (OR): 1.74; 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 1.28-2.38; P<0.001)) was more closely associated with SGA than
      clinic BP (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.92-2.13; P=0.11). The results were essentially the
      same if 24-h BP was replaced by awake or sleep SBP. Ambulatory diastolic BP
      showed the same tendency. However, abnormal circadian rhythm was not associated
      with the outcome. In conclusion, ambulatory BP monitoring measures performed
      during pregnancy were more closely associated with SGA than clinic BP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence, severity and relation to fluid
      retention of self-reported pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)
      symptoms in a large sample of pregnant women. DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal 
      cohort study. SETTING: Dutch women who became pregnant between January 2013 and
      January 2014 in the southeast of The Netherlands. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: A total
      of 639 Dutch pregnant women. METHODS: Baseline characteristics were assessed at
      12 weeks' gestation. CTS symptoms were assessed using the Boston Carpal Tunnel
      Questionnaire (BCTQ) at 32 weeks and during the first postpartum week regarding
      the last weeks of pregnancy. Fluid retention, sleeping problems and depressive
      symptoms (using the Edinburgh Depression Scale) were assessed at several time
      points during pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BCTQ scores, fluid retention and 
      sleeping problems. RESULTS: Of the 639 women, 219 (34%) reported CTS symptoms
      during pregnancy. Total mean scores on the BCTQ were significantly higher after
      32 weeks' than up to 32 weeks' gestation. Most women experienced mild to moderate
      symptoms. Pregnant women with CTS symptoms reported significantly higher levels
      of fluid retention during gestation compared with pregnant women without CTS
      symptoms [F = 60.6, df (1598), P < 0.001], adjusted for body mass index (BMI),
      age, parity, and depression scores. Higher scores on fluid retention throughout
      the pregnancy were significantly related to CTS (OR = 1.8, 95%CI 1.5, 2.1, P <
      0.001). Finally, the occurrence of CTS was independently related to sleeping
      problems. CONCLUSIONS: Although the severity of symptoms and functional
      impairment of CTS were relatively mild, health care professionals should be aware
      of the high prevalence. The occurrence of CTS symptoms is significantly higher in
      women who report fluid retention during gestation and it can contribute to
      sleeping problems.

TI  - Treatment of early-onset preeclampsia with continuous positive airway pressure.
PG  - 1106-9
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity
      and mortality. There is no treatment for preeclampsia other than delivery.
      Sleep-disordered breathing is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes,
      including preeclampsia, but it is not known whether treatment with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves perinatal outcomes. CASE: We report a
      35-year-old primigravid woman diagnosed with preeclampsia at 30 weeks of
      gestation. A sleep study confirmed severe sleep-disordered breathing, and CPAP
      treatment was started. After CPAP treatment, both clinical and biochemical
      markers of preeclampsia improved. In addition, circulating angiogenic markers of 
      preeclampsia improved. As a result, the pregnancy safely continued for 30 days,
      allowing the fetus to gain gestation. CONCLUSION: Continuous positive airway
      pressure may be a novel treatment for women with early-onset preeclampsia
      associated with sleep-disordered breathing.

TI  - Identifying Insomnia in Early Pregnancy: Validation of the Insomnia Symptoms
      Questionnaire (ISQ) in Pregnant Women.
PG  - 645-54
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.4776 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although a substantial number of pregnant women report symptoms
      of insomnia, few studies have used a validated instrument to determine the
      prevalence in early gestation. Identification of insomnia in pregnancy is vital
      given the strong connection between insomnia and the incidence of depression,
      cardiovascular disease, or immune dysregulation. The goal of this paper is to
      provide additional psychometric evaluation and validation of the Insomnia Symptom
      Questionnaire (ISQ) and to establish prevalence rates of insomnia among a cohort 
      of pregnant women during early gestation. METHODS: The ISQ was evaluated in 143
      pregnant women at 12 weeks gestation. The internal consistency and criterion
      validity of the dichotomized ISQ were compared to traditional measures of sleep
      from sleep diaries, actigraphy, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index using
      indices of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV,
      NPV), and likelihood ratio (LR) tests. RESULTS: The ISQ identified 12.6% of the
      sample as meeting a case definition of insomnia, consistent with established
      diagnostic criteria. Good reliability was established with Cronbach alpha = 0.86.
      The ISQ had high specificity (most > 85%), but sensitivity, PPV, NPV, and LRs
      varied according to which sleep measure was used as the validating criterion.
      CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia is a health problem for many pregnant women at all stages
      in pregnancy. These data support the validity and reliability of the ISQ to
      identify insomnia in pregnant women. The ISQ is a short and cost-effective tool
      that can be quickly employed in large observational studies or in clinical
      practice where perinatal women are seen. COMMENTARY: A commentary on this article

TI  - Minimal Effect of Daytime Napping Behavior on Nocturnal Sleep in Pregnant Women.
PG  - 635-43
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.4774 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess whether daytime naps negatively impact nocturnal
      sleep. DESIGN: Longitudinal, prospective cohort design. PARTICIPANTS: 161
      pregnant women recruited and evaluated in early gestation (10-20 weeks).
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Daily sleep information was collected in three 2-week
      periods (10-12, 14-16, and 18-20 weeks gestation) with a daily sleep diary and an
      actigraph. The average number of naps, as well as the average length of each nap,
      were calculated from sleep diaries. Women were categorized first as non nappers
      (0 naps/2-week period), moderate nappers (1-3 naps/2-week period), or frequent
      nappers (>/= 4 naps/2-week period). Then, based on the average nap length, they
      were categorized as short (< 90 min) or long (>/= 90 min) nappers. Nocturnal
      sleep parameters included SOL, WASO, SE, and TST. SAS procedure MIXED was used
      for modeling the main effects of nap group and time, and time by nap group
      interactions. Women who took naps had a decrease in diary-assessed nocturnal TST,
      but not actigraphy-assessed TST. This observation was group- and time-specific.
      There were no other group differences. Women who napped >/= 90 min had poorer
      diary-assessed SE and lower diary-assessed TST than those who took shorter naps. 
      Length of nap was not associated with any other sleep measures. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      number of daytime naps have minimal impact on nocturnal sleep parameters;
      however, long nappers did exhibit modestly impaired sleep continuity and sleep
      quality. Overall, we propose that daytime naps provide a beneficial
      countermeasure to the sleep disruption commonly reported by pregnant women. This 
      may be clinically beneficial given that sleep continuity and quality are
      important correlates of pregnancy outcomes. COMMENTARY: A commentary on this

TI  - The effect of sleep health behavioral education on the depression of pregnant
      women with sleep disorders: a randomized control trial.
PG  - e11420
LID - 10.5812/ircmj.11420 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 79% of the pregnant women experience sleep disorders and 70% of
      pregnant women experience some symptoms of the depression. Physiologic, hormonal,
      and physical changes of pregnancy can predispose mothers to depression these
      disorders before, during, and after childbirth and might be aggravated by
      neglecting health behavior. Health behavior education might be useful for the
      management of depression in pregnant women. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to
      evaluate the effect of sleep health behavioral education on the improvement of
      depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This
      study was a randomized clinical trial, performed on 96 pregnant women with sleep 
      disorder diagnosed according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Tools for
      data collection included demographic questionnaire and Beck's Depression
      Inventory (BDI). Easy and accessible sampling was done. Participants were
      randomly (simple) allocated to intervention and control groups. In intervention
      group, sleep health behavior education was presented during a four-hour session
      held in weeks 22, 23, 24, and 25; then the patients were followed up to fill out 
      the BDIQ in follow-up session at weeks 29 and 33 of pregnancy. The control group 
      received no intervention and only received routine prenatal care. The results
      were assessed by Chi-square tests, independent-samples t-test, and Fischer's
      exact-test by SPSS 16. RESULTS: A statistically significant change was reported
      in the severity of depression in pregnant women with sleep disorders in the
      intervention group in comparison to the control group at weeks 29 (P < 0.000) and
      33 (P < 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep health behavioral education improves depression
      in pregnant women who are experiencing insomnia. Findings from this study add
      support to the reported effectiveness of sleep health behavioral education in the
      prenatal care and clinical management of insomnia in pregnancy.

TI  - Laing Distal Myopathy
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Laing distal myopathy is characterized by early-onset
      weakness (usually before age 5 years) that initially involves the dorsiflexors of
      the ankles and great toes and then the finger extensors, especially those of the 
      third and fourth fingers. Weakness of the neck flexors is seen in most affected
      individuals and mild facial weakness is often present. After distal weakness has 
      been present for more than ten years, mild proximal weakness may be observed.
      Life expectancy is normal. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis relies on clinical
      findings and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in MYH7.
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Physiotherapy to prevent or treat
      tightening of the tendo Achilles is helpful. In more advanced cases, lightweight 
      splinting of the ankle (e.g., with an ankle-foot orthosis) can be useful.
      Surveillance: Annual neurologic examination; regular evaluation for
      scoliosis/kyphoscoliosis (especially during rapid growth); repeat
      electrocardiogram and echocardiogram if symptoms of cardiac insufficiency occur; 
      respiratory assessment if sympoms suggest sleep apnea / sleep-related respiratory
      insufficiency. GENETIC COUNSELING: Laing distal myopathy is inherited in an
      autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 65%-70% of affected individuals have an 
      affected parent; de novo mutation of MYH7 accounts for 30%-35% of cases. Each
      child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic
      variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for
      families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified.

TI  - Feeding methods, sleep arrangement, and infant sleep patterns: a Chinese
      population-based study.
PG  - 66-75
LID - 10.1007/s12519-015-0012-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Findings from prior research into the effect of feeding methods on
      infant sleep are inconsistent. The objectives of this study were to examine
      infants' sleep patterns by feeding methods and sleep arrangement from birth to
      eight months old. METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study enrolled 524 pregnant
      women at 34-41 weeks of gestation and their infants after delivery in 2006 and
      followed up until eight months postpartum. The study subjects were recruited from
      nine women and children hospitals in nine cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing,
      Wuhan, Changsha, Nanning, Xiamen, Xi'an, Jinan, and Hailin). Participating
      infants were followed up weekly during the first month and monthly from the
      second to the eighth month after birth. Twenty-four hour sleep diaries recording 
      infants' sleeping and feeding methods were administered based on caregiver's
      self-report. Multivariable mixed growth curve models were fitted to estimate the 
      effects of feeding methods and sleep arrangement on infants' sleep patterns over 
      time, controlling for maternal and paternal age, maternal and paternal education 
      level, household income, supplementation of complementary food, and infant birth 
      weight and length. RESULTS: Exclusively formula fed infants had the greatest
      sleep percentage/24 h, followed by exclusively breast milk fed infants and
      partially breast milk fed infants (P<0.01). Night waking followed a similar
      pattern. However, the differences in sleep percentage and night waking frequency 
      between exclusively formula and exclusively breast milk fed infants weakened over
      time as infants developed. In addition, compared to infants with bed-sharing
      sleep arrangement, those with room sharing sleep arrangement had greater daytime 
      and 24-hour infant sleep percentage, whereas those with sleeping alone sleep
      arrangement had greater nighttime sleep percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Our data based
      on caregiver's self-report suggested that partial breastfeeding and bed-sharing
      may be associated with less sleep in infants. Health care professionals need to
      work with parents of newborns to develop coping strategies that will help prevent
      early weaning of breastfeeding.

      pregnancy.
PG  - 924-6
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000527 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fundal growth during pregnancy can lead to unremitting discomfort and
      skin breakdown in patients with extensive abdominal scarring. CASE: A 31-year-old
      primigravid woman at 30 weeks of gestation presented to the department of
      dermatology with constant abdominal discomfort, itch, and sleep disturbance
      secondary to increasing tension associated with existing abdominal scars. An
      outpatient course of ablative fractional laser resurfacing was initiated in
      consultation with the dermatology department, resulting in immediate and durable 
      symptom relief and visible abdominal expansion. No complications were observed,
      and the patient delivered a healthy newborn at term. CONCLUSIONS: Ablative
      fractional laser resurfacing is a minimally invasive therapeutic alternative for 
      treating pregnant patients with symptoms related to restrictive scarring of the
      abdomen.

TI  - The Overlap between Fibromyalgia Syndrome and Myotonia Congenita.
PG  - 188-91
LID - 10.3988/jcn.2015.11.2.188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a complex disorder characterized by
      chronic widespread pain (CWP), multiple areas of tenderness, sleep disturbance,
      fatigue, and mood or cognitive dysfunction. Myotonia congenita (MC) is an
      inherited myopathic disorder that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the
      skeletal muscle chloride channel, which can infrequently manifest as generalized 
      muscle cramps or myalgia. CASE REPORT: The first case was a 33-year-old woman who
      complained of CWP and chronic headache occurring during pregnancy, and the second
      case was a 37-year-old man with CWP and depression who suffered from cold-induced
      muscle cramps. These two patients were initially diagnosed with FMS by
      rheumatologists, based on CWP of longer than 3 months duration and mechanical
      tenderness in specific body regions. However, these two FMS patients were
      subsequently also diagnosed with MC. CONCLUSIONS: These two cases are the first
      report of an overlap of CWP between FMS and MC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the Sleep Disordered Breathing substudy of the
      Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) is to
      determine whether sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor
      for adverse pregnancy outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: NuMoM2b is a prospective cohort
      study of 10,037 nulliparous women with singleton gestations that was conducted
      across 8 sites with a central Data Coordinating and Analysis Center. The Sleep
      Disordered Breathing substudy recruited 3702 women from the cohort to undergo
      objective, overnight in-home assessments of sleep disordered breathing. A
      standardized level 3 home sleep test was performed between 6(0)-15(0) weeks'
      gestation (visit 1) and again between 22(0)-31(0) weeks' gestation (visit 3).
      Scoring of tests was conducted by a central Sleep Reading Center. Participants
      and their health care providers were notified if test results met "urgent
      referral" criteria that were based on threshold levels of apnea hypopnea indices,
      oxygen saturation levels, or electrocardiogram abnormalities but were not
      notified of test results otherwise. The primary pregnancy outcomes to be analyzed
      in relation to maternal sleep disordered breathing are preeclampsia, gestational 
      hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, and
      preterm birth. RESULTS: Objective data were obtained at visit 1 on 3261 women,
      which was 88.1% of the studies that were attempted and at visit 3 on 2511 women, 
      which was 87.6% of the studies that were attempted. Basic characteristics of the 
      substudy cohort are reported in this methods article. CONCLUSION: The substudy
      was designed to address important questions regarding the relationship of
      sleep-disordered breathing on the risk of preeclampsia and other outcomes of
      relevance to maternal and child health.

PG  - 221-31

AB  - There are gender differences in the upper airway function and respiratory
      stability in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Hormones are implicated in some
      gender-related differences, and these differences between men and women appear to
      mitigate as age increases. In addition, changes in the airway and lung function
      during pregnancy can contribute to snoring and OSA that might have an adverse
      effect on the mother and fetus. The limited data available suggest that although 
      the prevalence and severity of OSA may be lower in women, the consequences of the
      disease are similar, if not worse. Women with OSA may have greater risk for
      hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, be more likely to develop comorbid
      conditions such as anxiety and depression and have increased mortality.
      Therefore, treatment options specifically targeting female presentations and
      pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are expected to result in
      improved outcomes in women.

PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.4274/tjod.22120 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors affecting general sleep pattern and sleep
      quality in pregnant women. MATERIALDS AND METHODS: We assessed all pregnant women
      applied to Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Training and Research
      Hospital, School of Medicine, Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University between 01
      January 2014 and 01 March 2014. The participants were informed prior to the study
      and 100 pregnant women who gave their informed consent were included in the
      study. Questionnaires consisting sociodemographic characteristics, pregnancy
      history and the Epworth sleepiness scale were applied to the patients. Factors
      affecting general sleep pattern and sleep quality in pregnant women were
      compared. RESULTS: The mean age of 100 pregnant women was 27.9 years (min=16,
      max=42). The mean gestational age of participants was found to be 24.8 weeks
      (min=5, max=40). In obstetric history, 9% of women previously had a stillbirth
      and also 25% of women previously had curettage performed. There were tobacco use 
      in 6% of participants and 6% of patients previously had been to the hospital due 
      to a sleep disorder. The mean excessive daytime sleepiness scale score of
      pregnant women were found to be 4.56. There were no significant difference among 
      the patients regarding regular exercise (p=0.137), tobacco use (p=0.784),
      accompanying disease (p=0.437) and excessive daytime sleepiness scale score.
      CONCLUSION: In our study, patients who had a complaint of sleep disorder before
      and who were previously admitted to a health center for this problem, were also
      found to suffer from the same problem during pregnancy. Treatment of sleep
      disorders in preconception period for women planning pregnancy is important in
      terms of mother and the baby's health. Pregnant women should be informed about
      factors reducing sleep quality during pregnancy.

TI  - Eclampsia as a cause of secondary non-obstructive central sleep hypoventilation.
PG  - 16-9
AB  - The central alveolar hypoventilation of Ondine's curse is a disorder
      characterized by absent or diminished ventilatory response to hypercapnia,
      hypoxia or both, with parallel decrease in saturation to 50%. The secondary form 
      may begin mainly after insult that affects the brain stem. We present a case of a
      24-years old primipara in the 41st gestational week with an uncomplicated course 
      of pregnancy and with secondary non-obstructive sleeping hypoventilation which
      occurred after eclamptic seizure. This obstetric case provides evidence for the
      benefit of home BiPAP use for patients with secondary Ondine's curse.

TI  - In school-age children who were born very preterm sleep efficiency is associated 
      with cognitive function.
PG  - 244-52
AB  - AIMS: This study examined whether the association between sleep duration, as well
      as sleep continuity, and cognitive function differs between normally developing
      preterm children compared to full-term children during middle childhood. METHODS:
      A total of 58 early preterm (<32 weeks' gestation) and 55 full-term children,
      aged 6-10 years and enrolled in elementary school, were assessed on sleep
      duration, sleep continuity and cognitive function. We used in-home
      polysomnographic recordings of total sleep time, sleep efficiency and nocturnal
      awakenings. Cognitive tests included intelligence, arithmetic, selective
      attention, verbal memory, and visuospatial memory. RESULTS: Preterm children
      showed poorer performance in intelligence, arithmetic, selective attention, and
      visuospatial memory (d = 0.38-0.79, p < 0.05) and more objectively assessed
      nocturnal awakenings (d = 0.40, p = 0.03) than full-term children. Associations
      of sleep efficiency and cognitive functions (intelligence, arithmetic, selective 
      attention, visuospatial memory) were positive and stronger for preterm children
      (beta = 0.17-0.31, p < 0.05), while they were nonsignificant for full-term
      children. CONCLUSION: Results confirm lower cognitive test scores and more
      nocturnal awakenings in normally developing early preterm children compared to
      full-term children. Furthermore, poor sleep efficiency may aggravate cognitive
      deficits, particularly in children who are more vulnerable due to premature
      birth.

TI  - Immunonutrition: methodology and applications.
PG  - 145-54
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.sup3.8762 [doi]
AB  - Immunonutrition is an emergent and interdisciplinary subject, since it comprises 
      several aspects related to Nutrition, Immunity, Infection, Inflammation, and
      Injury or tissue damage, what is known as Nutrition and 4 "Is". Within these
      interactions the endocrine, nervous and immune systems are involved, microbiota
      being a part of the last one. Nowadays, gut microbiota has been shown to play an 
      essential role, not only in the gastrointestinal tract but also into the nervous 
      system, because of its bilateral connection. There are several methods to study
      Immunonutrition, which allow measuring different immunological biomarkers to
      provide information about the nutritional status. However, it should be taken
      into account that there is not a single gold standard parameter to evaluate the
      cause- effect relationship between nutrition and the immune system. On the
      contrary, a combination of biomarkers have to be assessed depending on the
      different nutritional situations. Since Immunonutrition is a multidisciplinary
      matter as mentioned above, the study on the interactions between nutrition and
      the immune system has not been exclusively focused as such, but bearing in mind
      other systems of the organisms as well as a wide range of confounding factors and
      determinants coming from idiosyncratic features, genes and lifestyle of each
      individual. Therefore, Immunonutrition allows to study the following research
      fields: 1) Evaluation of nutritional status in presumably healthy people with
      risk of malnutrition (children, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, elderly, and
      sportspeople); 2) Assessment of the evolution and progress of patients with
      nutrition and immune-related diseases, such as food allergies, eating and
      metabolic disorders; 3) Evaluation of the effects of nutrients, bioactive
      compounds and both conventional and functional foods on the immune system; 4)
      Evaluation of impact of lifestyle determinants on the immune system, such as
      diet, food behaviour, physical activity, sedentariness, sleep quality and
      quantity, and as a key factor, stress.

PG  - 927-32
LID - 10.1080/13548506.2015.1017508 [doi]
AB  - Depression has been associated with sleep disturbances in pregnancy; however, no 
      previous research has controlled the possible confounding effect of anxiety on
      this association. This study aims to analyze the effect of depression on sleep
      during the third trimester of pregnancy controlling for anxiety. The sample was
      composed by 143 depressed (n = 77) and non-depressed (n = 66) pregnant women who 
      completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep. Differences between groups 
      in sleep controlling for anxiety were found. Depressed pregnant women present
      higher number of nocturnal awakenings and spent more hours trying falling asleep 
      during the night and the entire 24 h period. Present findings point out the
      effect of depression on sleep in late pregnancy, after controlling for anxiety.

TI  - Central serous chorioretinopathy secondary to corticosteroids in patients with
      atopic disease.
PG  - 123-9
LID - 10.2500/aap.2015.36.3827 [doi]
AB  - Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is of unknown etiology and is the most
      common cause of retinopathy after age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
      retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion. Vision loss results from fluid leakage
      and serous detachment in the macula. Five percent of patients develop chronic
      CSCR. It is predominantly found in middle-aged men (age-adjusted rates per
      100,000: 9.9 for men and 1.7 for women) and is usually unilateral and reversible.
      Three-quarters of CSCR patients resolve within 3 months but 45% have recurrences,
      usually with only minor visual acuity changes. Risk factors include type A
      personality, emotional stress, elevated catecholamines, hypertension, pregnancy, 
      organ transplantation, increased levels of endogenous cortisol,
      psychopharmacologic medication, use of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors,
      obstructive sleep apnea, Helicobacter pylori infection, or treatment with
      corticosteroids. Five percent of patients develop chronic disease as a result of 
      subretinal fibrin formation within the blister. CSCR is often bilateral,
      multifocal, and recurrent, and may be associated with subretinal fibrin formation
      within the blister. Permanent loss of vision may result from subretinal
      fibrin-fibrosis with scarring of the macula. Corticosteroid-associated CSCR
      occurs bilaterally in 20% of patients. Steroid-associated therapy may begin days 
      to years after therapy with any form of drug delivery. We present three atopic
      patients who presented at various times after oral, inhaled, intranasal, and
      topical corticosteroid therapy. One patient developed CSCR after three separate
      types of administration of corticosteroids, which, to our knowledge, has not been
      observed in the literature.

TI  - Role of melatonin in embryo fetal development.
PG  - 488-92
AB  - Melatonin is an indoleamine produced by the pineal gland and secreted in a
      circadian manner. In the past few decades, research over this topic has been
      enhanced. Melatonin has many important roles in the human physiology: regulator
      of the circadian rhythms, sleep inducer, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic. This
      paper reviews the involvement of melatonin in embryo fetal development. The
      pineal gland develops completely postpartum, so both the embryo and the fetus are
      dependent on the maternal melatonin provided transplacentally. Melatonin appears 
      to be involved in the normal outcome of pregnancy beginning with the oocyte
      quality and finishing with the parturition. Its pregnancy night-time
      concentrations increase after 24 weeks of gestation, with significantly high
      levels after 32 weeks. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the embryo and fetus
      since early stages. There is solid evidence that melatonin is neuroprotective and
      has a positive effect on the outcome of the compromised pregnancies. In addition,
      chronodisruption leads to a reproductive dysfunction. Thus, the influence of
      melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to the entertaining of
      circadian rhythmicity, but further studies are needed.

TI  - Recent clinical and translational advances in pediatric hypertension.
PG  - 926-31
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03586 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological reports describe a child population increase in BP level and an
      increase in prevalence of hypertension, that is largely, but not entirely, driven
      by a concurrent increase in childhood obesity. Given current estimates,
      approximately 10% of adolescents have hypertension or prehypertension. In
      addition to obesity, dietary salt intake and waist circumference, a marker of
      visceral obesity, are found to be independently associated with the rise in BP
      among children and adolescents. Dietary salt intake in urban children is well
      above recommended levels largely because of consumption of processed and fast
      foods. Childhood exposures, such as stress,52 salt, and fructose, as well as
      lifestyles, including food sources, sleep patterns, and reductions in physical
      activity may have a role in obesity-high BP associations. In addition, clinical
      and translational evidence is mounting that intrauterine exposures alter can
      effect changes in fetal development that have an enduring effect on
      cardiovascular and metabolic function later in life. These effects can be
      detected even in children who are products of a term otherwise normal pregnancy. 
      Hypertension in childhood has been defined statistically (BP >/= 95th percentile)
      because of lack of outcome data that links a BP level with heightened risk for
      future cardiovascular events. Therefore, primary hypertension had been considered
      a risk factor for later hypertension in adulthood. Intermediate markers of TOD,
      including cardiac hypertrophy, vascular stiffness, and increases in cIMT, are
      detectable in adolescents with primary hypertension. Evidence that vascular
      injury is present in the early phase of hypertension and even in prehypertension 
      warrants consideration on the current definition of pediatric hypertension. With 
      further studies on TOD and other risk factors in addition to high BP, it may be
      possible to shift from a statistical definition to a definition of childhood
      hypertension that is evidence based. Preventing or reducing childhood obesity
      would have substantial benefit in countering the documented increase in BP levels
      and prevalence of high BP in childhood. Weight control in overweight and obese
      children, along with dietary changes 53 and increases in physical activity,54 has
      benefit on BP levels in childhood. Prevention of childhood obesity and BP risk
      will require multiple levels of intervention, including public health, health
      policy, and attention to food supply to foster the necessary lifestyle changes to
      prevent and reduce childhood obesity.

TI  - Infant sleep development from 3 to 6 months postpartum: links with maternal sleep
      and paternal involvement.
PG  - 107-24
LID - 10.1111/mono.12147 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this longitudinal study were to examine (a) development of infant
      sleep and maternal sleep from 3 to 6 months postpartum; (b) concomitant and
      prospective links between maternal sleep and infant sleep; and (c) triadic links 
      between paternal involvement in infant caregiving and maternal and infant sleep. 
      The study included 57 families that were recruited during pregnancy. Maternal and
      infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and sleep diaries for 5 nights. Both
      fathers and mothers completed a questionnaire assessing the involvement of
      fathers relative to mothers in infant caregiving. The results demonstrated
      moderate improvement in infant and maternal sleep percent between 3 and 6 months.
      Maternal sleep percent at 3 months significantly predicted infant sleep percent
      at 6 months. Greater paternal involvement in infant daytime and nighttime
      caregiving at 3 months significantly predicted more consolidated maternal and
      infant sleep at 6 months. These findings suggest that maternal sleep is an
      important predictor of infant sleep and that increased involvement of fathers in 
      infant caregiving responsibilities may contribute to improvements in both
      maternal and infant sleep during the first 6 months postpartum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosis)
      are serious conditions that affect approximately 10-15% of women after
      childbirth, and up to 40% of women at risk for these disorders. Research reveals 
      an association between poor sleep quality/quantity and symptoms of anxiety,
      depression and psychosis. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the
      available evidence for the relationship between sleep and postpartum mental
      disorders. METHODS: Searches included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews - Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost CINAHL through June
      30, 2014. Manual searching was performed on reference lists of included articles.
      Published primary research in any language was included. RESULTS: There were 3187
      unique titles/abstracts and 44 full-text articles reviewed. Thirty-one studies
      were included. Evidence was found for the impact of self-reported poor sleep
      during pregnancy and the postpartum on the development of postpartum depression, 
      with not enough evidence for either postpartum anxiety or psychosis. The evidence
      for objectively assessed sleep and the development of postpartum disorders was
      mixed. Among the 31 studies included, 1 was strong, 13 were moderate and 17 were 
      weak. LIMITATIONS: Research design, method of assessment, timing of assessment,
      recruitment strategies, representative adequacy of the samples and
      inclusion/exclusion criteria all varied widely. Many studies did not use tools
      validated for the perinatal population and had small sample sizes without power
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep interventions represent a potential low-cost,
      non-pharmacological prevention and treatment strategy for postpartum mental
      illness. Further high-quality research is needed on this topic area.

TI  - Developmental programming by androgen affects the circadian timing system in
      female mice.
PG  - 88
LID - 10.1095/biolreprod.114.126409 [doi]
AB  - Circadian clocks play essential roles in the timing of events in the mammalian
      hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The molecular oscillator driving these 
      rhythms has been localized to tissues of the HPO axis. It has been suggested that
      synchrony among these oscillators is a feature of normal reproductive function.
      The impact of fertility disorders on clock function and the role of the clock in 
      the etiology of endocrine pathology remain unknown. Polycystic ovarian syndrome
      (PCOS) is a particularly devastating fertility disorder, affecting 5%-10% of
      women at childbearing age with features including a polycystic ovary,
      anovulation, and elevated serum androgen. Approximately 40% of these women have
      metabolic syndrome, marked by hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin
      resistance. It has been suggested that developmental exposure to excess androgen 
      contributes to the etiology of fertility disorders, including PCOS. To better
      define the role of the timing system in these disorders, we determined the
      effects of androgen-dependent developmental programming on clock gene expression 
      in tissues of the metabolic and HPO axes. Female PERIOD2::luciferase (PER2::LUC) 
      mice were exposed to androgen (dihydrotestosterone [DHT]) in utero (Days 16-18 of
      gestation) or for 9-10 wk (DHT pellet) beginning at weaning (pubertal androgen
      excess [PAE]). As expected, both groups of androgen-treated mice had disrupted
      estrous cycles. Analysis of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants revealed that
      excess androgen produced circadian misalignment via tissue-dependent effects on
      phase distribution. In vitro treatment with DHT differentially affected the
      period of PER2::LUC expression in tissue explants and granulosa cells, indicating
      that androgen has direct and tissue-specific effects on clock gene expression
      that may account for the effects of developmental programming on the timing
      system.

TI  - Restless leg syndrome: a neglected diagnosis.
PG  - e22009
LID - 10.5812/numonthly.22009 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is an irresistible urge to move legs that
      usually occur during inactivity and at night. This neurologic condition is
      associated with increased risk of nocturnal hypertension as well as
      cardiovascular events and affects patient's sleep, which leads to anxiety,
      depression, and decreases quality of life. Presence of RLS in patients on
      hemodialysis is associated with higher mortality rate. Most of the times,
      patients have indescribable symptoms. The aim of this review was to provide
      physicians with information to be aware and turn their attention to the patient's
      symptoms, which are the most important clue to diagnosis of RLS. EVIDENCE
      ACQUISITION: For data extraction, we reviewed PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, the
      Cochrane collaboration, and Up to Date databases with the keywords of restless
      legs syndrome, sleep disorders, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The most
      recent review articles, clinical trials, and cross-sectional studies with large
      sample sizes that had used International RLS Study Group criteria (IRLSSG) and
      had focused on demographic characteristics and renal function were included. This
      situation has described in primary and secondary forms. The former usually occurs
      in younger patients and seems to have genetic tendencies and the latter is due to
      the iron deficiency state, pregnancy, and ESRD. RESULTS: Two major theories are
      developed regarding the pathophysiology of RLS. The first one concerns central
      nervous system dopamine imbalance and the second one concerns intracellular iron 
      dysregulation. The most common used pharmacologic agents in treatment of RLS are 
      dopamine agonists. Other used therapeutic agents include levodopa, Alpha-2-delta 
      calcium channel ligands, opioids, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, clonidine,
      iron therapy in low levels of serum ferritin, and nonpharmacologic therapies.
      CONCLUSIONS: The most important factor in diagnosis is physician's attention and 
      clinical experience with this condition and using IRLSSG.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize sleep patterns and sleep problems in
      a large sample of women across all months of pregnancy. METHODS: A total of 2427 
      women completed an Internet-based survey that included the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, vitality scale of the Short Form 
      36 Health Survey (SF-36), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Berlin questionnaire,
      International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) question set, and a short version of 
      the Pregnancy Symptoms Inventory (PSI). RESULTS: Across all months of pregnancy, 
      women experienced poor sleep quality (76%), insufficient nighttime sleep (38%),
      and significant daytime sleepiness (49%). All women reported frequent nighttime
      awakenings (100%), and most women took daytime naps (78%). Symptoms of insomnia
      (57%), sleep-disordered breathing (19%), and restless legs syndrome (24%) were
      commonly endorsed, with no difference across the month of pregnancy for insomnia,
      sleep-disorder breathing, daytime sleepiness, or fatigue. In addition, high rates
      of pregnancy-related symptoms were found to disturb sleep, especially frequent
      urination (83%) and difficulty finding a comfortable sleep position (79%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Women experience significant sleep disruption, inadequate sleep, and
      high rates of symptoms of sleep disorder throughout pregnancy. These results
      suggest that all women should be screened and treated for sleep disturbances
      throughout pregnancy, especially given the impact of inadequate sleep and sleep
      disorders on fetal, pregnancy, and postpartum outcomes.

TI  - Transcriptomes reveal alterations in gravity impact circadian clocks and activate
      mechanotransduction pathways with adaptation through epigenetic change.
PG  - 113-28

AB  - Few studies have investigated the impact of alterations in gravity on mammalian
      transcriptomes. Here, we describe the impact of spaceflight on mammary
      transcriptome of late pregnant rats and the effect of hypergravity exposure on
      mammary, liver, and adipose transcriptomes in late pregnancy and at the onset of 
      lactation. RNA was isolated from mammary collected on pregnancy day 20 from rats 
      exposed to spaceflight from days 11 to 20 of gestation. To measure the impact of 
      hypergravity on mammary, liver, and adipose transcriptomes we isolated RNA from
      tissues collected on P20 and lactation day 1 from rats exposed to hypergravity
      beginning on pregnancy day 9. Gene expression was measured with Affymetrix
      GeneChips. Microarray analysis of variance revealed alterations in gravity
      affected the expression of genes that regulate circadian clocks and activate
      mechanotransduction pathways. Changes in these systems may explain global gene
      expression changes in immune response, metabolism, and cell proliferation.
      Expression of genes that modify chromatin structure and methylation was affected,
      suggesting adaptation to gravity alterations may proceed through epigenetic
      change. Altered gravity experiments offer insights into the role of forces
      omnipresent on Earth that shape genomes in heritable ways. Our study is the first
      to analyze the impact of alterations in gravity on transcriptomes of pregnant and
      lactating mammals. Findings provide insight into systems that sense gravity and
      the way in which they affect phenotype, as well as the possibility of sustaining 
      life beyond Earth's orbit.

AB  - The rhythmic expression of clock genes in the uterus is attenuated during
      decidualization. This study focused on Ptgs2, which is essential for
      decidualization, as a putative clock-controlled gene, and aimed to reveal the
      functions of clock genes in relation to Ptgs2 during decidualization. We compared
      the transcript levels of clock genes in the rat uterus on days 4.5 (D4.5) and 6.5
      of pregnancy. The transcript levels of clock genes (Per2, Bmal1, Roralpha, and
      Rev-erbalpha) had decreased at implantation sites on day 6.5 (D6.5e) compared
      with those on D4.5, whereas Ptgs2 transcripts had increased on D6.5e. Similar
      observations of Rev-erbalpha and Ptgs2 were also obtained in the endometrium on
      D6.5e by immunohistochemistry. In the decidual cells induced by
      medroxyprogesterone and 2-O-dibutyryl-cAMP, the rhythmic expression levels of
      clock genes were attenuated, whereas Ptgs2 transcription was induced. These
      results indicate that decidualization causes the attenuation of clock genes and
      the induction of Ptgs2. Furthermore, in the experiment of Bmal1 siRNA, the
      rhythmic expression of clock genes and Ptgs2 was attenuated by the siRNA.
      Transcript levels of Ptgs2 and prostaglandin (PG)E(2) production were increased
      by treatment with the Rev-erbalpha antagonist, suggesting the contribution of the
      nuclear receptor Rev-erbalpha to Ptgs2 expression. Moreover, Rev-erbalpha
      knockdown enhanced the induction of Ptgs2 transcription and PGE(2) production by 
      forskolin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis revealed that Rev-erbalpha 
      could directly bind to a proximal RORE site of Ptgs2. Collectively, this study
      demonstrates that the attenuation of the circadian clock, especially its core
      component Rev-erbalpha, contributes to the induction of Ptgs2 during
      decidualization.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome and hypertension in Chinese pregnant women.
PG  - 877-81
LID - 10.1007/s10072-015-2094-4 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy, and studies show that
      pregnant women are more likely to suffer from restless legs syndrome (RLS).
      Pregnant women with hypertension and RLS often experience disrupted sleep
      patterns because of activation of the nervous system. The present study aimed to 
      clarify the relationship between hypertension and RLS in pregnant women, and
      their impact on sleep. We enrolled 3,781 pregnant women who were admitted at our 
      hospital for delivery between May 2011 and May 2014. The face-to-face
      questionnaire used to gather data included the International RLS Study Group
      criteria for diagnosis, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale (ESS), and hypertension diagnosis. Depending on the time of occurrence of
      hypertension, it was divided into two different types: pregnancy-induced
      hypertension and chronic hypertension in pregnancy. Out of 3,781 patients, 453
      fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for RLS and 486 met the diagnostic criteria for
      hypertension. Among patients with RLS, prophylactic iron supplementation was less
      frequently taken during pregnancy. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, rather than
      chronic hypertension in pregnancy, was found to be more frequent in patients with
      RLS; pregnant women with RLS had higher PSQI and ESS scores than pregnant
      controls. In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant women, especially in those
      without prophylactic iron supplementation. Patients with RLS described more
      serious sleep disruption and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). In addition,
      pregnancy-induced hypertension was more common in patients with RLS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the expression patterns of periphery clock
      genes were influenced by menstrual cycle in a monkey model. STUDY DESIGN: In this
      preliminary study, the expression patterns of four clock genes (Bmal1, Clock,
      Cry1 and Per2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 6 female Macaca
      fascicularis in menstrual, late follicular and mid luteal phases of menstrual
      cycle were determined by qrt-PCR. RESULTS: Bmal1 and Per2 mRNA levels were found 
      to exhibit significant diurnal rhythms in all phases of the menstrual cycle. The 
      expression of Cry1 mRNA was statistically rhythmic in late follicular and mid
      luteal phases. A main effect of menstrual cycle existed on the rhythms of Bmal1, 
      Cry1 and Per2 expression, but not Clock expression. No significant differences
      were detected between menstrual phase and late follicular phase in all clock
      genes. Significant differences were found on the expression of Bmal1, Cry1 or
      Per2 mRNA between late follicular phase and mid luteal phase, when no difference 
      existed in estrogen level, indicating the role of progesterone on biological
      clock gene expression. Furthermore, the peak of Bmal1 mRNA level slightly
      advanced in mid luteal phase compared with that in menstrual and late follicular 
      phases. CONCLUSION: The expression patterns of clock genes in PBMCs were
      influenced by menstrual cycle, potentially by the change of progesterone levels, 
      and this effect maybe correlated with early pregnancy.

TI  - Sleep disturbances among pregnant women with history of migraines: A
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1092-102
LID - 10.1177/0333102415570493 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine is associated with sleep disturbances in men and
      non-pregnant women. However, relatively little is known about sleep disturbances 
      among pregnant migraineurs. We investigated sleep disturbances among pregnant
      women with and without history of migraine. METHODS: This cross-sectional study
      was conducted among 1324 women who were recruited during early pregnancy.
      Migraine diagnoses were based on the International Classification of Headache
      Disorders-II criteria. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire
      was used to evaluate sleep-related characteristics including sleep duration,
      sleep quality, excessive daytime sleepiness, and other sleep traits.
      Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate adjusted odds 
      ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Migraineurs were more 
      likely than non-migraineurs to report short sleep duration (<6.5 hours) (AOR =
      1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.02), poor sleep quality (PSQI>5) (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI
      1.35-2.23), and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI
      1.12-2.02). Migraineurs were also more likely than non-migraineurs to report
      taking sleep medication during pregnancy (AOR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.20-2.42).
      Associations were generally similar for migraine with or without aura. The odds
      of sleep disturbances were particularly elevated among pre-pregnancy overweight
      migraineurs. CONCLUSION: Migraine headache and sleep disturbances are common
      comorbid conditions among pregnant women.

TI  - Presenting features of idiopathic versus secondary restless legs syndrome in
      pregnancy.
PG  - 241-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is the most common movement disorder in 
      pregnancy, which can be idiopathic or secondary. There are limited comparative
      data regarding these two forms of RLS. The aim of this study was to compare
      clinical features of idiopathic and secondary RLS in pregnant women. METHODS:
      Over a period of 3 months, 443 women who admitted for delivery in two clinical
      centers were screened for RLS using four diagnostic criteria of the international
      RLS study group. A total of 79 subjects diagnosed with RLS were consecutively
      enrolled in the present study. All of them were interviewed for medical history
      and complaints during pregnancy and responded to self-administer international
      RLS rating scale. RESULTS: Ten subjects (12.9%) out of 79 pregnant women with RLS
      had idiopathic form, and their mean age was significantly higher than patients
      with secondary RLS (30.6 +/- 7.3 years vs. 26.4 +/- 4.6 years, P = 0.0260).
      Compared with women with secondary RLS, sleep duration in pregnancy was
      significantly decreased in idiopathic RLS group (P = 0.0460), whereas RLS
      severity score was similar in both groups. No significant difference was observed
      between the two groups in terms of other sleep complaints, the positive family
      history of RLS, parity, duration of pregnancy, or frequency of cesarean section
      (P > 0.0500). CONCLUSION: Idiopathic and secondary RLS have relatively similar
      courses and features during pregnancy. However, the idiopathic form may have more
      negative impact on sleep in pregnancy. Careful screening and effective treatment 
      of idiopathic RLS before pregnancy is recommended to limit these disturbances.

TI  - Effect of attending childbirth education classes on psychological distress in
      pregnant women measured by means of the General Health Questionnaire.
PG  - 953-7
LID - 10.17219/acem/37351 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy brings about many changes in a woman's life in somatic,
      psychological and social spheres. Therefore, many women decide to participate in 
      childbirth education classes. The aim of study was to determine the differences
      in emotional distress between women who participated in childbirth education
      classes and these who did not. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy first-time mothers
      after labor were examined. Based on a survey carried out, the women were divided 
      into two equal groups. Group I consisted of women who had participated in
      childbirth education classes and Group II of women who had not. The data was
      gathered by means of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) adapted to Polish 
      conditions. RESULTS: There were no differences either in age or in BMI rates
      among the examined women. The level of education and knowledge about labor was
      significantly higher among the participants of childbirth classes. The results of
      the GHQ-12 revealed that women from Group I had a better mental status than women
      from Group II. Significant differences were observed in terms of sleep
      deprivation, overcoming difficulties and in the ability to enjoy daily
      activities. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in childbirth classes has a significant
      influence on psychological well-being in pregnant women as measured by the
      GHQ-12.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure and its variability in adults born preterm.
PG  - 615-21
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.04717 [doi]
AB  - Adults born preterm have higher blood pressure (BP) than those born at term. Most
      studies have focused on preterm birth, and few have assessed BP variability, an
      independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. We studied the association of 
      preterm birth with 24-hour ambulatory BP, measured by an oscillometric device, in
      42 young adults born early preterm (<34 weeks), 72 born late preterm (34-36
      weeks), and 103 controls (>/=37 weeks). Sleep was confirmed with accelerometry in
      72.4% of subjects. The 24-hour systolic BP of adults born early preterm was 5.5
      mm Hg higher (95% confidence interval, 1.9-9.3), awake systolic BP was 6.4 mm Hg 
      higher (95% confidence interval, 2.8-10.1), and sleeping systolic BP was 2.9 mm
      Hg higher (95% confidence interval 0.3-7.5) when adjusted for age, sex, and use
      of accelerometry. The differences remained similar when adjusted for height, body
      mass index, physical activity, smoking, parental education, maternal body mass
      index, smoking during pregnancy, and gestational diabetes mellitus and attenuated
      slightly when adjusted for maternal hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Adults born
      early preterm also had higher BP variability as indicated by higher individual
      standard deviations of systolic BP and diastolic BP. Although our results were
      consistent with a dose-response relationship between shorter gestation and higher
      BP, the difference between the late preterm and term groups was not statistically
      significant. Our results suggest that the higher BP in adults born early preterm 
      is present during both waking and sleeping hours, may be more pronounced during
      waking hours, and is accompanied by higher individual BP variability.

TI  - An integrated web-based mental health intervention of assessment-referral-care to
      reduce stress, anxiety, and depression in hospitalized pregnant women with
      medically high-risk pregnancies: a feasibility study protocol of hospital-based
      implementation.
PG  - e9
LID - 10.2196/resprot.4037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At prevalence rates of up to 40%, rates of depression and anxiety
      among women with medically complex pregnancies are 3 times greater than those in 
      community-based samples of pregnant women. However, mental health care is not a
      component of routine hospital-based antenatal care for medically high-risk
      pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and feasibility of the hospital-based implementation of a Web-based
      integrated mental health intervention comprising psychosocial assessment,
      referral, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for antenatal inpatients.
      METHODS: This study is a quasi-experimental design. Pregnant women are eligible
      to participate if they are (1) <37 weeks gestation, (2) admitted to the antenatal
      inpatient unit for >72 hours, (3) able to speak and read English or be willing to
      use a translation service to assist with completion of the questionnaires and
      intervention, (4) able to complete follow-up email questionnaires, (5) >16 years 
      of age, and (6) not actively suicidal. Women admitted to the unit for induction
      (eg, <72-hour length of stay) are excluded. A minimum sample of 54 women will be 
      recruited from the antenatal high-risk unit of a large, urban tertiary care
      hospital. All women will complete a Web-based psychosocial assessment and 6
      Web-based CBT modules. Results of the psychosocial assessment will be used by a
      Web-based clinical decision support system to generate a clinical risk score and 
      clinician prompts to provide recommendations for the best treatment and referral 
      options. The primary outcome is self-reported prenatal depression, anxiety, and
      stress symptoms at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment. Secondary outcomes are postpartum
      depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; self-efficacy; mastery; self-esteem;
      sleep; relationship quality; coping; resilience; Apgar score; gestational age;
      birth weight; maternal-infant attachment; infant behavior and development;
      parenting stress/competence at 3-months postpartum; and intervention
      cost-effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility, and acceptability. All women will
      complete email questionnaires at 6-8 weeks postrecruitment and 3-months
      postpartum. Qualitative interviews with 10-15 health care providers and 15-30
      women will provide data on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.
      RESULTS: The study was funded in September, 2014 and ethics was approved in
      November, 2014. Subject recruitment will begin January, 2015 and results are
      expected in December, 2015. Results of this study will determine (1) the
      effectiveness of an integrated Web-based prenatal mental health intervention on
      maternal and infant outcomes and (2) the feasibility of implementation of the
      intervention on a high-risk antenatal unit. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide 
      evidence and guidance regarding the implementation of a Web-based mental health
      program into routine hospital-based care for women with medically high-risk
      pregnancies.

TI  - Inhibitory role of REV-ERBalpha in the expression of bone morphogenetic protein
      gene family in rat uterus endometrium stromal cells.
PG  - C528-38

AB  - Uterus circadian rhythms have been implicated in the gestation processes of
      mammals through entraining of the clock proteins to numerous downstream genes.
      Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), having clock-controlled regulatory sites in
      their gene promoters, are expressed in the uterus during decidualization, but the
      regulation of the Bmp gene expression is poorly understood. The present study was
      designed to dissect the physiological roles of the uterus oscillators in the Bmp 
      expression using the uterus endometrial stromal cells (UESCs) isolated from
      Per2-dLuc transgenic rats on day 4.5 of gestation. The in vitro decidualization
      of UESCs was induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate and 2-O-dibutyryl cAMP. A
      significant decline of Per2-dLuc bioluminescence activity was induced in decidual
      cells, and concomitantly, the expression of canonical clock genes was
      downregulated. Conversely, the expression of the core Bmp genes Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp6,
      and Bmp7 was upregulated. In UESCs transfected with Bmal1-specific siRNA, in
      which Rev-erbalpha expression was downregulated, Bmp genes, such as Bmp2, Bmp4,
      and Bmp6 were upregulated. However, Bmp1, Bmp7, and Bmp8a were not significantly 
      affected by Bmal1 silencing. The expression of all Bmp genes was enhanced after
      treatment with the REV-ERBalpha antagonist (SR8278), although their rhythmic
      profiles were differed from each other. The binding of REV-ERBalpha to the
      proximal regions of the Bmp2 and Bmp4 promoters was revealed by chromatin
      immunoprecipitation-PCR analysis. Collectively, these results indicate that the
      Bmp genes are upregulated by the attenuation of the cellular circadian clock; in 
      particular, its core component REV-ERBalpha functions as a transcriptional
      silencer in the Bmp gene family.

TI  - Respiratory impedance in healthy unsedated South African infants: effects of
      maternal smoking.
PG  - 467-73
LID - 10.1111/resp.12463 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Non-invasive techniques for measuring lung mechanics in
      infants are needed for a better understanding of lung growth and function, and to
      study the effects of prenatal factors on subsequent lung growth in healthy
      infants. The forced oscillation technique requires minimal cooperation from the
      individual but has rarely been used in infants. The study aims to assess the use 
      of the forced oscillation technique to measure the influence of antenatal
      exposures on respiratory mechanics in unsedated infants enrolled in a birth
      cohort study in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Healthy term infants were
      studied at 6-10 weeks of age using the forced oscillation technique. Respiratory 
      impedance was measured in the frequency range 8-48 Hz via a face mask during
      natural sleep. Respiratory system resistance, compliance and inertance were
      calculated from the impedance spectra. RESULTS: Of 177 infants tested, successful
      measurements were obtained in 164 (93%). Median (25-75%) values for resistance,
      compliance and inertance were 50.2 (39.5-60.6) cmH2 O.s.L(-1), 0.78 (0.61-0.99)
      mL.cmH2 O(-1) and 0.062 (0.050-0.086) cmH2 O.s(2) .L(-1), respectively. As a
      group, male infants had 16% higher resistance (P = 0.006) and 18% lower
      compliance (P = 0.02) than females. Infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy
      had a 19% lower compliance than infants not exposed to tobacco smoke during
      pregnancy (P = 0.005). Neither maternal HIV infection nor ethnicity had a
      significant effect on respiratory mechanics. CONCLUSIONS: The forced oscillation 
      technique is sensitive enough to demonstrate the effects of tobacco smoke
      exposure and sex in respiratory mechanics in healthy infants. This technique will
      facilitate assessing perinatal influences of lung function in infancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the effect of maternal sleep-disordered breathing
      (SDB) on infant general movements (GMs) and neurodevelopment. STUDY DESIGN:
      Pregnant women with uncomplicated full-term pregnancies and their offspring were 
      prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low-risk obstetric
      surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire on second
      trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT; Itamar Medical,
      Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index>5) and
      controls. Infant GMs were assessed in the first 48 hours and at 8-11 and 14-16
      weeks of age. At 12 months of age the Infant Developmental Inventory and the
      Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire were administered. RESULTS: In all, 74 women and
      their full-term infants were studied. Eighteen (24%) women had SDB. Mean
      birthweight was 3347.1+/-423.9 g. Median Apgar score at 5 minutes was 10 (range, 
      8-10). In adjusted comparisons, no differences were found between infants born to
      mothers with SDB and controls in GM scores in all 3 evaluations. Low social
      developmental score was detected at 12 months in 64% of infants born to SDB
      mothers compared to 25% of infants born to controls (adjusted P=.036; odds ratio,
      16.7). Infant snoring was reported by 41.7% of mothers with SDB compared to 7.5% 
      of controls (P=.004). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal
      SDB during pregnancy has no adverse effect on neonatal and infant neuromotor
      development but may affect social development at 1 year.

TI  - The clock protein period 2 synchronizes mitotic expansion and decidual
      transformation of human endometrial stromal cells.
PG  - 1603-14
LID - 10.1096/fj.14-267195 [doi]
AB  - Implantation requires coordinated interactions between the conceptus and
      surrounding decidual cells, but the involvement of clock genes in this process is
      incompletely understood. Circadian oscillations are predicated on
      transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which balance the activities of the
      transcriptional activators CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and
      brain muscle arnt-like 1 and repressors encoded by PER (Period) and Cryptochrome 
      genes. We show that loss of PER2 expression silences circadian oscillations in
      decidualizing human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs). Down-regulation occurred
      between 12 and 24 hours following differentiation and coincided with reduced
      CLOCK binding to a noncanonical E-box enhancer in the PER2 promoter. RNA
      sequencing revealed that premature inhibition of PER2 by small interfering RNA
      knockdown leads to a grossly disorganized decidual response. Gene ontology
      analysis highlighted a preponderance of cell cycle regulators among the 1121
      genes perturbed upon PER2 knockdown. Congruently, PER2 inhibition abrogated
      mitotic expansion of differentiating HESCs by inducing cell cycle block at G2/M. 
      Analysis of 70 midluteal endometrial biopsies revealed an inverse correlation
      between PER2 transcript levels and the number of miscarriages in women suffering 
      reproductive failure (Spearman rank test, rho = -0.3260; P = 0.0046). Thus, PER2 
      synchronizes endometrial proliferation with initiation of aperiodic decidual gene
      expression; uncoupling of these events may cause recurrent pregnancy loss.

TI  - Sleep position, fetal growth restriction, and late-pregnancy stillbirth: the
      Sydney stillbirth study.
PG  - 347-55
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0000000000000627 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify potentially modifiable risk factors for late-pregnancy
      stillbirth. METHODS: This was a population-based matched case-control study of
      pregnant women at 32 weeks of gestation or greater booked into tertiary maternity
      hospitals in metropolitan Sydney between January 2006 and December 2011. The case
      group consisted of women with singleton pregnancies with antepartum fetal death
      in utero. Women in the control group were matched for booking hospital and
      expected delivery date with women in the case group. Data collection was
      performed using a semistructured interview and included validated questionnaires 
      for specific risk factors. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for a
      priori-specified risk factors using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS:
      There were 103 women in the case group and 192 women in the control group. Mean
      gestation was 36 weeks. Supine sleeping was reported by 10 of 103 (9.7%) of women
      who experienced late-pregnancy stillbirth and by 4 of 192 (2.1%) of women in the 
      control group (adjusted OR 6.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-34). Women who 
      experienced stillbirth were more likely to: have been followed during pregnancy
      for suspected fetal growth restriction, 11.7% compared with 1.6% (adjusted OR
      5.5, 95% CI 1.36-22.5); not be in paid work, 25.2% compared with 9.4% (adjusted
      OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.6); and to have not received further education beyond high
      school, 41.7% compared with 25.5% (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.5). None of the 
      deaths to women who reported supine sleeping were classified as unexplained.
      CONCLUSION: This study suggests that supine sleep position may be an additional
      risk for late-pregnancy stillbirth in an already compromised fetus. The clinical 
      management of suspected fetal growth restriction should be investigated further
      as a means of reducing late stillbirth.

      misregulation induced by gestational sleep disturbance.
PG  - R419-30

AB  - Sleep disorders are highly prevalent during late pregnancy and can impose adverse
      effects, such as preeclampsia and diabetes. However, the consequences of sleep
      fragmentation (SF) on offspring metabolism and epigenomic signatures are unclear.
      We report that physical activity during early life, but not later, reversed the
      increased body weight, altered glucose and lipid homeostasis, and increased
      visceral adipose tissue in offspring of mice subjected to gestational SF (SFo).
      The reversibility of this phenotype may reflect epigenetic mechanisms induced by 
      SF during gestation. Accordingly, we found that the metabolic master switch Foxo1
      was epigenetically misregulated in SFo livers in a temporally regulated fashion. 
      Temporal Foxo1 analysis and its gluconeogenetic targets revealed that the
      epigenetic abnormalities of Foxo1 precede the metabolic syndrome phenotype.
      Importantly, regular physical activity early, but not later in life, reversed
      Foxo1 epigenetic misregulation and altered the metabolic phenotype in
      gestationally SF-exposed offspring. Thus, we have identified a restricted
      postnatal period during which lifestyle interventions may reverse the Foxo1
      epigenetically mediated risk for metabolic dysfunction later in the life, as
      induced by gestational sleep disorders.

PG  - 835-40
LID - 10.1007/s11325-014-1099-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Physiologic changes in the cardiac, respiratory, and renal systems in
      pregnancy likely impact ventilatory control. Though obstructive sleep apnea and
      snoring are common in the pregnant population, the predisposition to central
      respiratory events during sleep and the prevalence of such events is less well
      studied. The aim of this study was to assess the presence of central apneas
      during sleep in pregnant women and non-pregnant controls suspected of sleep
      disordered breathing. METHODS: Twenty-five pregnant women referred for
      polysomnography for sleep disordered breathing were compared with non-pregnant
      controls matched for age, body mass index, gender, and apnea hypopnea index
      (AHI). Central apnea index was defined as the number of central apneas per hour
      of sleep, and mixed apnea index was defined as the number of mixed apneas per
      hour of sleep. RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of pregnant women had a respiratory
      disturbance index >5 events per hour of sleep. Mean body mass index was 44.1 +/- 
      6.9 kg/m(2) pregnant compared to 44.0 +/- 7.3 kg/m(2) in controls. The total
      number of central apneas observed during sleep in the pregnant group consisted of
      two central apneas in one patient, and of 98 central apneas in 11 patients in the
      control group (p = 0.05). Median central apnea index was low in both groups
      (pregnant 0, interquartile range (IQR) 0, 0 vs. non-pregnant 0, IQR 0, 0.2, p =
      0.04). Mixed apnea index was similarly low in both groups. CONCLUSION: Despite
      some physiologic changes of pregnancy that impact ventilatory control, the
      prevalence of central sleep apnea was low in our sample of overweight pregnant
      women with sleep-disordered breathing.

PG  - 192-203
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000000225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cosmic radiation and circadian disruption are potential reproductive 
      hazards for flight attendants. METHODS: Flight attendants from 3 US airlines in 3
      cities were interviewed for pregnancy histories and lifestyle, medical, and
      occupational covariates. We assessed cosmic radiation and circadian disruption
      from company records of 2 million individual flights. Using Cox regression
      models, we compared respondents (1) by levels of flight exposures and (2) to
      teachers from the same cities, to evaluate whether these exposures were
      associated with miscarriage. RESULTS: Of 2654 women interviewed (2273 flight
      attendants and 381 teachers), 958 pregnancies among 764 women met study criteria.
      A hypothetical pregnant flight attendant with median first-trimester exposures
      flew 130 hours in 53 flight segments, crossed 34 time zones, and flew 15 hours
      during her home-base sleep hours (10 pm-8 am), incurring 0.13 mGy absorbed dose
      (0.36 mSv effective dose) of cosmic radiation. About 2% of flight attendant
      pregnancies were likely exposed to a solar particle event, but doses varied
      widely. Analyses suggested that cosmic radiation exposure of 0.1 mGy or more may 
      be associated with increased risk of miscarriage in weeks 9-13 (odds ratio = 1.7 
      [95% confidence interval = 0.95-3.2]). Risk of a first-trimester miscarriage with
      15 hours or more of flying during home-base sleep hours was increased (1.5
      [1.1-2.2]), as was risk with high physical job demands (2.5 [1.5-4.2]).
      Miscarriage risk was not increased among flight attendants compared with
      teachers. CONCLUSIONS: Miscarriage was associated with flight attendant work
      during sleep hours and high physical job demands and may be associated with
      cosmic radiation exposure.

TI  - [Sleep-related breathing disorders in pregnancy--a predictor of pre-eclampsia?].
PG  - 2290-4
AB  - Sleep disorders are common in pregnancy. Several hormonal and physiological
      changes have been shown to affect the quality of sleep. Sleep disorders have been
      related to various pregnancy complications, e.g. pre-eclampsia. In particular,
      sleep apnea is more common among women who develop hypertension in pregnancy or
      pre-eclampsia. Compared with control patients, snoring is similarly more often
      apparent in women who will have pre-eclampsia manifested. Hence, the relationship
      between sleep disorders and pre-eclampsia warrants investigation. CPAP treatment 
      has been proven to be effective in sleep apnea, but also in lowering blood
      pressure. CPAP may be useful also in the prevention and treatment of
      pre-eclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of prone sleeping, the major risk factor for
      sudden infant death syndrome, in the control of blood pressure (BP) in preterm
      infants born across a range of gestational ages. STUDY DESIGN: Daytime
      polysomnography was performed at 2-4 weeks, 2-3 months, and 5-6 months postterm
      age. The participants were 21 very preterm (mean gestation 29.4 +/- 0.3 weeks),
      14 preterm (mean gestation 33.1 +/- 0.3 weeks), and 17 term (mean gestation 40.1 
      +/- 0.3 weeks). BP was measured via a Finometer cuff (Finapres Medical Systems,
      Amsterdam, The Netherlands) placed around the wrist. Data were recorded both
      supine and prone. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was calculated via cross-spectral 
      analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in BP. RESULTS: BRS was lower in the prone
      position in very preterm infants at 2-4 weeks in active sleep (P < .05).
      Maturation of BRS was delayed in very preterm compared with both preterm and term
      infants. CONCLUSIONS: Maturation of BRS after term-equivalent age is altered in
      very preterm infants. Reduced BRS may result in an impaired ability of very
      preterm infants to respond to cardiovascular stress during infancy and may
      predispose them to cardiovascular disease later in life.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during
      pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western
      countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and negative impact on sleep. 
      There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on
      the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was 
      chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for
      the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation. A
      committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12
      consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed
      potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive
      committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation
      Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential
      diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy
      and lactation. Nonpharmacologic approaches, including reassurance, exercise and
      avoidance of exacerbating factors, are outlined. A rationale for iron
      supplementation is presented. Medications for RLS/WED are risk/benefit rated for 
      use during pregnancy and lactation. A few are rated "may be considered" when
      RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches. An algorithm summarizes
      the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice
      and promote further research.

TI  - Impact of overnight oximetry findings on cardiac autonomic modulation in women
      during second trimester of uncomplicated pregnancy.

AB  - AIM: Although sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) might impose an underlying health 
      threat upon some pregnant women, the influence of SDB on the health status of
      most pregnant women is not discernible. In order to find out which pregnant women
      should be evaluated for clinically meaningful SDB during the second trimester,
      the present study aimed to determine which overnight oximetry findings
      significantly affect maternal resting cardiac autonomic modulations. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: Overnight arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) was monitored at home using
      pulse oximetry by 64 women with uncomplicated pregnancy between 24 and 28 weeks
      of gestation. We then determined the impact of the findings on maternal resting
      heart rate variability (HRV) using 5-min photoplethysmography. RESULTS: A
      relatively increased oxygen desaturation index (number of oxygen desaturation
      events where SaO2 fell >3% below the baseline saturation/h) of >/=3.0 in five
      women did not significantly impact HRV. On the other hand, events associated with
      profound oxygen desaturation (minimum SaO2 </= 90%) in three women were
      associated with decreased HRV, including high- and low-frequency powers.
      CONCLUSION: Parasympathetic activities of cardiac autonomic modulations might be 
      attenuated in women who experience profound night-time oxygen desaturation, even 
      if the incidence of significant events is quite low. The oximetry finding of
      minimum SaO2 </= 90% might be a valuable criterion for clinically meaningful
      sleep-disordered breathing among women with early uncomplicated pregnancy.

TI  - Pregnancy is characterized by widespread deep-tissue hypersensitivity independent
      of lumbopelvic pain intensity, a facilitated response to manual orthopedic tests,
      and poorer self-reported health.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Lumbopelvic pain is common in pregnancy but the sensitization factors
      underlying the condition are largely unknown. This study characterized the
      somatosensory profile of pregnant and nonpregnant women and the relationship
      between pain, hypersensitivity, and commonly used manual clinical tests.
      Thirty-nine pregnant and 22 nonpregnant women were included. Although lumbopelvic
      pain was not an inclusion criterion, the pregnant women were divided into low-
      and high-pain groups following data collection. The sensitivity to light brush,
      pin-prick, and pressure pain was assessed bilaterally at 3 sites in the
      lumbopelvic region, at the shoulder, and in the lower leg. Responses to the
      active straight leg raise test and pain provocation tests of the sacroiliac joint
      were recorded. Participants completed questionnaires addressing emotional and
      physical well-being and rated disability using the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire.
      Compared with controls, the high-pain group rated the active straight leg raise
      test as more difficult (P < .05), and both pain groups had more positive pain
      provocation tests (P < .05). The pregnant groups demonstrated significantly lower
      pressure pain thresholds at most assessment sites compared with controls (P <
      .05), but self-reported disability and pain were not correlated with pressure
      pain thresholds within pregnant participants. The high-pain group reported worse 
      emotional health and poorer sleep quality than controls (P < .05). PERSPECTIVE:
      This article presents the somatosensory profile of a healthy pregnant cohort. The
      results indicate that pain sensitivity increases during pregnancy possibly owing 
      to the physical changes the body undergoes during pregnancy but also owing to
      changes in emotional health. This should be accounted for in clinical management 
      of pregnant women with lumbopelvic pain.

TI  - Accuracy of self-reported sleep position in late pregnancy.
PG  - e115760
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0115760 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is emerging research to suggest that supine maternal sleep
      position in late pregnancy may adversely affect fetal wellbeing. However, these
      studies have all been based on maternal report of sleeping position. Before
      recommendations to change sleep position can be made it is important to determine
      the validity of these studies by investigating how accurate pregnant women are in
      reporting their sleep position. If avoiding the supine sleeping position reduces 
      risk of poor pregnancy outcome, it is also important to know how well women can
      comply with the instruction to avoid this position and sleep on their left.
      METHOD: Thirty women in late pregnancy participated in a three-night
      observational study and were asked to report their sleeping position. This was
      compared to sleep position as recorded by a night capable video recording. The
      participants were instructed to settle to sleep on their left side and if they
      woke overnight to settle back to sleep on their left. RESULTS: There was a
      moderate correlation between reported and video-determined left-side sleep time
      (r = 0.48), mean difference = 3 min (SD = 3.5 h). Participants spent an average
      of 59.60% (SD = 16.73%) of time in bed on their left side (ICC across multiple
      nights = 0.67). Those who included left side among their typical sleep positions 
      reported significantly longer sleep during the study (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: On
      average participant reports of sleep position were relatively accurate but there 
      were large individual differences in reporting accuracy and in
      objectively-determined time on left side. Night-to-night consistency was
      substantial. For those who do not ordinarily sleep on that side, asking
      participants to sleep on their left may result in reduced sleep duration. This is
      an important consideration during a sleep-critical time such as late pregnancy.

PG  - 2740-5
LID - 10.12659/MSM.891222 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate whether poor sleep quality
      of third-trimester pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depression. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: Third-trimester pregnant women (T0, n=293) were tested using the
      first socio-demographic, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Edinburgh Postnatal 
      Depression Scale assessments, and received a diagnosis of depression. Three
      months (T1, n=223) after delivery, scale filling was finished and the structured 
      interview was performed again. RESULTS: We found that 73 persons (32.7%) were low
      income, 84 persons (37.7%) were middle-income, and 66 persons (29.6%) were higher
      income. The overall prevalence of postpartum depression was 9.4% (21 persons).
      After controlling for other factors, age, household income, marital satisfaction,
      and sleep quality were significantly related to postpartum depression, in which
      age and sleep quality scores (a higher score was associated with poorer sleep
      quality) were positively related to postpartum depression, and household income
      and marital satisfaction were negatively related to postpartum depression.
      Moreover, third-trimester sleep quality score was positively related to
      postpartum depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Poor third-trimester subjective
      sleep quality is a risk factor for postpartum depression.

PG  - 143
LID - 10.3389/fnana.2014.00143 [doi]
AB  - In most species, self-sustained molecular clocks regulate 24-h rhythms of
      behavior and physiology. In mammals, a circadian pacemaker residing in the
      hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives photic signals from the
      retina and synchronizes subordinate clocks in non-SCN tissues. The emergence of
      circadian rhythmicity during development has been extensively studied for many
      years. In mice, neuronal development in the presumptive SCN region of the
      embryonic hypothalamus occurs on days 12-15 of gestation. Intra-SCN circuits
      differentiate during the following days and retinal projections reach the SCN,
      and thus mediate photic entrainment, only after birth. In contrast the genetic
      components of the clock gene machinery are expressed much earlier and during
      midgestation SCN explants and isolated neurons are capable of generating
      molecular oscillations in culture. In vivo metabolic rhythms in the SCN, however,
      are observed not earlier than the 19th day of rat gestation, and rhythmic
      expression of clock genes is hardly detectable until after birth. Together these 
      data indicate that cellular coupling and, thus, tissue-wide synchronization of
      single-cell rhythms, may only develop very late during embryogenesis. In this
      mini-review we describe the developmental origin of the SCN structure and
      summarize our current knowledge about the functional initiation and entrainment
      of the circadian pacemaker during embryonic development.

PG  - 303
LID - 10.1186/s12887-014-0303-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor sleep contributes to the developmental problems seen in preterm 
      infants. We evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants 6 months of
      post-gestational age using the subjective Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ)
      and objective sleep tests. We also compared the sleep of premature infants with
      that of full-term infants. METHODS: The study included 68 6-month-old full-term
      healthy infants and 191 premature infants born at <37 weeks gestation. All
      parents completed the BISQ-Chinese version and sleep diaries. At the same time,
      all premature infants were submitted to one night of polysomnography (PSG) in the
      sleep laboratory and also were set up with an actigraph kept for 7 days.
      Statistical analyses were performed using correlation coefficients and the t-test
      with SPSS version 18 to compare questionnaire responses with other subjective and
      objective measures of sleep. RESULTS: The sleep problems indicated in the
      subjective questionnaire for the premature infants, particularly: "the nocturnal 
      sleep duration, number of night awakenings, daytime sleep duration, duration of
      time with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing" had significant correlations
      with sleep diaries, actigraphy and PSG results. The BISQ showed that duration of 
      infant's sleeping on one side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall
      asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, daytime sleep duration, subjective
      consideration of sleep problems, loud-noisy breathing, and duration spent crying 
      during the night were significantly different between the premature infants and
      the term infants. PSG confirmed the presence of a very high percentage (80.6%) of
      premature infants with AHI > 1 event/hour as indicated by the questionnaire.
      CONCLUSION: Premature infants have more sleep problems than full-term infants,
      including the known risk of abnormal breathing during sleep, which has been well 
      demonstrated already with the BISQ-Chinese (CBISQ).

AB  - Disturbances of fetal autonomic brain development can be evaluated from fetal
      heart rate patterns (HRP) reflecting the activity of the autonomic nervous
      system. Although HRP analysis from cardiotocographic (CTG) recordings is
      established for fetal surveillance, temporal resolution is low. Fetal
      magnetocardiography (MCG), however, provides stable continuous recordings at a
      higher temporal resolution combined with a more precise heart rate variability
      (HRV) analysis. A direct comparison of CTG and MCG based HRV analysis is pending.
      The aims of the present study are: (i) to compare the fetal maturation age
      predicting value of the MCG based fetal Autonomic Brain Age Score (fABAS)
      approach with that of CTG based Dawes-Redman methodology; and (ii) to elaborate
      fABAS methodology by segmentation according to fetal behavioral states and HRP.
      We investigated MCG recordings from 418 normal fetuses, aged between 21 and 40
      weeks of gestation. In linear regression models we obtained an age predicting
      value of CTG compatible short term variability (STV) of R (2) = 0.200
      (coefficient of determination) in contrast to MCG/fABAS related multivariate
      models with R (2) = 0.648 in 30 min recordings, R (2) = 0.610 in active sleep
      segments of 10 min, and R (2) = 0.626 in quiet sleep segments of 10 min.
      Additionally segmented analysis under particular exclusion of accelerations (AC) 
      and decelerations (DC) in quiet sleep resulted in a novel multivariate model with
      R (2) = 0.706. According to our results, fMCG based fABAS may provide a promising
      tool for the estimation of fetal autonomic brain age. Beside other traditional
      and novel HRV indices as possible indicators of developmental disturbances, the
      establishment of a fABAS score normogram may represent a specific reference. The 
      present results are intended to contribute to further exploration and validation 
      using independent data sets and multicenter research structures.

TI  - Is postpartum depression a homogenous disorder: time of onset, severity, symptoms
      and hopelessness in relation to the course of depression.
PG  - 402
LID - 10.1186/s12884-014-0402-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common illness, but due to the
      underlying processes and the diversity of symptoms, some variability is
      exhibited. The risk of postpartum depression is great if the mother has
      previously suffered from depression, but there is some evidence that a certain
      subgroup of women only experience depression during the postpartum period.
      METHODS: The study group consisted of 104 mothers with postpartum major
      depression and a control group of 104 postpartum mothers without depression. The 
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) was used for
      data collection. The severity of depression and other mental symptoms were
      assessed using several validated rating scales. RESULTS: A history of past
      depression (82%), including depression during pregnancy (42%) and during the
      postpartum period (53%), was very common in those with current PPD. Eighteen per 
      cent of mothers with current PPD had previously not had any depressive episodes
      and four per cent had experienced depression only during the postpartum period.
      Therefore, pure PPD was rare. The onset of PPD was usually (84%) within six weeks
      of childbirth. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, 
      depressed mood, diminished pleasure/interest, decreased energy, and psychomotor
      agitation/retardation were common with all kinds of depression histories. Pure
      PPD was the most similar to the first depressive episode. Nevertheless, the
      severity of depression, the level of hopelessness, somatisation, interpersonal
      sensitivity, anxiety, hostility, psychoticism, sleep disturbance, and suicidal
      ideation were lower, appetite changed less, and concentration was better than in 
      other recurrent depressions. CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, PPD is not a
      homogenous disorder. The time of onset, severity, symptoms, level of
      hopelessness, and the course of depression vary. Recurrent depression is common. 
      All mothers must be screened during the sixth week postpartum at the latest.
      Screening alone is not effective; it is also important to give mothers
      information about PPD and to discuss the symptoms with them in order for them to 
      recognise this disorder and possible new episodes in the future.

TI  - Maternal plasma and amniotic fluid chemokines screening in fetal Down syndrome.
PG  - 835837
LID - 10.1155/2014/835837 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chemokines exert different inflammatory responses which can
      potentially be related to certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities. The aim of the
      study was to determine the concentration of selected chemokines in plasma and
      amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down syndrome. METHOD: Out of 171
      amniocentesis, we had 7 patients with confirmed fetal Down syndrome (15th-18th
      weeks of gestation). For the purpose of our control, we chose 14 women without
      confirmed chromosomal aberration. To assess the concentration of chemokines in
      the blood plasma and amniotic fluid, we used a protein macroarray, which allows
      the simultaneous determination of 40 chemokines per sample. RESULTS: We showed
      significant decrease in the concentration of 4 chemokines, HCC-4, IL-28A, IL-31, 
      and MCP-2, and increase in the concentration of CXCL7 (NAP-2) in plasma of women 
      with fetal Down syndrome. Furthermore, we showed decrease in concentration of 3
      chemokines, ITAC, MCP-3, MIF, and increase in concentration of 4 chemokines,
      IP-10, MPIF-1, CXCL7, and 6Ckine, in amniotic fluid of women with fetal Down
      syndrome. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our findings, our hypothesis is that the
      chemokines may play role in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome. Defining their
      potential as biochemical markers of Down syndrome requires further investigation 
      on larger group of patients.

TI  - Central Core Disease
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Central core disease (CCD) is characterized by muscle
      weakness ranging from mild to severe. Most affected individuals have mild disease
      with symmetric proximal muscle weakness and variable involvement of facial and
      neck muscles. The extraocular muscles are often spared. Motor development is
      usually delayed, but in general, most affected individuals acquire independent
      ambulation. Life span is usually normal. Severe disease is early in onset with
      profound hypotonia often accompanied by poor fetal movement, spinal deformities, 
      hip dislocation, joint contractures, poor suck, and respiratory insufficiency
      requiring assisted ventilation. The outcome ranges from death in infancy to
      survival beyond age five years. The weakness in CCD is not typically progressive.
      DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CCD is based on clinical findings of muscle
      weakness, the histopathologic findings of characteristic cores on muscle biopsy, 
      and molecular genetic testing. Most CCD is associated with pathogenic variants in
      RYR1, the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor 1. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Physical therapy for hypotonia and weakness that may include
      stretching and mild to moderate low-impact exercise; assistive devices as needed 
      for ambulation; orthopedic surgery as needed for scoliosis, congenital hip
      dislocation, foot deformities; respiratory support, breathing exercises, chest
      physiotherapy as needed; dietary supplementation and nasogastric or gastrostomy
      feeding as needed. Prevention of secondary complications: Intervention as needed 
      to prevent respiratory compromise from scoliosis; immunization against influenza;
      prompt treatment of respiratory infection; mobility and physical therapy to
      prevent joint contractures. Surveillance: Routine assessment of spine for
      scoliosis, joints for contractures, respiratory parameters (e.g., respiratory
      rate, peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR], forced vital capacity [FVC], and forced
      expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]), motor abilities to determine need for
      physical therapy, occupational therapy, assistive devices; sleep studies when
      signs of nocturnal hypoxia are present. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Although
      the actual risk for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is unknown, it is
      prudent for individuals with CCD to avoid inhalational anesthetics and
      succinylcholine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the RYR1 pathogenic variant 
      is known, it is appropriate to offer at-risk relatives molecular genetic testing 
      to identify those with possible increased malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. 
      GENETIC COUNSELING: Central core disease (CCD) is usually inherited in an
      autosomal dominant (AD) manner but can be inherited in an autosomal recessive
      (AR) manner. Most individuals diagnosed with AD central core disease have an
      affected parent or an asymptomatic parent who has a pathogenic variant. The
      proportion of AD CCD caused by de novo pathogenic variants is unknown. Each child
      of an individual with AD CCD has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic
      variant. The parents of a child with AR CCD are obligate heterozygotes and
      therefore carry one mutated allele. Heterozygotes (carriers) are often
      asymptomatic. At conception, each sib of an individual with AR CCD has a 25%
      chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a
      25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Prenatal diagnosis for
      pregnancies at increased risk for AD or AR CCD is possible once the pathogenic
      variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member.

AB  - Sleep and sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as determinants of
      women's health and well-being, particularly in the context of the menstrual
      cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. At present, however, little is known about
      whether fertility is affected by sleep quantity and quality. That is, to what
      degree, and by what mechanisms, do sleep and/or its disturbances affect
      fertility? The purpose of this review is to synthesize what is known about sleep 
      disturbances in relation to reproductive capacity. A model is provided, whereby
      stress, sleep dysregulation, and circadian misalignment are delineated for their 
      potential relevance to infertility. Ultimately, if it is the case that sleep
      disturbance is associated with infertility, new avenues for clinical intervention
      may be possible.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated whether psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are
      prevalent amongst women in pregnancy and/or in the early postnatal phase, and
      whether the predictors identified in the literature for non-puerperal psychosis
      apply in a general sample of perinatal women. METHOD: 101 women in their third
      trimester of pregnancy completed questionnaire measures of mood, subjective
      well-being, sleep, expectations about labour, and PLEs. 66 of these participants 
      also completed questionnaires shortly after giving birth. The main outcome
      measures were scores on the Peters Delusions Inventory (PDI) and the Launay-Slade
      Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R). RESULTS: During pregnancy, 80% of the
      samples endorsed at least one item on the PDI, and 76% endorsed at least one item
      on the LSHS-R. Endorsement rates were lower postnatally, with rates of 59% and
      52% for the PDI and LSHS-R, respectively. Mean scores on the PDI were 3.07 during
      pregnancy and 1.61 postnatally. Mean scores on the LSHS-R were 8.38 during
      pregnancy and 5.24 postnatally. Hierarchical multiPLEs regression analyses
      revealed that ratings of depressive symptomatology significantly predicted PDI
      total score during pregnancy and LSHS-R total score postnatally, whilst
      postnatally, scores obtained on the PDI and LSHS-R postnatally were significantly
      predicted by scores on these measures during pregnancy. Fear in childbirth, but
      not in pregnancy, showed associations with PLEs but these associations were not
      maintained once multivariate analyses were conducted. CONCLUSIONS: The results of
      this study support the continuum model of psychosis, by illustrating that PLEs
      occur frequently in perinatal individuals without a diagnosis of severe mental
      illness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to determine demographic
      characteristics, health and sexual behaviors, and psychological health associated
      with pregnancy ambivalence. We used a cross-sectional design for our study.
      METHODS: A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted among
      nonpregnant women 16-40 years old from southeast Texas from July 2010 to August
      2011. The survey included questions pertaining to demographics, pregnancy
      intentions, health behaviors, sexual behaviors, violence exposure, pregnancy
      coercion, and psychological behaviors. Multivariate logistic regression analyses 
      were performed to determine differences between ambivalent and nonambivalent
      females. RESULTS: Of the 1,388 women included in this analysis, 529 (38%) were
      ambivalent toward pregnancy. Ambivalent women were younger (p=0.03), had fewer
      children living at home (p<0.01), and were less likely to have been previously
      pregnant (p=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that ambivalent women were more
      likely to smoke (p<0.01), sleep poorly (p=0.02), have had more sexual partners in
      the past month (p<0.01) and in their lifetime (p=0.01), not used contraception at
      last sex (p=0.01), be a victim of violence (p=0.01), and have experienced
      pregnancy coercion (p<0.01). In addition, these women exhibited higher scores on 
      scales measuring depressive symptoms (p=0.01) and perceived stress (p<0.01).
      CONCLUSIONS: Women ambivalent toward pregnancy are not only less likely to use
      contraception but also more likely to have unhealthy behaviors and psychological 
      risk factors. As this combination of characteristics may put a future pregnancy
      and child at risk, awareness about the possible consequences of pregnancy
      ambivalence needs to increase among the public and medical community. Providers
      need to focus efforts on screening for this patient population and preventive
      education through contraceptive counseling.

AB  - Heart disease remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in women in 
      the United States and worldwide. This review highlights known and emerging risk
      factors for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in women. Traditional Framingham risk
      factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, as well as
      lifestyle habits such as unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle are all
      modifiable. Health care providers should be aware of emerging cardiac risk
      factors in women such as adverse pregnancy outcomes, systemic autoimmune
      disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, and radiation-induced heart disease;
      psychosocial factors such as mental stress, depression, anxiety, low
      socioeconomic status, and work and marital stress play an important role in IHD
      in women. Appropriate recognition and management of an array of risk factors is
      imperative given the growing burden of IHD and need to deliver cost-effective,
      quality care for women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has established a number of risk factors that are
      associated with the onset of PTSD following childbirth. However, little is known 
      about factors that maintain PTSD symptoms. METHODS: This study is part of the
      Akershus Birth Cohort. Questionnaire data from pregnancy week 17, 8 weeks
      postpartum and 2 years postpartum were used. 1473 women completed all these three
      questionnaires and were included in the analyses. Post-traumatic stress symptoms 
      were measured with the Impact of Event Scale. Potential maintaining factors were 
      personality, sleep, support and life events. The factors that were significantly 
      correlated with post-traumatic stress symptoms were entered into regression
      analyses. Mediation analyses were run to test whether significant predictors
      would serve as mediator of post-traumatic stress symptoms at 8 weeks postpartum
      to post-traumatic stress symptoms at 2 years postpartum. RESULTS: We found
      several low to moderate associations between maintaining factors and PTSD
      symptoms two years postpartum. Adjusting for the starting point - PTSD symptoms 8
      weeks postpartum - only insomnia remained significantly associated. Further,
      insomnia mediated a small portion of the effect of PTSD symptoms 8 weeks
      postpartum to PTSD symptoms 2 years postpartum. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of the
      study include a relative homogeneous sample, modest effect sizes, low internal
      consistency of some of the measures and the challenge to distinguish insomnia
      from PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of postpartum PTSD might benefit from 
      addressing insomnia if present. Alleviating insomnia may itself reduce daytime
      symptoms of PTSD and it may also increase the efficacy of primary PTSD
      treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is defined by
      pruritus, elevated total fasting serum bile salts (TBS) and transaminases, and an
      increased risk of adverse fetal outcome. An accurate diagnostic marker is needed.
      Increased serum autotaxin correlates with cholestasis-associated pruritus. We
      aimed at unraveling the diagnostic accuracy of autotaxin in ICP. METHODS: Serum
      samples and placental tissue were collected from 44 women with uncomplicated
      pregnancies and 105 with pruritus and/or elevated serum transaminases. Autotaxin 
      serum levels were quantified enzymatically and by Western blotting, autotaxin
      gene expression by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Serum autotaxin was increased in
      ICP (mean +/- SD: 43.5 +/- 18.2 nmol ml(-1)min(-1), n=55, p<0.0001) compared to
      other pruritic disorders of pregnancy (16.8 +/- 6.7 nmol ml(-1)min(-1), n=33),
      pre-eclampsia complicated by HELLP-syndrome (16.8 +/- 8.9 nmol ml(-1)min(-1),
      n=17), and pregnant controls (19.6 +/- 5.7 nmol ml(-1)min(-1), n=44).
      Longitudinal analysis during pregnancy revealed a marked rise in serum autotaxin 
      with onset of ICP-related pruritus. Serum autotaxin was increased in women taking
      oral contraceptives. Increased serum autotaxin during ICP was not associated with
      increased autotaxin mRNA in placenta. With a cut-off value of 27.0 nmol
      ml(-1)min(-1), autotaxin had an excellent sensitivity and specificity in
      distinguishing ICP from other pruritic disorders or pre-eclampsia/HELLP-syndrome.
      Serum autotaxin displayed no circadian rhythm and was not influenced by food
      intake. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum autotaxin activity represents a highly
      sensitive, specific and robust diagnostic marker of ICP, distinguishing ICP from 
      other pruritic disorders of pregnancy and pregnancy-related liver diseases.
      Pregnancy and oral contraception increase serum autotaxin to a much lesser extent
      than ICP.

      factors.
PG  - 1093-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to identify the prevalence and clinical
      correlates and severity of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant women in
      mainland China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 1584 women (18-40
      years old) who came to a prenatal outpatient clinic to consult an obstetrician.
      Pregnant women were studied in each trimester, and assessments included
      interviews about RLS symptoms and related questions. Standardized questionnaires 
      include the International Restless Syndrome Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Questionnaire. Blood tests included levels of hemoglobin and mean
      corpuscular volume. RESULTS: RLS was diagnosed in 177 of 1584 women (11.2%); 4.2%
      were categorized as having pre-existing RLS and 54.8% reported onset of RLS
      symptoms after the 24th week. Multivariate analysis revealed that anemia was
      positively correlated with RLS. For the participants who first experienced RLS in
      pregnancy, RLS severity in the third trimester was more severe when compared with
      the first and second trimesters. Sleep disorders occurred more frequently in the 
      third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, RLS was frequent in pregnant Chinese 
      women, and anemia was identified as an independent predictor of the disease.
      Further, most participants reported their symptoms during the third trimester,
      and the severity of RLS and sleep disorders of participants was more prominent in
      the third trimester.

AB  - Approximately 4% of adults who have symptoms of insomnia resort to various
      hypnotic or sedating medications for acute symptom relief. Although typically a
      common practice for nonpregnant adults, this is not the case for the thousands of
      pregnant women who also report substantial sleep issues. Unfortunately, a paucity
      of randomized controlled trials in this population, scant empiric evidence
      regarding the appropriateness of prescribing options, and the concern of
      subsequent teratogenicity restricts the ability of clinicians to make informed
      decisions. We synthesized the current research regarding hypnotics and sedating
      medications used (both on- and off-label) during pregnancy and their association 
      with adverse outcomes. Medications that we investigated included benzodiazepines,
      hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and antihistamines.
      Overall, the examined studies showed no correlation of increased risk of
      congenital malformations. However, benzodiazepines and hypnotic benzodiazepine
      receptor agonists may increase rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, and/or
      small-for-gestational-age infants. The small number of studies and the small
      number of subjects prohibit any definitive interpretation regarding the
      consequences of the use of hypnotic or sedating medications in pregnancy.
      Additional case reports, randomized clinical trials, and epidemiologic studies
      are needed urgently.

AB  - Sleep deprivation in women resulting from their modern lifestyle, especially
      during pregnancy, is a serious concern as it can affect the health of the
      newborn. Anxiety disorders and cognitive deficits in the offspring are also on
      the rise. However, experimental studies on the effects of sleep loss during
      pregnancy, on emotional development and cognitive function of the newborn, are
      scanty in literature. In the current study, female rats were sleep-deprived for
      5h by gentle handling, during the 6 days of the third trimester (days 14-19 of
      pregnancy). The effects of this sleep deprivation on anxiety-related behaviors of
      pups during their peri-adolescence age were studied using elevated plus maze
      (EPM). In addition to body weights of dams and offspring, the maternal behavior
      was also monitored. The weanlings of sleep-deprived dams showed heightened
      risk-taking behavior as they made increased explorations into the open arms of
      EPM. They also showed higher mobility in comparison to the control group. Though 
      the body weights of sleep-deprived dams were comparable to those of the control
      group, their newborns had lower birth weight. Nevertheless, these pups gained
      weight and reached the control group values during the initial post-natal week.
      But after weaning, their rate of growth was lower than that of the control group.
      This is the first report providing evidences for the role of sleep during late
      pregnancy in shaping the neuropsychological development in offspring.

AB  - Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rodent pups are analogous to cries in human
      babies. There is reduction in USVs in pups after experimental deprivation of
      rapid eye movement sleep of dams during pregnancy. However, the effects of total 
      sleep deprivation on the USVs of newborns and their emotional development are not
      documented. Male pups born to the rats that underwent total sleep deprivation for
      5h during the third trimester made higher vocalizations, when tested on early
      postnatal days (pnds) in an isolation-paradigm. Their anxiety-related behaviors
      during pnds 25-28, were tested using elevated plus maze (EPM). In comparison to
      the control pups, weanlings of sleep-deprived dams made increased entries into
      the open arms and higher mobility in the EPM. Enhanced distress calls during
      early pnds and reduction in risk assessment in weanlings indicate a link between 
      the two behaviors. The USVs during ontogeny may provide early signals about
      altered emotional development.

TI  - Using surveillance data to inform a SUID reduction strategy in Massachusetts.
PG  - 12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-supine infant sleep positions put infants at risk for sudden
      unexpected infant death (SUID). Disparities in safe sleep practices are
      associated with maternal income and race/ethnicity. The Special Supplemental
      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is a nutrition supplement
      program for low-income (</=185% Federal Poverty Level) pregnant and postpartum
      women. Currently in Massachusetts, approximately 40% of pregnant/postpartum women
      are WIC clients. To inform the development of a SUID intervention strategy, the
      Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) investigated the association
      between WIC status and infant safe sleep practices among postpartum Massachusetts
      mothers using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)
      survey. METHODS: PRAMS is an ongoing statewide health surveillance system of new 
      mothers conducted by the MDPH in collaboration with the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC). PRAMS includes questions about infant sleep
      position and mothers' prenatal WIC status. Risk Ratio (RR) and 95 percent
      confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for infant supine sleep positioning by 
      WIC enrollment, yearly and in aggregate (2007-2010). RESULTS/OUTCOMES: The
      aggregate (2007-2010) weighted sample included 276,252 women (weighted n
      approximately 69,063 women/year; mean survey response rate 69%). Compared to
      non-WIC mothers, WIC mothers were less likely to usually or always place their
      infants in supine sleeping positions [RR = 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.81)]. Overall,
      significant differences were found for each year (2007, 2008, 2009, 2010), and in
      aggregate (2007-2010) by WIC status. CONCLUSION: Massachusetts WIC mothers more
      frequently placed their babies in non-supine positions than non-WIC mothers.
      While this relationship likely reflects the demographic factors associated with
      safe sleep practices (e.g., maternal income and race/ethnicity), the finding
      informed the deployment of an intervention strategy for SUID prevention. Given
      WIC's statewide infrastructure and the large proportion of pregnant/postpartum
      women in Massachusetts that are enrolled in WIC, a WIC-based safe sleep
      intervention may be an effective SUID reduction strategy with potential national 
      application.

TI  - External nasal dilators: definition, background, and current uses.
PG  - 491-504
LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S67543 [doi]
AB  - Our goal was to revise the literature about external nasal dilators (ENDs) as to 
      their definition, history, and current uses. We reviewed journals in the PubMed
      and MEDLINE databases. The current uses hereby presented and discussed are
      physical exercise, nasal congestion and sleep, snoring, pregnancy, cancer, and
      healthy individuals. Numerous studies have shown that ENDs increase the
      cross-sectional area of the nasal valve, reducing nasal resistance and transnasal
      inspiratory pressure and stabilizing the lateral nasal vestibule, avoiding its
      collapse during final inspiration. These effects also facilitate breathing and
      are beneficial to patients with nasal obstruction. Furthermore, END use is
      simple, noninvasive, painless, affordable, and bears minimum risk to the user.
      Most studies have limited sample size and are mainly focused on physical
      exercise. In conclusion, ENDs seem useful, so further studies involving potential
      effects on the performance of physical tests and improvements in sleep quality
      are necessary, especially in children and teenagers.

TI  - [Circadian rhythm of blood pressure in patients with chronic hypertension and
      pregnancy].
PG  - 604-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during 24 hours shows a blood
      pressure variability. The prevalence of chronic hypertension in pregnant women is
      1-5%, so it is important to know the changes in blood pressure and cardiovascular
      risk and prevent complications to the mother and fetus. OBJECTIVE: To know the
      circadian rhythm of the blood pressure in the chronic hypertensive pregnant
      patients, through the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
      A cross-sectional and descriptive study included chronic hypertensive pregnant
      patients, with > 20 weeks of gestation. Assessment of factors related to
      gynaecologic characteristics, according to the inclusion criteria underwent a
      washout period of two weeks and they were monitored with a Spacelabs 90207
      monitor blood pressure. Quantitative variables by Student t test, one-way ANOVA
      and Pearson correlation were analysed. RESULTS: 16 chronic hypertensive pregnant 
      patients were included, whose ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the
      systolic blood pressure in 24 hours averaged 117.12 +/- 5.85 mmHg; 24 hours
      diastolic blood pressure 71.31 +/- 5.89 mmHg; daytime systolic blood pressure
      120.18 +/- 5.75 mmHg, nocturnal systolic blood pressure 110.31 +/- 8.41 mmHg;
      daytime diastolic blood pressure 75.43 +/- 7.32 mmHg, nocturnal diastolic blood
      pressure 64.25 +/- 8.27 mmHg. Significant differences between daytime and night
      time were found. CONCLUSION: 56% of chronic hypertensive pregnant patients had no
      nocturnal reduction in systolic blood pressure and 43.75% had no nocturnal
      changes on diastolic blood pressure. The fact that 50% of patients were
      non-dippers force us to use long-action antihypertensive therapy and obtain
      control of the blood pressure for 24 hours.

TI  - Screening of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy: differences in predictive 
      values of questionnaires across trimesters.
PG  - 157-63
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.4464 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of Berlin and Stop-Bang questionnaires in detecting 
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) across trimesters of pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant
      women from a high-risk pregnancy clinic were recruited to complete sleep
      evaluations including Berlin and Stop-Bang Questionnaires. Overnight testing with
      Watch-PAT200 for diagnosis of OSA (cutoff point of apnea-hypopnea index >/=5
      events/h) was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-two singleton pregnant women
      participated in the study. Enrollment consisted of 23, 24, and 25 women during
      first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Of 72 pregnancies, 23 patients
      (31.9%) had OSA. Prevalence of OSA classified by trimesters from first to third
      was 30.4%, 33.33%, and 32.0%, respectively. Overall predictive values of Berlin
      and Stop-Bang questionnaires were fair (ROC area under curve, AUC 0.72 for
      Berlin, p = 0.003; 0.75 for Stop-Bang, p = 0.001). When categorized according to 
      trimesters, predictive values substantially improved in second (AUC: 0.84 for
      Berlin; 0.78 for Stop-Bang) and third trimesters (AUC: 0.81 for Berlin; 0.75 for 
      Stop-Bang), whereas performances of both questionnaires during first trimester
      were poorer (AUC: 0.49 for Berlin; 0.71 for Stop-Bang). Multivariate analyses
      show that pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) in first trimester, snore often in 
      second trimester, and weight gain and pregnancy BMI in third trimester were
      significantly associated with OSA. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk pregnancy, Berlin
      and Stop-Bang questionnaires were of limited usefulness in the first trimester.
      However their predictive values are acceptable as pregnancy progresses,
      particularly in second trimester. OSA in pregnancy seems to be a dynamic process 
      with different predictors association during each trimester.

AB  - Changes in the maternal environment can induce fetal adaptations that result in
      the progression of chronic diseases in the offspring. The objective of the
      present study was to evaluate the effects of maternal chronic sleep restriction
      on blood pressure, renal function and cardiac baroreflex response on male
      offspring at adult age. Female 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided in two
      experimental groups: control (C) and chronic sleep restricted (CSR). Pregnancy
      was confirmed by vaginal smear. Chronic sleep restricted females were subjected
      to sleep restriction by the multiple platform technique for 20 h daily, between
      the 1st and 20th day of pregnancy. After birth, the litters were reduced to 6
      rats per mother, and were designated as offspring from control (OC) and offspring
      from chronic sleep restricted (OCSR). Indirect blood pressure (BPi - tail cuff)
      was measured by plethysmography in male offspring at 3 months old. Following, the
      renal function and cardiac baroreflex response were analyzed. Values of BPi in
      OCSR were significantly higher compared to OC [OC: 127 +/- 2.6 (19); OCSR: 144
      +/- 2.5 (17) mmHg]. The baroreflex sensitivity to the increase of blood pressure 
      was reduced in OCSR [Slope: OC: -2.6 +/- 0.15 (9); OCRS: -1.6 +/- 0.13 (9)].
      Hypothalamic activity of ACE2 was significantly reduced in OCSR compared to OC
      [OC: 97.4 +/- 15 (18); OSR: 60.2 +/- 3.6 (16) UAF/min/protein mg]. Renal function
      alteration was noticed by the increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
      observed in OCSR [OC: 6.4 +/- 0.2 (10); OCSR: 7.4 +/- 0.3 (7)]. Chronic sleep
      restriction during pregnancy caused in the offspring hypertension, altered
      cardiac baroreflex response, reduced ACE-2 activity in the hypothalamus and renal
      alterations. Our data suggest that the reduction of sleeping time along the
      pregnancy is able to modify maternal homeostasis leading to functional
      alterations in offspring.

      cerebral ischaemia in late-gestation fetal sheep.
PG  - 56-65
LID - 10.1159/000368306 [doi]
AB  - There is considerable evidence that a mild, non-injurious insult can protect
      (precondition) against a subsequent injurious insult. Typically, protection is
      seen when the gap between insults is several days to a week. However, the effect 
      of mild but persistent hypoxia is unknown. In this study we examined the
      hypothesis that mild pre-existing hypoxia (PaO2<17 mm Hg) would reduce neural
      injury in chronically instrumented late-gestation (0.85 gestation) fetal sheep
      exposed to 30 min of global cerebral ischaemia induced by bilateral carotid
      artery occlusion (normoxia: n=9 vs. pre-existing hypoxia: n=9) or normoxia plus
      sham ischaemia (sham controls: n=9). Histopathology was assessed after 7 days of 
      recovery. Fetuses with pre-existing hypoxia had lower PaO2 values (16.1+/-0.6 vs.
      26.0+/-1.1 mm Hg) and were lighter at post-mortem (4,033+/-412 vs. 5,261+/-238 g)
      compared to normoxic fetuses. Cerebral ischaemia was associated with secondary
      cortical oedema and seizures, reduced final EEG power, loss of sleep state
      cycling, and significant loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, with no
      significant effect of pre-existing hypoxia. Pre-existing hypoxia was associated
      with a significantly attenuated rise in mean arterial pressure between 18 and 36 
      h and slower resolution of cortical oedema between 96 and 150 h after ischaemia. 
      These data suggest that chronic hypoxia is not associated with a significant
      preconditioning effect.

TI  - The impact of sleep healthy behavior education on the quality of life in the
      pregnant women with sleep disorder: A randomized control trial in the year 2012.
PG  - 508-16
AB  - BACKGROUND: About 79% of pregnant women in the world suffer from sleep disorders.
      These disorders result from physiological changes during pregnancy, originate
      from different factors, and can affect pregnant women's quality of life before,
      during, and after delivery. This study aimed to investigate the effect of sleep
      healthy behavior education on the quality of life among pregnant women with sleep
      disorders in the second trimester. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a clinical
      trial conducted on 112 pregnant women with sleep disorders referring to two
      selected health care centers in Makou affiliated to Urmia University of Medical
      Sciences during June-Oct 2012. Data collection tools included demographic
      characteristics questionnaire, Pittsburgh Standard Sleep Quality questionnaire,
      and World Health Organization, Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) WHOQOL-BREEF
      questionnaire. Sampling was done by convenient sampling. Firstly, Pittsburg
      Standard Sleep Quality Questionnaire was completed and the pregnant women with
      sleep disorders were selected as the subjects. After completion of sampling, the 
      subjects were randomly assigned to two groups of study and control. Education of 
      sleep health behavior was provided in the study group by the researcher during
      four 1-h sessions. Then, WHOQOL-BREEF and Pittsburg Standard Sleep Quality
      questionnaire were completed again in two groups in the first follow-up session
      (1 month after educational intervention) and in the second follow-up session (2
      months after educational intervention) held by the researcher. Control group only
      received conventional prenatal care. The obtained data were analyzed by
      Chi-square test, independent t-test, Fisher's exact and repeated measure tests
      through SPSS 18. RESULTS: Mean scores of quality of life showed an increase in 1 
      and 2 months after intervention in the study group compared to the control group.
      A significant difference was observed in the QOL in the two groups, 1 month (P < 
      0.000) and 2 months (P < 0.001) after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Education of
      sleep healthy behaviors was effective on the QOL of pregnant women with sleep
      disorders. The results obtained in the present study can be used to support the
      pregnant women with sleep disorders and sleep disorders clinics, as well as for
      administration of prenatal care.

TI  - Chiari 1 Malformation Presenting as Central Sleep Apnea during Pregnancy: A Case 
      Report, Treatment Considerations, and Review of the Literature.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2014.00195 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Chiari malformation (CM) type-1 frequently causes obstructive or central
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in both adults and children, although SDB is
      relatively rare as a presenting manifestation in the absence of other
      neurological symptoms. The definitive treatment of symptomatic CM is surgical
      decompression. We report a case that is, to our knowledge, a novel manifestation 
      of central sleep apnea (CSA) due to CM type-1 with severe exacerbation and
      initial clinical presentation during pregnancy. METHODS: Case report from
      tertiary care comprehensive sleep medicine center with literature review of SDB
      manifestations associated with CM type-1. PubMed search was conducted between
      January 1982 and October 2013. RESULTS: We report a 25-year-old woman with severe
      CSA initially presenting during her first pregnancy that eventually proved to be 
      caused by CM type-1. The patient was successfully treated preoperatively by
      adaptive servoventilation (ASV), with effective resolution of SDB following
      surgical decompression, and without recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy. Our
      literature review found that 58% of CM patients with SDB had OSA alone, 28% had
      CSA alone, 8 (10%) had mixed OSA/CSA, and 6 (8%) had hypoventilation. Of CM
      patients presenting with SDB, 50% had OSA, 42% had CSA, 8% had mixed OSA/CSA, and
      10.4% had hypoventilation. We speculate that CSA may develop in CM patients in
      whom brainstem compression results in excessive central chemoreflex sensitivity
      with consequent hypocapnic CSA. CONCLUSION: Chiari malformation type-1 may
      present with a diversity of SDB manifestations, and timely recognition and
      surgical referral are necessary to prevent further neurological deficits. ASV
      therapy can effectively manage CSA caused by CM type-1, which may initially
      present during pregnancy.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea and the risk of perinatal outcomes: a meta-analysis of
      cohort studies.
PG  - 6982
LID - 10.1038/srep06982 [doi]
AB  - Inconsistent information exists in the relationship between obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) and perinatal outcomes. This study was intended to investigate
      whether OSA in pregnant women has a potential to elevate the incidence of the
      maternal and neonatal outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of all available
      cohort studies. Five cohort studies including 977 participants were eligible for 
      inclusion. The association between OSA and the risk of perinatal outcomes was
      expressed as relative risks (RR), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Our results 
      revealed that OSA group was associated with more frequent preeclampsia (RR 1.96; 
      95% CI 1.34 to 2.86), preterm birth (RR 1.90; 95%CI 1.24 to 2.91), cesarean
      delivery (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.29) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
      (RR 2.65; 95% CI 1.86 to 3.76). On analyzing data for the prevalence of
      gestational diabetes and small gestational age (SGA) < 10th percentile (RR 1.40; 
      95% CI 0.62 to 3.19, and RR 0.64; 95%CI 0.33 to1.24, respectively), there were no
      significant differences in both group. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate 
      that OSA in pregnant women significantly increases the incidence of maternal and 
      neonatal outcomes, which is associated with more frequent preeclampsia, preterm
      birth, cesarean delivery and NICU admission.

TI  - Acute and long-term behavioral outcome of infants and children exposed in utero
      to either maternal depression or antidepressants: a review of the literature.
PG  - e1142-52
LID - 10.4088/JCP.13r08926 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors reviewed the published literature on the acute and
      long-term neurobehavioral effects on infants and children of either in utero
      exposure to maternal depression or in utero exposure to antidepressants. DATA
      SOURCES: The PubMed electronic database was searched to locate 292
      English-language studies from the first available year to October 2013 using the 
      keywords pregnancy, antidepressants, depression, perinatal, and neurobehavioral. 
      STUDY SELECTION: The authors reviewed only prospective studies that assessed the 
      impact of maternal depression during pregnancy or maternal antidepressant
      treatment during pregnancy on (1) clearly defined short-term behavioral outcomes 
      in infants (perinatal outcome) or (2) longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants 
      and children (neurodevelopmental outcome). DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were included
      if they were prospective and assessed the impact of maternal depression or
      maternal antidepressant treatment during pregnancy on clearly measurable,
      objective short-term and longer-term behavioral outcomes in infants and children.
      RESULTS: Untreated depression during pregnancy is associated with short-term
      neonatal effects, including increased distress after delivery, less than optimal 
      orientation and motor activity, and disrupted sleep. Longer-term effects on
      neurobehavioral outcome have also been reported, including disruptive social
      behavior, depression, and changes in the period of sensitivity for language
      discrimination. Antidepressant exposure during pregnancy is associated with
      adverse short-term perinatal symptomatology, including effects on autonomic and
      motor activity, habituation, and sleep. Longer-term studies of neurobehavioral
      outcomes of in utero antidepressant exposure suggest potential effects on gross
      motor function and language development but not cognition. CONCLUSIONS: In utero 
      exposure to either maternal depression or antidepressants carries risks to the
      developing fetus. Treatment decisions regarding whether and how to treat
      depression during pregnancy must be made on an individual basis, with careful
      consideration of the impact of these decisions on both mother and infant.

TI  - Male fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking sleep apnea
      in mice.
PG  - 1757-65
LID - 10.5665/sleep.4166 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by intermittent 
      hypoxia and oxidative stress. However, it is unknown whether intermittent hypoxia
      mimicking OSA modifies male fertility. We tested the hypothesis that male
      fertility is reduced by chronic intermittent hypoxia mimicking OSA in a mouse
      model. DESIGN: Case-control comparison in a murine model. SETTING: University
      research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen F1 (C57BL/6xCBA) male mice.
      INTERVENTIONS: Mice were subjected to a pattern of periodic hypoxia (20 sec at 5%
      O2 followed by 40 sec of room air) 6 h/day for 60 days or normoxia. After this
      period, mice performed a mating trial to determine effective fertility by
      assessing the number of pregnant females and fetuses. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS:
      After euthanasia, oxidative stress in testes was assessed by measuring the
      expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1)
      by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Sperm motility was determined
      by Integrated Semen Analysis System (ISAS). Intermittent hypoxia significantly
      increased testicular oxidative stress, showing a reduction in the expression of
      Gpx1 and Sod1 by 38.9% and 34.4%, respectively, as compared with normoxia (P <
      0.05). Progressive sperm motility was significantly reduced from 27.0 +/- 6.4% in
      normoxia to 12.8 +/- 1.8% in the intermittent hypoxia group (P = 0.04). The
      proportion of pregnant females and number of fetuses per mating was significantly
      lower in the intermittent hypoxia group (0.33 +/- 0.10 and 2.45 +/- 0.73,
      respectively) than in normoxic controls (0.72 +/- 0.16 and 5.80 +/- 1.24,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the intermittent hypoxia
      associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could induce fertility reduction in
      male patients with this sleep breathing disorder.

      physiological consequences of smoking while pregnant, 12-25% of all babies
      worldwide are born to mothers who smoked during their pregnancies. Chief among
      the negative legacies bestowed to the exposed individual is an enhanced
      proclivity postnatally to addict to drugs of abuse, which suggests that the drug 
      exposure during gestation changed the developing brain in such a way that biased 
      it towards addiction. Glutamate signalling has been shown to be altered by
      prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) and glutamate is the major excitatory
      neurotransmitter within the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT), which is a
      brainstem region importantly involved in responding to motivational stimuli and
      critical in development of drug addiction-associated behaviours, however, it is
      unknown whether PNE alters glutamate signalling within this nucleus. Accordingly,
      we used calcium imaging, to evaluate AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated calcium
      responses in LDT brain slices from control and PNE mice. We also investigated
      whether the positive AMPA receptor modulator cyclothiazide (CYZ) had differential
      actions on calcium in the LDT following PNE. Our data indicated that PNE
      significantly decreased AMPA receptor-mediated calcium responses, and altered the
      neuronal calcium response to consecutive NMDA applications within the LDT.
      Furthermore, CYZ strongly potentiated AMPA-induced responses, however, this
      action was significantly reduced in the LDT of PNE mice when compared with
      enhancements in responses in control LDT cells. Immunohistochemical processing
      confirmed that calcium imaging recordings were obtained from the LDT nucleus as
      determined by presence of cholinergic neurons. Our results contribute to the body
      of evidence suggesting that neurobiological changes are induced if gestation is
      accompanied by nicotine exposure. We conclude that in light of the role played by
      the LDT in motivated behaviour, the cellular changes in the LDT induced by
      exposures to nicotine prenatally, when combined with alterations in other
      reward-related regions, could contribute to the increased susceptibility to
      smoking observed in the offspring.

TI  - Technical Versus Public Spheres: A Feminist Analysis of Women's Rhetoric in the
      Twilight Sleep Debates of 1914-1916.
PG  - 1076-88

AB  - Twilight Sleep (TS) describes the delivery, via an injection, of an amnestic drug
      cocktail to a parturient woman throughout labor. In order to understand the
      development of modern-day rhetoric surrounding childbirth methods and procedures,
      this article explores the debate over TS between the public and technical sphere 
      in New York City between 1914 and 1916 and examines the ways in which this debate
      altered obstetric health care for middle- and upper-class White women. The public
      response to this campaign posed a direct challenge to male obstetricians in New
      York City, many of whom were ill-equipped, both literally and figuratively, to
      use this procedure. Using a feminist rhetorical criticism, we examined the pro-TS
      rhetoric of women writers in New York City, the methods they borrowed from the
      women's movement, and the ensuing dialogue between the public and technical
      spheres. For this study, we analyzed journal and newspaper articles, a pamphlet, 
      a collection of pro-TS organizational documents, letters to the editor, and books
      published about TS and the history of birth. Lastly, we analyzed theoretical
      notions of childbirth in women's health and communication studies. After
      examining the TS debate, we found that birth practices for middle- and
      upper-class women in New York City shifted and the obstetric community gained
      ascendancy over female midwifery. We also found that in certain instances, the
      rhetoric of pro-TS activists was more technically accurate than the rhetoric of
      some physicians. Hence the TS debate emerged from an argument over the right to
      use technical language in the technical and/or the public sphere. Conclusions and
      implications offered by this historical, feminist analysis question our current
      understanding of women's health and birthing practices, doctor-patient
      communication, and patient empowerment and access to technical knowledge.

AB  - Individual differences in sleep patterns of children may have developmental
      origins. In the present study, two factors known to influence behavioural
      development, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) genotype and prenatal Fe-deficient (ID)
      diet, were examined for their influences on sleep patterns in juvenile rhesus
      monkeys. Sleep patterns were assessed based on a threshold for inactivity as
      recorded by activity monitors. Pregnant monkeys were fed diets containing either 
      100 parts per million (ppm) Fe (Fe sufficient, IS) or 10 ppm Fe (ID). At 3-4
      months of age, male offspring were genotyped for polymorphisms of the MAOA gene
      that lead to high or low transcription. At 1 and 2 years of age, sleep patterns
      were assessed. Several parameters of sleep architecture changed with age. At 1
      year of age, monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype demonstrated a trend towards more
      sleep episodes at night compared with those with the high-MAOA genotype. When
      monkeys reached 2 years of age, prenatal ID reversed this trend; ID in the
      low-MAOA group resulted in sleep fragmentation, more awakenings at night and more
      sleep episodes during the day when compared with prenatal IS in this genotype.
      The ability to consolidate sleep during the dark cycle was disrupted by prenatal 
      ID, specifically in monkeys with the low-MAOA genotype.

TI  - Melatonin: shedding light on infertility?--A review of the recent literature.
PG  - 98
LID - 10.1186/s13048-014-0098-y [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the negative impact of oxidative stress on fertility has become 
      widely recognised. Several studies have demonstrated its negative effect on the
      number and quality of retrieved oocytes and embryos following in-vitro
      fertilisation (IVF). Melatonin, a pineal hormone that regulates circadian
      rhythms, has also been shown to exhibit unique oxygen scavenging abilities. Some 
      studies have suggested a role for melatonin in gamete biology. Clinical studies
      also suggest that melatonin supplementation in IVF may lead to better pregnancy
      rates. Here we present a critical review and summary of the current literature
      and provide suggestions for future well designed clinical trials.

TI  - Effect of caffeine on preterm infants' cerebral cortical activity: an
      observational study.
PG  - 2090-5
LID - 10.3109/14767058.2014.978757 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our first aim was to investigate the effects of caffeine on preterm
      infants' respiratory functions and brain cortical activity (conventional and
      amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (cEEG and aEEG)). Secondary aim was
      to study its long-term effects on respiratory system and electroencephalographic 
      maturation by 36 weeks post-menstrual age. METHODS: Prospective observational
      study on 33 consecutively admitted preterm infants less than 34-weeks-gestation. 
      cEEG and aEEG, cardiopulmonary and sleep state were recorded in 20 preterm
      infants, before, during and 2-hours after intravenous (IV) caffeine (caffeine
      Group), and for 13 preterms (control group). Both groups were subjected to
      assessment of cerebral cortical maturation by cEEG and aEEG at 36-weeks
      post-menstrual age as an outcome measure. RESULTS: IV caffeine administration
      significantly increased heart rate (p = 0.000), mean arterial blood pressure (p =
      0.000), capillary oxygen saturation (p = 0.003), arousability (p = 0.000) and
      aEEG continuity (p = 0.002) after half an hour. No clinical seizures were
      recorded and non-significant difference was found in electrographic seizures
      activity in cEEG. At 36-weeks post-conceptional age, NICU stay was significantly 
      longer in controls (p = 0.022). aEEG score was significantly higher in caffeine
      group than the control group, (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Caffeine increases
      preterm infants' cerebral cortical activity during infusion and results in
      cerebral cortical maturation at 36weeks, without increase in seizure activity.

TI  - Association between maternal symptoms of sleep disordered breathing and fetal
      telomere length.
PG  - 559-66
LID - 10.5665/sleep.4570 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Our investigation aims to assess the impact of symptoms of
      maternal sleep-disordered breathing, specifically sleep apnea risk and daytime
      sleepiness, on fetal leukocyte telomere length. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING:
      Pregnant women were recruited upon hospital delivery admission. INTERVENTIONS:
      Sleep exposure outcomes were measured using the Berlin Questionnaire to quantify 
      sleep apnea and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure daytime sleepiness.
      Participants were classified as "High Risk" or "Low Risk" for sleep apnea based
      on responses to the Berlin, while "Normal" or "Abnormal" daytime sleepiness was
      determined based on responses to the Epworth. DESIGN: Neonatal umbilical cord
      blood samples (N = 67) were collected and genomic DNA was isolated from cord
      blood leukocytes using Quantitative PCR. A ratio of relative telomere length was 
      derived by telomere repeat copy number and single copy gene copy number (T/S
      ratio) and used to compare telomere lengths. Bootstrap and ANOVA statistical
      procedures were employed. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: On the Berlin, 68.7% of
      participants were classified as Low Risk while 31.3% were classified as High Risk
      for sleep apnea. According to the Epworth scale, 80.6% were determined to have
      Normal daytime sleepiness, and 19.4% were found to have Abnormal daytime
      sleepiness. The T/S ratio among pregnant women at High Risk for sleep apnea was
      significantly shorter than for those at Low Risk (P value < 0.05), and the T/S
      ratio among habitual snorers was significantly shorter than among non-habitual
      snorers (P value < 0.05). Although those with Normal Sleepiness had a longer T/S 
      ratio than those with Abnormal Sleepiness, the difference was not statistically
      significant. CONCLUSION: Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating
      shortened telomere length among fetuses exposed to maternal symptoms of sleep
      disordered breathing during pregnancy, and suggest sleep disordered breathing as 
      a possible mechanism of accelerated chromosomal aging.

TI  - Sex dimorphism in late gestational sleep fragmentation and metabolic dysfunction 
      in offspring mice.
PG  - 545-57
LID - 10.5665/sleep.4568 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive sleep fragmentation (SF) is common in pregnant women.
      Adult-onset metabolic disorders may begin during early development and exhibit
      substantial sex dimorphism. We hypothesized that metabolic dysfunction induced by
      gestational SF in male mice would not be apparent in female littermates. METHODS:
      Body weight and food consumption were measured weekly in male and female
      offspring after late gestational SF or control sleep (SC). At 20 weeks, plasma
      leptin, adiponectin, lipid profiles, and insulin and glucose tolerance tests were
      assessed. Leptin and adiponectin, M1, and M2 macrophage messenger RNA expression 
      and polarity were examined. Adiponectin gene promoter methylation levels in
      several tissues were assessed. RESULTS: Food intake, body weight, visceral fat
      mass, and insulin resistance were higher, and adiponectin levels lower in male
      but not female offspring exposed to gestational SF. However, dyslipidemia was
      apparent in both male and female offspring exposed to SF, albeit of lesser
      magnitude. In visceral fat, leptin messenger RNA expression was selectively
      increased and adiponectin expression was decreased in male offspring exposed to
      gestational SF, but adiponectin was increased in exposed female offspring.
      Differences in adipokine expression also emerged in liver, subcutaneous fat, and 
      muscle. Increased M1 macrophage markers were present in male offspring exposed to
      SF (SFOM) while increased M2 markers emerged in SF in female offspring (SFOF).
      Similarly, significant differences emerged in the methylation patterns of
      adiponectin promoter in SFOM and SFOF. CONCLUSION: Gestational sleep
      fragmentation increases the susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome in
      male but not in female offspring, most likely via epigenetic changes. Thus, sleep
      perturbations impose long-term detrimental effects to the fetus manifesting as
      sex dimorphic metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

TI  - Changes in motor behavior during pregnancy in rats: the basis for a possible
      animal model of restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 436-41
LID - S0100-72032014001000436 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pregnant women have a 2-3 fold higher probability of developing restless
      legs syndrome (RLS - sleep-related movement disorders) than general population.
      This study aims to evaluate the behavior and locomotion of rats during pregnancy 
      in order to verify if part of these animals exhibit some RLS-like features.
      METHODS: We used 14 female 80-day-old Wistar rats that weighed between 200 and
      250 g. The rats were distributed into control (CTRL) and pregnant (PN) groups.
      After a baseline evaluation of their behavior and locomotor activity in an
      open-field environment, the PN group was inducted into pregnancy, and their
      behavior and locomotor activity were evaluated on days 3, 10 and 19 of pregnancy 
      and in the post-lactation period in parallel with the CTRL group. The serum iron 
      and transferrin levels in the CTRL and PN groups were analyzed in blood collected
      after euthanasia by decapitation. RESULTS: There were no significant differences 
      in the total ambulation, grooming events, fecal boli or urine pools between the
      CTRL and PN groups. However, the PN group exhibited fewer rearing events,
      increased grooming time and reduced immobilization time than the CTRL group
      (ANOVA, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pregnant rats show
      behavioral and locomotor alterations similar to those observed in animal models
      of RLS, demonstrating to be a possible animal model of this sleep disorder.

TI  - Perceived sleep quality is worse than objective parameters of sleep in pregnant
      women with a mental disorder.
PG  - 1137-41
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.4118 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disturbed sleep during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric 
      outcomes and less mental well-being. In pregnant women with a mental disorder,
      who frequently suffer from sleep problems, it is unknown whether predominantly
      objective or subjective sleep quality is more affected. To clarify this, we
      compared objective and subjective parameters of sleep quality between patients
      and healthy controls during pregnancy. METHODS: This observational study was
      embedded in an ongoing study among pregnant women with a mental disorder at the
      department of Psychiatry of Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, the
      Netherlands. We compared 21 pregnant women with a confirmed mental disorder with 
      33 healthy controls (gestational age, 23-29 weeks). To measure objective
      parameters of sleep quality, all participants continuously wore a wrist actigraph
      for 7 days and nights. Subjective sleep quality was retrospectively assessed
      using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and on a daily basis with the
      Subjective Sleep Quality-scale (SSQ). Differences in parameters of sleep between 
      patients and controls were tested using a multivariate linear regression analysis
      adjusted for parity, gestational age, educational level, and employment status.
      RESULTS: Objective parameters of sleep quality and subjective sleep quality as
      assessed by the PSQI did not differ significantly between patients and controls. 
      Daily sleep reports showed that, relative to controls, patients had a
      significantly worse average SSQ-score (5.2 vs. 7.6, adjusted beta = 0.12, 95%CI =
      0.03-0.53, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our exploratory study suggests that perceived 
      sleep quality reported on a daily basis by pregnant women with a mental disorder 
      is worse than the sleep quality as measured by wrist actigraphy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence of self-reported abnormal sleep duration
      and excessive daytime sleepiness in pregnancy among Maori (indigenous New
      Zealanders) and non-Maori women versus the general population, and to examine the
      influence of socio-demographic factors. METHODS: Self-reported total sleep time
      (TST) in 24-hrs, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and socio-demographic
      information were obtained from nullipara and multipara women aged 20-46 yrs at
      35-37 weeks pregnant (358 Maori and 717 non-Maori), and women in the general
      population (381 Maori and 577 non-Maori). RESULTS: After controlling for
      ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and employment status, pregnant women
      average 30 min less TST than women in the general population. The distribution of
      TST was also greater in pregnant women, who were 3 times more likely to be short 
      sleepers (</=6 h) and 1.9 times more likely to be long sleepers (>9 h). In
      addition, pregnant women were 1.8 times more likely to report excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS). Pregnant women >30 years of age experienced greater age-related
      declines in TST. Identifying as Maori, being unemployed, and working at night
      increased the likelihood of reporting abnormal sleep duration across all women
      population in this study. EDS also more likely occurred among Maori women and
      women who worked at night. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy increases the prevalence of
      abnormal sleep duration and EDS, which are also higher among Maori than non-Maori
      women and those who do night work. Health professionals responsible for the care 
      of pregnant women need to be well-educated about the importance of sleep and
      discuss sleep issues with the women they care for.

TI  - Safe sleep practices in a New Zealand community and development of a Sudden
      Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) risk assessment instrument.
PG  - 263

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions to prevent sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI)
      have generally been population wide interventions instituted after case-control
      studies identified specific childcare practices associated with sudden death.
      While successful overall, in New Zealand (NZ), the rates are still relatively
      high by international comparison. This study aims to describe childcare practices
      related to SUDI prevention messages in a New Zealand community, and to develop
      and explore the utility of a risk assessment instrument based on international
      guidelines and evidence. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study of 209 infants
      recruited antenatally. Participant characteristics and infant care data were
      collected by questionnaire at: baseline (third trimester), and monthly from
      infant age 3 weeks through 23 weeks. Published meta-analyses data were used to
      estimate individual risk ratios for 6 important SUDI risk factors which, when
      combined, yielded a "SUDI risk score". RESULTS: Most infants were at low risk for
      SUDI with 72% at the lowest or slightly elevated risk (combined risk ratio
      </=1.5). There was a high prevalence of the safe practices: supine sleeping
      (86-89% over 3-19 weeks), mother not smoking (90-92% over 3-19 weeks), and not
      bed sharing at a young age (87% at 3 weeks). Five independent predictors of a
      high SUDI risk score were: higher parity (P =0.028), younger age (P =0.030), not 
      working or caring for other children antenatally (P =0.031), higher depression
      scores antenatally (P =0.036), and lower education (P =0.042). CONCLUSIONS:
      Groups within the community identified as priorities for education about safe
      sleep practices beyond standard care are mothers who are young, have high parity,
      low educational levels, and have symptoms of depression antenatally. These
      findings emphasize the importance of addressing maternal depression as a
      modifiable risk factor in pregnancy.

TI  - The effect of impaired sleep on preterm labour.
PG  - 62-7
LID - 10.7727/wimj.2012.305 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance has become an important health problem for pregnant
      women. In fact, pregnancy-associated sleep disorder has been recognized as a
      distinct clinical entity. We aimed to study the relationship between sleep
      disturbance and preterm birth during pregnancy in a sample of Iranian women.
      METHODS: In this analytical cohort study, 231 pregnant women in their 28th-32nd
      gestational week were recruited, using the multistage sampling method, from four 
      healthcare centres in Ardabil, Iran, during 2010. The women were followed-up
      until 37-week gestation. One hundred and twelve women did not have sleep
      disturbances while 119 women had sleep disturbances. The Insomnia Severity Index 
      (ISI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and a demographic data questionnaire were 
      used for data collection. Data were analysed using SPSS software. Descriptive
      statistics, t, Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney tests were used as
      appropriate. RESULTS: The prevalence of preterm labour was 11.8% in women with
      sleep disorder compared with 11.6% in women without sleep disorder (p = 0.9).
      Sleep duration less than eight hours, daytime dysfunction and impaired quality of
      life as a component of ISI showed a significant relationship with preterm birth
      (p = 0.02, p = 0.044, and p = 0.047, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although daily
      dysfunction and lower quality of life because of sleep problems, and total sleep 
      duration were variables associated with preterm birth, we found no significant
      relationship between sleep disorder and preterm birth.

TI  - Drugs for preventing malaria in pregnant women in endemic areas: any drug regimen
      versus placebo or no treatment.
PG  - CD000169
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD000169.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria and this is associated with
      poor health outcomes for both the mother and the infant, especially during the
      first or second pregnancy. To reduce these effects, the World Health Organization
      recommends that pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas sleep under
      insecticide-treated bednets, are treated for malaria illness and anaemia, and
      receive chemoprevention with an effective antimalarial drug during the second and
      third trimesters. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of malaria chemoprevention
      given to pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas on substantive maternal
      and infant health outcomes. We also summarised the effects of intermittent
      preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) alone, and preventive
      regimens for Plasmodium vivax. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane
      Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS,
      and reference lists up to 1 June 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any antimalarial drug regimen for preventing
      malaria in pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas compared to placebo or 
      no intervention. In the mother, we sought outcomes that included mortality,
      severe anaemia, and severe malaria; anaemia, haemoglobin values, and malaria
      episodes; indicators of malaria infection, and adverse events. In the baby, we
      sought foetal loss, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality; preterm birth and
      birthweight measures; and indicators of malaria infection. We included regimens
      that were known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time but may 
      no longer be used because of parasite drug resistance. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias
      and extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RR),
      and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD); both are presented with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE
      approach. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen trials enrolling 14,481 pregnant women met our 
      inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted between 1957 and 2008, in Nigeria
      (three trials), The Gambia (three trials), Kenya (three trials), Mozambique (two 
      trials), Uganda (two trials), Cameroon (one trial), Burkina Faso (one trial), and
      Thailand (two trials). Six different antimalarials were evaluated against placebo
      or no intervention; chloroquine (given weekly), pyrimethamine (weekly or
      monthly), proguanil (daily), pyrimethamine-dapsone (weekly or fortnightly), and
      mefloquine (weekly), or intermittent preventive therapy with SP (given twice,
      three times or monthly). Trials recruited women in their first or second
      pregnancy (eight trials); only multigravid women (one trial); or all women (eight
      trials). Only six trials had adequate allocation concealment.For women in their
      first or second pregnancy, malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of moderate
      to severe anaemia by around 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.75; three trials, 2503
      participants, high quality evidence), and the risk of any anaemia by around 17%
      (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; five trials,, 3662 participants, high quality
      evidence). Malaria chemoprevention reduces the risk of antenatal parasitaemia by 
      around 61% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.58; seven trials, 3663 participants, high
      quality evidence), and two trials reported a reduction in febrile illness (low
      quality evidence). There were only 16 maternal deaths and these trials were
      underpowered to detect an effect on maternal mortality (very low quality
      evidence).For infants of women in their first and second pregnancies, malaria
      chemoprevention probably increases mean birthweight by around 93 g (MD 92.72 g,
      95% CI 62.05 to 123.39; nine trials, 3936 participants, moderate quality
      evidence), reduces low birthweight by around 27% (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.87;
      eight trials, 3619 participants, moderate quality evidence), and reduces
      placental parasitaemia by around 46% (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69; seven trials,
      2830 participants, high quality evidence). Fewer trials evaluated spontaneous
      abortions, still births, perinatal deaths, or neonatal deaths, and these analyses
      were underpowered to detect clinically important differences.In multigravid
      women, chemoprevention has similar effects on antenatal parasitaemia (RR 0.38,
      95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; three trials, 977 participants, high quality evidence)but
      there are too few trials to evaluate effects on other outcomes.In trials giving
      chemoprevention to all pregnant women irrespective of parity, the average effects
      of chemoprevention measured in all women indicated it may prevent severe anaemia 
      (defined by authors, but at least < 8 g/L: RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.75; two
      trials, 1327 participants, low quality evidence), but consistent benefits have
      not been shown for other outcomes.In an analysis confined only to intermittent
      preventive therapy with SP, the estimates of effect and the quality of the
      evidence were similar.A summary of a single trial in Thailand of prophylaxis
      against P. vivax showed chloroquine prevented vivax infection (RR 0.01, 95% CI
      0.00 to 0.20; one trial, 942 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Routine
      chemoprevention to prevent malaria and its consequences has been extensively
      tested in RCTs, with clinically important benefits on anaemia and parasitaemia in
      the mother, and on birthweight in infants.

LID - 10.3109/02813432.2014.965884 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse drug use in early pregnancy with special focus on
      socio-demographic factors associated with psychotropic and analgesic drug use.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: A total of 1765 women were
      invited via their local health care centres, and 1111 participated at 11-16 weeks
      of pregnancy by filling out a postal questionnaire concerning socio-demographic
      and obstetric background, stressful life events, and drug use. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Drug use prior to and early on in pregnancy, socio-demographic factors,
      smoking, and adverse life events were investigated. Drug categories screened for 
      were psychotropics (collective term for antidepressants, relaxants, and sleep
      medication), analgesics, hormones, nicotine, vitamins/minerals, and homeopathic
      medicine. RESULTS: Drug use from the aforementioned drug categories, excluding
      vitamins/minerals and homeopathic medicine, was reduced by 18% during early
      pregnancy, compared with six months prior to conception (49% vs. 60%).
      Psychotropic drug use during early pregnancy was associated with elementary
      maternal education (p < 0.5), being unemployed (p < 0.001), being
      single/divorced/separated (p < 0.01), smoking prior to or during pregnancy (p <
      0.01), forced to change job/move house (p < 0.001), and psychotropic drug use six
      months prior to pregnancy (p < 0.001). No items on the stressful life events
      scale were associated with increased analgesic use, which increased only with
      multiparity. CONCLUSIONS: Use of analgesics and psychotropic drugs seems common
      in pregnancy. Our results indicate that lack of a support network, stressful life
      events, and lower status in society may predispose women to more drug use. GPs
      and midwives responsible for maternity care could take this into account when
      evaluating risk and gain for women and foetuses in the primary care setting.

TI  - The influence of psychological factors on post-partum weight retention at 9
      months.
PG  - 751-66
LID - 10.1111/bjhp.12074 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Post-partum weight retention (PWR) has been identified as a critical 
      pathway for long-term overweight and obesity. In recent years, psychological
      factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in contributing to and
      maintaining PWR. DESIGN: Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the
      relationship between post-partum psychological distress and PWR at 9 months,
      after controlling for maternal weight factors, sleep quality, sociocontextual
      influences, and maternal behaviours. METHOD: Pregnant women (N = 126) completed a
      series of questionnaires at multiple time points from early pregnancy until 9
      months post-partum. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression indicated that gestational
      weight gain, shorter duration (6 months or less) of breastfeeding, and
      post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months are associated with higher PWR
      at 9 months; stress, depression, and anxiety had minimal influence. CONCLUSION:
      Interventions aimed at preventing excessive PWR should specifically target the
      prevention of body dissatisfaction and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.
      STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Post-partum
      weight retention (PWR) is a critical pathway for long-term overweight and
      obesity. Causes of PWR are complex and multifactorial. There is increasing
      evidence that psychological factors play a key role in predicting high PWR. What 
      does this study add? Post-partum body dissatisfaction at 3 and 6 months is
      associated with PWR at 9 months post-birth. Post-partum depression, stress and
      anxiety have less influence on PWR at 9 months. Interventions aimed at preventing
      excessive PWR should target body dissatisfaction.

      self-reported time use.
PG  - e109051
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0109051 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We used linked existing data from the 2006-2008 American Time Use
      Survey (ATUS), the Current Population Survey (CPS, a federal survey that provides
      on-going U.S. vital statistics, including employment rates) and self-reported
      body mass index (BMI) to answer: How does BMI vary across full time occupations
      dichotomized as sedentary/non-sedentary, accounting for time spent in sleep,
      other sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, and vigorous intensity
      activities? METHODS: We classified time spent engaged at a primary job (sedentary
      or non-sedentary), sleep, and other non-work, non-sleep intensity-defined
      behaviors, specifically, sedentary behavior, light, moderate, and vigorous
      intensity activities. Age groups were defined by 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64
      years. BMI groups were defined by 18.5-24.9, 25.0-27.4, 27.5-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and
      >/=35.0 kg/m2. Logistic and linear regression were used to examine the
      association between BMI and employment in a sedentary occupation, considering
      time spent in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light,
      moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age race/ethnicity, and
      household income. RESULTS: The analysis data set comprised 4,092 non-pregnant,
      non-underweight individuals 20-64 years of age who also reported working more
      than 7 hours at their primary jobs on their designated time use reporting day.
      Logistic and linear regression analyses failed to reveal any associations between
      BMI and the sedentary/non-sedentary occupation dichotomy considering time spent
      in sleep, other non-work time spent in sedentary behaviors, and light, moderate, 
      and vigorous intensity activities, sex, age, race/ethnicity, and household
      income. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of a relationship between self-reported
      full time sedentary occupation classification and BMI after accounting for sex,
      age, race/ethnicity, and household income and 24-hours of time use including
      non-work related physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The various sources
      of error associated with self-report methods and assignment of generalized
      activity and occupational intensity categories could compound to obscure any real

      animal model of restless legs syndrome.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pregnant women have a 2-3 fold higher probability of developing restless
      legs syndrome (RLS - sleep-related movement disorders) than general population.
      This study aims to evaluate the behavior and locomotion of rats during pregnancy 
      in order to verify if part of these animals exhibit some RLS-like features.
      METHODS: We used 14 female 80-day-old Wistar rats that weighed between 200 and
      250 g. The rats were distributed into control (CTRL) and pregnant (PN) groups.
      After a baseline evaluation of their behavior and locomotor activity in an
      open-field environment, the PN group was inducted into pregnancy, and their
      behavior and locomotor activity were evaluated on days 3, 10 and 19 of pregnancy 
      and in the post-lactation period in parallel with the CTRL group. The serum iron 
      and transferrin levels in the CTRL and PN groups were analyzed in blood collected
      after euthanasia by decapitation. RESULTS: There were no significant differences 
      in the total ambulation, grooming events, fecal boli or urine pools between the
      CTRL and PN groups. However, the PN group exhibited fewer rearing events,
      increased grooming time and reduced immobilization time than the CTRL group
      (ANOVA, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pregnant rats show
      behavioral and locomotor alterations similar to those observed in animal models
      of RLS, demonstrating to be a possible animal model of this sleep disorder.

      human male homosexuality: similarities and differences.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-1372-5_18 [doi]
AB  - In this chapter we briefly review the evidence supporting the existence of
      biological influences on sexual orientation. We focus on basic research studies
      that have affected the estrogen synthesis during the critical periods of brain
      sexual differentiation in male rat offspring with the use of aromatase
      inhibitors, such as 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17 (ATD) and letrozole. The results
      after prenatal and/or postnatal treatment with ATD reveal that these animals,
      when adults, show female sexual responses, such as lordosis or proceptive
      behaviors, but retain their ability to display male sexual activity with a
      receptive female. Interestingly, the preference and sexual behavior of these rats
      vary depending upon the circadian rhythm.Recently, we have established that the
      treatment with low doses of letrozole during the second half of pregnancy
      produces male rat offspring, that when adults spend more time in the company of a
      sexually active male than with a receptive female in a preference test. In
      addition, they display female sexual behavior when forced to interact with a
      sexually experienced male and some typical male sexual behavior when faced with a
      sexually receptive female. Interestingly, these males displayed both sexual
      behavior patterns spontaneously, i.e., in absence of exogenous steroid hormone
      treatment. Most of these features correspond with those found in human male
      homosexuals; however, the "bisexual" behavior shown by the letrozole-treated rats
      may be related to a particular human population. All these data, taken together, 
      permit to propose letrozole prenatal treatment as a suitable animal model to
      study human male homosexuality and reinforce the hypothesis that human sexual
      orientation is underlied by changes in the endocrine milieu during early
      development.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-1372-5_2 [doi]
AB  - Prenatal restraint stress (PRS) can induce persisting changes in individual's
      development. PRS increases anxiety and depression-like behaviors and induces
      changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in adult PRS rats after
      exposure to stress. Since adaptive capabilities also depend on temporal
      organization and synchronization with the external environment, we studied the
      effects of PRS on circadian rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle, that are
      parameters altered in depression. Using a restraint stress during gestation, we
      showed that PRS induced phase advances in hormonal/behavioral circadian rhythms
      in adult rats, and an increase in the amount of paradoxical sleep, positively
      correlated to plasma corticosterone levels. Plasma corticosterone levels were
      also correlated with immobility in the forced swimming test, indicating a
      depressive-like profile in the PRS rats. We observed comorbidity with
      anxiety-like profile on PRS rats that was correlated with a reduced release of
      glutamate in the ventral hippocampus. Pharmacological approaches aimed at
      modulating glutamate release may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat 
      stress-related disorders. Finally, since depressed patients exhibit changes in
      HPA axis activity and in circadian rhythmicity as well as in the paradoxical
      sleep regulation, we suggest that PRS could represent an original animal model of
      depression.

TI  - Women's experiences of low back pain during pregnancy.
PG  - 351-7
LID - 10.3233/BMR-140527 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the self-reported prevalence and impact of
      low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy in primiparous and multiparous women, and
      their treatment-seeking rationales and experiences, including their use of
      physiotherapy. METHODS: A sample of 105 post-partum women was recruited. All
      participants answered a questionnaire; women who experienced LBP during pregnancy
      (n=71) continue in the study and later they were also interviewed. Content
      analysis, descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data.
      RESULTS: Reports of LBP were common (n=71; 67.6%) and slightly more frequent in
      primiparous (n=40; 56.3%) than multiparous (n=31; 43.7%) women. Multiparous women
      with LBP were significantly older (p< 0.001) and reported more sleep disturbances
      (p=0.026) than primiparous women with LBP. LBP prevented women performing their
      daily activities (n=41; 57.7%) and worsened with the advance of pregnancy (n=55; 
      77.5%), yet 93.0% (n=66) of these women received no treatment. CONCLUSION: LBP is
      a prevalent and important clinical condition affecting the daily life of many
      pregnant women. Nevertheless, few women seek any treatment and physiotherapy is
      rarely considered. Given the significant impact on quality of life, health
      professionals need to be proactive in asking women about LBP.

TI  - Lenz Microphthalmia Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Lenz microphthalmia syndrome (LMS) is characterized by 
      unilateral or bilateral microphthalmia and/or clinical anophthalmia with
      malformations of the ears, teeth, fingers, skeleton, and/or genitourinary system.
      Microphthalmia is often accompanied by microcornea and glaucoma. Coloboma is
      present in approximately 60% of microphthalmic eyes with severity ranging from
      isolated iris coloboma to coloboma of the ciliary body, choroid, and optic disk. 
      Ears may be low set, anteverted, posteriorly rotated, simple, cup shaped, or
      abnormally modeled. Hearing loss has been observed. Dental findings include
      irregularly shaped, missing, or widely spaced teeth. Duplicated thumbs,
      syndactyly, clinodactyly, camptodactyly, and microcephaly are common, as are
      narrow/sloping shoulders, underdeveloped clavicles, kyphoscoliosis, exaggerated
      lumbar lordosis, long cylindric thorax, and webbed neck. Genitourinary anomalies 
      include hypospadias, cryptorchidism, renal hypoplasia/aplasia, and hydroureter.
      Approximately 60% of affected males have mild-to-severe intellectual disability
      or developmental delay. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Lenz microphthalmia
      syndrome is based on clinical findings. Mild simple microphthalmia can be
      identified by measuring the axial length of the globe with A-scan
      ultrasonography. NAA10 (MCOPS1 locus) and BCOR (MCOPS2 locus) are the only genes 
      known to be associated with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome (LMS). MANAGEMENT:
      Treatment of manifestations: For clinical anophthalmos or extreme microphthalmos:
      regular evaluation by an ocularist for placement of serial enlarging orbital
      expanders, physical and occupational therapy, special education, and referral to 
      services for the blind. For hearing loss and sleep disorders: treatment dependent
      on the specific defect and similar to that used in the general population.
      Institute regular dental examinations and cleaning should be instituted,
      especially when cognitive developmental delay is present; dental treatment as for
      the general population. Surveillance: Annual ophthalmologic examination for those
      with residual vision, monitoring of renal function, developmental assessments,
      and lifelong case management to help affected individuals gain access to social
      services and assistive devices for the blind. GENETIC COUNSELING: Lenz
      microphthalmia syndrome is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs
      depends on the carrier status of the mother. If the mother is a carrier, the
      chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant is 50% in each pregnancy: males who
      inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the
      pathogenic variant will be carriers. The majority of males with Lenz
      microphthalmia syndrome do not reproduce. Carrier testing for at-risk female
      relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible for
      families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected
      family member. Prenatal ultrasound examination at 18 weeks' gestation can be
      offered for pregnancies at increased risk to evaluate fetal renal development.

TI  - Methodology and recruitment for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the
      safety of wahakura for infant bedsharing.
PG  - 240
LID - 10.1186/1471-2431-14-240 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI) has persistent high rates
      in deprived indigenous communities and much of this mortality is attributable to 
      unsafe sleep environments. Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on 
      avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Maori community in New Zealand has
      reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways
      that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of
      this traditional sleeping device. METHODS/DESIGN: This two arm randomised
      controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from
      Maori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand.
      They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes
      questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an
      overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and
      oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary
      oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in
      thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned
      sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related)
      touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of
      behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey
      data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on
      maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal
      sleep patterns. DISCUSSION: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI
      interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its
      assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an
      important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken 
      worldwide. TRIALS REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry:

TI  - Sleep duration, vital exhaustion, and odds of spontaneous preterm birth: a
      case-control study.
PG  - 337
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-14-337 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality
      worldwide, resulting in a pressing need to identify risk factors leading to
      effective interventions. Limited evidence suggests potential relationships
      between maternal sleep or vital exhaustion and preterm birth, yet the literature 
      is generally inconclusive. METHODS: We examined the relationship between maternal
      sleep duration and vital exhaustion in the first six months of pregnancy and
      spontaneous (non-medically indicated) preterm birth among 479 Peruvian women who 
      delivered a preterm singleton infant (<37 weeks gestation) and 480 term controls 
      who delivered a singleton infant at term (>/=37 weeks gestation). Maternal
      nightly sleep and reports of vital exhaustion were ascertained through in-person 
      interviews. Spontaneous preterm birth cases were further categorized as those
      following either spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of
      membranes. In addition, cases were categorized as very (<32 weeks), moderate
      (32-33 weeks), and late (34- <37 weeks) preterm birth for additional analyses.
      Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, we found
      that short sleep duration (</=6 hours) was significantly associated with preterm 
      birth (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.19) compared to 7-8 hours of sleep. Vital
      exhaustion was also associated with increased odds of preterm birth (aOR = 2.41; 
      95% CI 1.79-3.23) compared to no exhaustion (Ptrend <0.001). These associations
      remained significant for spontaneous preterm labor and preterm premature rupture 
      of membranes. We also found evidence of joint effects of sleep duration and vital
      exhaustion on the odds of spontaneous preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: The results of 
      this case-control study suggest maternal sleep duration, particularly short sleep
      duration, and vital exhaustion may be risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth.
      These findings call for increased clinical attention to maternal sleep and the
      study of potential intervention strategies to improve sleep in early pregnancy
      with the aim of decreasing risk of preterm birth.

      suprachiasmatic nuclei.
PG  - e107360
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0107360 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and their intrinsic rhythmicity
      develop gradually during ontogenesis. In the rat, the SCN forms between embryonic
      day (E) 14 and E17, with gestation terminating at E21-22. Overt SCN rhythmicity
      is already present in the late embryonic stage. The aim of the present study was 
      to determine when the fetal SCN clock develops in vivo and whether overt
      rhythmicity results from a functional fetal clock. To achieve this goal, the
      prenatal development of rhythmic expression of clock genes was measured with a
      more sensitive method for detection of the clock gene expression than previously.
      Fetal SCN were collected at 3 h intervals during the 24 h period on E19 and E21
      by laser dissection and expression of clock genes (Per2, Nr1d1 and Bmal1) and
      genes related to cellular activity (c-fos, Avp and Vip) was measured by qRT PCR. 
      At E19, the expression of canonical clock genes Per2 and Bmal1 was not rhythmic; 
      however, the expression of all other studied genes followed clear circadian
      rhythms. At E21, Per2 and Bmal1 expression exhibited low amplitude but
      significant rhythmicity. From E19 to E21, the levels of the non-rhythmic
      transcripts (Per2 and Bmal1) decreased; however, the levels of the rhythmic
      transcripts (Nr1d1, c-fos, Avp and Vip) increased. In summary, these data
      demonstrate that at E19, rhythms in Per2 and Bmal1 expression were absent in the 
      fetal SCN; however, the expression of Nr1d1 and other genes related to cellular
      activity was driven rhythmically. Therefore, at the early stage in vivo, the
      developing fetal SCN clock could theoretically be entrained by oscillation of
      Nr1d1 which may be driven by the maternal rather than fetal circadian system.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: a review of
      the literature.
PG  - 588-94
LID - 10.1097/MCP.0000000000000097 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The evidence of a putative causal effect of sleep
      apnea-induced intermittent hypoxia on the pathogenesis of gestational
      hypertension and preeclampsia is mounting. The present review presents the
      evidence of current literature and questions whether an early diagnosis and
      treatment of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy can reduce the risk of
      preeclampsia. RECENT FINDINGS: Although pathophysiological pathways remain to be 
      more clearly defined, recent studies shed light on the association of
      sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. For the
      first time, a recent prospective study revealed that obstructive sleep apnea
      increases over the course of pregnancy and that it is common during the third
      trimester. In this study, age and BMI have been identified as independent
      predictors of gestational obstructive sleep apnea. SUMMARY: An association
      between sleep-disordered breathing, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia has
      been demonstrated. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of
      continuous positive airway pressure treatment during pregnancy on hypertension
      and preeclampsia. Further studies are required to ascertain whether continuous
      positive airway pressure can be a useful adjunct treatment for pregnant women at 
      risk of preeclampsia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal distress has largely been conceptualised as the experience 
      of depression and/or anxiety. Recent research has shown that the affective state 
      of stress is also present during the perinatal period and thus may add to a
      broader understanding of perinatal distress. AIM: The aims of the present study
      were to investigate the changes in depression, anxiety and stress symptoms across
      pregnancy, and to explore the prospective relationships between these symptoms.
      METHODS: Two-hundred and fourteen pregnant women were recruited when they were
      less than 16 weeks gestation. Women completed depression, anxiety and stress
      measures on a monthly basis, from 16 weeks gestation through to 36 weeks
      gestation. The covariate measures of sleep quality and social support were
      assessed bi-monthly at 16, 24 and 32 weeks gestation. FINDINGS: Levels of
      depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were all shown to change over time, with 
      women experiencing fewer symptoms during the middle of their pregnancy. Higher
      symptoms early in pregnancy predicted higher symptom levels throughout the rest
      of pregnancy. Higher depression scores early in pregnancy were also shown to
      predict higher anxiety and higher stress scores in late pregnancy. Increased
      stress scores during mid pregnancy also predicted higher anxiety scores in late
      pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Current findings indicate that symptom levels of
      depression, anxiety and stress vary over the course of pregnancy. Increased
      depression in early pregnancy seemed to be particularly pertinent as it not only 
      predicted later depression symptoms, but also increased anxiety and stress in
      late pregnancy. Collectively, these results further highlight the importance of
      emotional health screening early in pregnancy.

TI  - Maternal choline concentrations during pregnancy and choline-related genetic
      variants as risk factors for neural tube defects.
PG  - 1069-74
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.113.079319 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low maternal choline intake and blood concentration may be risk
      factors for having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD); however, the data are
      inconsistent. This is an important question to resolve because choline, if taken 
      periconceptionally, might add to the protective effect currently being achieved
      by folic acid. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between NTDs, choline status, 
      and genetic polymorphisms reported to influence de novo choline synthesis to
      investigate claims that taking choline periconceptionally could reduce NTD rates.
      DESIGN: Two study groups of pregnant women were investigated: women who had a
      current NTD-affected pregnancy (AP; n = 71) and unaffected controls (n = 214) and
      women who had an NTD in another pregnancy but not in the current pregnancy
      [nonaffected pregnancy (NAP); n = 98] and unaffected controls (n = 386). Blood
      samples to measure betaine and total choline concentrations and single nucleotide
      polymorphisms related to choline metabolism were collected at their first
      prenatal visit. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) plasma total choline concentrations in the 
      AP (2.8 +/- 1.0 mmol/L) and control (2.9 +/- 0.9 mmol/L) groups did not differ
      significantly. Betaine concentrations were not significantly different between
      the 2 groups. Total choline and betaine in the NAP group did not differ from
      controls. Cases were significantly more likely to have the G allele of
      phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT; V175M, +5465 G>A) rs7946 (P =
      0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that maternal betaine and choline
      concentrations are not strongly associated with NTD risk. The association between
      PEMT rs7946 and NTDs requires confirmation. The addition of choline to folic acid
      supplements may not further reduce NTD risk.

AB  - Fetal movements (FM) related heart rate accelerations (AC) are an important
      maturation criterion. Since Doppler-based time resolution is not sufficient for
      accompanying heart rate variability analysis, the work is aimed at a
      comprehensive FM-AC analysis using magnetocardiographic recordings from fetuses
      during sleep.We identify FM and AC by independent component analysis and
      automatic recognition algorithms. We investigate associations between FM and AC
      of different magnitude by means of event coincidence and time series
      cross-correlation over the maturation period of 21-40 weeks of gestation (WGA).FM
      related AC appear with increasing AC magnitude and WGA. Vice versa, AC related FM
      appear independent of WGA, but more frequently with increasing AC amplitude. The 
      FM-AC correlation exists already at 21 WGA and further increases with WGA while
      the variability of its time delay decreases. Hence, FM and AC are clearly
      associated over the whole investigated maturation period. The increase of FM
      related AC runs parallel to the increasing AC magnitude.The MCG methodology was
      confirmed and results from previous Doppler-based analyses reproduced. Hence, MCG
      recordings allow the collective analysis of heart rate variability based
      maturation indices and FM related AC. This synergism may improve the diagnosis of
      fetal developmental disorders.

AB  - This review aims to discuss how endogenous and exogenous testosterone exposures
      in men and estrogens/progesterone exposures in women interact with sleep
      regulation. In young men, testosterone secretion peaks during sleep and is linked
      to sleep architecture. Animal and human studies support the notion that sleep
      loss suppresses testosterone secretion. Testosterone levels decline slowly
      throughout the aging process, but relatively few studies investigate its impact
      on age-related sleep modifications. Results suggest that poorer sleep quality is 
      associated with lower testosterone concentrations and that sleep loss may have a 
      more prominent effect on testosterone levels in older individuals. In women, sex 
      steroid levels are characterized by a marked monthly cycle and reproductive
      milestones such as pregnancy and menopause. Animal models indicate that estrogens
      and progesterone influence sleep. Most studies do not show any clear effects of
      the menstrual cycle on sleep, but sample sizes are too low, and research designs 
      often inhibit definitive conclusions. The effects of hormonal contraceptives on
      sleep are currently unknown. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated
      with increased sleep disturbances, but their relation to the hormonal milieu
      still needs to be determined. Finally, studies suggest that menopausal transition
      and the hormonal changes associated with it are linked to lower subjective sleep 
      quality, but results concerning objective sleep measures are less conclusive.
      More research is necessary to unravel the effects of vasomotor symptoms on sleep.
      Hormone therapy seems to induce positive effects on sleep, but key concerns are
      still unresolved, including the long-term effects and efficacy of different
      hormonal regimens.

PG  - 60
LID - 10.1186/1129-2377-15-60 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though migraine and tension type headache are both commonly diagnosed
      in childhood, little is known about their determinants when diagnosed prior to
      puberty onset. Our aim was to determine psychosocial- and health-related risk
      factors of migraine and tension-type headache in 11 year old children. METHODS:
      871 New Zealand European children were enrolled in a longitudinal study at birth 
      and data were collected at birth, 1, 3.5, 7, and 11 years of age. Primary
      headache was determined at age 11 years based on the International Headache
      Society. Perinatal factors assessed were small for gestational age status, sex,
      maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal perceived stress, and maternal school
      leaving age. Childhood factors assessed were sleep duration, percent body fat,
      television watching, parent and self-reported total problem behaviour, being
      bullied, and depression. RESULTS: Prevalence of migraine and tension-type
      headache was 10.5% and 18.6%, respectively. Both migraine and TTH were
      significantly associated with self-reported problem behaviour in univariable
      logistic regression analyses. Additionally, migraine was associated with reduced 
      sleep duration, and both sleep and behaviour problems remained significant after 
      multivariable analyses. TTH was also significantly associated with antenatal
      maternal smoking, higher body fat, and being bullied. For TTH, problem behaviour 
      measured at ages 3.5 and 11 years both remained significant after multivariable
      analysis. Being born small for gestational age was not associated with either
      headache group. CONCLUSIONS: Although they share some commonality, migraine and
      tension-type headache are separate entities in childhood with different
      developmental characteristics. The association between primary headache and
      problem behaviour requires further investigation.

AB  - The objective of the study was to characterize the phenotype of males and females
      with autism spectrum disorder born preterm versus those born at term. Descriptive
      statistical analyses identified differences between male and female autism
      spectrum disorder subjects born preterm compared to term for several phenotypic
      characteristics and comorbidities. Of the 115 (13.0% of 883) born preterm, a
      greater percentage of males had sleep apnea (13.8% vs. 2.5%, p < 0.0001), seizure
      disorders (17.0% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.01), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (14.9% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.005). Females born preterm were more likely to be
      nonverbal (22.2% vs. 4.6%, p = 0.001). In summary, phenotypic differences were
      observed, especially among males. The results may have implications for
      understanding the underpinnings of a subset of individuals with autism spectrum
      disorder and contribute to the development of focused treatments for autism
      spectrum disorder among children born preterm.

TI  - Impact of night shifts on laparoscopic skills and cognitive function among
      gynecologists.
PG  - 1255-61
LID - 10.1111/aogs.12496 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether gynecologists have impaired laparoscopic skills
      and/or reduced cognitive function after long on-call hours. DESIGN: Prospective
      cohort study. SETTING: Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Norway.
      POPULATION: 28 gynecologists working long shifts in a single department. METHODS:
      Pre-training of laparoscopic skills on a virtual reality simulator. Simulator-
      and cognitive testing on two different occasions; one in the morning after a
      normal nights' sleep at home and one in the morning directly after 17.5 h on
      call. The virtual reality simulator test consisted of three repetitive
      salpingectomies in an ectopic pregnancy module. The cognitive test consisted of a
      standardized cognitive test battery (Cambridge neuropsychological test automated 
      battery). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Simulated laparoscopic performance was assessed 
      by time to perform the procedure, total length of instrument movement (tip
      trajectory) and blood loss. Cognitive function was assessed by reaction time,
      errors and total score. RESULTS: No significant impairment in laparoscopic skills
      was found after 17.5 h on call. Cognitive testing revealed a statistically
      significant increase in reaction time post-call. Construct validity for the
      metrics "time to perform procedure" and "tip trajectory" in the ectopic pregnancy
      module was established in a validation study prior to our main study.
      CONCLUSIONS: We were not able to detect impaired laparoscopic skills among
      gynecologists tested by a virtual reality procedural module after 17.5 h on call.
      We found a small increase in reaction time but no other signs of reduced
      cognitive function. The study adds information on surgical performance of
      sleep-deprived gynecologists.

AB  - Personality may influence sleep in perinatal women. A follow-up study was
      conducted among 3,752 pregnant, then postpartum women at Akershus University
      Hospital, Norway. The Big Five personality dimensions were measured by the
      Mini-International Personality Item Pool in week 17 of pregnancy. Insomnia was
      measured by the Bergen Insomnia Scale in pregnancy week 32 and 8 weeks
      postpartum, along with self-reported sleep times. The Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale measured depression, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist measured 
      anxiety. Adjusted for current anxiety, depression, and demographic variables, the
      personality traits Neuroticism and Agreeableness were associated with insomnia in
      pregnancy. No personality traits were associated with postpartum insomnia.
      Extraversion was associated with longer postpartum sleep duration and better
      sleep efficiency, and Agreeableness with shorter sleep duration.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and may be influenced by a multitude
      of factors. Pregnancy physiology may predispose to sleep disruption but may also 
      result in worsening of some underlying sleep disorders, and the de novo
      development of others. Apart from sleep disordered breathing, the impact of sleep
      disorders on pregnancy, fetal, and neonatal outcomes is poorly understood. In
      this article, we review the literature and discuss available data pertaining to
      the most common sleep disorders in perinatal women. These include restless legs
      syndrome, insomnia, circadian pattern disturbances, narcolepsy, and
      sleep-disordered breathing.

TI  - Comparison of haematological and biochemical changes between non-anaemic and
      anaemic primigravid women in a north Indian population to establish normative
      values.
PG  - 221-4
LID - 10.3109/01443615.2014.948817 [doi]
AB  - Pregnancy is accompanied by several haemodynamic, biochemical and haematological 
      changes, which may lead to severe problems, if they are not suitably addressed.
      The current study highlights the haematological and biochemical differences
      observed in anaemic (AP) and non-anaemic primigravida (NAP), in the 2nd
      trimester, in a north Indian population. There were significant differences (p < 
      0.05) in the body weight and body temperature of NAP compared with AP. A
      significant decrease (p < 0.001) in haematological parameters including
      haemoglobin, haematocrit, erythrocyte count, MCH and MCHC, was observed in AP;
      however, MCV was found to be significantly higher (p = 0.038). Many biochemical
      parameters viz. potassium, albumin, total protein and calcium levels were
      significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in AP, except alkaline phosphatase whose level
      was found significantly increased (p < 0.01). The findings of the study suggest
      that haematological and biochemical changes take place in anaemia during
      pregnancy. Further, the results obtained should be used for establishing
      normative values for similar populations.

AB  - Extreme obesity (BMI >/= 40) is thought to complicate approximately 5% of
      deliveries in the United States. Extreme obesity puts a pregnant woman at an
      increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, coronary
      artery disease, and congestive heart failure; respiratory disease, including
      obstructive sleep apnea and asthma; as well as pregnancy-specific diseases
      including pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes. Extreme
      obesity also puts a parturient at a significantly increased risk of requiring
      cesarean delivery. For the anesthesiologist, the physiologic changes of obesity
      combined with the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy can make for a complex 
      and challenging case. This review will focus on the anesthetic approach to the
      extremely obese parturient undergoing scheduled operative delivery. With proper
      planning and a detailed understanding of the patient's comorbidities, a safe and 
      effective anesthetic can be achieved.

TI  - [Ethnic differences in uptake of professional maternity care assistance].
PG  - A7718
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethnic differences in the uptake of professional
      maternity care assistance (MCA) in the Netherlands, and the factors that may
      explain these differences. Additionally the effect of MCA on health risk
      behaviour around infants is examined. DESIGN: Questionnaire survey. METHOD:
      Questionnaire data from 3967 mothers from the ABCD study (Amsterdam Born Children
      and their Development) included during pregnancy in 2003-2004, were used. We
      examined the explanatory role of ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, mastery of
      the Dutch language, parity, housing situation and place of giving birth on MCA
      uptake, and the effect of MCA uptake on health risk behaviour around infants,
      such as smoking indoors, infant sleep behaviour, infant nutrition, and response
      to infant crying. RESULTS: Mothers of non-Western origin less often used MCA than
      Dutch mothers (Ghanaian: 70%; Turkish: 75%; Moroccan: 79%; Surinamese: 81%; Dutch
      Caribbean: 85% vs. Dutch: 95%). Higher educational level, better mastery of the
      Dutch language, having a paid job and home delivery were all independently
      associated with the uptake of MCA, and also partially explained ethnic
      differences in the uptake of MCA. Mothers who received MCA more often breastfed, 
      more often gave vitamin K when not breastfeeding, and more often lived in
      smoke-free homes. The protective effect of MCA was stronger for non-Western
      mothers than for Dutch mothers. CONCLUSION: Mothers of non-Western origin make
      less use of professional MCA. Given that the use of MCA is associated with a less
      risk behaviour around infants, efforts should be made to improve the
      accessibility of professional MCA for mothers of non-Western origin.

TI  - Parenthood and Physical Activity in Young Adults: A Qualitative Study.
PG  - 782-8
LID - 10.1123/jpah.2013-0412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New parents have to adjust to less sleep, less free time, and more
      responsibility as a result of having a child. The purpose of this study was to
      examine how having a child impacts the physical activity (PA) beliefs and
      behaviors of new parents over a 2- to 3-year time period. METHODS: Participants
      included 49 men and women (31% men, 96% white) who did not have a child at
      baseline (26.3 +/- 1.1 years old) but did have a child at the time of follow-up
      (28.9 +/- 1.7 years old). The child's mean age at follow-up was 12 +/- 7 months
      old. PA was measured via questionnaire at baseline and again at follow-up.
      Interviews regarding PA occurred at follow-up. RESULTS: PA significantly
      decreased in parents across the time period (P < .001), and parents attributed
      this decrease to having a child and being pregnant. Parents mentioned they lack
      time, energy, and motivation for PA as a result of caring for a new child.
      Parents who maintained their activity level stated they prioritized PA and chose 
      activities they enjoyed. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that although activity
      levels decrease in individuals who have a child, PA in new parents may be a
      function of priority, intensity, and enjoyment.

TI  - Cultural differences in postnatal quality of life among German-speaking women - a
      prospective survey in two countries.
PG  - 277
LID - 10.1186/1471-2393-14-277 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of quality of life after childbirth is an important
      health-outcome measurement for new mothers and is of special interest in
      midwifery. The Mother-Generated Index (MGI) is a validated instrument to assess
      postnatal quality of life. The tool has not been applied for making a
      cross-cultural comparison before. This study investigated (a) responses to the
      MGI in German-speaking women in Germany and Switzerland; and (b) associations
      between MGI scores on the one hand and maternity and midwifery care on the other.
      METHODS: A two-stage survey was conducted in two rural hospitals 10 km apart, on 
      opposite sides of the German-Swiss border. The questionnaires included the MGI
      and questions on socio-demographics, physical and mental health and maternity
      care, and were distributed during the first days after birth and six weeks
      postpartum. Parametric and non-parametric tests were computed with the
      statistical programme SPSS. RESULTS: A total of 129 questionnaires were returned 
      an average of three days after birth and 83 in the follow-up after seven weeks.
      There were no statistically significant differences in the MGI scores between the
      German and the Swiss women (p = 0.22). Significantly more favourable MGI scores
      were found associated with more adequate information during pregnancy (p = 0.02),
      a more satisfactory birth experience (p < .01), epidural anaesthesia (p < 0.01), 
      more information (p = 0.01) and better support (p = 0.02) during the time in
      hospital and less disturbed sleep (p < 0.01). Significantly lower MGI scores were
      associated with the presence of a private doctor during birth (p = 0.01) and with
      exclusive breastfeeding during the first postnatal days (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION:
      The MGI scores of these German-speaking women were higher than those in other
      studies reported previously. Thus the tool may be able to detect differences in
      postnatal quality of life among women with substantially divergent cultural
      backgrounds. Shortcomings in maternity and midwifery care were detected, as for
      example the inadequate provision of information during pregnancy, a lack of
      individualised postpartum care during the hospital stay and insufficient support 
      for exclusively breastfeeding mothers. The MGI is an appropriate instrument for
      maternity care outcome measurement in cross-cultural comparison research.

TI  - Sleep disorders in women attending antenatal care at a tertiary hospital in
      Nigeria.
PG  - 155-9
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of sleep disorders in a
      population of Nigerian women during pregnancy and to evaluate the frequency of
      these sleep disorders according to the three trimesters of pregnancy. SUBJECTS
      AND METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional design. Participants' were interviewed
      at the antenatal clinic with a questionnaire to evaluate their sleep during and
      before pregnancy and to appraise disturbance in their sleep according to the
      trimester. RESULTS: Two hundred and three pregnant women participated in the
      survey and were evaluated at one of three points in pregnancy: 1st trimester
      (n=57), 2nd trimester (n=71) and 3rd trimester (n=75). Overall, the prevalence of
      sleep disorder in the population surveyed was 35.5% (72/203), more women
      experienced sleep disturbances in the first (42.1%) and third (40%) trimester of 
      pregnancy compared to the second (25.3%). In terms of types of sleep disorders;
      96(47.3%) reported insomnia, 32(15.8%) sleep breathing disorders, 86(42.4%)
      excessive daytime sleepiness, 172(84.7%) mild sleepiness and 64(31.5%)
      significant specific awakenings. The most common reason for specific awakening
      was frequent urination (78.6%). These sleep disorders were more common in the
      third trimester of pregnancy but only insomnia and specific awakenings showed
      statistical significance, p=0.007 and 0.031 respectively. Logistic regression
      model showed that nulliparity, increased BMI and previous adverse obstetric
      events had significant independent associations with sleep disorders. CONCLUSION:
      Sleep disorders are common in pregnancy, notably in the first and third
      trimesters.

      overweight and obese pregnant women.

AB  - This study was conducted to identify factors that influenced stress, healthy
      eating and physical activity among low-income overweight or obese pregnant women.
      We conducted seven focus groups with 96 low-income overweight and obese pregnant 
      women. Common themes were identified from audio tapes and transcripts. Women said
      that poor communication affected their relationships with spouses or significant 
      others. They were frustrated or upset with significant others for three key
      reasons: failure to understand or listen to the pregnant women's pregnancy
      concerns, refusal to be helpful when asked and being overly concerned with the
      woman's safety. Most women said that they were emotional and took naps throughout
      the day after becoming pregnant. Many withdrew from their social interactions.
      They also faced numerous challenges that made healthy eating more difficult,
      e.g., craving for unhealthy foods and eating foods for comfort. To eat healthier,
      some reminded themselves to avoid overeating or stop eating in the car. Women
      were not physically active because of tiredness, lack of motivation, inadequate
      social support, or bad weather. Some stayed physically active to prevent
      excessive pregnancy weight gain and have an easier labor. Women equivocally said 
      weighing themselves to manage weight would add to their stress and make them feel
      more depressed. When designing interventions to help low-income overweight and
      obese pregnant women avoid excessive pregnancy weight gain, it is important to
      include information and practical advice on stress management, emphasizing
      effective communication skills with significant others and helping them plan
      effective ways to manage negative feelings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess how change in sleep duration is related to subsequent
      obesity. METHODS: In this 10-year follow-up, 4903 non-pregnant participants
      answered a questionnaire on sleeping habits, obesity, and lifestyle factors
      (questions identical to baseline questionnaire). Habitual normal sleepers were
      defined as sleeping 6-9 h/night at both baseline and follow-up, whereas women
      sleeping <6 h/night or >/=9 h/night at both occasions were defined as habitual
      short sleepers and habitual long sleepers, respectively. Logistic regression was 
      used to analyze associations between changes in sleep duration, general obesity
      (body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2)), weight gain (>/=10 kg) and also, central obesity
      (waist circumference >/=88 cm), and increase in waist circumference (>/=10 cm) at
      follow-up. RESULTS: Among younger women (aged <40 years) both habitual short
      sleepers and habitual long sleepers had a higher prevalence of general (short:
      31.3%, P < 0.0001; long: 38.1%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (short: 60.5%, P = 
      0.01; long: 82.4%, P = 0.01) compared with habitual normal sleepers (general
      obesity: 8.9%; central obesity: 35.9%) at follow-up. Younger women who were short
      sleepers at baseline but normal sleepers at the follow-up had a higher prevalence
      of both general (19.3%, P = 0.01) and central obesity (45.4%, P = 0.07) compared 
      with habitual normal sleepers at follow-up. In adjusted analyses, both habitual
      short [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 6.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.71-17.0] 
      and long (aOR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.09-19.8) sleep durations were risk factors for
      general obesity in younger women. In younger women habitual long sleep duration
      was a risk factor also for central obesity (aOR, 6.05; 95% CI, 1.19-30.7) whereas
      habitual short sleep duration was not (aOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.87-4.81). Similar
      results were seen also for weight gain and increased waist circumference as
      dependent variables. In addition, decreased sleep duration from normal to short
      duration was a risk factor for both weight gain (aOR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.14-3.02)
      and increased waist circumference (aOR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.20-2.81). There were no
      associations between changes in sleep duration and any of the measures of obesity
      at the follow-up in women aged >40 years at baseline. CONCLUSION: In younger
      women, both habitual short and long sleep duration was a risk factor for obesity,
      whereas no such relationship was seen in older women.

PG  - 147-54
LID - 10.1097/jnr.0000000000000039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy-associated sleep disorder is a new category on the latest
      version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. It is a
      significant problem for pregnant women. PURPOSE: The present follow-up study
      assesses the association between sleep quality during the second and third
      trimesters of pregnancy and obstetric-neonatal outcomes. METHODS: A prospective
      follow-up study design was used. Follow-up examination of the obstetric birth
      records in the immediate postpartum period were carried out on 128
      second-trimester and 120 third-trimester women and their newborns in two
      hospitals in Taiwan. Poor sleep quality was identified using the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index. Data were collected from October 2007 to June 2008. RESULTS: The
      prevalence of poor sleepers (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score > 5) was 58%
      for second-trimester participants and 66% for third-trimester participants;
      participants who were unemployed reported a significantly higher prevalence of
      poor sleep quality than those who were employed. Subsequent review of the
      participant's obstetric birth records revealed that third-trimester poor sleepers
      were more likely to have had a vacuum-assisted delivery. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS
      FOR PRACTICE: This study identified poor sleep quality during the third trimester
      as a novel risk factor for vacuum-assisted delivery. We suggest that prenatal
      healthcare providers focus greater attention to the sleep disturbance condition
      of pregnant women and provide proactive sleep counseling to facilitate pregnant
      women's adjustment to the new psychosocial and physiological demands of
      motherhood.

AB  - This study investigated the mediating roles of sleep and depression on the
      relationships between stress, fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake among
      low-income overweight and obese pregnant women by trimesters. Participants (N =
      213) completed a self-administered survey including stress (exogenous variable), 
      depression, sleep (mediators), fat intake, and fruit and vegetable intake
      (endogenous variables). Path analysis was performed to compare mediation effects 
      among pregnant women in each trimester. Consistently across three trimesters,
      stress was related to depression but not sleep duration, night time sleep
      disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency or fat intake. Sleep duration was not
      associated with depression. Depending on trimester, night time sleep disturbance,
      sleep quality, and sleep latency were related to depression; night time sleep
      disturbance and depression affected fat intake; stress influenced fruit and
      vegetable intake. Sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep quality, sleep latency
      and depression did not mediate the relationships between stress, fat intake, and 
      fruit and vegetable intake in the second and third trimesters. However,
      depression mediated the relationship between stress and fat intake in the first
      trimester. Stress management interventions may help low-income overweight and
      obese pregnant women decrease depressive symptoms and therefore contribute to
      overall nutritional health.

TI  - Sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy: future implications for
      cardiovascular health.
PG  - 164-76
LID - 10.1097/OGX.0000000000000052 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common condition in
      postreproductive females. Key risk factors for later-life CVD include gestational
      hypertension (GHTN) and preeclampsia (PE). Although several risk factors of
      hypertension in pregnancy are well recognized, a novel risk factor that has
      emerged recently is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), a condition characterized
      by repeated closure of the upper airway during sleep with disrupted ventilation
      and sleep fragmentation. In the nonpregnant population, SDB is now known to play 
      a causal role in future CVD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to propose the 
      hypothesis that occult SDB during pregnancy may play a role in long-term CVD in
      women who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This
      study is a review and synthesis of empirical evidence that links SDB to GHTN/PE
      and GHTN/PE to future CVD. RESULTS: An increasing body of evidence supports the
      relationship between SDB and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy via mechanisms
      of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. It is well
      established that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with
      long-term risk for CVD via similar mechanisms. However, no studies have addressed
      the potential role of SDB in long-term outcomes of women with GHTN/PE during
      pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Given the suggested mechanisms that explain these
      associations, it is plausible that SDB during pregnancy may increase long-term
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. RELEVANCE: Pregnancy may offer a window
      of opportunity for identification and treatment of SDB, which could provide
      substantial health benefit for many years to come.

TI  - Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is characterized by
      distinctive facial features, broad and often angulated thumbs and great toes,
      short stature, and moderate to severe intellectual disability. The characteristic
      craniofacial features are downslanted palpebral fissures, low-hanging columella, 
      high palate, grimacing smile, and talon cusps. Prenatal growth is often normal;
      however, height, weight, and head circumference percentiles rapidly drop in the
      first few months of life. Obesity may occur in childhood or adolescence. IQ
      scores range from 25 to 79; average IQ is between 36 and 51. Other variable
      findings are coloboma, cataract, congenital heart defects, renal abnormalities,
      and cryptorchidism. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of RSTS is primarily based
      on clinical features. Chromosome abnormalities are occasionally observed on
      routine cytogenetic testing. CREBBP and EP300 are the only genes currently known 
      to be associated with RSTS. FISH analysis of CREBBP detects microdeletions in
      approximately 10% of individuals with RSTS. Sequence analysis detects CREBBP
      pathogenic variants in another 40%-50% of affected individuals. Pathogenic
      variants in EP300 are identified in approximately 3%-8% of individuals with RSTS.
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Early intervention programs, special
      education, vocational training to address developmental disabilities, and
      referral to behavioral specialists/psychologists and support groups/resources for
      family members; standard treatment for eye abnormalities, hearing loss, cardiac
      defects, cryptorchidism, and sleep apnea; surgical repair of significantly
      angulated thumbs or duplicated halluces; aggressive management of
      gastroesophageal reflux and constipation. Surveillance: Monitoring of growth and 
      feeding, especially in the first year of life; annual eye and hearing
      evaluations; and routine monitoring for cardiac, dental, and renal anomalies.
      GENETIC COUNSELING: RSTS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. RSTS
      typically occurs as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant in the family;
      most individuals represent simplex cases (i.e., the only affected member in a
      family). In most instances, the parents of an individual with RSTS are not
      affected. When the parents are clinically unaffected, the empiric recurrence risk
      for sibs is less than 1%. Individuals with RSTS rarely reproduce. The risk to
      offspring is 50%. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible 
      if the pathogenic variant or deletion in the family is known.

TI  - SOX2-Related Eye Disorders
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: SOX2-related eye disorders are characterized by
      anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia that is usually bilateral, severe, and
      apparent at birth or by prenatal ultrasound examination. Other common findings
      include brain malformations, esophageal atresia, cryptorchidism and/or micropenis
      in males, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and/or pituitary hypoplasia.
      Postnatal growth failure, delayed motor development, and learning disability are 
      common. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of SOX2-related eye disorders is
      established by clinical findings, cytogenetic or molecular analysis to detect
      deletions of 3q27 (which includes SOX2), and molecular genetic testing. Molecular
      genetic testing identifies a heterozygous SOX2 pathogenic variant in
      approximately 40% of individuals with bilateral anophthalmia/microphthalmia.
      MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Use of optically clear expanders to
      stimulate growth of the orbit and periorbital tissues; special educational
      services for visually impaired infants and children; physiotherapy for motor
      impairment; special education for neurodevelopmental problems; use of melatonin
      for abnormal sleep patterns; antiepileptic drugs for seizure management.
      Surveillance: Annual hearing test and annual neurodevelopmental assessment until 
      age five years; measurement of height, weight, and head circumference every three
      to six months during childhood. GENETIC COUNSELING: SOX2-related eye disorders
      are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, most often resulting from a de
      novo pathogenic variant. The risk to the sibs of a proband is usually small;
      however, if a parent of a proband has germline mosaicism, the risk to the sibs
      may be as high as 50%. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is
      possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known. Fetal ultrasound
      examination reveals marked reduction in the size of the globes.

TI  - How much do we know about schizophrenia and how well do we know it? Evidence from
      the Schizophrenia Library.
PG  - 3387-405
LID - 10.1017/S0033291714000166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: True findings about schizophrenia remain elusive; many findings are
      not replicated and conflicting results are common. Well-conducted systematic
      reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good
      meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size.
      In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available
      evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia. METHOD: Reviews
      were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and
      PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality
      assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if
      reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if
      reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs
      that may be prone to bias. RESULTS: High- and moderate-quality evidence shows
      that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have
      relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain 
      alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor
      physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are
      markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there
      is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is
      increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure
      to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections,
      childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), 
      particularly in certain ethnic groups. Developmental motor delays and lower
      intelligence quotient in childhood and adolescence are apparent. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that while our knowledge of schizophrenia is very substantial, our
      understanding of it remains limited.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of high-fat (HF) diet-induced maternal obesity 
      on follicular population and gene expression in adult offspring ovaries. DESIGN: 
      Experimental mouse study. SETTING: Laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Mice on HF diet.
      INTERVENTION(S): Female C57BL/6J mice were fed an HF or standard chow (C) diet 6 
      weeks before conception, through pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were fed the 
      C or HF diet from weaning, creating the HF/HF, HF/C, C/HF, C/C offspring groups. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Follicular counts and gene expression in adult offspring
      ovaries. RESULT(S): Prenatal exposure to maternal HF nutrition resulted in the
      reduction of primordial, antral, and Graafian follicle numbers in offspring
      ovaries (both HF/C and HF/HF). Expression levels of genes involved in apoptosis
      (FoXO3a), follicular growth and development (Gdf9), and circadian rhythms
      generation (Clock and Bmal1) were elevated in the ovaries of HF/C and HF/HF
      offspring, while expression of the circadian clock genes Cry1 and Per1 were lower
      in HF/HF ovaries. CONCLUSION(S): Maternal obesity during pregnancy has long-term 
      deleterious consequences on follicular growth and development in the adult
      offspring ovaries, which may impact their reproductive potential.

TI  - Assessment of postpartum depressive symptoms: the importance of somatic symptoms 
      and irritability.
PG  - 309-18
LID - 10.1177/1073191114544357 [doi]
AB  - Assessing postpartum depressive symptoms is complicated by the fact that
      irritability, fatigue, insomnia, and appetite disruptions are also related to
      normative aspects of the childbearing process. We used multigroup confirmatory
      factor analysis to compare symptoms in 271 postpartum women with those of 820
      non-postpartum women. We found that (a) irritability, insomnia, fatigue, and
      appetite loss were substantially associated with depressed mood among postpartum 
      women whereas increased appetite was not; (b) irritability, insomnia, fatigue,
      and appetite changes were as strongly related to depression among postpartum
      women as they were among non-postpartum women; and (c) after controlling for
      overall depressed mood, postpartum women reported more irritability, insomnia,
      and appetite loss than the non-postpartum women. Irritability, fatigue, insomnia,
      and appetite loss are valid indicators and should be used to measure postpartum
      depressive symptoms. However, scores on these symptoms should be adjusted
      downward to account for their higher baseline rates in the postpartum population.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the qualitative characteristics of a sleep in pregnant women in 
      the 3rd term of the physiological pregnancy by a questionnaire survey. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We have demonstrated questionnaire survey data of 400 pregnant women
      (mean age 27.5 +/- 8.2 years) in the 3rd term of pregnancy. Questioning conducted
      using the scale PSQI (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX--Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
      Assessment Questionnaire), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (sleepiness questionnaire
      Epfort's) and screening questionnaire to identify obstructive sleep apnea.
      RESULTS: We have determined that 78% of pregnant women to complain about sleep
      disorders, namely obstructive sleep disordered breathing, insomnia, "restless
      legs" syndrome, and combinations thereof. The frequency of sleep disorders
      increases as pregnancy progresses. Obstructive sleep disordered breathing
      increases with 10.12% in the 1st term to 31.7% in the 3rd term, insomnia--from
      14.3% in the 1st term to 37.6% in the 3rd term. In pregnancy increases of sleep
      latency (from 14.3 to 44.9 minutes), and reduced the duration of a sleep (from
      8.7 to 7.8 hours). CONCLUSIONS: high frequency of sleep disorders in pregnancy
      requires early pathogenetic prevention of pathological conditions, both in the
      mother and in the fetus.

TI  - Effects of housing conditions and season on the activity rhythm of spider monkeys
      (Ateles geoffroyi) kept under natural conditions within their distributional
      range in Central Mexico.
PG  - 983-95
LID - 10.3109/07420528.2014.938813 [doi]
AB  - The timing and pattern of mammalian behavioral activities are regulated by an
      evolutionary optimized interplay of the genetically based biological (circadian) 
      clock located in the brain's suprachiasmatic nuclei and direct responses to
      environmental factors that superimpose and thus mask the clock-mediated effects, 
      the most important of which is the photically induced phase-setting
      (synchronization) of the circadian rhythmicity to the 24-hour solar day. In wild 
      and captive animals living under the natural conditions prevailing in their
      habitat, to date, only a few attempts have been made to analyze the role of these
      two regulatory mechanisms in the species' adaptation to the time structure
      prevailing in their habitat. We studied the impact of housing conditions and
      season on the daily timing and pattern of activity in Mexican spider monkeys
      (Ateles geoffroyi). To this end, we carried out long-term activity recordings
      with Actiwatch(R) AW4 accelerometer/data-logger devices in 11 adult Ateles living
      under identical natural lighting and climatic conditions in either a large wire
      netting cage or a 0.25 ha forest enclosure in the primatological field station of
      Veracruz State University near Catemaco, Mexico. In a gravid female in the forest
      enclosure, we obtained first-hand information on the effect of late pregnancy and
      parturition on the monkey's activity rhythm. The Ateles behaved strictly diurnal 
      and undertook about 90% of daily total activity during this activity time. Due to
      a higher second activity peak in late afternoon, the bimodal activity pattern was
      more pronounced in monkeys living in the forest enclosure. Although the spider
      monkeys kept there had an earlier activity onset and morning activity peak than
      their conspecifics in the cage, no consistent differences were found in the
      parameters characterizing the phase-setting of the circadian system to the
      environmental 24-h periodicity, either by comparison or correlation with the
      external time markers of sunrise (SR) and sunset (SS). The most obvious effect of
      late pregnancy, parturition and lactation was a distinct reduction of the
      activity level during the week of parturition and the next. Seasonal variations
      in the form of significant differences between the long-day summer half year and 
      the short-day winter half year were established in the phase-angle differences of
      the morning activity peak to SR, in the evening activity peak and activity offset
      to SS, as well as in the activity time and the peak-to-peak interval, but not in 
      the phase position of activity onset to SR or in the height of the morning and
      evening activity peak. These findings in combination with a high variability of
      the phase angle differences indicate that in A. geoffroyi, a relatively weak
      circadian component and strong masking direct effects of environmental factors
      are involved in the regulation of the daily activity rhythm.

TI  - Melatonin administered during the fetal stage affects circadian clock in the
      suprachiasmatic nucleus but not in the liver.
PG  - 131-44
LID - 10.1002/dneu.22213 [doi]
AB  - The mammalian circadian system develops gradually during ontogenesis, and after
      birth, the system is already set to a phase of the mothers. The role of maternal 
      melatonin in the entrainment of fetal circadian clocks has been suggested, but
      direct evidence is lacking. In our study, intact or pinealectomized pregnant rats
      were exposed to constant light (LL) throughout pregnancy to suppress the
      endogenous melatonin and behavioral rhythms. During the last 5 days of gestation,
      the rats were injected with melatonin or vehicle or were left untreated. After
      delivery, daily expression profiles of c-fos and Avp in the suprachiasmatic
      nuclei (SCN), and Per1, Per2, Rev-erbalpha, and Bmal1 in the liver were measured 
      in 1-day-old pups. Due to the LL exposure, no gene expression rhythms were
      detected in the SCN of untreated pregnant rats or in the SCN and liver of the
      pups. The administration of melatonin to pregnant rats entrained the pups' gene
      expression profiles in the SCN, but not in the liver. Melatonin did not affect
      the maternal behavior during pregnancy. Vehicle injections also synchronized the 
      gene expression in the SCN but not in the liver. Melatonin and vehicle entrained 
      the gene expression profiles to different phases, demonstrating that the effect
      of melatonin was apparently not due to the treatment procedure per se. The data
      demonstrate that in pregnant rats with suppressed endogenous melatonin levels,
      pharmacological doses of melatonin affect the fetal clock in the SCN but not in
      the liver.

AB  - PURPOSE: This qualitative study aimed to explore how Turkish women experience
      nausea and vomiting in pregnancy based on the Roy Adaptation Model. METHODS: To
      collect data, in-depth interviews were undertaken with 35 pregnant women who had 
      nausea and vomiting. The sample of the study included pregnant women who were in 
      their first 12 weeks of gestation, did not have medical problems and had nausea, 
      retching and/or vomiting for at least the last 3 days. Data were collected in
      semi-structured interview form based on the Roy Adaptation Model and with a
      background data sheet. Data were analyzed using direct content analysis. RESULTS:
      Data were classified into four adaptive modes according to the Roy Adaptation
      Model. The behaviors in the physiological mode were nausea, vomiting, fatigue,
      changes in sleep patterns, inadequate nutrition, inguinal pain, burning sensation
      and irritation in the throat, ketosis, and urinary incontinence. The behaviors in
      the self-concept mode were feeling weak, crying, inadequate self-care, changes in
      sexual intercourse, and social isolation. The behaviors in the role function mode
      were being unable to fulfill the responsibilities at home and work. The behaviors
      in the interdependence mode were dissatisfaction with relationships. CONCLUSION: 
      The study findings help nursing staff detect the stimuli and the behaviors of
      pregnant women with nausea and vomiting. Further research may evaluate the impact
      of a counseling program prepared under the guidance of a nursing model on nausea 
      and vomiting in pregnancy.

AB  - We report a patient with pregnancy related obstructive sleep apnea ([OSA]; apnea 
      hypopnea index [AHI] 18/h) early after delivery, with improvement of AHI by 87%
      following 45-degree elevation in body position compared with the non-elevated
      position. Improvement associated with this position may be explained, at least in
      part, by an increased upper airway diameter (as measured during wakefulness).
      Sleep apnea in this patient resolved at 9 months postpartum. This observation
      suggests that 45-degree elevated body position may be an effective treatment of
      pregnancy related OSA during the postpartum period.

AB  - PURPOSES: To analyze which Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Postpartum
      Depression Screening Scores (PDSS) total and dimensional scores, as well as
      symptomatic answers proportions significantly differ between women in the
      perinatal period (pregnant/postpartum) without major depression, with major
      depression and women outside the perinatal period. METHODS: 572 pregnant women in
      the third trimester completed Beck Depression Inventory-II and Postpartum
      Depression Screening Scale and were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for
      Genetic Studies. 417 of these were also assessed (with the same instruments) at
      three months postpartum. Ninety non-pregnant women or that did not have a child
      in the last year (mean age=29.42+/-7.159 years) also filled in the
      questionnaires. RESULTS: Non-depressed pregnant women showed lower scores than
      depressed pregnant women and higher scores than women outside the perinatal
      period in the BDI-II total score and in its Somatic-Anxiety dimension.
      Non-depressed postpartum women showed significantly higher scores than women
      outside the perinatal period only at Sleep/Eating Disturbances. Compared to women
      outside the perinatal period, pregnant women without depression presented higher 
      scores only in the somatic items. Women with vs. without depression in the
      postpartum period did not significantly differ and both presented higher scores
      than women outside the perinatal period in the proportions of loss of energy and 
      sleep changes. LIMITATIONS: Women outside the perinatal period were not diagnosed
      for the presence of a depressive disorder, but their BDI-II mean score was
      similar to the figures reported worldwide regarding women in childbearing age.
      CONCLUSION: In the perinatal period, most particularly at pregnancy, women
      experience significant somatic changes even if not clinically depressed.
      Cognitive-affective symptoms are more useful when assessing the presence of
      perinatal depression.

TI  - Mandibulofacial Dysostosis with Microcephaly
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) is 
      characterized by malar and mandibular hypoplasia; microcephaly (congenital or
      postnatal onset); malformations of the pinna, auditory canal, and/or middle ear
      (ossicles and semi-circular canals) with associated conductive hearing loss; and 
      distinctive facial features (metopic ridge, up- or downslanting palpebral
      fissures, prominent glabella, broad nasal bridge, bulbous nasal tip, and everted 
      lower lip). Associated craniofacial malformations may include cleft palate,
      choanal atresia, and facial asymmetry. Intellectual disability is a prominent
      feature. Major extracranial malformations include: esophageal atresia (~40%),
      congenital heart disease (~40%), and thumb abnormalities (~25%). Short stature is
      present in approximately one third of individuals. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The
      diagnosis of MFDM is suspected in individuals with characteristic clinical
      findings, and confirmed in virtually all affected persons by identification of a 
      heterozygous pathogenic variant or deletion in EFTUD2. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of
      manifestations: Individualized treatment of craniofacial manifestations is
      managed by a multidisciplinary team which may include: plastic surgery,
      otolaryngology, dentistry, orthodontics, oromaxillofacial surgery, and
      occupational and speech/language therapy. Newborn infants may have airway
      compromise at delivery due to choanal atresia and/or mandibular hypoplasia,
      requiring intubation and/or tracheostomy for initial stabilization. Esophageal
      atresia is managed surgically. Cardiac defects are managed by pediatric
      cardiology and/or cardiac surgery. Treatment of hearing loss is individualized,
      and may involve conventional hearing aid(s), bone-anchored hearing aid(s), and/or
      cochlear implant(s). Occupational, physical, and/or speech/language therapies are
      involved as needed to optimize developmental outcome. Surveillance: Periodic
      growth and developmental assessment (preferably by a pediatrician) with inquiry
      into symptoms of seizures and obstructive sleep apnea; routine follow up by
      audiology. Pregnancy management: Management of an affected fetus should include a
      detailed ('level II') fetal ultrasound examination and consultation(s) with
      high-risk obstetrics and/or neonatology, as needed. The delivering team should be
      aware of the potential for neonatal airway compromise. Polyhydramnios, if
      present, should prompt urgent postnatal evaluation for esophageal atresia.
      GENETIC COUNSELING: MFDM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. While most
      affected individuals have a de novo heterozygous EFTUD2 pathogenic sequence
      variant or deletion, familial recurrence can result from either germline
      mosaicism or inheritance of the variant from a parent with a milder phenotype.
      Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic 
      variant has been identified in an affected family member.

TI  - Low-voltage pattern and absence of sleep-wake cycles are associated with severe
      hemorrhage and death in very preterm infants.

LID - 10.1007/s00431-014-2360-0 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: Amplitude integrated electroencephalogaphy (aEEG) is becoming an
      important tool for the assessment of cerebral activity in preterm newborns.
      Describing the relationship between early aEEG patterns and intraventricular
      hemorrhage (IVH) can improve our knowledge of neurological injury in the preterm 
      newborn. The aim of this prospective study was to identify early changes in the
      aEEG in premature newborns that could be associated to severe neurological
      lesion/death. Preterm newborns with a birth weight </=1,500 g and/or 32 weeks of 
      gestation were included. aEEG monitoring was performed during the first 72 h of
      life. A qualitative analysis of the aEEG recordings was performed, based on
      continuity, sleep-wake cycles (SWCs), inferior lower margin amplitude (LMA), and 
      bandwidth (BW). Key outcomes were severe IVH and/or death. Ninety-two subjects
      were included (mean gestational age 28 weeks). In 28.6 % of subjects with HIV
      III/IHP, a low-voltage pattern was observed. A statistically significant
      relationship was found between low-voltage tracings and death and neurological
      lesion/death. Absent SWCs during the first 72 h were also related to death.
      CONCLUSION: Early aEEG patterns can be predictive of neurological outcome in the 
      preterm newborn. Low-voltage tracing and absence of SWCs are associated with
      severe neurological lesions/death.

TI  - Risk factors for excessive gestational weight gain in a healthy, nulliparous
      cohort.
PG  - 148391
LID - 10.1155/2014/148391 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with adverse
      maternal and child outcomes and contributes to obesity in women. Our aim was to
      identify early pregnancy factors associated with excessive GWG, in a contemporary
      nulliparous cohort. METHODS: Participants in the SCOPE study were classified into
      GWG categories ("not excessive" versus "excessive") based on pregravid body mass 
      index (BMI) using 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Maternal
      characteristics and pregnancy risk factors at 14-16 weeks were compared between
      categories and multivariable analysis controlled for confounding factors.
      RESULTS: Of 1950 women, 17% gained weight within the recommended range, 74% had
      excessive and 9% inadequate GWG. Women with excessive GWG were more likely to be 
      overweight (adjOR 2.9 (95% CI 2.2-3.8)) or obese (adjOR 2.5 (95% CI 1.8-3.5))
      before pregnancy compared to women with a normal BMI. Other factors independently
      associated with excessive GWG included recruitment in Ireland, younger maternal
      age, increasing maternal birthweight, cessation of smoking by 14-16 weeks,
      increased nightly sleep duration, high seafood diet, recent immigrant, limiting
      behaviour, and decreasing exercise by 14-16 weeks. Fertility treatment was
      protective. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors
      for excessive GWG provides opportunities for intervention studies to improve
      pregnancy outcome and prevent maternal obesity.

AB  - Short sleep duration, poor sleep quality, and insomnia frequently characterize
      sleep in pregnancy during all three trimesters. We aimed: (i) to review the
      clinical evidence of the association between conditions of sleep loss during
      pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes; and (ii) to discuss the potential
      pathophysiological mechanisms that may be involved. A systematic search of
      cross-sectional, longitudinal studies using Medline, Embase, and PsychINFO, and
      MeSH headings and key words for conditions of sleep loss such as 'insomnia',
      'poor sleep quality', 'short sleep duration', and 'pregnancy outcome' was made
      for papers published between January 1, 1960 and July 2013. Twenty studies met
      inclusion criteria for sleep loss and pregnancy outcome: seven studies on
      prenatal depression, three on gestational diabetes, three on hypertension,
      pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, six on length of labor/type of delivery, eight on
      preterm birth, and three on birth grow/birth weight. Two main results emerged:
      (i) conditions of chronic sleep loss are related to adverse pregnancy outcomes;
      and (ii) chronic sleep loss yields a stress-related
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and abnormal immune/inflammatory, reaction,
      which, in turn, influences pregnancy outcome negatively. Chronic sleep loss
      frequently characterizes sleep throughout the course of pregnancy and may
      contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Common pathophysiological mechanisms
      emerged as being related to stress system activation. We propose that in
      accordance to the allostatic load hypothesis, chronic sleep loss during pregnancy
      may also be regarded as both a result of stress and a physiological stressor per 
      se, leading to stress 'overload'. It may account for adverse pregnancy outcomes
      and somatic and mental disorders in pregnancy.

TI  - Assisted conception, maternal personality and parenting: Associations with
      toddler sleep behaviour.
PG  - 732-8
LID - 10.1111/jpc.12654 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To explore the role of maternal personality (hardiness), sleep-related
      cognitions and bedtime involvement in child sleep behaviour during the second
      post-natal year in a sample of spontaneous and assisted conception first-time
      mothers. METHOD: Mothers (n = 134 (spontaneous (n = 81); assisted (n = 53)
      conception)) reported on a resilience measure (hardiness) during pregnancy and
      child sleep at 7 and 19 months post-partum. At 19 months post-partum, mothers
      also reported on their cognitions and involvement around their child's bedtime,
      and half the sample used Actigraph monitors (Acitiwatch-16, Mini Mitter Co. Inc, 
      Bend, OR, USA) to validate maternal report of child sleep. RESULTS: No
      significant differences were found between spontaneous and assisted conception
      mothers on any of the study variables; therefore, assisted and spontaneous
      samples were combined. Structural equation modelling confirmed that lower
      pre-birth maternal hardiness was associated with more problematic sleep-related
      cognitions (beta = 0.23, P < 0.01) and involvement at bedtime (beta = 0.29, P <
      0.01) and poorer child sleep outcomes (beta = -0.33, P < 0.001) during
      toddlerhood, even after considering concurrent maternal mood and child
      temperament. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-birth maternal hardiness rather than mode of
      conception contributes to parenting cognitions and behaviour around child sleep
      and, ultimately, toddlers' sleep outcomes. Findings suggest that targeting
      negative maternal perceptions of control and efficacy through clinical
      interventions could benefit toddlers' sleep.

TI  - Interaction of hydrophobic components in female urine before and after childbirth
      with P-glycoprotein in vitro.
PG  - 430-6
AB  - The first urine in the morning (total 15 samples) and whole day urine (total 4
      days, 17 samples) were collected from a young healthy woman during the pregnancy 
      and lactation period, to examine the possible interactions of urine components
      (methanol extracts) with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug
      resistance-associated proteins (MRPs). The interaction was evaluated by measuring
      the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine123, a P-gp substrate, in
      LLC-GA5-COL150 cells, or calcein, an MRP substrate, in Caco-2 cells in the
      absence and presence of urine components. Four first urine samples out of 12
      collected before childbirth and one sample out of three collected after
      childbirth suppressed P-gp function significantly. The effect of pregnancy and
      lactation on P-gp inhibitory potencies of urine components was not observed. The 
      whole day urine samples showed a clear circadian rhythm, in which three first
      urine samples in the morning out of four showed greater P-gp inhibitory potencies
      than other daytime samples. Interaction of urine components with MRPs was not
      detected. In conclusion, the concentration of endogenous P-gp inhibitor(s) was
      higher in the first urine in the morning, showing a clear circadian rhythm.
      Normal pregnancy and lactation appeared not to significantly affect the P-gp
      inhibitory potencies of urine components.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for adverse perinatal
      outcomes. We aimed to test the hypothesis that maternal Mallampati class (MC), as
      a marker for OSA, is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We
      performed a retrospective secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of term
      births (>/= 37 weeks). Fetal anomalies and aneuploidy were excluded. Primary
      outcome was small for gestational age (SGA). Secondary outcomes included
      preeclampsia, neonatal cord arterial blood gas pH < 7.10 and < 7.05, base excess 
      < - 8 and < - 12 mEq/L. Outcomes were compared between mothers with low MC
      airways and high MC airways using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,823 
      women met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were found in the
      risk of SGA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      0.6-1.2), preeclampsia (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.9) or neonatal acidemia (aOR 0.8,
      95% CI 0.3-2.0), between high and low MC. CONCLUSION: High MC is not associated
      with adverse perinatal outcomes.

TI  - Quality of life in pregnant women with sleep disorder.
PG  - 87-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disorders are common complaints of women during pregnancy. These
      disorders are the result of physiological, hormonal, physical changes, affecting 
      before, during, and right after pregnancy. This study aimed to evaluate the
      quality of life of pregnant women with sleep disorders in the second trimester.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data was collected with
      continuous sampling method. A total of 100 pregnant women with sleep disturbances
      in their second trimesters were recruited in this study. The participant referred
      to two elected health centers in West Azerbaijan University of Medical Science
      (One and three numbers of health care centers) in order to get prenatal care in
      the city of Maku, West Azerbaijan, Iran. The data was gathered using the personal
      information forms and the questionnaires, prepared by the World Health
      Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL: BREF). To analyze the collected data,
      different statistical methods, like frequency tables, Pearson, Spearman and ANOVA
      were applied. RESULTS: The results indicate that the mean sleep quality is 8.62
      +/- 2.81 in pregnant women with sleep disorders or poor quality of sleep in the
      second trimester. Quality of life (p </= 0.03) and one of domains, including
      psychological health (p </= 0.02) related to quality of sleep. CONCLUSION: Given 
      that a large percentage of women suffer from sleep disorders in pregnancy, we
      hope during this period, in addition to usual care, codified programs is done to 
      evaluate, detection and Diagnosis of this disorder.

TI  - The potential value of sleep hygiene for a healthy pregnancy: a brief review.
PG  - 928293
LID - 10.1155/2014/928293 [doi]
AB  - The quality of the intrauterine environment influences maternal-fetal health and 
      also offspring predisposition to obesity and cardiometabolic disease later in
      life. Several determinants, including but not limited to pregravid obesity and
      excessive gestational weight gain, alter the developmental milieu, fetal growth, 
      and child obesity risk. However, the role of sleep and its relationship to
      healthy pregnancy is not fully established. Given the host of psychosocial and
      physiological complications associated with childhood obesity, targeting the
      gestational period is purported to be an opportune time for preventive
      intervention. Many longitudinal studies suggest that short sleep duration is a
      risk factor for the development of impaired glycemia and obesity. However, there 
      is a dearth of information concerning the role of sleep hygiene and its role in a
      healthy pregnancy. Reports note disrupted and poorer quality of sleep during
      gestation and highlight an association between reduced sleep and risk of
      gestational diabetes mellitus. Given the lack of well-designed human trials
      assessing the value of sleep and healthy pregnancy outcomes, this review
      summarizes current evidence which suggests that incorporating sleep
      recommendations and utilizing time management strategies that encourage a
      healthful night 's sleep may improve the health of the mom and the baby.

TI  - A population-based study of factors associated with nocturia in reproductive-aged
      Turkish women.
PG  - 405-10
LID - 10.4111/kju.2014.55.6.405 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of nocturia according to 
      the International Continence Society (ICS) definition in Turkish women and to
      determine the associated risk factors and the correlation of other voiding
      symptoms with nocturia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective epidemiological
      study was carried out by use of self-reported questionnaires in 4,250
      reproductive-aged women from January 2013 to May 2013. The International
      Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form and a questionnaire
      developed by the researchers according to the ICS were administered to define
      nocturia and other lower urinary tract symptoms. Other physical, reproductive,
      and health characteristics were also recorded concurrently. RESULTS: Overall,
      1,636 women were included in the final analyses. The women had an average age of 
      34.4+/-5.26 years. The overall prevalence of nocturia was 34.7% (567 of 1,636
      women). Women with nocturia were older (p<0.001), had a higher body mass index
      (p=0.026), and had more children (p<0.001). Nocturia occurred more frequently in 
      women with a history of nocturnal enuresis (p<0.001). Three or more pregnancies, 
      3 or more deliveries, and age >40 years were significant risk factors for
      nocturia. We also found that other lower urinary tract symptoms correlated
      significantly (p<0.001) with nocturia. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of
      nocturia is higher with increasing age, younger adults are also affected.
      Nocturia may cause sleep disorders, mood disturbances, reduced quality of life,
      and distractibility. Thus, even if one void nightly causes a patient to
      experience bother, nocturia should be queried about and should be treated if
      necessary according to the cause of the disease.

AB  - Intrauterine infection or inflammation in preterm neonates is a known risk for
      adverse neurological outcomes, including cognitive, motor and behavioral
      disabilities. Our previous data suggest that there is acute fetal brain
      inflammation in a mouse model of intrauterine exposure to lipopolysaccharides
      (LPS). We hypothesized that the in utero inflammation induced by LPS produces
      long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the
      exposed mice that could be determined by using continuous quantitative
      video/EEG/electromyogram (EMG) analyses. A single LPS injection at E17 was
      performed in pregnant CD1 dams. Control dams were injected with same volumes of
      saline (LPS n=10, Control n=8). At postnatal age of P90-100, 24-h synchronous
      video/EEG/EMG recordings were done using a tethered recording system and
      implanted subdural electrodes. Behavioral state scoring was performed blind to
      treatment group, on each 10s EEG epoch using synchronous video, EMG and EEG trace
      signatures to generate individual hypnograms. Automated EEG power spectrums were 
      analyzed for delta and theta-beta power ratios during wake vs. sleep cycles. Both
      control and LPS hypnograms showed an ultradian wake/sleep cycling. Since rodents 
      are nocturnal animals, control mice showed the expected diurnal variation with
      significantly longer time spent in wake states during the dark cycle phase. In
      contrast, the LPS-treated mice lost this circadian rhythm. Sleep microstructure
      also showed significant alteration in the LPS mice specifically during the dark
      cycle, caused by significantly longer average non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycle
      durations. No significance was found between treatment groups for the delta power
      data; however, significant activity-dependent changes in theta-beta power ratios 
      seen in controls were absent in the LPS-exposed mice. In conclusion, exposure to 
      in utero inflammation in CD1 mice resulted in significantly altered sleep
      architecture as adults that were circadian cycle and activity state dependent.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether maternal mental health mediates the relationship 
      between eczema or asthma symptoms and mental well-being in children. STUDY
      DESIGN: Analysis of 7250 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
      Children. Child mental well-being at 8 years was measured by the Strengths and
      Difficulties Questionnaire. Binary outcomes were high 'internalizing'
      (anxious/depressive) and 'externalizing' (oppositional/hyperactive) problems
      (high was >90th percentile). Child rash and wheeze categories were 'none'; 'early
      onset transient' (infancy/preschool only); 'persistent' (infancy/preschool and at
      school age); and 'late onset' (school age only). Maternal anxiety and depression 
      were reported during pregnancy and when child was 8 years old. RESULTS:
      Persistent wheezing symptoms were associated with high externalizing (OR 1.74,
      95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and internalizing (1.67, 1.35-2.06) problems compared with
      never wheeze. Maternal anxiety and depression, and disrupted child sleep,
      attenuated these associations. Persistent rash (externalizing: 1.74, 1.40-2.15;
      internalizing: 1.42, 1.16-1.74) and late onset rash (externalizing: 1.62,
      1.17-2.25; internalizing: 1.46, 1.07-1.99) symptoms were associated with poorer
      mental well-being compared with no rash at any age. Maternal anxiety and
      depression, particularly when child was aged 8 years rather than during
      pregnancy, accounted for the association with internalizing symptoms and partly
      for externalizing symptoms. Sleep disruption did not mediate the association.
      CONCLUSIONS: Maternal anxiety and depression may mediate the association between 
      child rash and wheeze and child mental well-being.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the psychological mechanisms involved in the close
      association between maternal mood and self-reports of sleep quality during the
      perinatal period using appraisal theory of emotions. DESIGN: Repeated measures.
      SETTING: Antenatal clinics of a health center associated with the Northern
      Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 122 pregnant women in their third
      trimester of gestation. METHODS: Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index (PSQI), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and an appraisal 
      questionnaire during the third trimester of gestation, within 7 to 10 days after 
      childbirth, and at 10 to 12 weeks postpartum. Correlational and regression
      analyses were used to explore the associations between sleep reports and
      appraisals. RESULTS: Self-reports of poor sleep quality, impaired daytime
      dysfunction due to poor sleep, and the global PSQI score were associated with a
      low perceived ability to cope practically and emotionally with motherhood-related
      issues as well as with negative expectations about the future. CONCLUSIONS:
      Appraisal dimensions associated with self-reports of poor sleep quality are
      similar to those related to maternal distress identified by previous research.
      This finding contributes to a better understanding of the association between
      self-reports of sleep and maternal mood. Practical implications are discussed.

TI  - Factors associated with bed-sharing for African American and White mothers in
      Wisconsin.
PG  - 720-32
LID - 10.1007/s10995-014-1545-5 [doi]
AB  - Mother-infant bed-sharing has been associated with a higher risk of sleep-related
      infant deaths, which affects African Americans at a disproportionately higher
      rate. Although "separate but proximate sleep surfaces" for infants has been
      recommended since 2005, bed-sharing remains a common practice, especially among
      African Americans. This study examined factors associated with bed-sharing among 
      African American and White mothers. Separate logistic regression models were
      constructed for African American and White respondents to the 2007-2010 Wisconsin
      Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System. The sample consisted of 806
      African Americans and 1,680 Whites (N = 2,486). A significantly larger proportion
      of African Americans (70.6 %) reported bed-sharing than Whites (53.4 %). For both
      races, partner-related stress was significantly associated with bed-sharing; no
      significant differences were found between the two racial groups. For African
      Americans, partner stress (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) and maternal education of 13-15 years
      (OR 2.0: 1.2-3.4) or >/=16 years (OR 2.7: 1.1-6.3) was associated with increased 
      odds of bed-sharing. For Whites, partner stress (OR 1.3: 1-1.8), breastfeeding
      (OR 2.5: 1.9-3.1), income of $35,000-$49,999 (OR 1.6: 1.2-2.3), being unmarried
      (OR 1.5: 1.1-2.2), needing money for food (OR 1.6: 1.1-2.3), and non-supine sleep
      (OR 1.8: 1.2-2.6) were associated with increased odds of bed-sharing. Differences
      were found in bed-sharing factors between racial groups which suggests a need for
      culturally-relevant, tailored safe infant sleep interventions. Providers should
      ask families about their infant's sleeping environment and address safety issues 
      within that environment. More research is needed on the context and reasons for
      bed-sharing.

TI  - Melatonin secretion is impaired in women with preeclampsia and an abnormal
      circadian blood pressure rhythm.
PG  - 1001-7
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2014.926216 [doi]
AB  - Non-dipping circadian blood pressure (BP) is a common finding in preeclampsia,
      accompanied by adverse outcomes. Melatonin plays pivotal role in biological
      circadian rhythms. This study investigated the relationship between melatonin
      secretion and circadian BP rhythm in preeclampsia. Cases were women with
      preeclampsia treated between January 2006 and June 2007 in the University
      Hospital of Larissa. Volunteers with normal pregnancy, matched for chronological 
      and gestational age, served as controls. Twenty-four hour ambulatory BP
      monitoring was applied. Serum melatonin and urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin levels
      were determined in day and night time samples by enzyme-linked immunoassays.
      Measurements were repeated 2 months after delivery. Thirty-one women with
      preeclampsia and 20 controls were included. Twenty-one of the 31 women with
      preeclampsia were non-dippers. Compared to normal pregnancy, in preeclampsia
      there were significantly lower night time melatonin (48.4 +/- 24.7 vs. 85.4 +/-
      26.9 pg/mL, p<0.001) levels. Adjustment for circadian BP rhythm status ascribed
      this finding exclusively to non-dippers (p<0.01). Two months after delivery, in
      11 of the 21 non-dippers both circadian BP and melatonin secretion rhythm
      reappeared. In contrast, in cases with retained non-dipping status (n=10)
      melatonin secretion rhythm remained impaired: daytime versus night time melatonin
      (33.5 +/- 13.0 vs. 28.0 +/- 13.8 pg/mL, p=0.386). Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin
      levels were, overall, similar to serum melatonin. Circadian BP and melatonin
      secretion rhythm follow parallel course in preeclampsia, both during pregnancy
      and, at least 2 months after delivery. Our findings may be not sufficient to
      implicate a putative therapeutic effect of melatonin, however, they clearly
      emphasize that its involvement in the pathogenesis of a non-dipping BP in
      preeclampsia needs intensive further investigation.

TI  - On the time course, generality, and regulation of plasma progesterone release in 
      male rats by stress exposure.
PG  - 3527-37
LID - 10.1210/en.2014-1060 [doi]
AB  - Although progesterone is most commonly regarded in terms of its role in the
      female estrous cycle, reproductive behavior, and pregnancy, progesterone is also 
      a precursor to corticosterone (CORT) and is released from the adrenal glands of
      both sexes in response to stress. However, the relationship between plasma CORT
      and progesterone during times of stress has not been well established. To better 
      characterize dynamic changes in progesterone release as a result of stressor
      exposure, plasma progesterone levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay under
      multiple conditions, including after stress exposure (footshock, restraint, and
      forced swim), manipulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (injection
      of metyrapone or dexamethasone, or adrenalectomy), and in response to CRH and
      ACTH injections. When plasma levels of ACTH, CORT, and progesterone were analyzed
      across studies, CORT and progesterone were found to be highly correlated and
      rarely dissociated. Additionally, it appears that in male rats, the adrenal
      glands are the principle source of circulating progesterone in response to
      stress. Interestingly, a detailed time course indicated lack of a circadian
      rhythm of progesterone secretion, despite a robust rhythm of circulating CORT.
      The current studies provide critical new information on the coincident release of
      progesterone and CORT in response to stress and their somewhat paradoxical
      dissociation across the circadian rhythm. These findings provide an important
      foundation for future studies that will examine the role of stress-induced
      progesterone in behavioral, neuroimmune, and neuroendocrine responses to stress.

      (ODMs). SUBJECTS/METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed. The offspring
      of 63 pregnant women (23 controls, 21 diet-controlled gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) and 19 insulin-treated GDM) were recruited. Maternal and venous
      cord plasma DHA percentages were analyzed. Skin temperature and activity in
      children were recorded for 72 h at 3 and 6 months of life. Neurodevelopment was
      assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development II (BSID II) at 6 and 12
      months of age. RESULTS: Cord plasma DHA percentage was significantly lower in the
      ODMs compared with that in the controls (Control 6.43 [5.04-7.82](a); GDM+diet
      5.65 [4.44-6.86](ab); GDM+insulin 5.53 [4.45-6.61](b)). Both mental (Control
      102.71 [97.61-107.81](a); GDM+diet 100.39 [91.43-109.35](a); GDM+insulin 93.94
      [88.31-99.57](b)) and psychomotor (Control 91.52 [81.82-101.22](a); GDM+diet
      81.67 [73.95-89.39](b); GDM+insulin 81.89 [71.96-91.85](b)) scores evaluated by
      the BSID II were significantly lower at 6 months in ODMs, even after adjusting
      for confounding factors such as breastfeeding, maternal educational level and
      gender. Cord plasma DHA percentage correlated with the psychomotor score from
      BSID II (r=0.27; P=0.049) and with the intra-daily variability in activity
      (r=-0.24; P=0.043) at 6 months. Maternal DHA was correlated with several sleep
      rhythm maturation parameters at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Lower DHA levels in cord
      plasma of ODMs could affect their neurodevelopment. Maternal DHA status was also 
      associated with higher values in the sleep rhythm maturation parameters of
      children.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of using the Apnea Risk Evaluation System
      (ARES) Unicorder for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women.
      METHODS: Sixteen pregnant women, mean age (SD) = 29.8 (5.4) years, average
      gestational age (SD) = 28.6 (6.3) weeks, mean body mass index (SD) = 44.7 (6.9)
      kg/m(2) with signs and symptoms of OSA wore the ARES Unicorder during one night
      of laboratory polysomnography (PSG). PSG was scored according to AASM 2007
      criteria, and PSG AHI and RDI were compared to the ARES 1%, 3%, and 4% AHIs
      calculated with the ARES propriety software. RESULTS: Median PSG AHI and PSG RDI 
      were 3.1 and 10.3 events/h of sleep, respectively. Six women had a PSG AHI >/= 5 
      events/h of sleep and 11 had a PSG RDI >/= 5 events/h of sleep. PSG AHI and RDI
      were strongly correlated with the ARES AHI measures. When compared with
      polysomnographic diagnosis of OSA, the ARES 3% algorithm provided the best
      balance between sensitivity (1.0 for PSG AHI, 0.91 for PSG RDI) and specificity
      (0.5 for PSG AHI, 0.8 for PSG RDI) for detecting sleep disordered breathing in
      our sample. CONCLUSIONS: The ARES Unicorder demonstrated reasonable consistency
      with PSG for diagnosing OSA in this small, heterogeneous sample of obese pregnant
      women.

AB  - The majority of children and adolescents with epilepsy are managed in the
      community setting by general paediatricians. However, there is a paucity of
      practical, relevant information and standardised management documents assisting
      paediatricians. In the era of sub-specialisation, an electronic educational
      resource developed by specialists in epilepsy and paediatrics enhances the
      interface between tertiary and secondary/primary care. We aimed to create a
      website (www.pennsw.com.au) designed to optimise the care of all children and
      adolescents living with epilepsy and to assess its clinical usefulness. The site 
      provides clinicians and families an aligned resource, including key information
      on epilepsy syndromes, medication usage and adverse effects, safety (sleep
      deprivation, water sports), driving, pregnancy, psychosocial impact of epilepsy
      and coping skills. General paediatricians and carers completed a questionnaire,
      utilising rating scales and open ended questions, to evaluate design, content and
      clinical usefulness. Forty-nine general paediatricians with a median 12 years of 
      paediatric practice participated. Thirty-two carers participated. Epilepsy
      syndrome was focal in 59% of the children and generalised in 41%. The majority of
      participants (paediatricians: 84-100%, families: 69-100%) rated the website as
      well designed, practical, informative and clinically useful. General
      paediatricians considered the "Medication" pages and "Epilepsy Management
      Documents" as practically useful. Carers recorded the "Family Resources", seizure
      recording documents, the support information on mental health, and the "Coping
      with Epilepsy" segment as most informative. General paediatricians and carers
      highly valued the website, reflected by 120,000 page views in 12 months since its
      launch.

      else: the broad differential of kindergarten suspension.
PG  - 344-6
LID - 10.1097/DBP.0000000000000066 [doi]
AB  - CASE: Thomas is a 5-year 6-month-old boy whose parents requested an urgent care
      appointment because he has recently been suspended from kindergarten stating "and
      his doctor must see him before he can come back." His suspension from
      kindergarten was due to kicking and biting his classmates, but he has also become
      increasingly aggressive at home. His teacher reported that he has always had a
      high activity level and difficulty shifting attention between tasks, as well as
      noncompliance with rules and directions. He is noted to have learning challenges 
      and is showing difficulties in the concept of numbers and letter sounds. The
      practice has followed Thomas since his healthy birth. He has a history of delayed
      language development, and he received early intervention services from 2 years of
      age. He spoke his first word at 2 years 6 months. He started a half-day preschool
      program at 3 years of age. He had difficulty acclimating to preschool,
      interacting with peers, and was described as "hyperactive" by his teachers. His
      program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he 
      often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom. His parents 
      have always described him as a "difficult child." He gets frustrated easily and
      can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs
      or requests are not met. He has difficulty falling asleep, has frequent night
      awakenings, and often has trouble getting back to sleep. His self-help skills are
      poor, and he has difficulty with activities such as brushing his teeth and
      dressing. His parents report that he does not seem to remember rules from day to 
      day. He was evaluated at 5 years of age and diagnosed with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder, but his response to stimulants has been limited. Thomas
      is an only child. His parents are college educated and professionally employed.
      They deny drug use, domestic violence, and guns in the home. They reported that
      prior to the pregnancy, they enjoyed "partying" with friends on the weekends, but
      Thomas's mother reported that she stopped drinking as soon as she realized she
      was pregnant. All are wondering whether this child might have a fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorder, although he seems to have no clear facial dysmorphology. It is
      unsure what the next step might be and if there is value added in pursuing this
      diagnosis. What do you do next?

      study.
PG  - 1685-93
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.12885 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of obstructive sleep apnoea among women with
      and without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING:
      Obstetric clinics at an academic medical centre. POPULATION: Pregnant women with 
      hypertensive disorders (chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or
      pre-eclampsia) and women who were normotensive. METHODS: Women completed a
      questionnaire about habitual snoring and underwent overnight ambulatory
      polysomnography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence and severity of obstructive 
      sleep apnoea. RESULTS: Obstructive sleep apnoea was found among 21 of 51 women
      with hypertensive disorders (41%), but in only three of 16 women who were
      normotensive (19%, chi-square test, P=0.005). [Author correction added on 16 June
      2014, after first online publication: Results mentioned in the abstract were
      amended.] Non-snoring women with hypertensive disorders typically had mild
      obstructive sleep apnoea, but >25% of snoring women with hypertensive disorders
      had moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea. Among women with hypertensive
      disorders, the mean apnoea/hypopnoea index was substantially higher in snorers
      than in non-snorers (19.9+/-34.1 versus 3.4+/-3.1, P=0.013), and the
      oxyhaemoglobin saturation nadir was significantly lower (86.4+/-6.6 versus
      90.2+/-3.5, P=0.021). Among women with hypertensive disorders, after
      stratification by obesity, the pooled relative risk for obstructive sleep apnoea 
      in snoring women with hypertension compared with non-snoring women with
      hypertension was 2.0 (95% CI 1.4-2.8). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with
      hypertension are at high risk for unrecognised obstructive sleep apnoea. Although
      longitudinal and intervention studies are urgently needed, given the known
      relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension in the general
      population, it would seem pertinent that hypertensive pregnant women who snore
      should be tested for obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition believed to cause or
      promote hypertension.

TI  - Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy and related risk factors: a
      cross-sectional study in southern Sweden.
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1186/1472-6874-14-63 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Domestic violence during pregnancy is a serious public health issue
      which threatens maternal and foetal health outcomes. The aim of the study was to 
      explore prevalence of domestic violence among pregnant women in southern Sweden
      (Scania) and to explore associations with background factors, as symptoms of
      depression and sense of coherence. METHODS: This study has a cross-sectional
      design and is the first part of a longitudinal, cohort study. Inclusion criteria 
      were women >/= 18 years, registered at antenatal care when pregnant and who
      understand and write Swedish or English. Questionnaires were collected
      prospectively at seventeen antenatal care receptions situated in the two cities
      and six smaller municipalities in Scania. Statistical analyses were done using
      descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, bivariate logistic regression and
      multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). 
      RESULTS: Study sample included 1939 women. History of violence was reported by
      39.5% (n =761) women. Significant differences were obtained between the groups
      with or without history of violence regarding being single/living apart,
      unemployment, financial distress, smoking/snuffing, unintended pregnancy as well 
      as history of miscarriage/legalised abortion (p < 0.001). Experience of domestic 
      violence during pregnancy regardless of type or level of abuse was 1.0% (n = 18);
      history of physical abuse by actual intimate partner was 2.2% (n = 42). History
      of violence was the strongest risk factor associated with domestic violence
      during pregnancy, where all women (n = 18) exposed reported history of violence
      (p < 0.001). Several symptoms of depression (adjusted for low socio-economic
      status, miscarriage/abortion, single/living apart, lack of sleep, unemployment,
      age and parity) were associated with a 7.0 fold risk of domestic violence during 
      pregnancy (OR 7.0; 95% CI: 1.9-26.3). CONCLUSIONS: The reported prevalence of
      domestic violence during pregnancy in southwest Sweden is low. However, a
      considerable proportion of women reported history of living in a violent
      relationship. Both history of violence and the presence of several depressive
      symptoms detected in early pregnancy may indicate that the woman also is exposed 
      to domestic violence during pregnancy. Increased attention to this vulnerable
      group of women is needed to improve maternal and child health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The United Kingdom has one of the highest rates of stillbirth in
      Europe, resulting in approximately 4,000 stillbirths every year. Potentially
      modifiable risk factors for late stillbirths are maternal age, obesity and
      smoking, but the population attributable risk associated with these risk factors 
      is small.Recently the Auckland Stillbirth Study reported that maternal sleep
      position was associated with late stillbirth. Women who did not sleep on their
      left side on the night before the death of the baby had double the risk compared 
      with sleeping on other positions. The population attributable risk was 37%. This 
      novel observation needs to be replicated or refuted. METHODS/DESIGN: Case control
      study of late singleton stillbirths without congenital abnormality. Controls are 
      women with an ongoing singleton pregnancy, who are randomly selected from
      participating maternity units booking list of pregnant women, they are allocated 
      a gestation for interview based on the distribution of gestations of stillbirths 
      from the previous 4 years for the unit. The number of controls selected is
      proportional to the number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital over the 
      previous 4 years. DATA COLLECTION: Interviewer administered questionnaire and
      data extracted from medical records. SAMPLE SIZE: 415 cases and 830 controls.
      This takes into account a 30% non-participation rate, and will detect an OR of
      1.5 with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% for variables with a
      prevalence of 57%, such as non-left sleeping position. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
      Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and unconditional logistic regression to adjust for
      potential confounders. DISCUSSION: The hypotheses to be tested here are
      important, biologically plausible and amenable to a public health intervention.
      Although this case-control study cannot prove causation, there is a striking
      parallel with research relating to sudden infant death syndrome, where
      case-control studies identified prone sleeping position as a major modifiable
      risk factor. Subsequently mothers were advised to sleep babies prone ("Back to
      Sleep" campaign), which resulted in a dramatic drop in SIDS. This study will
      provide robust evidence to help determine whether such a public health
      intervention should be considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02025530.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with complications including pregnancy-induced
      hypertension (PIH) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) often experience
      disrupted sleep patterns because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system.
      These pathologies are aggravated by sympathetic nervous system activation and may
      be related to stress. The present study aimed to clarify the characteristics of
      and changes in sleep quality and stress in pregnant women with PIH and GDM during
      the second and third trimesters. METHODS: We enrolled 56 women in their second or
      third trimesters who were diagnosed with PIH or GDM. Participants completed
      questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SlgA) concentrations
      were measured as a biological indicator of stress. RESULTS: PSS scores and
      subjective stress parameters were significantly higher than those reported from
      previous studies of healthy pregnant women (15.2 points and 15.1 points for the
      second and third trimesters, respectively). Mean one-day values for SIgA were
      168.3 and 205.7 mug/mL for the second and third trimesters, respectively. During 
      the second and third trimesters, SIgA scores were higher than those reported for 
      healthy pregnant women in previous studies. The PSQI component scores sleep
      disturbance (C5) and sleep duration (C3) in follow up case were significantly
      higher in the third trimester than in the second trimester. DISCUSSION: This
      investigation suggests that pregnant women with PIH and GDM experience higher
      stress levels than do non-pregnant women and healthy pregnant women. Further, our
      results indicate that sleep quality worsens during the third trimester compared
      with the second trimester.

PG  - 727-54
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S61340 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to summarize evidence for the
      effectiveness of music therapy (MT) and to assess the quality of systematic
      reviews (SRs) based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). STUDY DESIGN: An SR
      of SRs based on RCTs. METHODS: Studies were eligible if they were RCTs. Studies
      included were those with at least one treatment group in which MT was applied. We
      searched the following databases from 1995 to October 1, 2012: MEDLINE via
      PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of
      Science, Global Health Library, and Ichushi-Web. We also searched all Cochrane
      Database and Campbell Systematic Reviews up to October 1, 2012. Based on the
      International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, we identified a disease 
      targeted for each article. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met all inclusion
      criteria. This study included 16 Cochrane reviews. As a whole, the quality of the
      articles was very good. Eight studies were about "Mental and behavioural
      disorders (F00-99)"; there were two studies on "Diseases of the nervous system
      (G00-99)" and "Diseases of the respiratory system (J00-99)"; and there was one
      study each for "Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (E00-90)",
      "Diseases of the circulatory system (I00-99)", and "Pregnancy, childbirth and the
      puerperium (O60)". MT treatment improved the following: global and social
      functioning in schizophrenia and/or serious mental disorders, gait and related
      activities in Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality.
      CONCLUSION: THIS COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF SRS DEMONSTRATED THAT MT TREATMENT
      IMPROVED THE FOLLOWING: global and social functioning in schizophrenia and/or
      serious mental disorders, gait and related activities in Parkinson's disease,
      depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. MT may have the potential for improving
      other diseases, but there is not enough evidence at present. Most importantly, no
      specific adverse effect or harmful phenomenon occurred in any of the studies, and
      MT was well tolerated by almost all patients.

TI  - Mechanisms underlying the effects of prenatal psychosocial stress on child
      outcomes: beyond the HPA axis.
PG  - 943-56
LID - 10.1007/s00787-014-0566-3 [doi]
AB  - Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that
      maternal psychosocial stress and anxiety during pregnancy adversely affect child 
      outcomes. However, knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying these
      relations is limited. In the present paper, we review the most often proposed
      mechanism, namely that involving the HPA axis and cortisol, as well as other less
      well-studied but possibly relevant and complementary mechanisms. We present
      evidence for a role of the following mechanisms: compromised placental
      functioning, including the 11beta-HSD2 enzyme, increased catecholamines,
      compromised maternal immune system and intestinal microbiota, and altered health 
      behaviors including eating, sleep, and exercise. The roles of (epi)genetics, the 
      postnatal environment and the fetus are also discussed. We conclude that maternal
      prenatal psychosocial stress is a complex phenomenon that affects maternal
      emotions, behavior and physiology in many ways, and may influence the physiology 
      and functioning of the fetus through a network of different pathways. The review 
      concludes with recommendations for future research that helps our understanding
      of the mechanisms by which maternal prenatal stress exerts its effect on the
      fetus.

PG  - 63-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To objectify indications for treatment with pantogam in premature
      infants with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury of the CNS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      We studied 71 children, with GA (gestation age) 24-36 weeks (32,9+/-2,9 weeks),
      with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury of the CNS, I-II grades, and
      hyperexitability syndrome. The main group (33 patients) received pantogam in dose
      50 mg/kg/day at the adjusted age (AA) 36-40 weeks from the conception. The
      comparison group included 38 patients. EEG day sleep monitoring was performed
      before and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Shortening of sleep cycle was
      observed in 78,8% children of the main group and in 78,9% of the comparison
      group. Duration of transitional sleep over 1 min was 78,79% and 81,58%. At AA
      44-46 weeks, the frequency of sleep disorders decreased to 45,45% (p=0,012) and
      52,63% (p=0,05). Duration of transitional sleep over 1 min was 45,45% and 65,79%.
      Duration of the latent period of the 2nd stage of slow wave sleep was 6,4+/-2,57 
      and 12,5+/-7,18 min (p=0,0004). CONCLUSION: The treatment reduced sleep
      disorders, changed the duration of transitional sleep stage and latent period of 
      the 2nd stage of slow wave sleep.

BTI - Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault
AB  - The Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey
      (NCVS) measures the rates at which Americans are victims of crimes, including
      rape and sexual assault, but there is concern that rape and sexual assault are
      undercounted on this survey. BJS asked the National Research Council to
      investigate this issue and recommend best practices for measuring rape and sexual
      assault on their household surveys. Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual
      Assault concludes that it is likely that the NCVS is undercounting rape and
      sexual assault. The most accurate counts of rape and sexual assault cannot be
      achieved without measuring them separately from other victimizations, the report 
      says. It recommends that BJS develop a separate survey for measuring rape and
      sexual assault. The new survey should more precisely define ambiguous words such 
      as "rape," give more privacy to respondents, and take other steps that would
      improve the accuracy of responses. Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual
      Assault takes a fresh look at the problem of measuring incidents of rape and
      sexual assault from the criminal justice perspective. This report examines issues
      such as the legal definitions in use by the states for these crimes, best methods
      for representing the definitions in survey instruments so that their meaning is
      clear to respondents, and best methods for obtaining as complete reporting as
      possible of these crimes in surveys, including methods whereby respondents may
      report anonymously. Rape and sexual assault are among the most injurious crimes a
      person can inflict on another. The effects are devastating, extending beyond the 
      initial victimization to consequences such as unwanted pregnancy, sexually
      transmitted infections, sleep and eating disorders, and other emotional and
      physical problems. Understanding the frequency and context under which rape and
      sexual assault are committed is vital in directing resources for law enforcement 
      and support for victims. These data can influence public health and mental health
      policies and help identify interventions that will reduce the risk of future
      attacks. Sadly, accurate information about the extent of sexual assault and rape 
      is difficult to obtain because most of these crimes go unreported to police.
      Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault focuses on methodology and
      vehicles used to measure rape and sexual assaults, reviews potential sources of
      error within the NCVS survey, and assesses the training and monitoring of
      interviewers in an effort to improve reporting of these crimes.

AB  - Overwhelming evidence reveals the close link between unwarranted weight gain
      among childbearing women and childhood adiposity. Yet current barriers limit the 
      capacity of perinatal health care providers (PHCPs) to offer healthy lifestyle
      counselling. In response, today's Internet savvy women are turning to online
      resources to access health information, with the potential of revolutionising
      health services by enabling PHCPs to guide women to appropriate online resources.
      This paper presents the findings of a project designed to develop an online
      resource to promote healthy lifestyles during the perinatal period. The
      methodology involved focus groups and interviews with perinatal women and PHCPs
      to determine what online information was needed, in what form, and how best it
      should be presented. The outcome was the development of the Healthy You, Healthy 
      Baby website and smartphone app. This clinically-endorsed, interactive online
      resource provides perinatal women with a personalised tool to track their weight,
      diet, physical activity, emotional wellbeing, and sleep patterns based on the
      developmental stage of their child with links to quality-assured information. One
      year since the launch of the online resource, data indicates it provides a
      low-cost intervention delivered across most geographic and socioeconomic strata
      without additional demands on health service staff.

AB  - The present review considers aquaerobic as a form of therapeutic exercises for
      the prenatal preparation of the pregnant women. It is shown that aquaerobic
      improves the parameters characterizing the degree of physical preparedness and
      physical development of the pregnant women, normalizes their general well-being, 
      mood, sleep, physical activity, and working capacity. Moreover, regular
      aquaerobic exercises prevent the development of pregnancy complications.
