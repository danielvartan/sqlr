N2  - Introduction: Women's sleep quality and their emotional status have been well studied. However, such relationship has been under explored during different stages of pregnancy. The objective of this study is to examine whether sleep disturbance during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with depression/anxiety and whether sleep disturbance in the second trimester of pregnancy predicts depression/anxiety during the third trimester. We also aim to identify which trimester has worse sleep problems. Methods: Participants include197 pregnant women aged 26.69 (SD = 3.56) years. Sleep problems were assessed during the second and third trimester by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Depression/anxiety symptoms were measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) during the third trimester only. PSQI contains 10 items whereas both BDI and BAI contain 21 items, all of which having higher the total score, indicating more problems. Linear regression model were used to test the association between sleep quality and depression/anxiety symptoms, while controlling for sociodemographic variables. Results: Results showed that women has worse sleep quality at the third trimester than those at the second trimester (t = -7.145, P < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that at the third trimester women with more sleep disturbance had increased anxiety (B = 0.307, P < 0.001) and a marginally increased depression (B = 0.150, P = 0.077). Moreover, women with more sleep disturbance during the second trimester had more depression/anxiety at the third trimester (Ps < 0.01). As hypnotized, sleep disturbance in the second trimester of pregnancy predicts women's depression/anxiety at the third trimester (Ps < 0.001) and women with short sleep duration had more anxiety (B = 0.151, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Sleep disturbance during pregnancy affects anxiety/depression. Better sleep quality during pregnancy may help women's emotional status.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep apnea appears to be common in pregnant women although its impact on pregnancy is unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the association between sleep apnea and infant and maternal outcomes in a population-based cohort. Methods: Birth and hospital records in New South Wales, Australia, were linked to conduct a population-based cohort study. Participants were all women who gave birth in hospital from 2002 to 2012 (N = 636,227). Sleep apnea in the year before pregnancy or during pregnancy was identified from hospital records. Outcomes of interest were gestational diabetes, pregnancy hypertension, planned delivery, caesarean section, preterm birth, perinatal death, 5-minute Apgar score, admission to neonatal intensive care or special care nursery, and infant size for gestational age. Maternal outcomes were identified using a combination of hospital and birth records. Infant outcomes came from the birth record. Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine associations between sleep apnea and each outcome taking into account maternal age, country of birth, socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking, obesity, parity, pre-existing diabetes and hypertension. Results: Sleep apnea was significantly associated with pregnancy hypertension (adjusted RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.40-2.07), planned delivery (1.15; 1.07-1.23), preterm birth (1.50; 1.21-1.84), 5-minute Apgar < 7 (1.60; 1.07-2.38), admission to neonatal intensive care/special care nursery (1.26; 1.11-1.44), large-for-gestational-age infants (1.27; 1.04-1.55) but not with gestational diabetes (1.09; 0.82-1.46), caesarean section (1.06; 0.96-1.17), perinatal death (1.73; 0.92-3.25), or small-for-gestational-age infants (0.81; 0.61-1.08). Conclusion: Sleep apnea is associated with higher rates of obstetric intervention and preterm delivery. Future research should examine if these risks are independent of obstetric history.

N2  - Introduction: Significant weight gain in the perinatal period is associated with increased risk of overweight/obesity among women of childbearing age, higher incidence of chronic diseases later in life, and disadvantages to exposed offspring. Shorter self-reported postpartum sleep duration is associated with greater postpartum weight retention (PPWR), but we are aware of no study that has examined associations between PPWR and sleep during pregnancy or has measured sleep patterns objectively. Methods: Perinatal women with a history of major depression or bipolar disorder (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) had sleep onset, sleep offset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency estimated with one week of wrist actigraphy at 33 weeks gestation and at 2, 6, and 16 weeks postpartum. Self-reported pre-pregnancy weight was obtained during the 33 week assessment with the question 'What was your approximate weight one year ago?'. At 2 and 16 weeks postpartum, we measured weight to the nearest 0.1 lb using a digital scale. Data were available from 19 women (age ± SD = 29.7 ± 4.8 years). We divided participants into PPWR+ and PPWR-groups, with PPWR+ defined as > = 5kg weight retention from pre-pregnancy to 16 weeks postpartum. We used t-tests to compare sleep measures between groups. Results: Across the whole sample, weights (mean ± SD) were 73.2 ± 20.4 kg at pre-pregnancy, 79.0 ± 19.4 kg at week 2 postpartum, and 77.7 ± 21.1 kg at 16 weeks postpartum. At 16 weeks postpartum, 33% of the women (n = 6) had gained > 5 kg and were classified as PPWR+. Average pre-pregnancy weights did not differ between groups (PPWR+ = 75.8 ± 18.1 kg and PPWR- = 72.0 ± 220 kg, t = -0.36, df = 17, p = ns). Women with PPWR had later sleep offset times at 33 weeks gestation and 16 weeks postpartum (33 wks: PPWR+ = 8:31 ± 84 min; PPWR- = 7:20 ± 54 min; t = -2.21, df = 17, p < .05; 16 wks: PPWR+ = 8:19 ± 120 min; PPWR- = 6:52 ± 59 min; t = -2.13, df = 17, p < .05). Moreover, the PPWR+ group had lower sleep efficiencies at 33 wks gestation (PPWR+ = 72.6 ± 16.4%, PPWR- = 85.8 ± 4.4%; t = 2.79, p < .05) and 2 and 16 wks postpartum (2 weeks: PPWR+ = 65.0 ± 5%; PPWR- = 72.0 ± 7.2%; t = -2.13, df = 17, p < .05; 16 weeks: PPWR+ = 78.8 ± 4.8%; PPWR- = 85.3 ± 6.8%; t = -2.11, df = 17, p = .05.) Conclusion: PPWR was associated with later sleep offset and decreased sleep efficiency during pregnancy and the postpartum period in our small, heterogeneous sample. Possible mechanisms include circadian misalignment and presence of an undiagnosed sleep disorder. Sleep disturbance may be a modifiable risk factor for PPWR.

N2  - Background: Recent research in major depressive disorder suggests that dysregulation of the circadian system may be a core pathophysiological component. In pregnancy, women often experience significant disruptions in their daily rhythms, including changes in day-to-day schedule and sleep habits. Current evidence suggests that these disruptions in daily rhythms may adversely affect underlying circadian rhythmicity. The purpose of our study was to examine whether subjectively rated daily rhythm disruptions were associated with a greater incidence of depressive symptoms during the third trimester. Method: Our study was a cross-sectional design, assessing sleep quality, symptoms of depression, and daily rhythm disruptions in 51 pregnant women in their third trimester. Results: We observed a significant relationship between mild depressive symptoms and disruptions in daily rhythms. While we initially observed a strong correlation between subjective sleep quality and depressive symptoms, this was attenuated after accounting for daily rhythm disruptions. Disruptions in daily social rhythms, eating patterns, and general activity were all significantly associated with depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: Our findings point to a strong correlation between daily rhythm disruptions and prenatal depressive symptoms. Given that these daily rhythms are known to act as zeitgebers, longitudinal studies examining the directionality of this relationship between circadian rhythms and depressive symptoms during pregnancy are warranted.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep is a major determinant in a person's health; however there are times when poor sleep is 'expected' and 'accepted'. This project explores the disconnect between sleep expert recommendations and the general public's understanding of the importance of sleep during pregnancy and in the first months post-partum. A search of Medline/PubMed quickly reveals the significant body of scientific knowledge regarding the influences of pregnancy on sleep quality as well as the negative consequences that poor sleep quality and sleep disorders can have on mother and infant outcomes. Yet when speaking with new mothers the most common statement is “yes my sleep is terrible, but that is to be expected, right?” This paper discusses the need to translate the vast body of sleep research into the understanding of the general public about the importance of sleep during and after pregnancy. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used for this project. A systematic review of the literature was used to ask the question: “What role does sleep play in pregnancy and postpartum?” Next, a convenience sa mple of pregnant and postpartum (within 1 year) women were asked to tell us about their sleep during and/or after the birth and what, if anything they did about it. Results: Data collection is ongoing. However, preliminary results suggest that there is in fact a significant gap between the recom mend ations put forward from sleep researchers regarding the importance of quality sleep during and after pregnancy and the general understanding and application of this information in pregnant and recently delivered mothers. Conclusion: There is no doubt that in today's society new mothers are getting less sleep after childbirth which is affecting their health. Our goal as health professionals should focus on ways to decrease the prevalence of this problem through different interventions concentrated on mother and baby.

N2  - Introduction: The circadian rhyth m of dim light melatonin onset does not remain stable across the perinatal period in expectant/new mothers. Although timing and quantity of light is an important regulator of circadian rhythms and sleep behavior, little research has focused on perinatal light exposure patterns. This study explored methods of quantifying daily light exposure, and examined changes in light patterns from 3rd trimester of pregnancy to 16 weeks postpartum. Methods: We measured sleep and continuous light levels in 47 expectant/new mothers with a previous history of major depression. Participants wore actigraphs for 1-week intervals at four time points (33 weeks gestation and postpartum weeks 2, 6, and 16). Sleep measures, including sleep onset and sleep offset, were estimated using using Action-W software (AMI). Three light measures (maximum lux, mean lux, and percent time with lux > 20) were derived for three intervals relative to sleep - the two hours prior to sleep onset, sleep onset to sleep offset, and the two hours following sleep offset - and averaged across each week. Light measures were compared across time points using ANOVAs and post-hoc tests (Bonferroni). Results: The light measure “percent time with lux > 20” (P > 20lux) was normally distributed and we therefore elected to use this measure for the present analyses. Compared with the postpartum weeks, P > 20lux was higher at 3rd trimester both during the two hours before sleep onset (Mean ± SD: 3rdT = 14.5 ± 14.1%; 2 wks = 8.2 ± 7.0%; 6 wks = 7.2 ± 6.6%; 16 wks = 8.2 ± 9.2%; F(3, 163) = 5.14, p = .002) and the two hours after waking (Mean ± SD: 3rdT = 42.0 ± 18.9%; 2 wks = 32.9 ± 17.2%; 6 wks = 33.1 ± 19.4%; 16 wks = 29.5 ± 20.9%; F(3, 163) = 3.47, p = .018). P > 20lux during the sleep period tended to be higher at two weeks postpartum (Mean ± SD: 3rdT = 1.2 ± 2.4%; 2 wks = 2.6 ± 3.4%; 6 wks = 1.4 ± 2.0%; 16 wks = 1.3 ± 2.8%; F(3, 163) = 2.52, p = .060), but this was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Compared with postnatal time periods, women in their third trimester receive greater light exposure in the two hours preceding and following the sleep period. This light is likely from indoor sources. Future analyses will assess light levels across the entire day and examine how changes in light exposure are related to sleep behavior and mood in the perinatal period.

N2  - Background: An inverse relationship between sleep duration, mood and body mass index (BMI). Lower 'stage of behavior change ' scores are associated with negative lifestyle behaviors. Little is known on the effect of these parameters in pregnancy. Objective We sought to assess the relationship between maternal wellbeing, stage of change, sleep duration and maternal body composition in an overweight and obese pregnant population Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of 124 women in early pregnancy. Maternal anthropometry was assessed by measuring mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), BMI and bioelectrical impedance analysis. The following additional data were collected using a lifestyle questionnaire: educational attainment, stage of behaviour change in the trans-theoretical model, sleep duration and wellbeing (WHO-5 Item Wellbeing Index, expressed as a percentage) Results: A total of 124 women were included in the analysis. The mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m2 (±3.48), and percentage fat mass (%FM) was 35.4% (±6.7). Patient's mean stage of behavior change was 2.9 (±1.4), wellbeing percentage score of 54 (±16) and average sleep duration of 6.8 hours. Maternal wellbeing positively correlated with sleep duration (p = 0.05). Maternal stage of behavior change negatively correlated with %FM and positively correlated with %FFM (percentage fat free mass). K-means cluster analysis revealed that as BMI increased from 27 to 29 kg/m2, there was a corresponding decrease in total wellbeing score from 60% to 52% and sleep duration from 472 to 322 minutes. Conclusions These results demonstrate the complex link between psychological behaviors, maternal body composition, and anthropometry and sleep duration in early pregnancy. Strategies to improve psychological wellbeing and sleep patterns could increase maternal levels of motivation and readiness to engage in healthier lifestyle behaviors in pregnancy. This may improve maternal adiposity and body composition with potential beneficial effects on maternal and perinatal outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: I n som nia rem ains largely unexplored in its relationship to pregnancy outcomes, though previous research implicates other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. The present study sought to examine whether insom n ia par tially accou nt s for the r isk of preg na ncies that do not result in live births among reproductive-aged women. Methods: Data from the combined 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used. Information on reproductive health was gathered from women age 18-45 (N = 5,554). Of these, N = 4,622 (83%) had been pregnant at least once and 1,870 (40%) of these had pregnancies that did not result in a live birth. Insomnia was assessed as self-reported difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, difficulty with early morning awakenings, and non-restorative sleep. Responses were coded as “Never,” “1/month,” “2-4/month,” “5-15/month,” or “>15/month.” Population-weighted logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, and sleep apnea symptoms (snoring and snorting/gasping frequency) assessed associations between insomnia symptoms and number of pregnancies that did not result in a live birth. Results: Insomnia symptoms combined with covariates predicted the likelihood of at least one pregnancy that did not result in a live birth (overall R 2 = 0.02, p15/month (OR = 2.25;95%CI[1.44-3.51];p < 0.0005). Conclusion: Women of reproductive age (18-45 years) experiencing difficulty maintaining sleep are more likely to have a pregnancy that does not result in a live birth (85% increased risk). Further studies are needed to explore the risk of insomnia specifically on spontaneous abortions/miscarriages and infertility.

N2  - Introduction: Research and anecdotal evidence suggests that sleep undergoes significant changes during pregnancy. The aim of the current project was to synthesize literature on sleep in pregnancy and assess magnitude of change. Methods: The literature was searched using the terms “pregnancy”, “Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index” (PSQI), and “Polysomnography”. Relevant articles were selected and data entered into random effects meta-analyses. Results: A total of 372 articles were identified and 33 were included in the final analyses. Results indicated that the average PSQI score changed significantly from 5.06 to 5.81 and 6.91 in the first, second, and third trimester, respectively. Results also indicated that, from first to third trimester, polysomnography assessed wake after sleep onset (WASO) increased from 39 (SE 4.34) to 65 (SE 5.59) minutes/night, d = - 0.55 [- 0.88, - 0.23], wh ile sleep ef ficie ncy (SE) de c rea sed from 89% (SE 1.17) to 82% (SE 1.77) d = 0.34 [0.09, 0.57], and total sleep time (TST) decreased from 417 (SE 11.95) to 379 (SE 7.27) minutes/night, d = 0.33 [0.09, 0.57]. Time spent in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) decreased from 20% (SE 1.38) to 17% (SE 0.75) of sleep time, d = 0.27 [0.03, 0.50]. There were no significant changes in time spent in slow wave sleep (SWS). Conclusion: Subjective sleep quality and objective sleep parameters appear to worsen as preg nancy progresses. In par ticular, women report worse sleep quality, spend more time awake at night, and have reduced SE and TST. Larger, more nuanced studies are needed to better understand normative versus pathological changes. Studies that track sleep from pre-pregnancy to postpartum and report analyses by parity and past sleep/mood history may be particularly useful.

N2  - Introduction: The emerging evidence suggests that gestational Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), has been associated with maternal-fetal complications, yet most obstetricians do not routinely screen for OSA. Upper airway narrowing is a main determinant of OSA. Its evaluation with other measures may be useful for screening OSA risk. We aimed to develop a screening tool combining subjective and objective measures to predict gestational OSA diagnosis. Methods: Data were collected from a completed prospective study of OSA including 130 women in first-trimester and 102 in third-trimester. All women underwent full polysomnography, visual assessment of the anatomy of oral cavity and completed questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale-(ESS), Sleep Apnea Symptom score-(SASS) from Multivariable Apnea Prediction index). An examiner blinded to participants' disease status assessed the oral cavity. Bivariate regression analyses were performed to identify characteristics associated with OSA (AHI ≥ 5/hour). Each variable with p < 0.2 associated with OSA was examined in multivariate analyses to determine the best performing models for identifying OSA. Analyses was performed using 3 covariate/outcome combinations: first trimester covariates predicting first trimester OSA, third trimester covariates predicting third trimester OSA and first trimester covariates predicting third trimester OSA. Results: Mean age was 26.8 ± 7.0 at baseline. Seventeen (13%) women in first and 27 (26%) women in third-trimester had AHI ≥ 5. Habitual snoring, ESS and SASS did not accurately predict sleep apnea in this group, with ROC area under the curves (AUC) of 0.53 (95%CI, 0.42-0.64), 0.58 (95%CI, 0.45-0.72) and 0.66 (95%CI, 0.53-0.79), respectively. However a model combining age, BMI and tongue size (normal vs. large) performed better in both trimesters. The AUC of this model was 0.86 (95%CI, 0.77-0.94) in first-trimester, and 0.84 (95%CI, 0.75-0.93) in third-trimester. Further analysis demonstrated that the same model including the same variables in first-trimester predicted OSA risk in third-trimester (AUC 0.82; 95%CI, 0.72-0.92). Conclusion: Existing tools assessing OSA symptoms are poor predictors of OSA risk in pregnant women. BMI, age and tongue size can reliably predict OSA risk over the course of pregnancy.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) occurs in 0.6% to 15% of reproductive-aged women. Because of an overlap in symptoms of SDB and normal pregnancy findings, the diagnosis of SDB in pregnancy is challenging. The repetitive arousals, sleep fragmentation, and hypoxias experienced by patients with SDB lead to an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. In the nonpregnant population SDB is associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and stroke. Increasing evidence identifies an association between SDB in pregnancy and gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and fetal growth abnormalities.

N2  - Background: Iron deficiency (ID) globally impact billions of people; mostly pregnant women. Anemia during pregnancy is mainly associated with ID; and prophylaxis includes daily supplementation of iron folic acid (IFA) tablets. During pregnancy, increased foetal iron demand leads to fluctuations in body iron reserves; thus supplemental iron is recommended to meet the iron demand. The effectiveness of weekly IFA supplementation in comparison to daily IFA intake during pregnancy is still shadowy, as the available data from well-defined clinical trials is inconsistent. The amount of quantifiable iron circulating in blood and stored in placenta, in both the supplementation schemes and their correlation with pregnancy outcomes is pre-requisite to reach any firm conclusion. Owing to this, the present study was conducted to providing better understanding of hemodynamics and molecular mechanism in human placental iron transfer. Aims: To investigate the iron dynamics in anemic and healthy pregnant women supplemented with daily and weekly IFA supplementation and its relation with clinical outcome. Methods: The subjects include non-anemic primigravida (NAP) (Hemoglobin (Hb) >11 g/ dl, N= 60) and anemic primigravida (AP) (8.0 <Hb <11 g/ dl, N=60) were followed across pregnancy at three time-points i.e. baseline (13-16 weeks of gestation), after three months (25-28 weeks) and 6 weeks postpartum. The subjects (NAP and AP) were randomly allocated to daily dose comprised 100 mg iron and 500 μg folic acid tablets and weekly dose contained two IFA tablets/ week till six weeks postpartum. Corresponding changes in hematological markers, iron status indicators viz. ferritin, iron and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) in blood and placental ferritin expression was studied. Birth outcome, gestational length, infant weight and placental weight were recorded. The statistical significance level (p <0.05) between the groups were assessed by applying unpaired t-test using SPSS (version 20.0). Results: Weekly IFA supplementation for three months has significantly altered the Hb, hematocrit and red blood cell (RBC) count (p<0.05) and increased the level of serum sTfR (p<0.002) at postpartum in AP. After three months of supplementation, serum iron and sTfR were significantly different (p<0.01) between the two supplemental groups in NAP; whereas, serum ferritin (p<0.001) was significantly high at postpartum in daily IFA group of NAP. Placental ferritin expression was increased in NAP supplemented with daily IFA in comparison to weekly IFA. The placentas obtained from AP supplemented with weekly IFA showed significantly low ferritin (p<0.05) expression when compared with daily IFA supplementation. However, birth outcome, infant weight, gestational length and placental weight were comparable in both the supplementation groups. Summary/Conclusions: The placental ferritin expression and its serum level showed similar trend among anemic and non-anemic primigravidas supplemented with daily and weekly IFA tablets. Although, significantly lower placental ferritin was observed in AP supplemented with weekly IFA tablets; but there was not any difference in birth outcome, infant weight or gestational length between two supplementation groups. The modulation in iron transporter expression may be involved in anemic placentas to flux iron for developing fetus, thereby maintaining the healthy pregnancy. The results of this study revealed that blood iron status/ hematological markers may be helpful to assess the optimum amount of supplemental iron required during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Maternal obesity in pregnancy is reaching epidemic proportions but the drivers of maternal adiposity are multifaceted and constitute more than simple energy imbalance. Personal choices and environmental factors also contribute to the rising rates of obesity. The obesogenic environment refers to factors that influence individuals to become excessively overweight. They are classified as micro-environments (school, workplace, home, neighbourhood) or macro-environments (education and health systems, government policies, societies' attitudes and beliefs). We sought to assess the obesogenic micro environment, sleep patterns of an overweight and obese pregnant cohort. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study with institutional ethical approval and maternal written consent. Women with BMI >25 kg/m2 were recruited from the antenatal clinic and a lifestyle questionnaire assessing their obesogenic risk factors was administered. Results: Fifty women were included in the analysis; 36 (72%) overweight, 14 (28%) obese. Over 80% of the group lived adjacent to green space and/or gym facilities although only moderate use of both was reported. Women reported easy access to public transport in the community however, less than half reported using these facilities. There was easy access to fast food premises in the majority of cases (>80%). A large proportion of women reported poor access to work canteen facilities (71%) with up to 40% leaving the workplace at meal times. Analysis of sleep duration revealed women in the group slept on average 6.5 hours per night. Conclusions This study has highlighted deficiencies in the physical, workplace and personal micro environments that could contribute to maternal adiposity. Devising future healthy lifestyle interventions for pregnant women at a national level should also target micro-environmental factors to tackle maternal obesity and improve the health of the next generation.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep apnea is rare in women except during pregnancy, with weight gain, oedema, change in CRF and hormonal changes. The consequences of gestational OSA are still poorly known. We hypothesized that intermittent hypoxia (IH) induces neurodevelopmental abnormalities of cardiorespiratory control and learning and that these abnormalities are related to inflammation. Methods: IH was applied in pregnant mice (5% FiO2) 10 h a day during either the last 10 days of gestation or the last 15 days, control mice are exposed to room air. The HI model was characterized by monitoring SpO2 and by weighing the mothers. Cytokine assays were performed in maternal serum and tissue samples at the end of IH. The evaluation of the pups consisted of weighing, measuring cardio respiratory parameters at basal state and during hypoxic and hypercapnic challenges. Cognitive functions were evaluated at 8 days post-natal age (P8-9) by Fox battery tests and at P30 by the object recognition test. Results: The IH induced oxygen desaturations and delayed weight gain in mother but neither serum nor tissue inflammation. In the IH-pups, we found transient respiratory anomalies (P5) with increase in basal normoxic ventilation (Ve, Ttot), delayed reponse to hypercapnic challenge (P12), a growth retardation up to 30 days of life but no abnormalities of cognitive function. No difference was noted between groups with the length of IH exposure. Discussion: Apart the unexpected lack of inflammation these results are consistent with the current literature and suggest a modest but consistent impact on pups of gestational IH.

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal depression has long-term effects on infant sleep yet mechanisms of this relationship are unknown. The current study evaluated maternal prenatal sleep quality as a potential mediator of the relationship between maternal prenatal depression and infant sleep. Methods: Maternal sleep quality and depression were assessed using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), respectively. Sleep questions were removed from the EPDS to assess maternal sleep quality mediation. Data was collected from 272 women at three time points: early pregnancy (Time 1 [T1]; < 22 weeks gestational age [GA]); late pregnancy (T2; 32 weeks GA); postnatal period (T3; 6 month postnatal). Infant nighttime sleep duration was defined as total time (in minutes) spent asleep from 1900 to 0700 hours and assessed by maternal responses on the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) at T3. Mediation was assessed using a bootstrapping procedure and product of coefficients approach (PROCESS for SPSS). Results: Participants (N = 272) were primarily married (85.5%), Caucasian (78.9%), and university educated (67.6%) with an average age of 31.0 years (SD 3.80). Average infant nighttime sleep at T3 was 10.2 ± 1.5 hours/night. Higher early prenatal depression (T1) significantly predicted lower infant nighttime sleep duration at T3 over and above covariates of maternal education, maternal age, income, parity, infant sex, preterm birth, and postnatal depression, F (8, 218) = 6.50, β = -76.84, p = .01. PSQI scores at T2 were a significant partial mediator of the relationship between prenatal depressive symptoms and infant nighttime sleep duration at T3 (β = -9.95, SE = 7.30, 95% CI [-30.25, - 0.20]). Conclusion: Results replicate findings showing that higher prenatal depression is associated with lower nighttime sleep duration in infants and provide evidence that worse mater nal sleep quality in late pregnancy is a plausible mechanism linking maternal depression to infant sleep.

N2  - Introduction: According to confirmed beneficial effects of physical activity during pregnancy, this study was performed with aim to investigate active and passive lifestyle on insulin resistance and the levels of AST and ALT liver enzymes in pregnant women at second trimester of pregnancy. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 80 pregnant women at second trimester in Isfahan at 2015. After completing the consent form and Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) based on lifestyle and doing and not doing daily walking were divided to two groups of active and passive lifestyle and were compared in terms of insulin resistance and the levels of AST and ALT liver enzymes. Data was analyzed using SPSS software (version 18) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and t-test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Serum levels of AST liver enzymes in active pregnant women who had daily walk were significantly lower than inactive women (P=0.018), but there was no significant difference between two groups in terms of ALT levels (P=0.079) and insulin resistance (P=0.146). Conclusion: Physical activity during pregnancy is effective on serum levels of AST liver enzymes, but according to the evaluation of control variables, ALT liver enzyme levels and insulin resistance were not significantly different due to walking with slow speed, long hours of immobility (11.8 ± 2.5) and sleep longer than the standard (9.9 ± 2.00).

N2  - Introduction: Galectin-3 is a novel biomarker that is indicative of inflammation, cardiac remodeling and heart failure. OSA is associated with cardiovascular disease. We sought to evaluate levels of serum Galectin-3 in pregnant women with and without OSA. Methods: We performed a nested cohort st udy of pregnant women enrolled in a prospective protocol to screen pregnant women for obstructive sleep apnea. Obese women underwent morphometric measurements and measurement of body composition using air displacement plethysmography. Women were evaluate with in-home portable polysomnography for the detection of OSA. All studies were manually scored by an independent reading center. Fasting serum was collected, stored at -80C, and analyzed in duplicate for levels of galectin-3 using the DGAL30 ELISA kit from R&D Systems. Data were analyzed using chi square, student T test and Spearman correlation. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: We included 25 women with OSA and 135 without OSA. Women with OSA were older in age (30 ± vs. 27 years, p = 0.04) and had a greater body mass index (40.2 vs. 35kg/m2, p = 0.02). Both groups were similar in gestational age at screening (21 vs. 20), p = 0.8) and percent body fat (43.5 vs. 43.9, p = 0.4). Serum levels of galectin-3 were similar between the two groups. (8.6 vs. 8.4). Galectin-3 levels were significantly correlated with mater nal age (r = -0.18, p = 0.02) and gestational age (r = 0.28, p = less than 0.001) but not with BMI (r = 0.06, p = 0.1), body fat percentage (r = 0.03, p = 0.7) or apnea hy popnea i ndex (r = 0.03, p = 0.6). Conclusion: Galectin-3 levels are not elevated among obese women with OSA. Galectin-3 was associated with maternal age and gestational age. Any future studies that use Galectin-3 as a biomarker should take into account these associations.

N2  - Introduction: Mannering and colleagues (2011) conducted the only evaluation of parental relationship dissolution (PRD) on sleep in children with a sample of married, middle class parents and their adopted children. They found that PRD increased bedtime resistance. The current study expands this work to evaluate whether PRD negatively impacts children's sleep quality among a diverse group of married and unmarried parents. Methods: Three waves of data from the Fragile Families Study (FFS; Teitler et al., 2001) were used. When children participants were three, mothers reported on their PRD (e.g., did the mother experience a breakup) in the previous two years, and their children's sleep. The same information was gathered when the children were 5 and 9. We fit a cross-lagged model to assess the link between: 1) PRD (0 = no PRD; 1 = one or more PRDs) between 3 and 5, on a latent factor of sleep quality (e.g., child's sleep duration, trouble sleeping) at age 5, controlling for sleep quality at age 3; and 2) PRD between 5 and 9, on sleep quality at age 9, controlling for sleep quality at age 5. All analyses controlled for mother's age and education at childbearing, mother's race, child gender, and low birth weight. Results: Mothers who experienced PRD between their child's 3rd and 5th birthday reported their child's sleep quality at age 5 to be .13 standard deviations lower than mothers who did not experience PRD (b = -.13, SE = .05, p < .01), cont rolling for previous sleep quality. Mothers who experienced PRD between their child's 5th and 9th birthday reported their child's sleep quality at age 9 to be .10 standard deviations lower than mothers who did not experience PRD (b = -.10, SE = .04, p < .01), controlling for previous sleep quality. Conclusion: PRD broadly, not just marital instability, is associated with lower sleep quality in children, independent of previous sleep quality.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep quality plays an integral role in one's health and contributes to long-term cardiovascular and psychiatric disturbances. Little is known about the relationship of disregulated sleep and fecundity. Changes in menstruation and fertility can be partly attributed to autoimmune causes. Recent studies have suggested an autoimmune mediated process li nked to narcolepsy causi ng a loss of orexin neurons. Report of Case: We present a case of a 33 y/o female with a history of depression, anemia and menstrual irregularities with excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis and vivid dreams since age 15. Her Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) was 15. The overnight PSG was normal, AHI 2.5, followed by an MSLT with sleep latency 5.2 minutes and SOREM in 2 of 5 naps. She was diagnosed with narcolepsy without cataplexy. Her narcolepsy symptoms were controlled with naps, caffeine and low dose modafinil due to side effects of other stimulants. For her challenges with conception and irregular cycles with intermenstrual bleeding, she started charting with the Creighton model for FertiltyCare. After low dose naltrexone was added for the autoimmune aspect of impaired fecundity, her cycle improved with less intermenstrual bleeding and remarkably reported, “My friends have never seen me so wide awake.” She went on to quickly achieve a successful pregnancy. However when she moved out of state and did not have access to low dose naltrexone, she subsequently had a series of miscarriages. Conclusion: Both narcolepsy and impaired fecundity can have an autoimmune etiology. Ensuring proper treatment of sleep disorders is expected to enhance a women's quality of life and influence her health. Having a heightened awareness for the coexistence of these disorders could be of value. Low dose naltrexone may be a cost effective and safe treatment of both.

N2  - Introduction: Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with worse sleep quality and shorter sleep duration in children and adults; however, associations between measures of SES and infant sleep have yet to be examined. Using a prospective cohort of 1,092 mother-infant dyads followed from pregnancy to 6-months postpartum, relationships between individual- and neighbourhood-socioeconomic status and infant sleep duration and consolidation at 6-months postpartum were investigated. Methods: Infant sleep duration (minutes between 7 pm and 7 am) was assessed using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ). Maternal SES was assessed via maternal education (High school above or below), annual household income, and a neighbourhood deprivation index (a census-based tool assessing average neighbourhood education, income, employment, single parent families and home ownership). Maternal ethnicity (White/Other), maternal age and parity were included as covariates in all analyses. Regression analyses were used to investigate relationships between SES variables and infant sleep duration. All SES variables were included simultaneously in the model. Results: At 6-months postpartum, longer infant sleep duration was repor ted by mothers with higher household income (B = 10.72, SE = 2.44, p < .0001), higher education (B = 19.83, SE = 8.07, p = .01) and those living in neighbourhoods with higher SES (B = -8.40, SE = 3.71, p = .02). To investigate change in infant sleep duration from 3-to 6-months, 3-month sleep duration was included as an additional covariate in the model. I ncreasing night time infant sleep duration from 3-to 6 -months was predicted by higher household income (B = 9.65, SE = 2.44, p < .0001) and h ig her neig hbou rho od SES (B = -9.14, SE = 3.79, p = .02). Conclusion: Individual- and neighbourhood-SES was associated with infant sleep duration at 3- and 6-months postpartum. Future studies should examine potential environmental and behavioural mediators of the relationship.

N2  - Introduction: Second hand smoking during childhood has been linked to several sleep problems. Little is known about the long-term impact of utero SHS exposure on childhood sleep disturbance. This study examined the association between SHS exposure during utero and at and childhood stage and childhood sleep disturbance in a sample of Chinese children. Methods: As part of China Jintan Cohort Project, around 1000 schoolaged children participated in this study. SHS exposure contained two stages: utero exposure (morther recall of pregnancy history when child was 4-6 years old), and childhood exposure (reported by children when they were 10-12 years old). Childhood sleep disturbance was examined via parent's report using Chinese version of Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and children's self report using Youth Self Report questionnaire (YSR). Higher scores indicate worse sleep problem. A total of around 400 children who have available SHS exposure history and sleep data were included for the current study. Linear regression was used to examine the impact of SHS exposure on sleep disturbance. Results: Mean age at sleep assessment was 10.74 years old (SD = 0.88), 54.5% were males. There were significant positive correlations between childhood SHS exposure and 2 CSHQ subscales: sleep anxiety (b = 0.086, p = 0.021), daytime sleepiness (b = 0.059, p = 0.038); and 1 YSR subscale: snoring/coughing during sleep (b = 0.275, p = 0.022). Utero SHS exposure has a long-term effect on childhood sleep disturbance, contributing to a significant score increase for snoring/coughing during sleep (b = 7.468, p = 0.036), assessed via YSR. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both utero and childhood SHS exposure are associated with increased risk for sleep disturbance. Further research is needed to examine the underlying mechanism of the influence of prenatal and postnatal SHS exposure on childhood sleep disturbance.

N2  - Introduction: We sought to investigate the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia(CBT-I) delivered through group prenatal care sessions on maternal sleep and mental health across pregnancy and postpartum among overweight and obese women reporting short sleep duration. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial of CBT-I delivered through group prenatal care versus routine group prenatal care. Women in the second trimester of pregnancy experiencing a self-reported sleep duration of < 6.5hrs per night with a pre-pregnancy BMI of ≥ 24.9kg/m2 were included. Exclusion criteria included pre-pregnancy diabetes mellitus, non-English speakers, and severe mental or physical condition limiting ability to complete the study intervention. In the second trimester (T1), late third trimester (T2) and 6-8 weeks postpartum (T3) patients completed mental health and sleep questionnai res, and por table polysomnog raphy. Data was analyzed using Man n Whitney U. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The cohort consisted of 53 women with an average age of 29 ± 6 years and pre-pregnancy BMI of 35.4kg/m2. Mean sleep duration in hours among the entire cohort was 7.2 ± 2.3, 7.2 ± 2.4, and 7.1 ± 1.8 and AHI was 3.0 ± 3.4, 2.7 ± 4.1, and 3.0 ± 3.5 at TI, T2 and T3 respectively. No difference between study control and intervention groups was noted for sleep duration in hours at T1 (6.6 vs 7.7 p = .13), T2 (7.6 vs 7.0 p = .45), or T3 (7.0 vs 7.25 p = .66) as well as mean AHI at T1 (3.4 vs 2.6 p = .23) T2 (2.3 vs 3.2 p = .33) and T3(2.8 vs 3.0 p = .50). Finally changes in survey scores between the T1 and T3 visits were evaluated. No difference in change between groups was noted for either the Edinburgh Depression Scale (-5.1 vs -2.8 p = .21) or the Perceived Stress Scale (-1.2 vs -5.0 p = .75). Conclusion: We noted no statistically significant difference in outcomes among women exposed to CBT-I during pregnancy. Improvements in perceived stress may be clinically significant. Larger studies are needed to confirm these finding.

N2  - Introduction: Disturbed sleep in the perinatal period puts women at risk for neurobehavioral impairment and postpartum depression. Recent work has established a link between disturbed sleep and worse neurobehavioral performance in expectant/new mothers, but little attention has been paid to neurobehavioral capacity and depressive symptoms in this population. Our aim was to examine associations between neurobehavioral performance, maternal sleep, and depressed mood in at-risk perinatal women. Methods: 21 women (age ± SD = 29.8 ± 4.5 years) with a history of major depression, but who were not in a mood episode at enrollment, had their average sleep onset, sleep offset, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency estimated over one week with wrist actigraphy at 33 weeks gestation and 2, 6 and 16 weeks postpartum. At the end of each monitoring week, mood was assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and participants completed a 6-minute visual psychomotor vigilance task (PVT, AMI). Generalized estimating equations were used to test for changes over time and assess associations between sleep, mood, and PVT measures. Results: Time of sleep offset (33 wks: 7:41 ± 63.6 min, 2 wks: 8:13 ± 63.6 min, 6 wks: 8:05 ± 71.4 min, 16 wks: 7:04 ± 57.6 min; F = 5.66, p = 0.01) and sleep efficiency (33 wks: 82.0 ± 11.3%, 2 wks: 70.9 ± 7.1%, 6 wks: 75.1 ± 7.0%, 16 wks: 84.2 ± 6.3%; F = 31.8, p < 0.01) differed significantly across time, as did three mean PVT measures: slowest 10% reciprocal reaction time (RRT) (33 wks: 2.1 ± 0.7 s-1, 2 wks: 1.8 ± 0.8 s-1, 6 wks: 1.7 ± 0.7 s-1, 16 wks: 2.1 ± 0.7 s-1; F = 3.80, p = 0.03), mean reaction time (RT) (33 wks: 361.6 ± 202.5s, 2 wks: 396.0 ± 220.9s, 6 wks: 467.9 ± 467.0s, 16 wks: 410.2 ± 436.2 s; F = 4.22, p = 0.02), and number of lapses (33 wks: 4.6 ± 9.5, 2 wks: 8.1 ± 17.4, 6 wks: 7.4 ± 10.4, 16 wks: 4.3 ± 9.8; F = 4.16, p = 0.03). More time awake at night was associated with worse neurobehavioral performance, with significant associations observed between wake minutes and mean slowest 10% RRT and false starts (F = 5.14, p = 0.03 and F = 6.76, p = 0.01, respectively). Finally, more depressive symptoms also were associated with worse performance, with significant associations between depressive symptoms and mean slowest 10% RRT, mean RT, and number of lapses (F = 19.33, p < 0.01; F = 13.11, p < 0.01; and F = 20.55, p < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: In our sample of perinatal women with a history of MDD, worse neurobehavioral performance was associated with more wakefulness at night and greater depressive symptomatology. These data indicate that both postpartum sleep disturbance and depressed mood impair daytime functioning in postpartum women.

N2  - Objective To illustrate the work of the perinatal mental health team (PMHT) at Wirral University Teaching Hospital (WUTH), from January to June 2015. Total births in this 6-month period was 1580. More than 1 in 10 women are affected by perinatal mental illness, when a wide range of mental health problems can occur, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, postpartum psychosis and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods Our PMHT started in 2008. The current clinical team consists of 2.5 WTE midwives experienced in perinatalmental health (PNMH), an obstetrician with special interest clinic, psychiatry liaison doctor, specialist liaison psychiatry nurse, and perinatal link health visitor. We continually review our service which allows us to analyse trends and make appropriate changes to the service. Results During the period, the team received 269 referrals (17% of pregnant women). Following consultation with the PMHT, 29% of women were found to have anxiety, 14% depression, 9% panic disorder, 5% phobias, 7% requesting CS (no obstetric indication) or tocophobia, 36% a combination of other disorders/complaints. 71% of referrals were from midwives at the patient's booking interview. 73 indicated that the patient had current depression. Following consultation with the PMHT, only 38 of patients were identified as having current depression. 8% of women referred to the service, following assessment with the PMHT disclosed a history of childhood sexual abuse, or sexual assault (1.33% of all pregnant women). The literature on PTSD following childbirth estimates a prevalence percentage of 2%. Following assessment, the PMHT found 3% of total referrals were postnatal and met criteria for PTSD following assessment. Conclusion WUTH has a well utilised PNMH service, enabling support for women with perinatal mental health problems. The team approach ensures that good planning is achieved across multi-agencies. Many factors at booking may impact on the woman's mood, which improve as pregnancy advances. These may include early pregnancy problems (nausea, hyperemesis, fatigue, hormonal changes, sleep disturbances, adjustment, and social stressors). We may under-identify women who have been victims of sexual abuse/assault; 1.33% compared with expected rates of between 7% and 27% and women with PTSD (0.64% versus expected 2%). These women may be at risk of re-traumatisation by obstetric procedures, so identification is important. Through regular review of our service, it appears we need to develop better identification of these women, possibly through sensitive questioning at booking.

N2  - Several medical - biological and social - hygienic factors have been found to account for the definite increase in the incidence of thyroid gland disorders in reproductive age and pregnant women. Aim of our study was to identify the risk factors for development of thyroid gland pathology in outpatient pregnant women. Observational study - "case - control" study has been conducted at the base of David Gagua Hospital Ltd. Main (study) group involved 292 pregnant patients with established thyroid pathology. Control group included 58 conditionally healthy pregnant participants without any demonstrated thyroid pathology. Study of risk factors was performed by initial interviewing and specialized questionnaire recording process (so-called two-stage model of interviewing). Characteristics of diet, sleep, physical activity, including harmful habits, socio-economic and hereditary factors were studied; quantitative indices of risk for each component were calculated: odds ratio (OR) and attributable risk (AR), taking into account 95% confidence interval (CI). The Pearson's criterion χ2 with respective P value and the calculator developed by International Society of Evidence-based Medicine were used to obtain the final results. Statistically significant risk factors for development of thyroid pathology were identified, which included: Thyroid gland diseases and hereditary history of diabetes mellitus; low economic income, unfavorable living conditions, unhealthy dietary habits. Despite of the difficulty of assessment of causative relationship between above mentioned components, their strong correlation should be taken into account when defining the strategy of preventive measures, moreover the most part of identified risk factors are manageable.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between measures of iron status and nocturnal leg symptoms in a large, nationally-representative female sample. As a secondary aim we examined this relationship among pregnant women. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for secondary analysis. Measures of iron status included ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), and total body iron. Nocturnal leg symptoms were defined by sleep-related leg jerks ≥ 5 times a month. Univariate and multivariate associations were tested. Results: In the full sample, the prevalence of leg symptoms was not significantly different across quintiles of any iron measure tested. However, there was a significant race interaction, with low transferrin saturation associated with leg symptoms among white women (p = 0.006) but not women of other races (p = 0.19). Among pregnant women, low sTfR was associated with leg symptoms, even after adjusting for covariates (p = 0.03). CRP level did not alter these results. Conclusion: These data support an association between low transferrin saturation and leg symptoms, but only among white women. In addition, among pregnant women, we found a relationship between low sTfR and the presence of leg symptoms; we speculate that this finding represents a shunting of available iron from maternal to fetal tissues predisposing to leg symptoms.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbance during the perinatal period has been shown to increase risk of depression. Few studies have examined the role of hypnotics on perinatal depression symptoms. We investigated whether or not there was a unique effect of hypnotic treatment on the course of perinatal depression severity in women with and without major depressive disorder. We hypothesized that depression severity would decrease over time significantly more in women taking both an antidepressant and a hypnotic compared with taking an antidepressant alone. Methods: 235 perinatal women (average age 27.98 [SD = 5.85]; 32.1% minority; 96 [41%] with major depressive disorder; 16 [6.6%] taking hypnotic medication; 76 [32%] taking antidepressant medication) participated in the study throughout pregnancy and the first 6 postpartum months. The Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology (IDSC) was used to assess the outcome variable of depression severity during each time point. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep disturbance, which was used as a covariate in the GLM. Results: GLM revealed a significant DEPRESSION (MDD yes/no) by MEDICATION (no med, antidepressant only, or both antidepressant and hypnotic) by TIME interaction: Wald Chi Square = 18.22 (6), p = .006. There was one significant first order interaction: DEP∗TIME among non-medicated women, Wald Chi Square = 12.7 (3), p = .005. Nonsignificant trends included 1) greatest IDSC mean difference from trimester 2 to trimester 3 occurring in the non-depressed group treated with both antidepressant and hypnotic medication: 10.72 to 3.72 and 2) mean changes in the opposite directions from trimester 3 to postpartum month 1 for the depressed versus nondepressed women using both antidepressants and hypnotic. Whereas these nondepressed women's depression severity increased (3.72 to 17.68), their depressed counterparts' depression severity decreased (27.67 to 18.52). Both groups experienced an increase in depression severity from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Conclusion: These results point to further investigation of whether or not perinatal hypnotic treatment could enhance antidepressant treatment effectiveness.

N2  - Background: Improvement of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in pregnancy, and worsening postpartum is well known. This led to the finding that cortisone had antiinflammatory effects. The hypothalamic proinflammatory hormone, gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH), is the master regulator of the reproductive system, and also has a circadian rhythm. GnRH activity diminishes in pregnancy and increases postpartum. Prior to our AGRA (Antagonist to Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone in RA) trial, no research in RA had been performed on this principal hormone. GnRH can act like a cytokine in the periphery, being secreted by T cells (1). In the AGRA trial, GnRH antagonism showed anti-inflammatory effects including a significant reduction in TNF in RA patients. GnRH antagonists decrease inflammatory cytokine mRNA, and downregulate the NF-κB pathway. Conversely, GnRH agonists are associated with the onset and flares of autoimmune diseases. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate for the first time whether GnRH exists in the periphery in patients with an autoimmune disease. If GnRH exists in the periphery in patients with RA, is GnRH associated with cytokines? Methods: Predefined endpoints from our proof-of-concept randomized, doubleblind, Norwegian AGRA study (N=99, ITT population) with active RA have been reported earlier (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00667758). Patients were randomized using computer-generated allocation (1:1) in dynamic blocks stratified for sex. Patients were assigned to cetrorelix, a GnRH antagonist (5mg days 1-2, 3mg days 3-5) or corresponding volumes of placebo. Blood sampling was at the same time of day and frozen to -80. We investigated serum GnRH baseline pretreatment levels using newly available ELISA assays according to the manufacturer's instructions, in duplicates, inter-assay CV<10% (USCN Life Science Inc.). Four serum cytokines were measured with multiplex technology (Luminex Inc.). Results: Mean peripheral GnRH level at baseline was 241 pg/mL (s.d. ±83 pg/mL). By day 5, TNF levels were significantly reduced by the GnRH antagonist vs. placebo (p=0.023). GnRH levels were not significantly changed by day 5. Conclusions: Peripheral GnRH is presented for the first time in autoimmunity. Due to GnRH's potential association with cytokines, the existence of peripheral GnRH may be due to GnRH production by T cells (1). These results could support preexisiting literature on GnRH and the immune system, that GnRH stimulates the secretion of cytokines peripherally, and help to explain clinical observations. These results warrant confirmation. (Table Presented).

N2  - Lung and kidney functions are intimately related in both health and disease. The regulation of acid–base equilibrium, modification of partial pressure of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate concentration, and the control of blood pressure and fluid homeostasis all closely depend on renal and pulmonary activities. These interactions begin in fetal age and are often responsible for the genesis and progression of diseases. In gestational age, urine is a fundamental component of the amniotic fluid, acting on pulmonary maturation and growth. Moreover, in the first trimester of pregnancy, kidney is the main source of proline, contributing to collagen synthesis and lung parenchyma maturation. Pathologically speaking, the kidneys could become damaged by mediators of inflammation or immuno-mediated factors related to a primary lung pathology or, on the contrary, it could be the renal disease that determines a consecutive pulmonary damage. Furthermore, non immunological mechanisms are frequently involved in renal and pulmonary diseases, as observed in chronic pathologies such as sleep apnea syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, progressive renal disease and hemodialysis. Kidney damage has also been related to mechanical ventilation. The aim of this review is to describe pulmonary-renal interactions and their related pathologies, underscoring the need for a close collaboration between intensivists, pneumologists and nephrologists.

N2  - Introduction: Hysterectomies occur frequently among reproductiveaged women. Depressed mood is one of the most prevalent and pervasive consequences, especially among young women. Although it is well-established that insomnia is a known risk factor for depression, few studies have examined the prevalence and role of insomnia among women who have undergone a hysterectomy. The present tested the hypothesis that insomnia would partially account for the risk of depression among these women, particularly those who underwent a hysterectomy at a younger age. Methods: Data from the combined 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were used. Reproductive health was assessed among women age ≥ 20 (N = 5820). Of these, N = 1,294 (22%) had hysterectomies. Insomnia was assessed as selfreported difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and/or difficulty with early morning awakenings; individuals were coded as having insomnia if they reported any of these symptoms rated at “Almost Always (≥ 15 days/month).” Depression was assessed as “feeling down, depressed, or hopeless” at least several days in the past month. Population-weighted logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, number of pregnancies and number of live births, assessed associations between age at hysterectomy and depression and insomnia. Mediation analyses and Sobel tests examined whether the relationship with depression was accounted for by insomnia. Results: Among those with a hysterectomy, both insomnia (19.6%) and depression (28.4%) were prevalent. Age at hysterectomy predicted depres sion (OR = 0.97, 95%CI [0.95-0.99], p = 0.006), as well as in somnia (OR = 0.96, 95%CI [0.94-0.98], p < 0.0001), even after adjusting for depression (OR = 0.96, 95%CI [0.94-0.98], P = 0.001). Significant partial mediation (p = 0.004) was found, such that insomnia explained 27% of the relationship. Conclusion: Women who underwent hysterectomies at younger ages are more likely to be depressed (3% increased risk per year earlier) and have insomnia (4% increased risk per year earlier). Fur ther, 27% of the depression relationship is explained by insomnia. This may be due to medical, psychological, and/or social factors.

N2  - Context Mounting evidence suggests that the origins of childhood obesity and related disparities can be found as early as the "first 1,000 days" - the period from conception to age 2 years. The main goal of this study is to systematically review existing evidence for modifiable childhood obesity risk factors present from conception to age 2 years. Evidence acquisition PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published between January 1, 1980, and December 12, 2014, of childhood obesity risk factors present during the first 1,000 days. Prospective, original human subject, English-language research with exposure occurrence during the first 1,000 days and with the outcome of childhood overweight or obesity (BMI ≥85th percentile for age and sex) collected between age 6 months and 18 years were analyzed between December 13, 2014, and March 15, 2015. Evidence synthesis Of 5,952 identified citations, 282 studies met inclusion criteria. Several risk factors during the first 1,000 days were consistently associated with later childhood obesity. These included higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, prenatal tobacco exposure, maternal excess gestational weight gain, high infant birth weight, and accelerated infant weight gain. Fewer studies also supported gestational diabetes, child care attendance, low strength of maternal-infant relationship, low SES, curtailed infant sleep, inappropriate bottle use, introduction of solid food intake before age 4 months, and infant antibiotic exposure as risk factors for childhood obesity. Conclusions Modifiable risk factors in the first 1,000 days can inform future research and policy priorities and intervention efforts to prevent childhood obesity.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is frequently secondary to common medical conditions including anemia, renal failure, and pregnancy. Here we report a case of restless legs symptoms occurring in the course of a multifocal central nervous system (CNS) process in the brainstem and upper spinal cord. Report of Case: A 37 year old female with a history of anxiety, attention deficit disorder and allergic rhinitis noticed acute onset of an urge to move her legs. Within a few days, the patient gradually developed paresthesia circumferentially around her waist that extended to her toes, along with muscle wea kness. She subsequently developed urinary retention and was evaluated in the Emergency Department. Magnetic Resonance Imaging demonstrated multifocal lesions in the brainstem and upper spinal cord with a peripheral (leptomeningeal) pattern with enhancement, and corresponding T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality which was suspicious for a demyelinating or inflammatory process. Further workup that included bloodwork, lumbar puncture and PET scan was unremarkable. She was started on steroid infusions on a monthly basis for 6 months. The steroid course improved her muscle weakness and paresthesia, and repeat MRI demonstrated resolution of neurological lesions; however, she continued to complain of leg restlessness that was worse at night. She was subsequently evaluated in the sleep clinic and had an unremarkable physical exam including non-focal neurological evaluation. Overnight polysomnography demonstrated frequent limb movements with PLMS Index of 67/hour. On follow up, she reported gradual (though incomplete) resolution of symptoms, and elected conservative management. Conclusions: This case highlights the fact that restless legs symptoms can result from lesions in the CNS, particularly in the spinal cord. However, the clinical course of such symptoms does not necessarily coincide with neuroimaging findings.

N2  - Background: Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FS) is a chronic condition with widespread pain. Increased FS prevalence was observed in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in several of former studies.1,2 Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of FS in patients with Type 2 DM. Additionally; we aimed to evaluate the association of pain severity with disease control of DM. Methods: Patients with Type 2 DM who were followed in Endocrinology Clinic of Cukurova University Hospital were included in the study. FS was diagnosed according to 2013 Alternative Criteria set by American College of Rheumatology. Patients with anemia, hyper- and hypothyroidism, malignancy, pregnancy and rheumatologic conditions were excluded. Patients' pain during morning and sleep was evaluated by Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Fasting blood glucose and Hba1c levels were measured to assess disease control of DM. Results: Ninety-two patients (61 female, 31 male) with Type 2 DM were included in the study. Mean age of the patients was 57.84 ± 10.01 years. FS was diagnosed in 4.3% of the patients. No significant difference was observed between Hba1c levels of Type 2 DM patients with and without FS (P=0.87). Mean VAS scores of the patients during morning and sleep were detected as 2.97±2.96 and 2.51±2.73 respectively. There was a weak negative correlation between VAS morning scores and Hba1c levels in diabetic patients (r=-0.24, P=0.04). There were no correlations of VAS sleep scores with fasting glucose and Hba1c levels (P=0.54, P=0.34 respectively). Conclusions: According to the results of the present study, when diagnosis is based on 2013 alternative criteria of ACR, FS frequency in patients with Type 2 DM is found to be similar to that of among healthy populations. Yet, better control of blood glucose levels might decrease daily pain in diabetic patients.

N2  - Introduction: Restless legs syndrome or Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED) is often misdiagnosed and undertreated. Due to socio-cultural differences in manifestation, this is a bigger problem in the Indian subcontinent. We conducted this study to evaluate the effectiveness of, and problems associated with pharmacological treatment in patients with primary RLS/WED. Methods: A retrospective chart review analysis was carried out for treatment details of adult patients diagnosed as RLS/WED by a single experienced Sleep physician, over an 8 year period. Only patients fulfilling IRLSSG diagnostic criteria for RLS and those with bilaterally symmetrical symptoms were included. Patients with significant comorbidities like chronic kidney disease, malignancies or any major medical illness, as well as pregnant ladies were excluded. Patients for whom at least one year follow up data was unavailable, were also excluded. All data was entered and descriptive statistical analysis was carried out. Results: A total of 192 (mean age 42.9+/-14.6 years) out of 407 patients evaluated, fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Mean IRLS scale scores changed from 21.4+/-7.4, to 6.2+/- 6.3 on treatment. Nearly 62% patients reported > 80% relief in symptoms, at a one-year follow up of treatment with pramipexole (N = 132), ropinirole (N = 128), or both (N = 38) or with pregabalin (N = 12). Eighteen patients reported less than 20% response to any of these. Median serum Ferritin was 35 (range 1.5-208) and oral iron was co-prescribed to 68 (35.4%) patients. Augmentation was observed in 14(7.3%) patients, at median 3.4 years of dopam i nerg ic ther apy, wit h med ian aug ment ation scale scores of 5.4 (range 2-10). Mild Impulse control disorders were observed in only 2 patients. Conclusion: Dopaminergic agonists are effective symptomatic treatment agents for majority of Indian patients with primary RLS/WED, with 'augmentation' not being encountered frequently. A third of these patients benefit with oral iron supplementation.

N2  - Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) alters the development of neurobiological systems, leading to lasting neuroendocrine and neurobehavioural deficits. The hypothalamus is particularly vulnerable to alcohol's effects, as indexed by long-termfunctional changes in the stress response, circadian rhythms, and metabolic regulation. While the etiology of this reprogramming remains unknown, DNA methylation is emerging as a potential mediator and biomarker for the effects of PAE due to its stability over time and malleability in response to environmental cues. Here, we examine the DNAmethylation profiles of rat hypothalami and leukocytes at four developmental time points to assess the genome-wide impact of PAE on the epigenome and identify potential biomarkers of PAE. On gestation day (GD) 1, Sprague-Daley dams were randomly assigned to one of three groups: prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) - ad libitum liquid ethanol diet; pair-fed (PF) - liquid control diet, maltose dextrin isocalorically substituted for ethanol, in the amount consumed by a PAE partner (g/kg/body weight/ GD); control (C) - ad libitum standard rat chow. The hypothalamus of female offspring was collected at postnatal days (PN) 0, 8, 15, and 22 and white bloods cells (WBC) were collected from whole blood at PN22 only. DNA methylation analysis was subsequently performed by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq (MeDIP-seq). PAE caused lasting changes to DNAmethylation profiles across all four developmental ages, and several differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were common between two or more time points. Furthermore, a large number of DMRs displayed the same direction of change in the hypothalamus and leukocytes of PN22 animals. Finally, the majority of differentially methylated regions were located in intergenic regions and contained important regulatory sequences. Persistent DNA methylation changes in the hypothalamus may explain some of the long-term deficits observed in both animal models and clinical studies of PAE. Moreover, correlations between epigenetic alterations in peripheral tissues and those in the brainmay prove vital to the development of an easily measurable signature of FASD.

N2  - Background: The importance of maternal sleep and its contribution to maternal and fetal health during pregnancy is increasingly being recognised. However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy. Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables. Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance. Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not. This study identifies the sleep variables that can be accurately obtained by questionnaire and those that cannot.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is higher during pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant population. The currently screening tools for OSA may not perform well in the obstetric population. OSA is directly linked to an increase in maternal and fetal morbidity. The goal of this systematic review is to determine the best OSA screening tool and the effect of OSA on maternal and fetal outcomes. METHODS: A search of the literature databases Medline (from 1946 to 2015), Medline in-process and other non-indexed citations, Embase (from 1947 to 2015) was carried out. The search strategy yielded 71 citations. Irrelevant papers were excluded by title and abstract review, leaving 33 manuscripts. We reviewed the studies that included: 1) A target population of obstetric patients with obstructive sleep apnea; 2) OSA screening tools; 3) Maternal and fetal outcomes. RESULTS: A number of sleep apnea screening tools have been evaluated for its use in the pregnant population. These screening tools are less accurate in the pregnant population (Table 1). There is growing literature reporting the impact of OSA on adverse maternal and fetal complications. OSA in pregnancy is associated with greater risk of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, pulmonary embolism, preterm birth, and unplanned caesarean sections. OSA in pregnancy is also associated with increased risk of fetal heart rate deceleration with maternal desaturations (SPO2 < 90%), lower Apgar score, low birth weights, still birth, small for gestational age and increased NICU admissions. Overall OSA is directly linked to an increase in maternal and fetal morbidity (Table 1). Treatment of OSA with CPAP in pregnancy has been shown to improve outcomes in a limited number of small studies. CONCLUSION: Further work is needed to detect and treat OSA in pregnancy to decrease the maternal and fetal outcomes.

N2  - Background: Peripartum depression is a debilitating mood disorder that occurs in 15-20% of childbearing women. Although risk factors have been identified, few are modifiable and a substantial proportion of the risk for the disorder remains unexplained and biological contributors are unclear. We aimed to identify modifiable factors early in pregnancy that increase the risk for peripartum depression. Methods: Participants were recruited from MUSC Women's Health Services during their first trimester of pregnancy. Participants (n=107) completed self-report assessments of mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale- EPDS), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-GAD) and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PSQI) as well as provided a blood sample for vitamin D analyses at 8-12 and 24-28 weeks gestation and 6-8 postpartum. Results: 18.7% (20/107) of participants meet criteria for depression, defined as an EDPS score >9, during at least one study assessment. After controlling for potentially confounding variables, women with an elevated PSQI (OR: 1.17; 95% CI 1.04-1.33; p=0.01) or GAD (OR: 1.33;95% CI 1.18-1.48; p=<0.0001) score were signiflcantly more likely to experience elevated depressive symptoms at subsequent assessments. Women with deficient levels of vitamin D (<20ng/L) were more likely to experience elevated depressive symptoms at follow-up assessments, but findings were not statisticallysignificant (OR: 2.40; 95% CI 0.92-6.27; p=0.07). Conclusions: Sleep, anxiety and vitamin D disturbances early in pregnancy appear to increase the risk for peripartum depression. Importantly, these factors are easily identifiable and modifiable in clinical practice. Interventions aimed at improving these disturbances may reduce the risk of peripartum depression.

N2  - Sleep has a strong influence on interictal epileptiform discharges and on epileptic seizures. Interictal epileptiform discharges are activated by sleep deprivation and sleep, and some epilepsies occur almost exclusively during sleep. Treatment of sleep-related epilepsy should take in account the type of epileptic syndrome, the type of seizures, the patient characteristics, and also the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Proper characterization of the epilepsy is essential to choose appropriate antiepileptic drugs. Drugs effective in focal epilepsy may be used to treat benign genetic focal epilepsies such as rolandic epilepsy and other focal (frontal or not) sleep epilepsies. These include both classical (such as carbamazepine) and new (such as levetiracetam and lacosamide) antiepileptic drugs. Drug-resistant cases should be evaluated for epilepsy surgery, which may be efficacious in this setting. Valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam, and perampanel are effective against generalized tonic-clonic seizures in genetic generalized epilepsies, which frequently happen on awakening. Risks of valproate should be considered before prescribing it to women of childbearing age. Specific syndromes such as ESES require specific treatment such as a combination of high dose steroids, benzodiazepines, levetiracetam, and even surgery when an epileptogenic lesion is present. Sleep disorders that may worsen epilepsy such as obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia should be adequately treated to improve seizure frequency. Adequate control of seizures during sleep (especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures) decreases risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: ACOG recommends pregnant women exercise 30 minutes or more on most days of the week. While there are many overall health benefits to exercise, there is little conclusive evidence on the correlation between prenatal exercise on weight gain during pregnancy, pregnancy complications, or obstetric outcomes. METHODS: A prospective survey evaluating exercise habits during each trimester of pregnancy was performed. Exercise level was defined as total number of trimesters (0, 1, 2 or 3) achieving greater than 150 minutes of exercise per week. Weight gain, incidence of pregnancy complications and obstetric outcomes were obtained from the prenatal record and analyzed by exercise level. RESULTS: 462 women met criteria for analysis. There was no difference in prepregnancy BMI or weight gain in pregnancy between exercise groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference in incidence of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, cervical insufficiency, gestational age at delivery, fetal weight, or mode of delivery between groups. There was a higher incidence of depression among pregnant women who did not exercise in comparison to those who exercised greater than 150 minutes in at least one trimester of pregnancy (P<.05). CONCLUSION: Our study did not demonstrate a significant association between exercise during pregnancy and maternal weight gain, pregnancy complications, or obstetric outcomes, with the exception of a higher rate of depression in women who did not exercise. However, our assessment focused on exercise habits, and did not assess dietary intake, sleep habits, or other positive health habits, which may be important indicators of weight gain and obstetric outcomes.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep disorder that may be associated with pregnancy. Studies have found that the prevalence of RLS among pregnant women ranged from 10 to 34%. Typically, there is complete remission of symptoms soon after parturition; however, in some patients, they may continue postpartum. RLS has been shown to be associated with a number of complications in pregnancy including preeclampsia and increased incidence of Cesarean sections. Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, each individual hypothesis cannot completely explain the whole pathogenesis. Present understanding suggests that a strong family history, low serum iron and ferritin level, and high estrogen level during pregnancy might play important roles. Vitamin D deficiency and calcium metabolism may also play a role. Medical treatment of RLS during pregnancy is difficult and challenging considering the risks to mother and fetus. However, in some cases, the disease may be severe enough to require treatment.

N2  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is characterised by widespread pain and increased sensitivity to pain in the central nervous system. Physical and psychological symptoms accompany the disease. The most common accompanying conditions are manual tender points, sleep disorders, fatigue, stiffness, anxiety and depressive symptoms; however, the etiology has not yet been clarified. FS is seen mainly in women between the ages of 25-55. Even though this is a condition that affects women of reproductive age, until now the relationship between pregnancy and FS has not been the subject of many studies. The study is a prospective case-control study conducted with patients at the birth unit of Department of Obstetrics in the period between January and June 2015. 277 pregnant women were included in this study. In the study, fibromyalgia syndrome was determined based on the presence or absence of the 2010 ACR diagnostic criteria. Our study included 150 pregnant women who had fibromyalgia syndrome, classified according to these criteria. The control group include 127 pregnant women who did not have fibromyalgia syndrome. The impact of the presence of fibromyalgia on the functional status of the patients in their daily life was evaluated using the FIQ (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire). VAS (Visual Analog Scale) is used to assess the severity of pain; BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) is used for assessing depression. This study included 150 pregnant women who had fibromyalgia syndrome and 127 pregnant women who did not FS. There was no demographic differences between the groups. When the difference between FS group and the control group in terms of these queries is studied as a single variable, its has been shown statistically that in the presence of FMS, the physical and psychological scores are negatively affected (p<0.001). No correlation between the marital satisfaction form results of the questionnaire and the presence of FS (p=0.634).In the study, the group with fibromyalgia syndrome and the control group were compared in terms of biochemical and hormonal parameters. The results of this comparison are as follows: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of glucose, calcium, phosphorus, PTH, TSH, fT4 levels. Comparison of the results from the fibromyalgia syndrome group and control group showed that the serotonin levels in the fibromyalgia syndrome group were significantly lower than the level of serotonin in the control group (p=0.009). The correlation between the Beck Depression Inventory scores and other parameters showed that pain and physical impact scores are negatively affected by depression (P=0.000). A one-unit increase in the BDI score increases the risk of FS 1.22 fold, which was statistically significant. A 1-unit decrease in the amount of serotonin increases the risk of the FS 1.003 times. But this correlation was not statistically significant. In conclusion, our study has shown that serotonin levels in women with FMS are lower than the control group and that serotonin levels reduce as pregnancy progresses. Anxiety and depression in pregnant women with FS are higher than the control group. The presence of depression increases the likelihood of developing FS. (figure present).

N2  - Introduction: Maternal smoking causes significant morbidity and mortality in the human infant. Following prenatal exposure, the newborn displays alterations in autonomic control and has increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS. Objective: This study aimed to establish whether snuff(non smoking tobacco) use by the mother during pregnancy is a less harmful alternative for the baby than smoking cigarettes. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on infants (n= 56) of women who used snuff or cigarettes during pregnancy. Maternal nicotine use was determined both with questionnaires and with cotinine levels in urine of the infant. We studied heart rate variability in infants at 1-2 months of age with a 24 hour-ECG followed by spectral analysis of a 2 hour ECG segment during sleep. The outcome LF/HF ratio reflects the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic system. Results: The LF/HF ratio was higher in snuff and smoke as compared to controls and was due to decreased parasympathetic activation. Prenatal nicotine exposure, both snuff and smoking, without any postpartal exposure showed an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls. We could see no difference of non-smoke tobacco compared to cigarettes which suggests that the detrimental effects are mediated via nicotine. The alteration in autonomic regulation seems to be long lasting and due to neonatal reprogramming. Conclusion: The results of this study indicates that nicotine is harmful for the developing infant in all forms. It thus emphasizes the importance of abstaining from all forms of nicotine during pregnancy and that there are no safe forms of tobacco or safe periods for its use during gestation.

N2  - Sleep disorders are common in CKD patients and especially so in those with ESRD. However, despite disrupted sleep patterns in CKD patients, not much is known about its prevalence across the CKD stages. We sought to determine the prevalence of physician-diagnosed sleep disorders in adults with early and advanced stages of CKD and whether the prevalence across stages is consistent over time. We used 2005-2012 NHANES data of non-pregnant adults aged ≥ 20 years who reported having at least one routine place to go for healthcare (n=3,444-4,649). CKD was defined by 15≤eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or ACR≥30 mg/g. Sleep disorder was defined by answering “yes” to the question “Have you ever been told by a doctor⋯ that you have a sleep disorder?” We used a multivariable regression model adjusted for confounders such as age, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity to examine the prevalence of sleep disorder across two time periods: 2005-2008 and 2009-2012. (Table Presented) There was a significant increase in reports of physician-diagnosed sleep disorders in stages 1-2 (mild CKD) and stages 3-4 (moderate to severe CKD) across the two time periods. We also found that reports of physician diagnosed sleep disorders were significantly higher in CKD stages 3-4 compared to stages 1-2 (p<0.001) in 2005-2008 and in 2009-2012. Sleep disorders are much more prevalent in the advanced stages of CKD. However, it is unclear if this increase is due to an increase in sleep disorders or better physician diagnosis and patients awareness of sleep disorders. Focusing on diagnosis and management of sleep disorders may improve quality of life in adults with CKD.

N2  - Background and purpose: Preeclampsia is one of the three main causes of death in pregnant women in which multiple causes may be involved including lifestyle, stress, and sleep disorders. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between pre-eclampsia and restless legs syndrome. Materials and methods: This case-control study was conducted in 150 pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and 150 pregnant women without pre-eclampsia attending health centers and state hospitals of Mashhad, Iran in 2014. The diagnosis of preeclampsia was made by a systolic blood pressure equal to, or greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure equal to, or greater than 90 mm Hg, accompanied by urinary protein excretion more than 300 mg per 24 hours. The presence of restless legs syndrome was determined based on the diagnostic criteria updated by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Data was analyzed using SPSS V.16 and chi-square test, odds ratio, independent t-test, mann-whitney, chi-square, correlation coefficient and logistic regressions. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Restless legs syndrome was observed in 15.3% of the participants with preeclampsia and 7.3% of the control group indicating a significant relationship between pre-eclampsia and restless legs syndrome (P<0.001). In fact, participants with pre-eclamsia were more at risk of restless legs syndrome compared to those without it (OR =2.28, CI95%:1.07-4.88). Conclusion: Due to an increased risk of preeclampsia in women with restless legs syndrome during pregnancy, it can be considered as a risk factor for preeclampsia.

N2  - Background: Few data are available about obesity surgery in adolescent patients. Objective: To assess long-term outcomes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in patients <18 years. Setting: University Hospital, Europe. Methods: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data of patients <18 years (childhood group; ChG) (n = 28) treated by LRYGB of which 19 were available for follow-up between 2.4 and 10.2 years (mean 7.2 years). This group of patients was matched with an adult control group (AdG) of randomly chosen patients with similar characteristics who underwent LRYGB during the same period. The extensive survey included a telephonic questionnaire. Results: 19 (12 females) of the 28 patients (67.9%) were available for follow-up. Preoperatively, 3 had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 1 arterial hypertension, 5 dyslipidemia and 1 sleep apnea. In the ChG, average BMI after 7 years dropped from 38.9 kg/m2 preoperatively to 27.5 kg/m2. In the AdG, average BMI decreased from 39.4 to 27.1 kg/m2 in the same time period (nonsignificant between groups). One patient in the ChG needed a reoperation (internal hernia) versus 3 patients in the AdG (1 leak, 2 obstructions). All patients resolved their initial comorbidities. Two of 12 female patients in the ChG became pregnant 6 and 8 years after surgery, respectively, despite seemingly adequate oral contraception. Compliance with postoperative guidelines was good in 16/19 patients in ChG and in 14/18 patients in the AdG. Overall degree of satisfaction was high: 8.2/10 (SD 1.2, range 6-10) in the ChG and 8.9/10 (SD 1.7, range 5-10) in the AdG. Conclusion: LRYGB seems to be safe, provide good weight loss, and cure comorbidities in an adolescent population. Satisfaction degree is high. Inadvertent pregnancy despite conventional contraception is a possible issue.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Known causes of stillbirth include premature rupture of membranes, congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Risk factors for stillbirth include age, black or Hispanic ethnicity, history of smoking, history of stillbirth, diabetes, and hypertension. The objective of this study was to determine the stillbirth rate and descriptive factors for clinics serving the a Midwestern, metropolitan community. METHODS: After receiving IRB approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted at two local, private practice obstetrical clinics. Records were reviewed for patients that experienced a stillbirth between January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2013 using ICD-9 codes: V27.1, 656.4, 674.9, 656.43, 779.9, and 651.6. Cases with a demise before 14 weeks gestation were excluded. Demographics, maternal history, antepartum care, antepartum education, and delivery information were collected. RESULTS: The stillbirth rate was 4.1 per 1,000 deliveries. Among the 78 patients included in the final analysis, average maternal age was 28.2 years (SD=7.1, range=17 to 45). Most were white (n=48, 64%), never smoked (n=50, 64.9%), and had private medical insurance (n=51, 68%). Average gestational age at delivery was 27.9 weeks (SD=7.9, range=14 to 41). Among the 45 women who experienced stillbirth after 24 weeks gestation, 12 (27.9%) reported decreased fetal movement, and most did not receive education on fetal movement (n=44, 97.8%), safe sleep (n=45, 100%), or breastfeeding (n=43, 93.3%). CONCLUSION: Prenatal education in regards to fetal movement, safe sleep, and breastfeeding was lacking. A locally designed intervention to detect fetal movement should be developed to reduce stillbirth.

N2  - Objective: Patient S.P., 37 years old, has come with complaints about dyspareunia, pain feelings during coitus with irradiation into clitoris and small vulvar lips. Sick nurse. She has been married for 23 years, fiduciary relationships in family, loves her husband. Methods: Menstruations' debut at the age of 12, regular, painless. Sexual debut at the age of 23, single sexual partner. One childbirth through natural birth passages. Contraception - interrupted sexual intercourse, condom. During sexual intimacy she achieved orgasm more than in half of cases. Frequency of sexual intercourse was 2-3 times per week. One year ago due to undesirable pregnancy the artificial interruption in the period of 7-8 weeks was carried out, complicated with placental polyp and repeated curettage of uterine cavity. When resuming sexual relationships in one month after treatment pain feelings appeared. During gynecological examination of the woman a chronic inflammatory disease of organs of small pelvis was revealed. During sexological examination by ultrasonography method with the use of Doppler method of organs of small pelvis in the first phase of menstrual cycle signs of violation of blood flow in genitals were revealed: increase of index of resistance (IR) to 0.69 and reduction of voluminous blood flow (Vvol) to 3.31 ml/min. Results: Individual psychotherapy and psychotherapy of a couple. Complex anti-inflammatory therapy. Physical therapy. Electric sleep. In 3 months after treatment the harmony of sexual relationships of spouses was achieved. When using Doppler method of organs of small pelvis Doppler indicators normalized: index of resistance (IR) has normalized to 0.57, and voluminous speed of blood flow (Vvol) has normalized to 3.46 ml/min. To prevent unplanned pregnancy we recommended using vaginal ring Nova Ring. Conclusion: Optimal choice of method of contraception promotes preservation of reproductive and sexual health of a couple and prevention of possible sexual dysfunctions during unplanned pregnancy.

N2  - Cannabis is popularly believed to be a relatively benign substance. Cannabis is also considered to have potential medical benefits, and medical marijuana has been legislated in many parts of the world. However, a recent meta-analysis found that cannabinoids were associated with only modest benefits for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, small and inconsistent benefits for pain and spasticity, and inconclusive benefits for other indications such as improvement of appetite and weight, reduction in tic severity, and improvement of mood or sleep. On the flip side, cannabinoids and cannabis have acute and long-term adverse effects. In randomized controlled trials, cannabinoids increase the risk of total adverse events, serious adverse events, and dropout due to adverse events. Cannabis impairs cognition, and driving after cannabis use is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. Long-term cannabis use may lead to dependence, respiratory conditions, psychosis, and possibly cancer, as well. Cannabis use during pregnancy may compromise certain pregnancy outcomes such as fetal growth, and use during adolescence may compromise neurodevelopment, social adjustment, and vocational success. The composition and bioavailability of cannabis vary across preparations of the substance and routes of administration; this limits the ability to generalize the findings of studies. The findings of older research may no longer apply to current strains of cannabis that are higher in psychotogenic content. It is important for medical professionals and the lay public to understand the limitations of the efficacy data and the seriousness of the risks associated with cannabis use in medical and recreational contexts.

N2  - Objective: She has been working as a head of the department in a bank and is satisfied with her work. She has been in a second marriage for 15 years. She has been smoking for 30 years, but lately has limited the consumption of cigarettes to 3-4 per day. She goes to gym 5 days per week with one session lasting 40-45 minutes long, and has a tendency to put on weight. Methods: Psychological health and previous treatment: No previous treatment. She describes herself as emotionally stable, loving wife and mother. General medical health: Menopause - 2.5 years after stress (mother's death). IMT - 25.2 kg/m2. For the last year the increase of arterial pressure to 130/90 mm have been marked (she was previously inclined to hypotension), with hot flushes up to 5-7 times per day, superficial sleep. Obstetric history and subjective complaints: Multipara, normal pregnancies and vaginal birth. In 3 years after childbirth she went through artificial abortion, complicated with intensification of chronic inflammatory disease of organs of small pelvis. An antiinflammatory therapy was carried out. Sexual debut: At the age of 18. Previous sexual experience: no sexual assaults/abuse, heterosex, previously stable sexual relationships with few partners prior to the first marriage (during 2 years) and to the second marriage. Sexual complaints: Before the early menopause there were no sexual complaints. Since the menopause the patient has not been able to achieve the same level of orgasm as pre-op. She has experienced low desire situationally. Her partner complained about the patient's inability of achieving the same level of orgasm as prior to the menopause. She has complained of slight and deep dyspareunia (by the principle of 'vicious circle'). Pelvic examination and diagnostics: No abnormalities, besides hypertonic pelvic muscles. The vaginal tissue looks atrophic. Reduction of estrogen level in blood (E2- 40 pg/ml). Colposcopy: thinning of mucous membrane of vagina, petechial hemorrhage, translucent capillaries. pH of vaginal contents - 6.8. Reduction of blood flow level in clitoris vessels before and after sexual stimulation when assessing the blood flow speed with the Doppler method. Rise of susceptibility threshold of first-order erogenous zones when assessing their tactile reaction with the vibro test. Results: Sexual counseling/psychotherapy. Step-by-step introduction to sensate focus exercises with and without partner. Masturbation techniques with and without partner. System hormonal replacement therapy and topical estrogen. Conclusion: As the complaints the patient has addressed with have become stable for the last years, treatment has to be complex and take into account the general state and age changes of a woman, and psychological problems of spouses in a single context. 2 months after treatment: Improvement of the general state: sleep has normalized, lost 2 kg, normal weight/BMI. Lubrication restored, dyspareunia removed, sexual desire improved with the achievement of orgasm in most cases and couple's sexual comfort.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances are common in women, especially during pregnancy. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of sleep disturbances as a risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes and the need for screening and treatment of inadequate sleep. These reports, however, did not examine health-related quality of life which may be affected by sleep long before adverse clinical consequences are detectable in women during pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between sleep and health-related quality of life in pregnant women.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: A university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan and participants' homes.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 164 pregnant women completed questionnaires and wore a wrist actigraphy monitor for 7 days each trimester.
METHODS: Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy, subjective sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life was measured using the SF-12v2 questionnaire across three trimesters. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep and health-related quality of life.
RESULTS: Sixty-four (39.0%) women consistently had an average sleep efficiency<85% by actigraphy and 40 (24.4%) had a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score>5 in all three trimesters. Cross-sectionally, more actigraphic daytime sleep (p=0.04) and better subjective sleep quality (p<0.01) were associated with better physical health-related quality of life in first-trimester pregnant women. Better actigraphic sleep efficiency (p=0.04) and better subjective sleep quality (p<0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in second-trimester pregnant women. Longer actigraphic total nighttime sleep (p<0.01) and better subjective sleep quality (p<0.01) were associated with better mental health-related quality of life in third-trimester pregnant women. Longitudinally, first-trimester actigraphic total nighttime sleep (p<0.05) and subjective sleep quality (p<0.01) predicted mental health-related quality of life in the second and third trimester.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances are a highly prevalent and persistent problem in pregnant women. Adequate sleep is essential for women at all pregnancy stages and improving nocturnal sleep quantity and quality in early gestation is of utmost importance for an optimal health-related quality of life later in pregnancy.

N2  - Circadian rhythms are endogenous entrainable oscillations of approximately 24 hours. The tissues of the female reproductive system, from preovulation to parturition, are regulated by circadian rhythms. Studies have shown that disruptions of circadian rhythms during pregnancy result in adverse maternal (preterm birth and miscarriage) and fetal outcomes (impaired cognition). We hypothesize that knockout of chief circadian clock genes Per1/Per2, Clock, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor (VIPR2) will decrease gestation length and impair offspring cognition. To test our hypothesis, we used C57BL/6 mice (WT) and mice deficient Per1/Per2, VIP, and VIPR2. These mice were blindly monitored throughout their pregnancies in a 12 hour light/dark cycle, with lights turning on at 7:00 AM and off at 7:00 PM. Archival data on mouse birth records did not provide a refined temporal resolution, but research in our laboratory indicates shorter gestation lengths in Per1-/-/Per2-/-knockout mice when mating was more discretely timed, with 1-minute resolution. Preliminary results also show a difference in the frequency of certain behaviors attributed with sleep between genotypes. Mice that are either advanced or delayed in their cycles showed an uncharacteristic onset of sleep, occurring well before lights turned on. Other mice showed significant differences in frequency of behavior associated with wakefulness. This and further monitoring could help us get closer to understanding the link between circadian rhythms and the timing of birth.

N2  - Objectives: The postpartum period is a time of considerable stress related to adaptation to the demands of parenting including altered sleep schedules. The potential implications for immune function are not well described. This study examined effects of sleep quality and psychosocial stress on stimulated cytokine production among 71 women assessed during late pregnancy (26-35 weeks gestation) and again at 7-10 weeks postpartum. Methods: LPS-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β by PBMCs incubated for 24 hours was determined via multiplex tissue culture kits from MSD. Women completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Parenting Stress Index - Short Form (PSI-SF; at postpartum only). Results: During the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, no associations were observed between psychosocial measures and stimulated cytokine production (ps > 0.10). However, at postpartum, poorer sleep quality was associated with greater stimulated IL-6 (r = 0.235, p = 0.049) and IL-8 production (r = 0.266, p = 0.025). In addition, greater parenting stress predicted greater stimulated IL-6 (r = 0.30, p = 0.013) and marginally greater IL-8 production (r = 0.22, p = 0.069). When both PSQI and PSI-SF were included in a regression model, the effect of sleep quality was reduced by 25.5% for IL-6 production and 13.9% for IL-8 production, suggesting that effects of sleep were partially accounted for by increased parenting stress. The observed associations were not affected by inclusion of maternal BMI, race, breastfeeding status, smoking, age, or weeks postpartum in the model. In addition, no associations were observed between CES-D or PSS scores with stimulated cytokine production at postpartum (ps ≥ 0.11). Discussion: Women reporting poorer sleep quality during postpartum show enhanced inflammatory responses to immune challenge, an effect partially accounted for by increased parenting stress. Infections of delivery-related wounds (surgical or episiotomy), as well as uterine, bladder, and kidney infections and mastitis are common in postpartum, affecting 6.0-7.4% of women in the first month alone. Implications of sleep- and stress-induced immune dysregulation during this period of considerable behavioral stress as well as health vulnerability require examination. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Objective: Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common during pregnancy and are associated with negative obstetric and postpartum outcomes. This study investigated if group cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) was associated with improvements in symptoms of insomnia experienced during pregnancy. Secondary outcomes included changes in subjective sleep quality, objective sleep measures, depression, anxiety and fatigue. Design, Setting and Participants: Thirteen pregnant women (mean gestational age = 19.31 weeks) with insomnia participated in the CBT-I group sessions. Insomnia was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Measures of total sleep time (TST), time in bed (TIB), sleep onset latency (SOL) and sleep efficiency (SE) were assessed via self-report and wrist actigraphy. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and one week following five weekly sessions of treatment. Results: All participants completed the study and provided baseline and follow-up data. Improvements were observed on the ISI, PSQI and subjective and objective assessments of TIB, SOL and SE and subjective TST. ISI scores decreased such that, on average, participants were no longer reporting clinically significant insomnia following treatment. The majority of participants (12/13 participants, 92.3%) experienced a decrease of at least 8.4 points on the ISI, which is indicative of clinically significant improvement of insomnia symptoms. Additionally, symptoms of depression, pregnancy-specific anxiety and fatigue all decreased over the course of treatment. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large. Conclusions: CBT-I delivered during pregnancy was associated with significant improvements in sleep and mood. Given the promise of this intervention, the logical next step in this area of inquiry is to better establish efficacy via a randomized controlled trial. (Table presented).

N2  - Rationale: Anxiety during pregnancy has been linked to adverse maternal health outcomes, including postpartum depression (PPD). However, there has been limited study of biological mechanisms underlying behavioral predictors of PPD during pregnancy. Objectives: Considering the shared etiology of chronic stress amongst antenatal behavioral predictors, the primary goal of this pilot study was to examine associations among stress-related physiological factors (including GABA-ergic neurosteroids) and stress-related behavioral indices of anxiety during pregnancy. Methods: Fourteen nulliparous women in their second trimester of a singleton pregnancy underwent speech and mental arithmetic stress, following a 2-week subjective and objective recording of sleep-wake behavior. Results: Lower cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of ALLO + pregnanolone throughout the entire stressor protocol (area under the curve, AUC) were associated with greater negative emotional responses to stress, and lower cortisol AUC was associated with worse sleep quality. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone was associated with greater anxious and depressive symptoms. Stress produced paradoxical reductions in cortisol, progesterone, and a combined measure of allopregnanolone + pregnanolone, while tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were elevated. Conclusions: These data suggest that cortisol, progesterone, and ALLO + pregnanolone levels in the second trimester of pregnancy are inversely related to negative emotional symptoms, and the negative impact of acute stress challenge appears to exert its effects by reducing these steroids to further promote negative emotional responses.

N2  - Our goal was to examine associations of infant sleep and feeding patterns with maternal sleep and mood among women at risk for postpartum depression. Participants were 30 women (age ± SD = 28.3 ± 5.1 years) with a history of MDD (but not in a mood episode at enrollment) who completed daily sleep diaries, wore wrist actigraphs to estimate sleep, and had their mood assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17) during four separate weeks of the perinatal period (33 weeks pregnancy and weeks 2, 6, and 16 postpartum). They logged their infants’ sleep and feeding behaviors daily and reported postnatal stress on the Childcare Stress Inventory (CSI) at week 16. Mothers’ actigraphically estimated sleep showed associations with infant sleep and feeding patterns only at postpartum week 2. Shorter duration of the longest infant-sleep bout was associated with shorter maternal sleep duration (p =.02) and lower sleep efficiency (p =.04), and maternal sleep efficiency was negatively associated with the number of infant-sleep bouts (p =.008) and duration of infant feeding (p =.008). Neither infant sleep nor feeding was associated with maternal sleep at 6 or 16 weeks, but more disturbed infant sleep and more frequent feeding at 6 weeks were associated with higher HAM-D scores at 6 and 16 weeks and higher CSI scores. Sleep in the mother-infant dyad is most tightly linked in the early postpartum weeks, but mothers continue to experience disturbed sleep and infant sleep and feeding behaviors continue to be associated with mothers’ depressive symptoms and stress ratings as long as 16 weeks postpartum. These data imply that interventions designed to improve maternal sleep and postpartum mood should include both mothers and infants because improving infant sleep alone is not likely to improve maternal sleep, and poor infant sleep is linked to postpartum depression and stress.

N2  - Study Objectives: The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is more prevalent in ex-preterm children compared to the general pediatric population. However, it is unknown whether OSAS in ex-preterm children is associated with specific perinatal risk factors. This multicenter cohort study aimed to determine perinatal factors associated with OSAS at school age. Methods: 197 ex-preterm (500-1,250 g) children aged 5-12 y who participated as neonates in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of caffeine versus placebo (Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity) underwent comprehensive ambulatory polysomnography. A negative binomial regression model was used to identify perinatal risk factors associated with OSAS. Results: 19 children had OSAS (9.6%). Chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation were positively associated with OSAS with P values of 0.014 and 0.03, respectively. Maternal white race (P = 0.047) and maternal age (P = 0.002) were negatively associated with OSAS. Other risk factors, such as birth weight, Apgar score at 5 min, antenatal corticosteroids, delivery route, and sex were not significant. Conclusions: OSAS is very frequent, and is associated with chorioamnionitis and multiple gestation in ex-preterm children. Those born to older white mothers appear to be protected. We speculate that the former may be due to systemic inflammation and the latter to a higher socio-economic status.

N2  - Purpose: Approximately 20-40% of patients with GERD are not effective to standard doses of proton pump inhibitors. Refractory symptoms are strongly associated with sleep disturbances and quality of life (QOL). An increased dose of PPI appears to improve the refractory GERD sympoms1). However, pertinent dose interval of PPI and the efficacy on sleep disturbance or QOL have not fully been studied. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of once-daily 20mg rabeprazole with that of twice-daily 10mg rabeprazole on refractory GERD symptoms, sleep disturbance and QOL. Method: A multicenter prospective randomized study was done. Patients were enrolled between November 2011 and September 2015 at Keiyu Hospital and 6 clinics. Inclusion criteria included eligible patients who were not effective PPI over 4 weeks. We use the Global Overall Symptom (GOS) scale. Patients that at least one of 10 specific upper GI symptoms was 4-point were diagnosed as the PPI refractory. Pregnant patients, nursing mothers or night-shift workers were excluded from the study. Disease-related exclusion criteria were as follows: sever diseases such as malignant diseases, active peptic ulcer, or a past history of upper GI surgery. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy were performed before starting treatment. Patients completed self-report questionnaires that include the GOS score every week for 8 weeks, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and SF-8 at 4 and 8 weeks. Patients were randomized by a scratch card to once-daily 20mg rabeprazole group (20x1) or twice-daily 10mg rabeprazole group (10x2). Results: A total of 88 patients were enrolled in this study. One patient discontinued treatment due to edema of extremities, side effect of rabeprazole. One was dropped out and , 8 were incomplete questionnaires. Then, 78 patients were analyzed. Treatment groups did not differ in age, gender, and other patients characteristics. Table 1 summarizes the patients' characteristics. GOS sore significantly decreased after 1 week in both group. There was no significantly difference in GOS score between two groups (Figure 1). SF-8 score showed increasing trend for 8 weeks in both groups, but did not show significant difference (20x1:0w 42.7±8.8, 4w 43.9±7.9, 8w 44.5±8.5. 10x2: 0w 46.5±7.3, 4w 47.9±7.5, 8w 48.4±6.4). Of the 74 cases, 51 (68.9%) were PSQI score∧5.5. PSQI score was not significantly changed for observed period, and there were no significant differences between two groups (20x1:0w 7.8±3.7 4w 7.7±3.7, 8w 7.6±3.7. 10x2: 0w 7.5±4.0, 4w 7.2±4.1, 8w 6.8±3.7). Conclusion: Many patients with PPI refractory GERD were suffered from sleep disturbance and general distress. Double-dose rabeprazole was effective to PPI refractory GERD in spite of interval of PPI but both were not effective to sleep disturbances and general distress. (Table Presented).

N2  - Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is the underlying pathophysiological condition seen in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea. We have recently demonstrated that offspring exposed to maternal CIH during pregnancy exhibit reduced Liver X Receptor (LXR) protein leading to augmented expression of hepatic enzymes promoting gluconeogenesis. As LXR also plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis, this study was done to determine the impact of diminished LXR expression on cholesterol handling by the liver in the offspring of CIH exposed pregnant mothers. Pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed daily to CIH (6.5% nadir; 18 cycles/h; 8h/day) from gestational day-1 to day-20. Control mothers were exposed to room air during pregnancy. Offspring were sacrificed at postnatal 6 and 12 weeks of age to assess early life and long-term alterations in liver function. At both ages, male CIH offspring had significantly (p<0.05) higher total circulating cholesterol levels concomitant with significantly (p<0.05) greater body fat deposition compared to offspring exposed to gestational normoxia. Western blot analysis revealed that adult male CIH offspring at both ages had significantly (p<0.05) lower protein expression of the cholesterol catabolizing enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the cholesterol efflux transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter G8 (ABCG8), and the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) compared to the offspring exposed to gestational normoxia. Taken together, these data indicate that gestational CIH-induced hypercholesterolemia in the offspring results from diminished expression of LXR target genes associated with cholesterol breakdown, excretion, and removal from the circulation.

N2  - Background: Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a burdensome sleep disorder, has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and related disorders. However, the relationship of RLS to history of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), a predictor of subsequent CVD, diabetes, and associated conditions, remains little explored. In this study, we investigated the relationship of RLS to history of PIH in a sample of primary care patients. Methods: Participants were women aged ≥40 years drawn from an anonymous survey study of West Virginia primary care patients. Data collected included detailed information on demographics, lifestyle factors, sleep patterns, and reproductive/medical history; the survey also included an RLS diagnostic questionnaire. Women who were pregnant or unsure about their pregnancy status were excluded from the analyses. Results: Of the 498 participants in the final analytic sample, 24.5% met diagnostic criteria for RLS (17.9% with symptoms ≥once/week, 11.9% with symptoms ≥3 times/week); 73 (16.5% of parous women) reported a history of PIH, defined as physician-diagnosed preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle characteristics, obesity, reproductive history, health conditions, and other factors, those reporting a history of PIH were approximately twice as likely to meet criteria for RLS (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1, 3.6). These associations increased in magnitude with increasing symptom frequency (adjusted OR for RLS with symptoms ≥3 times/week = 3.8; CI 1.9, 7.6; p for trend = 0.003). Conclusions: History of PIH was strongly and positively related to current RLS in this study of primary care patients; these findings further support a possible role for metabolic dysregulation in RLS etiology.

N2  - Introduction: Obesity during pregnancy is associated with a wide spectrum of maternal, fetal and neonatal complications. This study compared placental pathology in women with obesity and normal weight gravidas. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective case-control study. The sample was randomly selected from a total of 1000 deliveries of largely Caucasian population in a single institution, recruited for the study of sleep disordered breathing, where the placenta is submitted for pathological examination for clinical indications based on national guidelines. Cases (Body mass index - BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2; n = 47) and controls (BMI < 25 kg/m2, n = 45) were selected based on BMI obtained from the first prenatal visit. Placental pathology, clinical parameters and limited outcomes were extracted from medical records. Placental weight range was defined as small for gestational age (SGA) if <10th percentile, large for gestational age (LGA) if >90th percentile. Results: Mean BMI was 36.2 ± 5.5 in the group with obesity and 21.7 ± 1.9 in the control group (p < 0.01). There was a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes in cases compared to controls (14/47 vs. 3/45, p = 0.006) while preterm birth was significantly higher in the control group (9/47 vs. 19/46, p = 0.02). There were more LGA placentas in cases versus controls (12/47 vs. 2/46, p = 0.007; even after adjusting for diabetes). More histological features of inflammation, marginal insertion of the umbilical cord and intervillous thrombi in the parenchyma were also noted in the case group. Conclusions: Results from the current study suggest that maternal obesity measured at early pregnancy may have effects on both placental implantation and growth, and further exacerbate the hypercoagulable state in placenta.

N2  - Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of stillbirth, adverse perinatal outcomes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in later life. Aim: A proof of concept study, WELLBABE (Weight Loss Looking for Babe and mother's Better outcomes), was carried out at the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals to investigate the effects of dietary energy restriction (1200 kcal/day) on glycaemic control in women with GDM. We report on women's participation and experience of the diet. Methods Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 pregnant women who participated in WELLBABE. Results All women described the diet as something they 'had to do' and felt a responsibility to reduce risks to their baby's health: 'what better incentive not to cheat'. They had no concerns about calorie restriction causing harm, all anxieties surrounded the possible impact of GDM on the fetus. Other motivating factors included medication avoidance, controlling weight, reducing future T2D risk, ongoing surveillance by the research team and contributing to research results. The women felt well supported by the research team. Social support from family and friends was also important; involvement by partners was especially helpful. Women reported having more energy, better sleep and feeling fitter. Glycaemic control was maintained by diet in 75% of interviewees, women felt glad they had participated and reported learning valuable lessons that they would continue to use. Conclusion Women with GDM are willing and able to reduce calorie intake if provided with adequate information, support, monitoring and reassurance.

N2  - Background: Peginterferon alpha-2a is a known standard therapy for patients with acute HCV infection. Our experience with peginterferon in hemodialised patients with hepatitis C started with a million question and uncertainties. This because of the: - acute phase of infection, which we encountered due to repetitive serological tests the patients underwent because of hemodialysis protocols. - fragile, immunodepressed patients which had a lifetime with serious underlying diseases, primary related to nephropathies or not. However efficacy and safety of this treatment is still unclear in regional settings. This study tends to evidence the efficacy and safety of peg-interferon therapy in Albanian hemodialysed patients. Methods & Materials: In a one-year period (from November 2013- November 2014), we enrolled consecutive patients with detectable anti-HCV antibody and HCV-RNA in the serum, who had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Written informed consent was taken from them. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were excluded and in women of fertility age,pregnancy tests were done 24 hours prior to the first dose of peginterferon alpha-2a. Underlying diseases in our hemodialysed patients included Chronic renal failure -55 cases, Acute pyelonephritis - 1 case, Renal policystosis - 6 cases, Congenital renal atrophy - 1 case, nephrolythiasis -2 cases, renal transplant- 2 cases, nephroectomy- 3 cases, Arterial hypertension- 2 cases, spondyloarthrosis - 1 case. Results: Early virologic response and sustained virologic response rates were 84.8% (47/55) 78.2% (42/55) respectively. The most common adverse effects in descending order were flue-like symptoms (83%), hair loss 36.3%, anorexia 54.5%, weight loss 25.4%, mood changes 40%, sleep disorders 29%, hematomas 41%, epistaxis 21.8% Laboratory data evidenced anemia 96.3%, leucopenia 78.1%, thrombocytopenia 83.6%. Conclusion: Our 55 patients manifested several adverse effects, during therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a. Despite their particular immune status, these adverse affects appeared minimal compared to the efficacy of treatment in our patients.

N2  - Although low cholesterol levels have been consistently related to depression, no studies have examined whether blood lipid fractions are differentially associated with depressive symptom clusters and individual symptoms. Such an analysis could provide insights into the mechanisms underlying lipid-depression relationships, as particular neurobiological changes are thought to be responsible for certain depressive symptoms. Thus, we examined associations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and statin use with depressive symptom clusters and individual symptoms. We utilized cross-sectional data from NHANES 2005-2012 - a survey of a large probability sample representative of the U.S. population. We selected the 7,072 adults (Mage=47.9 years, 51% female, 27% non-white) who were 18 years or older, had no history of CVD, were not pregnant, followed the blood draw fasting restrictions, and had complete data on key variables. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and subscale scores were computed by summing items 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9 for the cognitive-affective subscale and 3, 4, 5, and 8 somatic subscale. Standard methods were used to assess serum total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides. The Friedewald equation was used to calculate LDL-C. Statin use was self-reported during the household interview. Separate regression models revealed that only HDL-C is inversely associated with both total PHQ-9 score (B=-0.41, SEB=0.18, p=.03) and the somatic subscale (B=-0.27, SEB=0.11, p=.01) but not the cognitive-affective subscale (B=-0.14, SEB=0.09, p=.11). LDL-C, triglycerides, and statin use were all not associated with the PHQ-9 total and subscale scores. Further analyses indicated that HDL-C is inversely associated with PHQ-9 Item #3 (sleep disturbance; B=-0.09, SEB=0.04, p=.02) and Item #4 (fatigue; B=-0.10, SEB=0.04, p=.02) only. Contrasting with prior findings, lipid fractions and statin use were not associated with Item #9 (suicidal ideation). Our results suggest that the relationship between low HDL-C and depressive symptoms is driven by the somatic symptoms, especially sleep disturbance and fatigue but not appetite/eating changes. These findings are more consistent with physiologic mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-depression relationship (e.g., low HDL-C leading to increased systemic inflammation and/or reduced serotonergic signaling leading to sleep disturbance and fatigue) than behavioral mechanisms (e.g., appetite/eating changes leading to nutritional deficits leading to low HDL-C).

N2  - Background and Objective: Abnormal respiratory rate (RR) is a key symptom of disease in the newborn. The aim of this study was to establish the reference range for RR during the first 24 hours of life in healthy infants born at term. Methods: Infants were included at the hospital postnatal ward when time permitted. During sleep or a defined quiet state, RR was counted at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours by placing the bell of a stethoscope in front of the nostrils and mouth for 60 seconds. Data on maternal health, pregnancies, and births were obtained from medical records and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Results: The study included 953 infants. Median RRs were 46 breaths/minute at 2 hours, thereafter 42 to 44 breaths/minute. The 95th percentile was 65 breaths/minute at 2 hours, thereafter 58 to 60 breaths/minute. The fifth percentile was 30 to 32 breaths/minute. Within these limits, the intraindividual variation was wide. The overall mean RR was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7 to 5.7, P <.001) breaths/minute higher while awake than during sleep, 3.1 (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.8, P <.001) breaths/minute higher after heavy meconium staining of the amniotic fluid, and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.4, P <.001) breaths/minute higher in boys than girls. RR did not differ for infants born after vaginal versus cesarean deliveries. Conclusions: The RR percentiles established from this study allow for a scientifically based use of RR when assessing newborn infants born at term.

N2  - Introduction: Increasing use of panel analyses (epileptic encephalopathies) leads to identification of sequence variants of unknown significance. The pathogenic relevance may only be assessed in the context of the disease course. A female infant carrying a formerly unknown sequence variant in the SCN2A gene in mosaic state showed clinical response to phenytoin. Case Report: A girl displayed after uneventful pregnancy and delivery myoclonic and focal seizures starting from the second day of life. EEG showed burst-suppression pattern. Cranial MRI and screening for inborn disorders of metabolism were normal. The seizures persisted despite application of diverse anti-epileptic drugs (phenobarbital, vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate, folinate, and levetiracetam). Panel analysis for epileptic encephalopathies was initiated. Upon admittance to our hospital (fifth week) the patient displayed seizures ∼10 times per hour. EEGs showed multifocal ETPs, phases of suppression- abortive burst during sleep. Prior to the results of genetic testing, additional AEDs (dexamethasone, zonisamide, vigabatrin) were tested without clinical benefit. With lacosamide, reduction in seizure frequency was achieved. The sequence variant c.2644G > A; p.Gly882Arg in the SCN2A gene was identified in mosaic state in peripheral blood and buccal mucosa. Since it was suggested that neonatal onset of epilepsy correlates with gain-of-function mutations in SCN2A and that sodium channel blockers are often effective, phenytoin treatment was initiated and showed rapid cessation of clinically visible seizures. Conclusion: (1) A mosaic SCN2A sequence variant in a highly conserved amino acid position can lead to a classical neonatal disease course. (2) Knowledge of the underlying genetic mutation allowed the application of specific AEDs.

N2  - Objective: Seizures in neonates are relatively common; they are powerful predictors of long-term cognitive and developmental impairment. There is also a significant concern about current anti-seizure therapies (e.g. phenobarbitone), which can cause brain injury as they have the potential to be neurotoxic. We propose that ganaxolone, a GABAA agonist, will improve electrographic and early signs of seizures, and reduce markers of brain injury, following global fetal asphyxia, whereas treatment with phenobarbitone will not reduce markers of brain injury. Design: We investigated the effects of ganaxolone, or phenobarbitone given at the onset of seizure in term fetal sheep caused by hypoxia ischemia. Method: Hypoxia ischemia was induced via umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) at caesarean delivery in near-term lambs (∼141d gestation). UCO or control lambs were resuscitated using standard resuscitation guidelines. UCO lambs with seizures were treated with either phenobarbitone (20mg/kg i.v. over 30min) or ganaxolone (5mg/kg i.v. over 30min). At 72 hours, lambs were euthanased for brain collection and analysis. Results: At the time of birth, asphyxiated lambs had a pH<7.0 (6.92±0.02) and a base excess >12mmol/L (-14.2±1.1), indicating severe birth asphyxia. Brain histology at 72 hour showed an increase in the number of inflammatory cells (Iba- 1 positive) and cell death (TUNEL positive) in phenobarbitone treated-lambs compared to control lambs. Ganaxolone reduced the number of seizures after UCO. Unlike phenobarbitone, suppression of the EEG, and impaired sleep cycling did not persist with ganaxolone. We have observed a return to normal cycling within 6 hours post-treatment. Conclusion: Phenobarbitone suppresses seizure activity but is associated with the presence of a high incidence of microglial activation and cell death. Ganaxolone, known to have a high margin of safety and lack of tolerance with repeated administration, is proposed to decrease both seizure activity and indices of cerebral inflammation and cell death. Ganaxolone may therefore be a therapy that avoids the side effects and poor efficacy associated with the current recommended treatments.

N2  - This study examined the incidence of adverse prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal experiences amongst children with anxiety disorders, and the relationship to clinical symptomology and functional impairment in treatment-seeking children (N = 107) with a primary anxiety disorder. Anxious children had higher rates of reported maternal prescription medication use during pregnancy, maternal smoking and illness during pregnancy and neonatal complications (including neonatal intensive care and feeding issues) compared with population base rates and non-affected children. Almost one-third had early problems with sleep. Developmental problems were common with more than half having at least one area of delay. More than three quarters of anxious children had a first-degree family member with a psychiatric history. There were several associations between neonatal complications and subsequent clinical symptomology, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depressive comorbidity, anxiety severity and functional impairment. Findings suggest higher rates of perinatal complications in anxious children.

N2  - Background: Malaria in pregnancy is an immense public health problem with at least 50 million pregnant women living in malaria endemic areas. To prevent malaria and its complications in pregnancy the World Health Organization recommends the use of intermittent preventive treatment sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP), the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), and effective case management. In most malaria endemic countries in Africa, 40 % of pregnant women sleep under ITNs. In Cameroon, about 90 % of pregnant women receive the first dose of SP, while 64 % take the complete dose. Following the 2011 mass-campaign of free distribution of ITNs coupled with routine ANC distribution of ITN and adoption of IPTp in Cameroon, little has been done to assess the effectiveness of both interventions outside of Yaoundé, the capital city. This study sought to assess the usage and effectiveness of IPTp-SP and ITNs on malaria in pregnancy. Methods: The research was a cross-sectional hospital-based study that included 410 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in the Buea Health District. Capillary blood samples were collected to check malaria parasite by microscopy and haemoglobin levels by microhaematocrit technique. Results: A prevalence of 13.4 and 41.7 % was detected for malaria and anaemia, respectively. The Overall coverage of ITN was 32.4 % while that of ITPp was 63.2 %. Malaria prevalence was least (7.2 %) amongst women using both IPTp-SP and ITN while those with no intervention had the highest malaria prevalence of 18.6 % (χ2 = 6.188; P = 0.103). Of the women with malaria, 12.73 % were using ITN and had taken at least one dose of SP, 38.18 % had taken at least one dose IPTp only, 10.91 % were using only ITN and 38.18 % were not using any preventive measure. There was a difference in anaemia status within the different intervention groups (χ2 = 8.673; P = 0.034). Pregnant women using both interventions were less associated to malaria (OR = 0.341, 95 % CI = 0.138-0.841) compared to those using only one control method. Conclusion: Repeated doses of SP in combination with ITN use are effective in reducing malaria parasitaemia and improving haemoglobin level of pregnant women.

N2  - The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study-Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) Heart Health Study (HHS) was designed to investigate the relationships between adverse pregnancy outcomes and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The ongoing nuMoM2b-HHS, which started in 2013, is a prospective follow-up of the nuMoM2b cohort, which included 10,038 women recruited between 2010 and 2013 from 8 centers across the United States who were initially observed over the course of their first pregnancies. In this report, we detail the design and study procedures of the nuMoM2b-HHS. Women in the pregnancy cohort who consented to be contacted for participation in future studies were approached at 6-month intervals to ascertain health information and to maintain ongoing contact. Two to 5 years after completion of the pregnancy documented in the nuMoM2b, women in the nuMoM2b-HHS were invited to an in-person study visit. During this visit, they completed psychosocial and medical history questionnaires and had clinical measurements and biological specimens obtained. A subcohort of participants who had objective assessments of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy were asked to repeat this investigation. This unique prospective observational study includes a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort, rich depth of phenotypic information about adverse pregnancy outcomes, and clinical data and biospecimens from early in the index pregnancy onward. Data obtained from this cohort will provide mechanistic and clinical insights into how data on a first pregnancy can provide information about the potential development of subsequent risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

N2  - Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) has been shown to reduce lipid accumulation in liver in mice and rats. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether maternal COS feeding affects hepatic lipid metabolism via influencing the expression of circadian clock genes in piglets. From day (d) 85 of gestation to d 14 of lactation, sixteen pregnant sows were divided into a control group (basal diet without COS supplementation) and a COS group (30 mg COS/kg basal diet). After farrowing, one piglet per litter in each group was selected for the collection of plasma and liver samples on d 0 and d 14 of age, respectively. Interestingly and significantly, we found that maternal COS supplementation promoted plasma and hepatic cholesterol accumulation and up-regulated the mRNA level of negative-regulated element period 1 (Per1), and reduced the abundance of the positive elements, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), and brain muscle Arnt-like 1 (BMAL1) in the suckling piglets on d 14. These alterations may promote the hepatic cholesterol accumulation, which, in turn, activates hepatic bile acid metabolism and attenuates the relative expression levels of lipid metabolism-associated genes in the liver. However, the expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 and the lipid profile in the plasma and liver were not affected by COS supplementation on d 0. Collectively, our results indicate that maternal supplementation with COS postpartum up-regulates cholesterol accumulation in suckling piglets at age d 14, in part, by the regulation of circadian clock genes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Circadian rhythms are endogenous rhythms with periods close to 24 hours. Many physiological and behavioral processes show circadian rhythms that are synchronized to environmental stimuli. Alteration of environmental stimuli or mutations in circadian genes can perturb, or chronodisrupt, circadian rhythms. Although chronodisruption has been linked to poor reproductive and pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, the role of circadian oscillators in the time of day of delivery and gestation length is not fully understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mutations in circadian clock genes increase the risk of preterm birth. METHODS: We compared pregnancy outcomes of pregnant mice of three different circadian genotypes: C57BL/6NJ (wild type [WT]) mice have a 23.7-hr period, hPer2SG mice have a 20.7hr period, and Per1-/-Per2-/- mice that have no circadian rhythm. All mice were maintained on a 12h:12h light dark cycle. Mice were mated for two hours and then singly housed after a post copulatory plug was observed. We used infrared cameras to measure the time (± 1 min) from the appearance of a copulatory plug until the appearance of the first pup. We compared gestation duration and the time of day of delivery among dams for their first two parities. RESULTS: We found that hPer2SG dams had a shorter gestation length during their first parity than WT dams (423.5 ± 7.64 hours, n=4, vs. 475.3 ± 16.05 hours, n=8; P=0.0001). Gestation length of Per1-/-Per2-/- dams was similar to that of WT (478.1 ± 16.97 hours, n=12; P=0.6756). The time of day of delivery during the first parity was significantly clustered near dawn for all genotypes. In the second parity, gestation length of Per1-/-Per2-/-was shorter than that of WT dams (438.4 ±18.65 hours, n=6, vs. 482.1 ± 4.627 hours, n=6; P=0.0460). Notably, half of the Per1-/-Per2-/- dams gave birth 72-96 hours earlier than the WT dams. Per1-/-Per2-/- dams also varied more in the time of day of delivery in their second parity than WT (r=0.427, P=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal that mutations that either shorten circadian period or abolish circadian rhythms shorten gestation length and alter the time of day of delivery. We conclude that the circadian clock plays a role in both the length of gestation and the gating of the time of day of delivery.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Many physiological and behavioral processes show daily rhythms that are generated endogenously and are synchronized to environmental stimuli. Chronotype defines the stable phase relationship between a biological rhythm (e.g., wake-sleep) and an environmental rhythm (e.g., dawn-dusk). Chronodisruption results when biological rhythms are not stably synchronized to daily environmental cues (e.g., jetlag or shift-work). Although studies have shown that genetic and environmental disruptions of circadian rhythms are associated with increased risk for infertility, miscarriage, and preterm birth, little is known about normal changes in chronotype during pregnancy. Here, we investigated the effect of pregnancy on chronotype in both normal and genetically chronodisrupted mice. METHODS: We monitored wheel-running behavior in pregnant mice of three circadian genotypes (C57BL/6NJ or WT, Per1-/-Per2-/-, and hPer2SG) with different chronotypes (WT=normal, Per1-/-Per2-/-=arrhythmic, and hPer2SG=early). All mice were maintained on a 12h:12h light dark cycle. We measured the onset of locomotor activity each day, from the day of appearance of a post-copulatory plug until delivery of pups. RESULTS: Compared to non-pregnant mice, pregnant mice of all three genotypes consistently advanced their daily onset of activity around the fourth day after copulation (dpc4) by 5hrs. Specifically, the phase angle of entrainment, or chronotype, of pregnant mice was 14.64 +/- 2.08 hours, whereas that of non-pregnant mice was 19.38 +/- 0.2502 hours. The advance in activity onset was largest between dpc8 and dpc14, and the onset of activity shifted back to that of nonpregnant dams during the last three to four days of pregnancy in all genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that, regardless of circadian genotype, female mice advance their daily onset of locomotor activity during the early stages of pregnancy.

N2  - Purpose: Poor sleep quality during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Despite its routine use as a sleep quality assessment scale among men and non-pregnant women, the psychometric properties of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) have not been assessed among US pregnant women. We sought to evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the PSQI among 1488 pregnant women. Methods: A structured interview was used to collect information about demographics and sleep characteristics in early pregnancy. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were used to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Consistency indices, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA), correlations, and logistic regression procedures were used. Results: The reliability coefficient, Cronbach’s alpha for the PSQI items was 0.74. Results of the EFA showed that a rotated factor solution for the PSQI contained two factors with eigenvalues >1.0 accounting for 52.8 % of the variance. The PSQI was significantly positively correlated with the PHQ-9 (rs = 0.48) and DASS-21 (rs = 0.42) total scores. Poor sleepers (PSQI global score >5) had increased odds of experiencing depression (OR = 6.47; 95 % CI = 4.56–9.18), anxiety (OR = 3.59; 95 % CI = 2.45–5.26), and stress (OR = 4.37; 95 % CI = 2.88–6.65) demonstrating evidence of good construct validity. CFA results corroborated the two-factor structure finding from the EFA and yielded reassuring measures indicating goodness of fit (comparative fit index = 0.975) and accuracy (root mean square error of approximation = 0.035). Conclusions: The PSQI has good construct validity and reliability for assessing sleep quality among pregnant women.

N2  - Purpose: Sleep disturbances such as insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, restless legs syndrome, habitual snoring, and excessive daytime sleepiness are frequent during pregnancy, and these have been linked to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed in high-risk Indian pregnant women. We used modified Berlin questionnaire (MBQ), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group 2011 criteria, and Epworth sleepiness scale to diagnose various sleep disorders, such as symptomatic OSA, poor sleep quality and insomnia, RLS, and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively, in successive trimesters of pregnancy. Outcome variables of interest were development of gestational hypertension (GH), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and cesarean delivery (CS); the Apgar scores; and low birth weight (LBW). The relationship between sleep disorders and outcomes was explored using logistic regression analysis. Results: Outcome data were obtained in 209 deliveries. As compared to nonsnorers, women who reported snoring once, twice, and thrice or more had odds ratios for developing GH—4.0 (95 % CI 1.3–11.9), 1.5 (95 % CI 0.5–4.5), and 2.9 (95 % CI 1.0–8.2) and for undergoing CS—5.3 (95 % CI 1.7–16.3), 4.9 (95 % CI 1.8–13.1), and 5.1 (95 % CI 1.9–14.9), respectively. Pregnant women who were persistently positive on MBQ had increased odds for GH and CS. Conclusions: Snoring and high-risk MBQ in pregnant women are strong risk factors for GH and CS. In view of the significant morbidity and health care costs, simple screening of pregnant women with questionnaires such as MBQ may have clinical utility.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Sleep disruption in pregnancy is linked to adverse outcomes. Fetal movement peaks in late evening and maternal perception of movement is increased in supine position. Women with anterior placentas more frequently report decreased fetal movement. We sought to evaluate if anterior placentation resulted in less disruption of maternal sleep. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort using overnight Watch-PAT200® to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and record sleep parameters. Women analyzed were at 32-35 6/7 weeks gestation, noted to have an anterior or posterior placenta and delivered at Forsyth Medical Center. Medical and obstetric data were abstracted. The hypothesis that anterior placentation resulted in less sleep disruption was tested using chi square to evaluate dichotomous variables with Yates correction when applicable. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate continuous variables. RESULTS: 68 participants had singleton gestations, complete sleep studies and ultrasound data. Of those, 34 had anterior and 31 had posterior placentation. Demographics were similar between groups. There was no difference in gestational hypertension,preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, gestational age at or mode of delivery, postpartum hemorrhage or infant weight. There was an increased risk of fetal growth restriction in pregnancies with an anterior placenta (p=0.04). Sleep parameters, sleep related symptoms and OSA status were not different between groups CONCLUSIONS: Placental location did not impact maternal sleep parameters or perception of fatigue in the third trimester. Fetal growth restriction was increased in mothers with anterior placentas, however the study was not designed to evaluate this relationship and further research is needed. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction: Reducing the quality of sleep is one of the most common complaints during pregnancy that can create appropriate field for many mental disorders in this period. Inappropriate sleep quality is related with negative consequences on the mental health in pregnant women. This study was performed with aim to predict the sleep quality based on stress, depression and anxiety with role of mediator cognitive emotion regulation strategies in pregnant women. Methods: This descriptive study was done on 302 pregnant women referred to health centers in Kermanshah city in 2015. To evaluate the relationship between measured variables in suggested conceptual model, structural equations pattern was used. The subjects as self-assessment completed Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire (PSQI), Granfeski cognitive emotion regulation strategies questionnaire and depression, anxiety and stress questionnaire (DASS-21). Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 22) and AMOS 21, and Pearson correlation coefficient, regression coefficient, path analysis. PResults: significant relationship was observed between sleep quality and mental health in pregnant women through cognitive emotion regulation strategies, so that, use of negative emotion regulation strategies such as thought rumination and disaster concept increases the risk of developing depression and anxiety and reduced sleep quality (P<0.05) Conclusion: Poor mental health and maladaptive cognition emotion regulation strategies can reduce sleep quality in pregnant women.

N2  - Aims: To investigate whether sleep quality and sleep duration in pregnant women with GDM is associated with their glycaemic control. Methods: Sixty-five pregnant women with GDM were recruited from Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust at 30-32 weeks of gestation. Glycaemic control was assessed objectively using 6 days of blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression (adjusted for booking body mass index and age) was performed to explore the association between total PSQI score, self-reported sleep duration and CGM measures. Pregnancy glucose target range was 3.5-7.8 mmol/l. Results: A higher PSQI score (indicating poorer sleep quality) was associated with a lower proportion of time within glucose target [beta -0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.22 to -0.15]; a greater area under the curve (AUC) above target (beta 0.01; 95% CI 0.002-0.017); a higher variability in glucose levels (beta 0.02; 95% CI 0.004-0.04); a higher average glucose (beta 0.04; 95% CI 0.007-0.079); and a greater number of glucose excursions (beta 0.46; 95% CI 0.066-0.852). Moreover, shorter sleep duration was associated with a lower proportion of time within glucose target (beta -1.33; 95% CI -0.086 to -2.58); a higher AUC above target (beta 0.02; 95% CI 0.033 to -0.002); and a higher glucose variability (beta 0.05; 95% CI 0.097-0.008). Conclusions: Poor sleep quality and short sleep duration may be an important factor in achieving optimum glycaemic control in pregnant women with GDM.

N2  - Objectives: To examine the associations of Intimate partner violence (IPV) with stress-related sleep disturbance (measured using the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test [FIRST]) and poor sleep quality (measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) during early pregnancy. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 634 pregnant Peruvian women. In-person interviews were conducted in early pregnancy to collect information regarding IPV history, and sleep traits. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated using logistic regression procedures. Results: Lifetime IPV was associated with a 1.54-fold increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (95% CI: 1.08-2.17) and a 1.93-fold increased odds of poor sleep quality (95% CI: 1.33-2.81). Compared with women experiencing no IPV during lifetime, the aOR (95% CI) for stress-related sleep disturbance associated with each type of IPV were: physical abuse only 1.24 (95% CI: 0.84-1.83), sexual abuse only 3.44 (95%CI: 1.07-11.05), and physical and sexual abuse 2.51 (95% CI: 1.27-4.96). The corresponding aORs (95% CI) for poor sleep quality were: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.13-2.61), 2.82 (95% CI: 0.99-8.03), and 2.50 (95% CI: 1.30-4.81), respectively. Women reporting any IPV in the year prior to pregnancy had increased odds of stress-related sleep disturbance (aOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.17-3.67) and poor sleep quality (aOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.30-3.97) during pregnancy. Conclusion: Lifetime and prevalent IPV exposures are associated with stress-related sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality during pregnancy. Our findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be important mechanisms that underlie the lasting adverse effects of IPV on maternal and perinatal health.

N2  - The present study aimed to analyze the effects of sleep restriction (SR) during pregnancy in rats. The following three groups were studied: home cage (HC pregnant females remained in their home cage), Sham (females were placed in tanks similar to the SR group but with sawdust) and SR (females were submitted to the multiple platform method for 20 h per day from gestational days (GD) 14 to 20). Plasma corticosterone after 6 days of SR was not different among the groups. However, the relative adrenal weight was higher in the SR group compared with the HC group, which suggests possible stress impact. SR during pregnancy reduces the body weight of the female but no changes in liver glycogen, cholesterol and triglycerides, and muscle glycogen were detected. On GD 20, the fetuses of the females submitted to SR exhibited increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, which indicates that sleep restriction of mothers during the final week of gestation may affect neuronal growth factors in a fetal brain structure, in which active neurogenesis occurs during the deprivation period. However, no changes in the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum of the fetuses were detected. SR females showed no major change in the maternal behavior, and the pups' preference for the mother's odor on postpartum day (PPD) 7 was not altered. On GD 20, the SR females exhibited increased plasma prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin (OT) compared with the HC and Sham groups. The negative outcomes of sleep restriction during delivery could be related, in part, to this hormonal imbalance. Sleep restriction during pregnancy induces different changes compared with the changes described in males and affects both the mother and offspring.

N2  - It is increasingly well recognised that sleep duration and sleep quality are factors involved in glucose homeostasis. Recent technology, using continuous glucose monitoring combined with continuous actigraphy, allows us to explore the relationship between glucose and sleep in real-time, in a free-living rather than lab-based situation. This intensive longitudinal data allows us unprecedented insight into how sleep and glucose interact. Glucose control is particularly important in the context of pregnancy, where tight glucose control is associated with a significantly better outcome for mother and baby. Despite available treatments, this is often not achieved and women are particularly cautious about taking drugs during pregnancy. Understanding the relationship between sleep and glucose may enable us to develop novel lifestyle based interventions to optimise glucose control. I will present data from our recent studies of sleep in pregnant women with diabetes.

N2  - Introduction Pregnancy is characterized by important changes in sleep and some of them (as insomnia) predict negative outcomes, like depression, through all the perinatal period. There are few Portuguese adapted and validated instruments assessing insomnia in pregnancy. Objective To validate the Insomnia Assessment Scale in a sample of Portuguese pregnant women. Methods 419 pregnant women (mean age: 32.51±4.759; weeks of gestation: 17.32±4.803) answered the Insomnia Assessment Scale (IAS), constructed according to the DSM-V and the ICSD-3 criteria and presenting fourteen items: three evaluating insomnia symptoms (1 to 3); one assessing if sleep difficulties were present although there were adequate conditions to sleep (item 4); one assessing if sleep difficulties occurred three times/week (item 5); one evaluating if sleep was not restorative (item 6); three assessing daily impairment associated to insomnia symptoms (7 to 9); two assessing the use of prescribed and/or homemade medication (10 and 11); three excluding that sleep difficulties were not due to another sleep disorder, substance use, a physical condition or a mental disorder) (12 to 14). Results The IAS Kuder-Richardson alpha was very good (α=0.85) and none of the items increased the alpha if removed. A principal component analysis revealed a three factors solution, explaining a variance/EV of 63,74%: F1/Insomnia symptoms (items 1 to 6) (EV 36.02%; α=0.81); F2/Daily impairment associated to insomnia symptoms (items 7 to 9) (EV 18.67%; α=0.79); F3/Differential diagnosis (items 12 to 14) (EV 8.38%; α=0.81). Conclusions The IAS adapted for Portuguese pregnant women presented good reliability and validity.

N2  - Introduction Mindfulness based programs during pregnancy (some including self-compassion components) increase self-compassion, mindfulness and maternal self-efficacy, and reduce anxiety, stress and psychological distress in pregnant women. According to our knowledge, there are no studies about the association between self-compassion and sleep outcomes in pregnancy. Objective To explore differences in self-compassion, between three sleep groups, in a sample of Portuguese pregnant women. Methods Four hundred and nineteen pregnant women (mean age: 32.51±4.759; weeks of gestation: 17.32±4.803) completed the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS, Bento et al., 2015), presenting six dimensions (self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness and over-identification) and the Insomnia Assessment Scale (Marques et al., 2015). Three sleep groups were formed: good sleepers (no insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment); insomnia symptoms groups (one/more insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment); insomniacs (one/more insomnia symptoms; daily associated impairment). Results There were significant differences in the total SCS, self-judgment, isolation and over-identification scores, between sleep groups [respectively, F (2,396) = 7,926, P≤0,001; F (2,409) = 19,155, P≤0,001; F (2,410) = 13,016, P≤0,001; F (2,412) = 11,258, P≤0,001]. Self-judgement, isolation and over-identification scores of good sleepers and insomnia symptoms group were higher than of insomniacs. Total SCS score of good sleepers was higher than of insomniacs and the same score of symptoms of insomnia group was also higher than of insomniacs. Conclusions Results seem to show the importance of developing self-compassion to improve sleep in pregnancy or reduce the impact of insomnia symptoms (common at pregnancy).

N2  - Introduction The impact of mindfulness in improving insomnia symptoms is documented in different samples (e.g. anxiety disorders; insomnia samples) and mindfulness based programs for pregnancy refer the association between mindfulness development and the reduction of insomnia symptoms/improvement of sleep. Objective To explore differences in the Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire-10 (FMQ-10; Azevedo et at. 2015), between sleep groups, in Portuguese pregnant women. Methods Four hundred and nineteen pregnant women (mean age: 32.51±4.759; weeks of gestation: 17.32±4.803) answered the Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire-10 and the Insomnia Assessment Scale (IAS, Marques et al., 2015). Three sleep groups were created considering all the IAS items: good sleepers (no insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment); insomnia symptoms groups (one/more insomnia symptoms; no associated daily impairment; exclusion of other conditions/disorders explaining the symptoms); insomniacs (one/more insomnia symptoms; one/more daily associated impairment; exclusion of other conditions/ disorders explaining the symptoms). Results There were significant differences in the total FMQ-10 score, the F1/Nonjudging of inner experience and the F2/acting with awareness, between sleep groups [respectively, F (2.402) = 6,933; P = 0.001; F (2.406) = 10.243; P = 0.001; F (2.406) = 37.431; P = 0.002]. Tukey tests indicated that the mean total FMQ-10 and F1/Nonjudging of inner experience scores of good sleepers and insomnia symptoms group were significantly higher than of the insomniacs. The mean value of F2/acting with awareness in the good sleepers was significantly higher than of the insomniacs. Conclusions It seems important to develop mindfulness to improve sleep in pregnancy or reduce the impact of insomnia symptoms (common at pregnancy).

N2  - Introduction: Sleeping problems and fatigue in pregnancy are often accepted as a normal part of pregnancy; however, these conditions can be linked to serious consequences for both the mother and child. Despite established links between sleeping disturbance and a wide range of pregnancy complications, little is known about the health-care utilisation of women experiencing sleeping problems and fatigue. This study addresses the existing gap in the literature by examining cross-sectional data to identify health service utilisation patterns of pregnant women experiencing sleeping problems and/or tiredness or fatigue. Methods: In 2010, a sub-study of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health was conducted as a cross-sectional survey of 2445 women who had recently given birth. Associations between reported symptoms of sleeplessness and/or tiredness or fatigue and health service utilisation were determined using logistic regression analysis. Results: During their pregnancy, 15.2 % of women experienced sleeping problems while 35.4 % experienced tiredness or fatigue. Women most commonly consulted with an obstetrician (n = 96) or a general practitioner (GP) (n = 74) for their tiredness or fatigue rather than a midwife (n = 56). A substantial number of women sought help from a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioner for sleeping problems (33 %) or tiredness/fatigue (28 %). Discussion: Sleeping problems and/or tiredness or fatigue is reported by a reasonable percentage of pregnant women, and women obtain assistance from conventional and CAM practitioners for their symptoms, but not all seek help. Given the serious implications of untreated sleep- and fatigue-related symptoms for mother and baby, this area of research deserves and requires more attention.

N2  - Introduction Depressive symptoms in pregnancy are risk factors for postpartum depression and associated to adverse child outcomes (Glover, 2014). Depressive symptoms decreases after participation in mindfulness and self-compassion based interventions for pregnant women (e.g. Goodman et al., 2014). However, apart from intervention trials, there are not studies on the relationship between mindfulness, self-compassion and depressive symptoms in pregnancy (Zoeterman, 2014). Objective To explore the association between mindfulness, selfcompassion and depressive symptoms in pregnant women. Methods Four hundred and twenty-seven pregnant women (mean age: 32.56±4.785 years) in their second trimester of pregnancy completed a set of self-report questionnaires validated for pregnancy: Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire-10 ([FMQ-10]; Azevedo et al., 2015; to evaluate Nonjudging of experience/NJ, acting with awareness (AA) and observing and describing (OD), Self-Compassion Scale ([SCS]; Bento et al., 2015; to evaluate self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity [CH], isolation, mindfulness and over-identification [OD]) and Postpartum Depression Screening Scale-24 (PDSS-24; Pereira et al., 2013). Only variables significantly correlated with the outcomes were entered in the multiple regression models. Results FMQ-10 and SCS Total scores were both significant predictors of PDSS-24 (B = -0.294,-0.272). Derealization and failure predictors were NJ and Isolation (B = -0.234; 0.384); Suicidal ideation predictor was NJ, OD and isolation (B = -0.152;-0.115; 0.334); concentration difficulties and anxiety predictors were isolation and CH (B = 0.296;-0.201); Sleep difficulties predictors were AA and isolation (B = -0.199; 0.248) (all P < 0.05). Conclusions Mindfulness and self-Ccompassion dimensions, particularly nonjudging of experience, acting with awareness, observing and describing are protective correlates of antenatal depressive symptoms. Isolation is a correlate of PD in pregnancy.

N2  - Aims: To systematically review the evidence for an association between sleep disruption in the postnatal period, weight retention (WR) and Type 2 diabetes. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases were searched for studies published from 1946 to 2015. Search results were manually scrutinised using a priori defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included articles were also screened through forward and backward citation for relevant studies. Results: A total of 10 studies were included. The studies used a variety of designs, various subjective measures of sleep, assessed across a range of different time points postpartum, and using different cut-off points for what was considered 'substantial' WR. Eight studies examined the relation between sleep and postpartum WR; four found a significant association while the rest found no evidence of an association. Two studies investigated the relation between sleep and body mass index; one found a positive linear association but not the other. Two studies have explored the relationship between sleep and Type 2 diabetes; one found no significant association between sleep duration and Type 2 diabetes whereas the other study found an association between poor sleep quality and impaired glucose tolerance only in women who had gestational diabetes in the preceding pregnancy. Conclusions: Studies published to date provide equivocal and inconsistent results about the association between sleep disruption, postpartum WR and Type 2 diabetes. This review indicates the need for more robust research in this area using, in particular, more consistent prospective designs, with better quantification of WR and validated instruments for the assessment of sleep.

N2  - Aims: It is unclear whether SSD is a risk factor for developing diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes, GDM). The aim of the present study was to review the available evidence for an association between SSD and GDM using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Embase and MEDLINE were searched for studies published prior to 2014 that included regression models assessing the relationship between SSD and GDM. Two independent reviewers (AAA and NAA) manually screened the search results for any relevant studies. Random effects models were used to calculate the combined odds of GDM, together with the I2 statistic to assess the level of heterogeneity amongst studies included in the models. Results: A total of n = 79 studies were found that had examined the relationship between sleep and various pregnancy outcomes. Ten studies included SSD as an exposure and three of these explored the relationship between SSD and GDM. All three studies were undertaken in the USA using prospective longitudinal designs and multivariable analyses. GDM was diagnosed using an oral glucose tolerance test whilst sleep duration was assessed using subjective questionnaires across a range of different gestational ages. Meta-analyses of these studies indicated that SSD (< 7 h/ night) was associated with 2.39 the odds of GDM (95% CI 1.48- 3.86; p < 0.001; I2 = 0.0%; p = 0.803), the low level of heterogeneity reflecting similarities in the three studies' designs. Conclusions: The literature contains evidence that SSD is associated with an increased risk of developing GDM, though the volume, quality and consistency of published studies indicate the need for more research in this area.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy is associated with maternal metabolic adaptations (increased cholesterol and triglycerides) that are essential for the growth of the fetus. In mammals, physiological and behavioral changes are driven via biological clocks entrained by the light-dark/restactivity cycles that define feeding time and body temperature. A number of oscillators are present in the peripheral organs that are synchronized by cues from the suprachiasmatic nucleus and impact metabolic pathways. We hypothesize that maternal metabolic adaptations fluctuate during the light dark cycle (LDC) and are differentially regulated in early and late pregnancy. METHODS: C57BL6 mice were sacrificed in early pregnancy (day 7 post-coitum (pcm)) and in later in pregnancy (day 14pcm) at 4-hour intervals over a 24-hour LDC. Mice collected on day 2pcm were used as controls. Metabolic and clock gene pathways were assessed. One-way ANOVA was performed to establish significant changes in LDC fluctuation at each stage of pregnancy and also at the same time-points at different stages of pregnancy (p<0.05). RESULTS: We observed that in late pregnancy, triglycerides (TG) were constantly raised and did not fluctuate like on day 2 and day 7. We demonstrated a significant increase of hepatic TG biosynthesis pathways on day 7 of pregnancy with a partial 'switch off' of these genes on day 14 of pregnancy and this was consistent with the free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the liver. However, day 14 of pregnancy was characterized by significantly increased levels of FA oxidation and transport pathways in the muscle, especially in the dark phase of the 24-hour cycle. This concurred with increased levels of FFA availability in the dark phase and it synchronized with peak gene expression patterns of the FA transport pathways in placenta and also FFA levels in the fetal liver. Interestingly, our data imply that liver metabolic actions in pregnancy are mediated by the Rev-erb-α clock gene, whereas muscle metabolic activity is mediated by Rev-erb-β. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that maintenance of pregnancy and fetus development are facilitated by a liver to muscle gestational switch between early and late pregnancy.

METHODS: This is a descriptive study of pregnant obese women referred to Wake Forest University Perinatology. BMI was assessed at <20 weeks, delivery, and 6 weeks postpartum. OSA screen, ASA status, delivery mode, delivery indication, and postpartum wound healing were tracked. Patients were subsequently stratified into groups by ASA status, OSA screen, gestational weight gain categories (eg, inadequate, adequate, and excessive by IOM guidelines). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used as appropriate to assess impact of factors on outcomes. RESULTS: 142 obese pregnant women had complete data on ASA status, weight gain, and delivery outcome. Mean ASA score was 2.29. BMI, gestational age, gravity, parity, DM, and HTN were not different across groups. 51 were assessed for OSA. 7/51 (14%) patients screened positive for OSA. 107/142 (75%) did not adhere to IOM gestational weight gain guidelines, of which 82/142 (58%) gained excess weight. 29/142 (20%) had indicated C-sections. 47/142 (33%) had indicated IOLs. Excess weight gain was associated with higher ASA status immediately prior to delivery (p=0.02). Odds of indicated delivery increased with escalating ASA category (OR 3.4, CI 1.6-6.9). Higher ASA status conferred higher odds of indicated delivery (OR 3.4, CI 1.6-6.9), gestational HTN (GHTN) (OR 5.4 CI 1.2-20.4), or preeclampsia (OR=7.1 CI 1.4-38.0). Intake BMI was associated with delivering by cesarean (p=0.02); this persisted in a regression model controlling for parity, excess weight gain and delivery BMI. Screening OSA+ was associated with wound dehiscence postpartum (7/7 [100%] OSA+ vs. 2/44 [5%] OSA-; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Obese women had more adverse outcomes when gaining excess weight. As a result of poorer health status, these women had higher ASA categorization at delivery. These factors lead to higher rates of indicated delivery, GHTN, and preeclampsia. Women screening positive for OSA had poorer wound healing, potentially due to chronic intermittent hypoxia. As increased weight contributes to poorer ASA category and increased OSA risk, proper weight management during pregnancy could improve pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - This investigation was conducted to examine circadian and seasonal rhythms of heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) by means of hour-by-hour recordings over 24h in a large population of non-lactating Holstein-Friesian pregnant cows [N=56, summer (June-July); N=61, winter (November-December)]. Data were collected during a 5-day period from each animal. Besides parameters of cardiac autonomic function [the high-frequency (HF) component of HRV and the ratio between the low-frequency (LF) and the HF components (LF/HF ratio)], the RR triangular index and Lmax were calculated. A clear circadian profile was observed for every parameter in summer. Heart rate elevated gradually with the course of the day from 7:00 to 17:00 o'clock and then slightly decreased from 18:00 to 6:00. Sympathovagal balance shifted towards sympathetic dominance during the daytime (increased LF/HF ratio), whereas parasympathetic activity was predominant during the night (increased HF). Lmax reflected a chaotic behavior of heart rate fluctuations during the afternoon in summer. Decreased values of RR triangular index indicated a sensitive period for cows between 14:00 and 16:00 o'clock in summer. During winter, except for the RR triangular (RRtri) index reflecting a high overall variability in R-R intervals between 12:00 and 23:00 o'clock, heart rate and HRV showed no periodicity over the 24-h period. The results suggest an impaired cardiac autonomic function during daytime in summer. HF, Lmax and RRtri index showed seasonal differences for both daytime and nighttime. Heart rate was higher in summer than in winter during the daytime, whereas the LF/HF ratio was higher in winter during the nighttime. Circadian and seasonal rhythms of cardiovascular function are presumably related to the differing temperature, and animal activity associated with summer and winter. As all of the investigated parameters are commonly used in bovine HRV research, these findings have practical implications for behavioral, physiological and welfare studies on dairy cattle.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: A maternal high fat (HF) diet and obesity during pregnancy influence the offspring's postnatal health. In our mouse model of obesity, maternal HF feeding alters blood pressure and heart size in the offspring. MicroRNAs are implicated in cardiac differentiation and remodelling and affect the susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and ischemic heart disease. We investigated whether the maternal HF diet alters miRNA expression within the fetal heart which may underlie the postnatal cardiovascular phenotype. METHODS: Female C57/BL6J mice were fed either a HF (45% kcal fat, n=4) or control chow (C, 7% kcal fat, n=4) diet 6 weeks prior to conception and throughout pregnancy. On day 16 of pregnancy dams were killed, fetuses collected and the fetal hearts dissected, snap frozen and stored at -80C. MicroRNA expression was measured using small RNA sequencing (Illumina miRNA-Seq, Expression Analysis, USA). Differential expression analysis identified both up and down-regulated miRNAs (p<0.05) and pathway analysis was carried out using DIANA miRPath. RESULTS: Thirty-three miRNAs were expressed differentially between both groups, including upregulation in HF of miR-470-5p, miR-299-3p, miR-574-5p and downregulation in HF of miR-29a-5p, miR-129-1-3p and miR-23a-5p. MicroRNA-regulated pathways potentially upregulated by a maternal HF diet include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, circadian rhythm and mTOR signalling. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified miRNAs that alter biological pathways linked to cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies in response to maternal HF feeding. This suggests that HF exposure during fetal development could alter the expression of miRNAs in the heart that may underlie the associated cardiovascular dysfunction in postnatal life.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Placental lesions mirrors the mechanisms leading to preterm delivery. Amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) indices of background activity and sleep cycling patterns in premature infants were shown to correlate with long term outcome. The objective of our study is to determine the association between pregnancy complications, placental lesions, and aEEG patterns of premature infants. METHODS: This prospective study included all premature neonates who were delivered <28 weeks of gestation, had an aEEG, and their placentas were available for histologic examination (n=33). aEEG data was assessed for percentage of depressed daily activity in the first 3 days of life and presence of sleep cycling. The associations of placental histology with clinical findings and aEEG activity were explored using uni and multivariable models. RESULTS: The survival rate was 58% (21/33). Amniotic fluid infection, preterm PROM or chorioamnionitis and placental lesions consistant with fetal amniotic infection or maternal under perfusion (MUP) (P < 0.05). Fetal vascular thrombo-occlusive lesions of inflammatory type were negatively associated with neonatal sleep cycling during the 2nd day of life (OR: 0.15, 95%CI: 0.026-0.868) and negatively associated with depressed cerebral activity during the 1st/2nd days of life (OR: 0.06; 0.14, 95%CI: 0.01-0.4; 0.02-0.73, respectively). MUP was positively associated with depressed cerebral activity during the first 3 days of life (P= 0.014).after adjustment for gestational age at delivery, fetal response to amniotic fluid infection was associated with absence of sleep cycling pattern during the 1st day of life (OR: 7.6, 95% CI: 1.2-48), CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal neonatal aEEG patterns are associated with placental lesions consistent with amniotic fluid infection of fetal type and with MUP, but not with thrombo-oclusive vascular disease of inflammatory type. Our findings highlight the association between the prenatal mechanisms leading to preterm parturition and depressed cerebral function early after birth which eventually put premature infants at risk of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.

N2  - This issue exemplifies the types of articles that JABFM publishes to advance family medicine. We have articles on the implications of health system organizational structures. Three of these are international articles at the level of the national health system (1 from China) and systematic local health interventions (1 from Canada and 1 from Netherlands). Inside the United States, where there are more family physicians, there is less obesity, and designation as a Patient Centered Medical Home is related to increased rates of colorectal cancer screening. Review articles on common clinical topics discuss treatments that are changing (acne in pregnancy) or lack consensus (distal radial fractures). We have articles on making life easier in the office, such as for predicting Vitamin D levels, osteoporosis, and prediabetes in normal weight adults. There are articles to raise awareness of the "newest" testing or treatments, that is, auditory brainstem implants. "Reminder" articles highlight known entities that need to be reinforced to prevent over-/underdiagnosis or treatment, for example, "cotton fever." Another article discusses the increased risk for postoperative complications with sleep apnea. We also provide "thought" pieces, in this case about the terminology we are using to extend our concept of patient-centered medical homes.

N2  - Introduction Perinatal mental illness is one of the most frequent complications of pregnancy and the postpartum period. During the puerperium, the risk of developing a mental disease, such as a psychotic episode, is higher than in any other time in a woman's life. Objectives The two main objectives are to describe a case series of 4 patients diagnosed with pospartum psychosis, and to synthesize the most important facets of this mental illness based on a literature review. Aims The aim is to provide an overview of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of postpartum psychosis. Methods The four clinical cases are presented by describing the similar as opposed to the differential aspects between all patients, using the information obtained through successive clinical interviews and the case file. Research was accomplished through Clinical Key and PubMed (2005-2015) using the keywords: postpartum psychosis. Results In all four cases, the patients developed symptoms of sleep disturbance, mood fluctuation, altered thinking process with delusions or obsessions, and bizarre behaviours. This occurred within the first four weeks after labour, which was in all cases an obstrutced labour. The data suggests that postpartum psychosis is a presentation of bipolar disorder. Clinical aspects and risk factors related to this perinatal complication all coincide with the cases presented. Conclusions Postpartum psychosis is a rare presentation of perinatal mental illness. However, it presents itself, as a psychiatric emergency, and the early and correct assessment are crucial to reset the development of the mother-child bond.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Maternal depression has been associated with excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems, but the specificity of maternal depression, as compared with maternal anxiety remains unclear and manifest disorders prior to pregnancy have been widely neglected. In this prospective longitudinal study, the specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to, during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems were investigated in the context of maternal parity.
METHODS: In the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 primiparous and multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16 months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI-V) to assess DSM-IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n = 286 mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby-DIPS).
RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed syndrome-specific risk constellations for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy: Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first-time mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity.
CONCLUSIONS: Primiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an escalation of mother-infant interactions. The relation between maternal depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice.

N2  - INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Diabetic Neuropathy developing usually due to Diabetes Mellitus type 1 is responsible for retrograde ejaculation (RE) in 5-18% of cases. Medical treatment of RE is based either on increasing the sympathetic tone of the bladder or on decreasing the parasympathetic activity but some side effects of the drugs like dizziness, sleep disturbances, weakness, restlessness, dry mouth, or nausea should be considered. Moreover, many patients do not respond to such therapy. We aimed to analyze long term outcome of endourethral injection of volume-forming material (VFM) of collagen type 2 into bladder neck submucosa in patients with RE secondary to diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1). MATERIAL & METHODS: Twenty four patients with complete retrograde ejaculation refractory to imipramine and diabetes mellitus type 1 were included in the study. Patients were randomized according to a computer generated random sequence with a 1:1 ratio in two treatment groups, namely group A (endourethral collage type 2 injection) and group B (endourethral saline water injection). New technique includes an endoscopic injection of VFM such as collagen (Correcting MIT®, Ltd. Minimally invasive technologies, Russia, Moscow) into bladder neck submucosa. Primary endpoint of the study was the improvement of semen antegrade volume, antegrade count, antegrade total motility and antegrade progressive motility. Secondary endpoints were the improvement of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients completed the study. Diabetes mellitus duration was 9 ± 2.6 years in all cohort. Of the 24 patients randomized, 12 and 11 subjects in the group A and in the group B, respectively, completed the study protocol. The procedure lasted for 11 ± 7 min in group A and 12 ± 6.5 in group B while the mean of Collagen volume was 9± 4 ml in group A and saline water was 10.0 ± 5 ml in group B (both p-value > 0.05). Physiological direction of the ejaculation was restored in 11 of 12 patients in group A (91.6%) while in 0 of 12 patients of group B (0%) (p<0.05). In the group A, significant differences from baseline to 12-months were observed relative to antegrade volume (mean difference: 0.71, P < 0.05), antegrade count (mean difference: 45.6, p<0.05), antegrade total motility (mean difference: 15.4, p<0.05) and antegrade progressive motility (mean difference: 8.4, p<0.05). In the group A we observed significant differences in terms State-Trait Anxiety Inventory(mean difference: -20.5, p<0.05) and Beck Depression Inventory (mean difference: -8.4, p<0.05) (Table 2) with significant differences compared to group B. We did not observed significant difference in terms of IIEF-5. There were no complications such as bleeding nor urethritis nor acute urine retention related to the procedure. The patients were not treated with additional medications after the endoscopic procedure. Spontaneous pregnancy occurred in two cases out of 12 of patients in group A at the of the study (11.54%) while in 0 out of 11 in group B (p=0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Correction of RE in type 1 Diabetes Mellitus patients could be achieved with endourethral injection of collagen type 2.

N2  - Background: Generalised itching is one of the most common dermatological symptoms in pregnant women. Having itchy skin during pregnancy may be very frustrating and can lead to poor sleep, exhaustion and impaired quality of life. There is a need for a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating itching in pregnancy. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating generalised itching (not caused by systemic diseases or skin lesions) in pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 January 2016) and the reference list of the one identified study. Selection criteria: All published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for itching in pregnancy. Quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs, RCTs using a cross-over design, and studies reported in abstract form (without full text) were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the one trial report that was identified from the search strategy and this was subsequently excluded. Main results: There are no included studies as we did not identify any relevant trials. Authors' conclusions: Generalised itching (not caused by systemic disease or skin lesions) is quite a common symptom in pregnancy. However, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide practice in terms of the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for treating this condition. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of topical and systemic pharmacological interventions as well as any adverse effects of the interventions. Such studies should consider important outcomes such as relief of itching, women's satisfaction, sleep disturbance, and adverse effects.

N2  - Background: Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is a serious public health problem as it can affect the health of pregnant women and newborns. However, it is not well studied whether sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy has similar effects on emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring, and if so, the potential cellular mechanisms also remain poorly understood. Methods: In the present study, the pregnant rats were subjected to sleep deprivation for 6 h per day by gentle handling during the first (gestational days 1-7), second (gestational days 8-14) and third trimester (gestational days 15-21) of pregnancy, respectively. The emotional and cognitive functions as well as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were tested in the offspring rats (postnatal days 42-56). Results: The offspring displayed impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, and increased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Quantification of BrdU-positive cells revealed that adult hippocampal neurogenesis was significantly reduced compared to control. Electrophysiological recording showed that maternal sleep deprivation impaired hippocampal CA1 LTP and reduced basal synaptic transmission, as reflected by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that maternal sleep deprivation at different stages of pregnancy disrupts the emotional and cognitive functions of the offspring that might be attributable to the suppression of hippocampal LTP and basal synaptic transmission.

N2  - Mechanistic pathways linking maternal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) status with gestational length are poorly delineated. This study examined whether inflammation and sleep quality serve as mediators, focusing on the antiinflammatory ω-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n3) and proinflammatory ω-6 arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n6). Pregnant women (n = 135) provided a blood sample and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at 20-27 weeks gestation. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid levels were determined by gas chromatography and serum inflammatory markers [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, and C-reactive protein] by electrochemiluminescence using high sensitivity kits. Both higher serum IL-8 (95% CI = 0.10,3.84) and poor sleep (95% CI = 0.03,0.28) served as significant mediators linking lower DHA:AA ratios with shorter gestation. Further, a serial mediation model moving from the DHA:AA ratio→sleep→IL-8→length of gestation was statistically significant (95% CI = 0.02, 0.79). These relationships remained after adjusting for depressive symptoms, age, BMI, income, race, and smoking. No interactions with race were observed in relation to length of gestation as a continuous variable. However, a significant interaction between race and the DHA:AA ratio in predicting preterm birth was observed (p = 0.049); among African Americans only, odds of preterm birth decreased as DHA:AA increased (p = 0.048). These data support a role for both inflammatory pathways and sleep quality in linking less optimal RBC PUFA status with shorter gestation in African American and European American women and suggest that African-Americans have greater risk for preterm birth in the context of a low DHA:AA ratio.

N2  - The purpose of this descriptive study was to examine the associations of sleep hygiene and actigraphy measures of sleep with self-reported sleep quality in 197 pregnant women in northern Taiwan. Third-trimester pregnant women completed the Sleep Hygiene Practice Scale (SHPS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) as well as the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and wore an actigraph for 7 consecutive days. Student's t-test was used to compare the SHPS scores and means as well as variability of actigraphy sleep variables between poor sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score >5) and good sleepers (i.e., PSQI global score ≤5). Compared to good sleepers, poor sleepers reported significantly worse sleep hygiene, with higher SHPS scores and higher sleep schedule, arousal-related behavior, and sleep environment subscale scores. Poor sleepers had significantly greater intra-individual variability of sleep onset latency, total nighttime sleep, and wake after sleep onset than good sleepers. In stepwise linear regression, older maternal age (p = .01), fewer employment hours per week (p = .01), higher CES-D total score (p < .01), and higher SHPS arousal-related behavior subscale scores (p < .01) predicted self-reported global sleep quality. Findings support avoiding physically, physiologically, emotionally, or cognitively arousing activities before bedtime as a target for sleep-hygiene intervention in women during pregnancy.

N2  - The aims of this paper are to study the associations between objective and subjective sleep in pregnant women, to examine which specific aspects of women’s sleep are associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and to test the moderating role of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the relations between objective and subjective sleep. The sample included 148 pregnant women. Objective sleep was measured by actigraphy for five nights at the participants’ home, and subjective sleep was measured with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale and anxiety symptoms with the Beck anxiety inventory. Significant associations were found between the subjective sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores, but there were no significant associations between actigraphic sleep measures and the depressive and anxiety scores. Depressive and anxiety scores emerged as significant moderators of the links between objective and subjective sleep. The findings suggest that emotional distress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms severity) during pregnancy is associated with subjective sleep disturbances but not with objective sleep disturbances. Importantly, only among women with higher levels of emotional distress was subjective sleep quality associated with objective sleep quality. These findings may suggest that women with higher levels of emotional distress are not necessarily biased in their perception of sleep quality. However, they may perceive fragmented sleep as more detrimental to their wellbeing.

N2  - In preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, the sympathetic nerves are activated, leading to disrupted sleep. Melatonin, which transmits information to regulate the sleep-wake rhythm and other such biorhythms, has been implicated in insulin resistance, antioxidant behaviors, and metabolic syndrome. In addition, its reduced secretion increases the risk of hypertension and diabetes. The aim of this study was to elucidate the features of melatonin secretion, sleep quality, and sleep-wake rhythms in pregnant women with complications. Fifty-eight pregnant women with pregnancy complications (hypertensive or glucose metabolic disorders) and 40 healthy pregnant women completed questionnaires, including sleep logs and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), during the second to third trimesters. Their salivary melatonin levels were also measured. Pregnant women with complications had significantly lower morning (p < 0.001), daytime (p < 0.01), evening (p < 0.001), night (p < 0.01), daily mean (p < 0.001), peak (p < 0.001), and bottom (p < 0.01) melatonin values than healthy pregnant women. Pregnant women with complications also had significantly smaller melatonin amplitudes than healthy pregnant women (p < 0.001). Among pregnant women with complications, the duration (p < 0.05) and frequency (p < 0.01) of wake after sleep-onset were significantly greater in the poor sleep group than in the favorable sleep group which was divided by PSQI cutoff value. Pregnant women with hypertensive or glucose metabolic disorder complications had smaller circadian variation in salivary melatonin secretion, and their values were lower throughout the day than healthy pregnant women.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Greater acculturation is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in Mexican-American women, but the mechanisms by which acculturation influences perinatal outcomes are unclear. Pregnant acculturated Mexican-American women are more likely to engage in unhealthy prenatal behaviors relative to those less acculturated, including poor sleep. As sleep disruptions are associated with acculturation and negative perinatal outcomes, particularly maternal depression, alterations in sleep may adversely affect pregnant Mexican-American women.
METHODS: Sixty pregnant women of Mexican descent completed surveys about sleep, acculturation, depressive symptoms and potential protective factor of social support.
RESULTS: Acculturation, but not social support, significantly predicted increased sleep disruptions as well as overall feeling less refreshed upon waking across pregnancy. Moderation analysis indicated that more acculturated women who took longer to fall asleep reported increased depressive symptoms. Feeling refreshed upon waking also mediated the relationship between increased acculturation and elevated maternal depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Acculturation and altered sleep contribute to greater risk in Mexican-American women for maternal depressive symptoms in the perinatal period. These findings have implications for prevention and treatment of maternal mental health disorders, which may adversely affect perinatal outcomes in the vulnerable Mexican-American population.

N2  - Background: Findings from prior research into the effect of feeding methods on infant sleep are inconsistent. The objectives of this study were to examine infants’ sleep patterns by feeding methods and sleep arrangement from birth to eight months old. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study enrolled 524 pregnant women at 34-41 weeks of gestation and their infants after delivery in 2006 and followed up until eight months postpartum. The study subjects were recruited from nine women and children hospitals in nine cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanning, Xiamen, Xi’an, Jinan, and Hailin). Participating infants were followed up weekly during the first month and monthly from the second to the eighth month after birth. Twenty-four hour sleep diaries recording infants’ sleeping and feeding methods were administered based on caregiver’s self-report. Multivariable mixed growth curve models were fitted to estimate the effects of feeding methods and sleep arrangement on infants’ sleep patterns over time, controlling for maternal and paternal age, maternal and paternal education level, household income, supplementation of complementary food, and infant birth weight and length. Results: Exclusively formula fed infants had the greatest sleep percentage/24 h, followed by exclusively breast milk fed infants and partially breast milk fed infants (P<0.01). Night waking followed a similar pattern. However, the differences in sleep percentage and night waking frequency between exclusively formula and exclusively breast milk fed infants weakened over time as infants developed. In addition, compared to infants with bed-sharing sleep arrangement, those with room sharing sleep arrangement had greater daytime and 24-hour infant sleep percentage, whereas those with sleeping alone sleep arrangement had greater nighttime sleep percentage. Conclusions: Our data based on caregiver’s selfreport suggested that partial breastfeeding and bedsharing may be associated with less sleep in infants. Health care professionals need to work with parents of newborns to develop coping strategies that will help prevent early weaning of breastfeeding.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effect of acupression at the H7 point on sleep quality during pregnancy. After oral consent had been obtained, the midwife invited the women claiming to have poor sleep quality and anxiety symptoms to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-1. Then, the same midwife, previously trained by an expert acupuncturist (I.N.), advised the women to put on the wrist overnight compression H7 Insomnia Control half an hour before going to bed and to take it off upon awakening, for 10 consecutive days and thereafter every odd day (active group). Women refusing to wear the device for low compliance toward acupression were considered as the control group. After 2 weeks, a second questionnaire evaluation was completed. In the active, but not in the control, group, a significant improvement of sleep quality was observed after H7 device application. The study suggests that H7 acupression applied for 2 weeks improves sleep quality in pregnant women. This preliminary result should serve to stimulate further studies on the long-term effects of acupression.

N2  - Background: For a small but significant group, pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain may become persistent. While multiple factors may contribute to disability in this group, previous studies have not investigated sleep impairments, body perception or mindfulness as potential factors associated with disability post-partum. Objectives: To compare women experiencing no pain post-pregnancy with those experiencing pregnancy-related persistent lumbopelvic pain (either low- or high-level disability) across multiple biopsychosocial domains. Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Participants completed questionnaires for thorough profiling of factors thought to be important in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain. Specific measures were the Urinary Distress Inventory, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophising Scale, The Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale. Women where categorised into three groups; pain free (n = 26), mild disability (n = 12) and moderate disability (n = 12) (based on Oswestry Disability Index scores). Non-parametric group comparisons were used to compare groups across the profiling variables. Results: Differences were identified for kinesiophobia (p = 0.03), body perception (p = 0.02), sleep quantity (p < 0.01) and sleep adequacy (p = 0.02). Generally subjects in the moderate disability group had more negative findings for these variables. Conclusion: Disturbances in body-perception, sleep and elevated kinesiophobia were found in pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain subjects with moderate disability, factors previously linked to persistent low back pain. The cross-sectional nature of this study does not allow for identification of directional pathways between factors. The results support the consideration of these factors in the assessment and management of pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy and postpartum are two critical and stressful periods. Despite the joy of motherhood, these periods are sometimes associated with important physiological and pathological changes such as sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality. This study aimed to determine the effect of orange peel essential oil on sleep quality after delivery. Methods: This triple-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 96 postpartum women. Verified samples were assigned to intervention and control groups using randomized blocking. The intervention group received 10 drops of orange peel essential oil and the control group received 10 drops of placebo in a glass of water, three times a day, after each meal for 8 weeks. All participants filled out the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and after the intervention.Results There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of socio-demographic characteristics sleep quality score before intervention (p > 0.05). A significant improvement in sleep quality was observed in the group receiving orange peel essential oil compared with the control group at 8 weeks after delivery [adjusted mean difference: 5.0; 95% confidence interval: 3.9 to 6.1; p = 0.001]. Regarding the components of the sleep quality index, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups except for the daytime dysfunction component (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Orange peel essential oil has a positive effect in improving mothers' sleep quality in the postpartum period. However, further studies are needed on a more general population of women in order to decide on its use as an appropriate medication to use in clinical situations.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a health coaching (HC) intervention designed to prevent excessive gestational weight gain (GWG), and promote positive psychosocial and motivational outcomes in comparison with an Education Alone (EA) group.
DESIGN: Randomized-controlled trial.
METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-one women who were <18 weeks pregnant consented to take part. Those allocated to the HC group received a tailored HC intervention delivered by a Health Coach, whilst those in the EA group attended two education sessions. Women completed measures, including motivation, psychosocial variables, sleep quality, and knowledge, beliefs and expectations concerning GWG, at 15 weeks of gestation (Time 1) and 33 weeks of gestation (Time 2). Post-birth data were also collected at 2 months post-partum (Time 3).
RESULTS: There was no intervention effect in relation to weight gained during pregnancy, rate of excessive GWG or birth outcomes. The only differences between HC and EA women were higher readiness (b = 0.29, 95% CIs = 0.03-0.55, p < .05) and the importance to achieve a healthy GWG (b = 0.27, 95% CIs = 0.02-0.52, p < .05), improved sleep quality (b = -0.22, 95% CIs = -0.44 to -0.03, p < .05), and increased knowledge for an appropriate amount of GWG that would be best for their baby's health (b = -1.75, 95% CI = -3.26 to -0.24, p < .05) reported by the HC at Time 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the HC intervention was not successful in preventing excessive GWG, several implications for the design of future GWG interventions were identified, including the burden of the intervention commitment and the use of weight monitoring.
STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on the subject? Designing interventions to address gestational weight gain (GWG) continues to be a challenge. To date, health behaviour change factors have not been the focus of GWG interventions. What does this study add? Our health coaching (HC) intervention did not reduce GWG more so than education alone (EA). There was an intervention effect on readiness and importance to achieve healthy GWG. Yet there were no group differences regarding confidence to achieve healthy GWG post-intervention.

N2  - Objective The Lifestyle Interventions for Expectant Moms (LIFE-Moms) Consortium is designed to determine, in pregnant women with overweight or obesity, whether various behavioral and lifestyle interventions reduce excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and subsequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes and obesity in offspring. The design and planning process of the LIFE-Moms Consortium is described. Methods The LIFE-Moms Consortium is a collaboration among seven clinical centers, a Research Coordinating Unit, and the NIH designed to support each clinical center's conduct of a separate trial of a unique intervention. Specific common measures, procedures, and eligibility criteria are consistent across the seven trials allowing data to be combined in exploratory analyses and/or compared readily. Results Numerous committees and working groups were created to define common measures and outcomes during pregnancy and through 1 year postpartum, develop Consortium policies, and oversee progress of the trials. The primary outcome for the Consortium is excessive GWG. Secondary outcomes include maternal, neonatal, and infant anthropometric measures, physical activity, sleep, and complications of pregnancy and delivery. Conclusions A multi-center consortium of independent, lifestyle interventions with common measures and outcomes may enhance the ability to identify promising interventions for improving outcomes in pregnant women and their offspring.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To examine: (1) the prevalence and characteristics of bed-sharing among non-Hispanic Black and White infants in Georgia, and (2) differences in bed-sharing and sleep position behaviors prior to and after the American Academy of Pediatrics' 2005 recommendations against bed-sharing.
METHODS: Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data were obtained from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Analysis was guided by the socioecological model levels of: Infant, Maternal, Family, and Community/Society within the context of race. Data from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to address the first objective and from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2011 to address the second objective. Rao-Scott Chi square tests and backward selection unconditional logistic regression models for weighted data were built separately by race; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 6595 (3528 Black and 3067 White) cases were analyzed between 2004 and 2011. Significantly more Black mothers (81.9 %) reported "ever" bed-sharing compared to White mothers (56 %), p < 0.001. Logistic regression results indicated that the most parsimonious model included variables from all socioecological levels. For Blacks, the final model included infant age, pregnancy intention, number of dependents, and use of Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Services. For Whites, the final model included infant age, maternal age, financial stress, partner-related stress, and WIC. When comparing the period 2000-2004 to 2006-2011, a total of 10,015 (5373 Black and 4642 White cases) were analyzed. A significant decrease in bedsharing was found for both Blacks and Whites; rates of non-supine sleep position decreased significantly for Blacks but not Whites.
CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Continued high rates of bed-sharing and non-supine sleep position for both Blacks and Whites demonstrate an ongoing need for safe infant sleep messaging. Risk profiles for Black and White mothers differed, suggesting the importance of tailored messaging. Specific research and practice implications are identified and described.

N2  - Background: The 22q11 region is susceptible to chromosomal rearrangements, leading to various types of congenital malformation and intellectual disability. Several genomic disorders have been described, including cat eye syndrome (CES) caused by extra copies of the most proximal region, DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome due to deletion of 22q11.21, 22q11.2 duplication syndrome, and distal 22q11.2 microdeletion/microduplication syndrome. We present a clinical observation of a 28-year-old male with a tetrasomy of the region 22q11.1q11.21, corresponding to the CES region. Methods: The patient underwent clinical, neurophysiological and neuroradiological examination. Laboratory studies included array-CGH, conventional cytogenetic and FISH analysis. Results: A 28-year-old male patient was born to nonconsanguineous parents after a normal pregnancy. His weight at birth was 3,350 g. At birth, a total anomalous pulmonary venous connection of the heart was diagnosed and a surgical correction was required. Developmental milestones were severely delayed: first steps without help after 3 years and no development of language. A nasal fistula was corrected surgically during infancy. Since the past 2 years, the patient has developed daily atypical seizures, characterized by loss of contact and motor stereotypies, which are refractory to treatment. Seizures became more and more frequent with ageing (up to 1-2 episodes a day). Further results are as follows: (1) Clinical examination: turricephaly, spastic tetraparesis more marked on the right side; (2) Brain MRI: thinning of the corpus callosum, hypomyelination of the oval centers; (3) 24-hour EEG: spikes/polyspikes and waves more marked on the left side during sleep; (4) Cognitive phenotype: severe learning disabilities and specific language impairment, IQ at WAIS was undetectable for severity, and (5) Behavioral phenotype: presence of ritualistic and stereotyped behaviors, lethargy, and lack of eye contact. Array- CGH detected the tetrasomy of about 1.55 Mb on chromosome 22q11.1q11.21, due to the presence of a bisatellited, small dicentric supernumerary chromosome, as demonstrated by karyotype and FISH analysis. Conclusion: Although seizure characterization is lacking in CES, in the present case, epilepsy emerged as a main disturbance in the clinical picture of CES.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether adopted children with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differ from the general ASD population in terms of diagnosis, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, and medications. METHODS: We studied 163 adoptees in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN) in comparison with 5624 nonadopted ATN participants (aged 1.5-17.6 years; mean [SD] = 6.2 [3.4] years). Gender, age, race, ethnicity, IQ, and categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, ASD diagnosis were tested for differences by group (adopted versus nonadopted) by using independent-samples t tests for continuous variables and Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. Logistic or linear regression models were used to examine the association between adoption status and several outcome variables, after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: After controlling for demographics and diagnosis, there were significant differences in group characteristics, including greater propensity for externalizing behavior (P < .001), internalizing behavior (P = .001), and sleep problems (P < .001) in the adopted population. Adoptees were also prescribed psychotropic medications (P < .001) more often than the nonadoptees. Adoptees received a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified significantly more frequently than controls (odds ratio = 1.8; CI = 1.3- 2.5; P < .001), despite no significant difference in symptoms on standardized measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the population of adopted children with ASD differs from the general ASD population both with regard to diagnostic subtype and co-occurring behavioral problems. Future research should evaluate the contributions of specific factors associated with adoption such as biological family history, pregnancy history, early childhood experience, and age at adoption.

N2  - The paradigm of chronobiology is based almost wholly upon the daily biological clock, or circadian rhythm, which has been the focus of intense molecular, cellular, pharmacological, and behavioral, research. However, the circadian rhythm does not explain biological timings related to fundamental aspects of life history such as rates of tissue/organ/body size development and control of the timing of life stages such as gestation length, age at maturity, and lifespan. This suggests that another biological timing mechanism is at work. Here we focus on a "many days" (multidien) chronobiological period first observed as enigmatic recurring growth lines in developing mammalian tooth enamel that is strongly associate with all adult tissue, organ, and body masses as well as life history attributes such as gestation length, age at maturity, weaning, and lifespan, particularly among the well studied primates. Yet, knowledge of the biological factors regulating the patterning of mammalian life, such as the development of body size and life history structure, does not exist. To identify underlying molecular mechanisms we performed metabolome and genome analyses from blood plasma in domestic pigs. We show that blood plasma metabolites and small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) drawn from 33 domestic pigs over a two-week period strongly oscillate on a 5-day multidien rhythm, as does the pig enamel rhythm. Metabolomics and genomics pathway analyses actually reveal two 5-day rhythms, one related to growth in which biological functions include cell proliferation, apoptosis, and transcription regulation/protein synthesis, and another 5-day rhythm related to degradative pathways that follows three days later. Our results provide experimental confirmation of a 5-day multidien rhythm in the domestic pig linking the periodic growth of enamel with oscillations of the metabolome and genome. This association reveals a new class of chronobiological rhythm and a snapshot of the biological bases that regulate mammalian growth, body size, and life history.

N2  - Abstract: This study aimed to explore attitudes towards family formation in single or cohabiting childless women of advanced age. The design comprised semi-structured qualitative interviews of 20 women aged 34–39 years attending the Fertility Assessment and Counselling Clinic, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. A sample of 10 single women and 10 cohabiting women was chosen with equal distribution of postgraduate education length. Data were analysed using content analysis following the method of Graneheim and Lundman and consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ). The general attitude towards family formation was characterized by a fear of the consequences of choosing motherhood on one hand, and a ‘ticking biological clock’ and a wish to establish a nuclear family on the other. The women idealized the perception of perfect mothering in terms of uncompromising expectations of child rearing and showed an increasing awareness of solo motherhood as a possible solution to advanced age, the wish of a child and single status compared to earlier studies. Our study contributes to knowledge and understanding of personal considerations related to childbearing in nullipara women in their mid- to late 30s and may be useful in a fertility assessment and counselling setting.

N2  - Animal studies demonstrate that circadian rhythm disruption during pregnancy can be deleterious to reproductive capacity and the long-term health of the progeny. Our previous studies in rats have shown that exposure of pregnant dams to an environment that significantly disrupts maternal circadian rhythms programs increased adiposity and poor glucose metabolism in offspring. In this study, we used mice with a ClockΔ19 mutation to determine whether foetal development within a genetically disrupted circadian environment affects pregnancy outcomes and alters the metabolic health of offspring. Ten female ClockΔ19+MEL mutant mice were mated with 10 wildtype males, and 10 wildtype females were mated with 10 ClockΔ19+MEL mutant males. While genetically identical, the heterozygote foetuses were exposed to either a normal (wildtype dams) or disrupted (ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams) circadian environment during gestation. Pregnancy outcomes including time to mate, gestation length, litter size and birth weight were assessed. One male and one female offspring from each litter were assessed for postnatal growth, body composition, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test at 3 and 12 months of age. There was no effect of maternal genotype on pregnancy outcomes, with days to plug, gestation length, litter size and perinatal mortality not significantly different between wildtype and ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams. Similarly, there was no effect of maternal genotype on weight of the offspring at birth or at any stage of postnatal growth. While there was an effect of sex on various tissue weights at 3 and 12 months of age, there were minimal effects of maternal genotype. Relative adrenal weight was significantly reduced (-32%) in offspring from ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams, whereas gastrocnemius muscle was significantly increased (+16%) at 3 months of age only. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests at 3 months of age revealed female offspring from ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams had significantly reduced area under the curve following glucose administration (-25%), although no differences were found at 12 months of age. There was no effect of maternal genotype on intraperitoneal insulin tolerance at 3 or 12 months of age for either sex. These results demonstrate that foetal growth within a genetically disrupted circadian environment during gestation has no effect on pregnancy success, and only marginal impacts upon the long-term metabolic health of offspring. These results do not support the hypothesis that circadian rhythm disruption during pregnancy programs poor metabolic homeostasis in offspring. However, when maintained on a 12L:12D photoperiod, the ClockΔ19+MEL mutant dams display relatively normal patterns of activity and melatonin secretion, which may have reduced the impact of the mutation upon foetal metabolic programming.

N2  - A number of studies to-date suggest that poor sleep quality and short sleep duration are associated with development of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes in the general population(1).Moreover, studies in pregnant women have found associations between sleep disturbance and development of impaired glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes (GDM)(2). However, there remains limited research on the relationship between sleep quality, sleep duration and glucose control in pregnant women with established GDM(3). The present study therefore aimed to determine whether sleep quality and sleep duration is associated with glycemic control in pregnant women with GDM during the third trimester. Sixty five women with GDM were recruited from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Data were collected at 30-32 weeks gestation. Glucose control was assessed using 6 days of blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using an iPro2 device (Medtronic). Sleep was assessed using a validated sleep questionnaire (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI). Linear regression (adjusted for pre-pregnancy BMI and age) was performed to assess the association between total PSQI score, self-reported sleep duration and CGM measures of glucose control including: percentage of time in pregnancy target glucose range 3·5-7·8 mmol/l; area under the curve (AUC) >7·8 mmol/l; standard deviation (SD) of glucose values; average glucose level; and total number of glucose excursions. Our results show that a higher PSQI score (indicating poorer sleep quality) was associated with: a lower proportion of time in glucose target (β -0·69; 95 % CI -1·22 to -0·15); a greater AUC above target (β 0·01; 95 % CI 0·002 to 0·017); a higher SD glucose signifying higher variability in glucose levels (β 0·02; 95 % CI 0·004 to 0·04) ; a higher average glucose levels (β 0·04; 95 % CI 0·007 to 0·079); and a greater number of glucose excursions (β 0·46; 95 % CI 0·066 to 0·852). On the other hand longer sleep duration was associated with: a higher proportion of time within glucose target (β 1·33; 95 % CI 0·086 to 2·58); a smaller AUC above target (β -0·02; 95 % CI -0·033 to 0·002); and a lower SD glucose (β -0·05; 95 % CI -0·097 to -0·008). (Table Presented) This study suggests that sleep quality and sleep duration in the third trimester may be an important factor in achieving optimum glucose control in women with GDM. It offers the possibility that interventions targeted to address sleep quality/duration may help achieve tighter glucose control and thereby better pregnancy outcomes at this stage in pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is a chronic pain disorder usually affecting women in their fertile period of life. However, the relationship between FS and pregnancy has not been studied in depth. The effect of FS on the course of pregnancy is poorly investigated in the current literature. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of FS to menarche age, gravidity, parity and duration of breastfeeding. Methods: One hundred and eighty-seven non-pregnant females attending between March 2015-June 2015, to Malatya State Hospital Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Outpatient Clinic, were included in this prospective study. One hundred eleven (111) of them were diagnosed with FS according to the American Rheumatology Association (ACR) 2010 criteria and were defined as group 1; group 2 comprised of seventy six (76) non-pregnant healthy volunteers. All participants were asked about their menarche age, marriage age, gravidity, parity, duration of breastfeeding by conducting a basic questionnaire survey. Patients’ body mass index (BMI) were recorded. Depression parameters were evaluated by Beck Depression Scale (BDS). Results: The average age of the patients was 39.04±9.21 (FS) and 38.47±9.65 (Control) years; first menarche age was at 13.28±1.38 (FS) and 13.59±1.54 years (Control), and marriage age was 20.1±3.62 (FS) and 20.69±3.90 years (Control), respectively. No statistically significant difference was found (p=0.598) between BMI values (FS, 27.76±4.95; Control 26.90±4.56 kg/m2). The results from both groups were similar in terms of gravidity, parity, and breastfeeding duration, with no statistically significant differences (p=0.252, 0.093, 0.075, respectively). The only significant difference was found in the depression parameter. The BDS results were statistically different between the groups, found higher in FS group (p=0.000). Conclusion: FS occurs as a result of symptoms such as mood disorder, anxiety, cognitive and sleep disorders, and also hormonal changes; no exact cause has yet been established. The syndrome usually occurs during fertile period of young female. According to the findings of our study, FS has no negative effect on the outcome of gravidity, parity, and duration of breastfeeding in Turkish women. Further studies about the effects of FS on the course of pregnancy are required.

N2  - Introduction: The pregnancy is high demending period of time for women's psysically and psychologically. Motherhood is very rewarding but also very complex the psychological point of view. Pregnancy is related with many psychological effects inducing anxiety and depression. It is characteristic for pregnant woman to present susceptibility, and mood swings that can accentuated with small proportion adversed events. Depression, anxiety, and stress, are psychological conditions than can affect the mother as well as the fetus in short and long term. The knowledge of the emotional changes of future mothers are important for health care professionals. It is essential to performe appropriate messures to avoided negative consequences. Materials and methods: We performed across sections study including 254 pregnant women with non-pathological pregnancies followed in hospitals of Madrid. Two validates scales (Zung Depression Scale and Beck Anxiety Questionnaire) were used to assess anxiety and depression in the population studied. Clinical cases and summary results: Objetive: To assess psycho-emotional changes in pregnant women with non-pathological gestations. Methods: We performed across sections study. Including 254 pregnant women with non-pathological pregnancies followed in hospitals of Madrid. Two validates scales (Zung Depression Scale and Beck Anxiety Questionnaire) were used to assess anxiety and depression in the population studied. Results: 31,9% of pregnant women had symptoms of depression, and 19,3% presented anxiety disorders. Self-esteem problems prior pregnancy planning, previous antidepressant treatments, family history of depression, changes in sleep patterns and lack of emotional support were risk factors for depression and anxiety Conclusion: Psychoemotional, disords as anxiety and depression can be present during pregnancy. The evaluation of the emotional status of pregnant women is a pending activity for health care providers. It is very important to detect risk factor for psychological pathology in pregnat women to prevent adverse consequences.

N2  - Maternal physiological adaptations, such as changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, are central to pregnancy success. Circadian variation of the HPA axis is dependent on clock gene rhythms in the hypothalamus, but it is not known whether pregnancy-induced changes in maternal glucocorticoid levels are mediated via this central clock. We hypothesized that hypothalamic expression of clock genes changes across mouse pregnancy and this is linked to altered HPA activity. The anterior hypothalamus and maternal plasma were collected from C57Bl/6J mice prior to pregnancy and on days 6, 10, 14 and 18 of gestation (termZd19), across a 24-h period (0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 0000, 0400 h). Hypothalamic expression of clock genes and Crh was determined by qPCR, plasma ACTH concentration measured by Milliplex assay and plasma corticosterone concentration by LC-MS/MS. Expression of all clock genes varied markedly across gestation, most notably at mid-gestation when levels of each gene were elevated. The pregnancy-induced increase in maternal corticosterone levels (by up to 14-fold on day 14) was not accompanied by a parallel shift in plasma ACTH (28% lower on day 14 compared with non-pregnant levels). Moreover, while circadian rhythmicity in corticosterone was maintained up to day 14 of gestation, this was effectively lost by day 18. Overall, our data show that the central circadian clock undergoes marked adaptations throughout mouse pregnancy, changes that are likely to contribute to maternal physiological adaptations. Importantly, however, neither hypothalamic clock genes nor plasma ACTH levels appear to drive the marked increase in maternal corticosterone after mid-gestation.

N2  - While there is substantial evidence that obesity is a risk factor for poor sleep, not least as a result of an increased risk of obstructive sleep apnoea, the possibility that sleep might play a role in energy metabolism and the development of obesity has led to much speculation and a raft of fresh research in this area. Much of the evidence to-date has relied upon self-reported measures of sleep, for which sleep duration is the component of sleep most commonly recorded by all studies. In the present study we therefore sought to examine sleep duration in a population likely to experience an elevated risk of both poor glucose control and body weight, body mass index (BMI) and recent weight gain - pregnant women at risk of gestational diabetes. All pregnant women who presented at booking with one or more clinical risk factors for gestational diabetes (a family history of diabetes, ethnicity, elevated BMI and/or gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy), and who were referred to a specialist antenatal diabetology clinic at St James' Hospital in Leeds, were invited to participate in the present study. Women who consented to participate (n = 193) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),(1) while data on preceding sociodemographic and clinical factors were obtained from their antenatal records. Data on sleep duration were categorised as <6hrs, 6-<7hrs and ≥7hrs per night, and the relationship between sleep duration and body weight/BMI (on referral to the specialist antenatal diabetology clinic), and weight gain (between booking and referral), were assessed using multinomial regression analyses before and after adjustment for potential confounders (maternal age, parity, marital status, family history of diabetes, deprivation- smoking and alcohol consumption). (Table Presented) These analyses indicate that all three anthropometric indices were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of short sleep duration, and that this association strengthened after adjustment for potential confounders. It therefore seems likely that this population is at high risk of short sleep, although it remains to be seen whether short sleep simply mediates the risk of gestational diabetes, or is an independent risk factor thereof.

N2  - Background: Disturbed sleep is a significant health issue for pregnant women. Inadequate vitamin D intake is common among pregnant women and can affect many bodily systems. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that serum vitamin D levels are low in pregnant women who have poor sleep quality in their last trimester. Methods: We enrolled 92 pregnant women who were admitted to the Maternity Clinic of Turgut Ozal University (Ankara, Turkey) in their last trimester. Venous blood sampling was performed to determine serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Sleep quality was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire. The Student t test and Chi-square test were used to evaluate the relationships between variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of the vitamin D level. Results: The median score of the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire was 6.2 ± 3.3 (range, 1-17). We determined that 43.5% (40) of participants had poor sleep quality. The mean number of sleep hours at night was 8.6 ± 1 hours (range, 6.30-11 hours), and the mean sleep latency was 20.3 ± 12.7 minutes (range, 5-60 minutes). Vitamin D levels were measured for 87 participants; the median serum level of 25 (OH) vitamin D was 22.9 ± 16.2 ng/mL (range, 4.9-99 ng/mL). Among all patients, we did not determine any significance between the vitamin D-deficient group and the non-vitamin D-deficient group with regard to the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Inventory (PSQI) total score and subcomponents scores of the questionnaire (. p > 0.05). Among 37 patients with poor sleep quality and for whom the vitamin D level was measured, 56.8% (21) women had vitamin D deficiency, and 81% (30) women had vitamin D insufficiency. However, we did not find any significance between participants with poor sleep and participants with good sleep quality with regard to age, occupational status, relationship with her partner, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), weight gain during pregnancy, being primiparus, length of labor, and mode of delivery. Our findings further showed that being in a low income family was associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusion: Inadequate vitamin D and poor sleep quality are prevalent in pregnant women, but low levels of vitamin D are not associated with poor sleep quality. Further studies with larger sample sizes and studies that include preterm deliveries and special sleep disorders should be performed to understand this issue better.

N2  - Context: Deterioration in the quality of sleep and changes in melatonin metabolism are risk factors in developing of obstetrics complications. The objective of our study was to reveal the peculiarities of somnological status and melatonin metabolism in pregnant women and in case of metabolic syndrome. Methods, patients, interventions and outcome measures: We conducted polysomnography and studied the level of 6-sulfatoximelatonin in morning urine in 291 patients: 147 women with physiological pregnancy and 144 women with metabolic syndrome. EEG analysis was carried out in an abandoned mode on epochs of 20 seconds. Results: In the dynamics of physiological pregnancy we detected an increase in the duration of stage I of sleep, increased total waking time, the amount of movement during sleep and nocturnal awakenings and decreased sleep efficiency. In the sleep patterns we revealed an increase in the duration of the superficial stages of slow-waves' sleep and decrease of the duration of paradoxical sleep, as well as increasing segmentation of its phases. In metabolic syndrome, we found the predominance of slow-wave phase in all cycles of sleep. The segmentation of its phases increased significantly (by 45% compared to physiological pregnancy), the duration of superficial stages of slowwave sleep increased. We detected the decrease of paradoxal sleep, until obstructive apnea. We also found the reduced total sleep efficiency. Conclusion: These changes in the structure and quality of a night's sleep are revealed on the background of a gradual increase in the level of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the morning urine of women with increasing gestation of physiological pregnancy, and, conversely, the reduce of it - in the metabolic syndrome.

N2  - Background: During pregnancy, due to special hormonal and physiological changes that occur in the body, sleep disorders are very prevalent; therefore, positive psychological states and emotions can have major impacts on overall sleep quality among pregnant women. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of 15 positive psychological states (trust in God, optimism, a sense of efficacy, accepting responsibilities, a sense of control, purposefulness, hope, meaningfulness in life, life satisfaction, positive mood and happiness, being social, self-esteem and self-worth, a sense of peace, appreciation, and forgiveness) on predicting sleep quality among pregnant women. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study followed a correlational-predictive design. The statistical population of this study included all pregnant women referred to health care centers in Khash in the first half of 2015, which included 890 individuals. The sampling method was multistage cluster sampling. Overall, 268 questionnaires were distributedamongpregnant women,whohad the inclusion criteria of the current study, in order to be answer freely and voluntarily. Moreover, to collect data, two questionnaires including positive psychological states (PPS) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) were used. Results: The results of the correlation coefficient indicated that optimism, purposefulness, hope, meaningfulness in life, life satisfaction, positive mood and happiness, a sense of peace, trust in God and forgiveness were significantly related to high sleep quality (P ≤ 0.01). However, sleep quality was not correlated with a sense of efficacy, accepting responsibilities, a sense of control, being social, and a sense of self-esteem and self-worth (P ≥ 0.05). Additionally, the results of stepwise regression analysis showed that positives mood, meaningfulness in life and hope together predicted 0.47 of the variance in sleep quality among pregnant women (P ≤ 0.01). Conclusions: Since psychological states and emotions have great impacts on sleep quality of pregnant women, paying attention to women's psychological states and emotions, especially in the last trimester of pregnancy, seems essential.

N2  - Both short and prolonged nighttime sleep duration have been linked to type 2 diabetes due to their adverse impact on insulin sensitivity. Sleep difficulty is common in pregnancy, but prospective data is limited on its relation to gestational diabetes (GDM). In the NICHD Fetal Growth Study (n=2584), a prospective, multiracial cohort of healthy women without diabetes before pregnancy, we examined the relation of sleep duration and napping frequency to GDM risk. GDM (n=107) was diagnosed by medical record review. In the 1st (8-13 gestational weeks) and 2nd (16-22 weeks) trimesters, women reported their typical sleep duration (5-6, 7, 8-9 or 10+ hours) and napping frequency (most times, sometimes or rarely/never) in the preceding week. Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for GDM were estimated with Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy body mass index, and other risk factors. From the 1st to 2nd trimester, women were less likely to sleep for 10+ hours (24.4% vs. 14.7%) or to nap some/most times (80.4% vs. 54.4%). Sleeping duration and napping in the 1st trimester were not independently or jointly related to GDM risk. However, significant relations were observed in the 2nd trimester. Compared to women who slept for 8-9 hours and did not nap (rarely/never), aRRs (95% CI) were 2.65 (1.32-5.33) for women who slept less (5-7 hours) and did not nap, 2.07 (1.07-4.02) for those who slept 8-9 hours and napped (some/most times), and 2.24 (1.02-4.92) for those who slept more (10+ hours) and napped. In addition, the relation of 2nd trimester sleep and GDM differed by obesity status (p for interaction=0.04). Only among nonobese women, sleeping more or less than 8-9 hours were both significantly related to GDM risk; aRRs (95% CI) were 2.53 (1.28-4.99) for 5-6 hours, 1.98 (1.08-3.64) for 7 hours, and 2.37 (1.15-4.88) for 10+ hours. Our data suggest a U-shaped relation between sleep duration and GDM and that napping and obesity status may modify this relation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to describe the association between OSA and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanisine (8-OHdG) a biomarker of oxidative stress and DNA damage among obese pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Participants in a prospective observational cohort of obese pregnant women (BMI >30 kg/m2) underwent overnight sleep studies testing for OSA using a portable [polysomnography (ARES Unicoder; Carlsbad, CA), recording nasal pressure, oxygen saturation, snoring, and head movement. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod). The subsequent first morning void maternal urine samples were collected and stored at -70C. Samples were analyzed in duplicate for levels of 8-OHdG using a commercially available kit and corrected for creatinine level. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, student t-test and Spearman correlation P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Among 179 participants, 27 (15%) had OSA. Women with OSA compared to women without OSA were similar in age (27±5 vs. 30±5 years, p= 0.08), and percentage of body fat (44±6 vs. 48±6%, p=.42) but had a higher BMI 50±12 vs. 39±6 kg/m2, p<.001. There was a positive correlation between BMI and urinary 8-OHdG (r=.227, p=0.03) but no correlation with severity of OSA by apnea hypopnea index (r=0.4, p=.19) or percentage body fat (r=.14, p=.20). Among the cohort, compared to Class I and II, class III obesity had the highest level of 8-OHdG urinary levels (5.7±2, 5.0±2 and 6.4±1.9 ng/ml, p=.04). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, oxidative stress was positively correlated with patient BMI but not severity of sleep apnea. Studies of the physiological effects of OSA should be careful to control for the independent effects of obesity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic data from non-pregnant cohorts have linked poor sleep with obesity and weight gain. Our objective was to determine the relationship between objectively measured sleep duration and weight gain in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Women enrolled in the nuMoM2b study, a multicenter prospective cohort study of nulliparous women with a singleton gestation, were recruited at the 2nd study visit (16-21 weeks') to wear an actigraph to record objective sleep activity for 7 consecutive days. Women with pregestational diabetes and chronic hypertension were excluded. Sleep duration (SD) was calculated as an average across study nights and categorized as follows: <6, 6 to <7, 7 to <8, 8 to <9, and >9 hours/night. Gestational weight gain (GWG) was calculated relative to self-reported prepregnancy weight using measured weights at visit 2 and visit 3 (22-29 weeks'), and chart abstracted last weight prior to delivery. We examined GWG using gestational age-standardized z-scores, a measure of GWG that by design is uncorrelated with gestational age at measurement and BMI. Z scores of <-1 and >+1 were used to define groups with the smallest and largest normalized weight gains, respectively. RESULTS: Actigraphy and weight data were available for 751 women. The majority of women (74.8%) had a SD between 7 to <9 hours; 2.1% and 5.2% had a SD of <6 and >9 hours/night, respectively. Non-linear relationships were observed between SD and GWG (see Table). For all GWG assessments, large GWG (Z>+1) became less frequent as SD increased. Women with the shortest (<6) and the longest (> 9) SD had the highest rates of small GWG (Z<-1). Differences were statistically significant for GWG at Visit 2 and Visit 3 (p<.0001, p=.04) and were similar in magnitude for the last weight prior to delivery (p=0.0504). CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that both short and long SD in pregnancy are associated with GWG. Poor sleep in pregnancy has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, and our findings provide one potential mechanism for this association. (Table Presented).

N2  - Purpose of review This review aims to provide an update on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy and its effect on maternal and fetal outcomes. Recent findings Current OSA screening tools may not perform well in this population. There are some pieces of evidence linking poorer maternal and neonatal outcome with pregnant patients having OSA. At present, there are inadequate data on which to base fetal or maternal parameters for treatment of OSA, and no evidence that treatment in the short-term impacts maternal or neonatal outcomes. Summary Further research is needed to help in the detection and treatment of OSA in pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: Perinatal depression (PND) has an overall estimated prevalence of roughly 12%. If left untreated, PND has significant negative consequences not only on the health of the mothers, but also on the physical, emotional and cognitive developmentof their children. No certain risk factors are known to predict PNDand no completely safe drug treatments are available during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sleep and depression are strongly relatedto each other because of a solid reciprocal causal relationship. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-tested and safe treatment,effective in both depression and circadian/sleep disorders. Theaims of the present project are:-to systematically and prospectively explore sleep-related parameters, as well as mood changesduring the perinatal period, to identify potential early diagnosticmarkers of PND (Life-ON main study)-to explore the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudyLife-ON 1)-to investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treatingPND (substudy Life-ON 2)-to test whether a short-term trial ofBLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy Life-ON 3).Methods: In a 3-year longitudinal, observational, multicenterstudy, about 500 women will be recruited and followed-up fromearly pregnancy (10th-15th week of gestation) until 12 monthsafter delivery. Sleep will be assessed using wrist actigraphy, polysomnography and various sleep questionnaires. A blood-basedanalysis of potential biochemical, hormonal and genetic markersduring the perinatal period will be performed. Women affected byPND, based on a psychiatric interview and an EPDS score >12,will be invited to participate in a randomized, placebo-controlledtrial with morning bright light therapy (BLT) for 6 weeks. A subsample of 80 women without depression will also be randomizedto participate in a 6-week open-label study with BLT during thethird trimester of pregnancy.Results: The study is ongoing since the middle of 2016. Todate about 150 pregnant women have been recruited and about 20of them participated in the preventive substudy Life-ON 3. A firstinterim analysis of the available data is planned for fall 2017. Thefinal study results are expected in 2019.Conclusions: The characterization of specific predictive andrisk factors for PND may substantially contribute to improve preventive medical and social strategies for the affected women. Thestudy results are expected to promote a better understanding of therelationship between sleep disorders and the development of PNDand to confirm, in a large sample of women, the safety and efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND.

N2  - Background: It has been suggested that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy may adversely influence maternal as well as fetal well being. Objectives: To examine the effect of maternal SDB on neonatal neurological examination and perinatal complications. Methods: Pregnant women of singleton uncomplicated pregnancies were prospectively recruited from a community and hospital low risk obstetric surveillance. All participants completed a sleep questionnaire in the second trimester and underwent ambulatory sleep evaluation (WatchPAT™, Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). They were categorized as SDB (apnea hypopnea index > 5) and non-SDB. Maternal and newborn records were reviewed and a neonatal neurologic examination was conducted during the first 48 hours. Results: The study group included 44 women and full-term infants; 11 of the women (25%) had SDB. Mean maternal age of the SDB and non-SDB groups was 32.3 ± 2.8 and 32.5 ± 4.7 years, respectively (P = 0.86). Mean body mass index before the pregnancy in the SDB and non-SDB groups was 25.8 ± 4.7 and 22.0 ± 2.5 kg/m2, respectively (P = 0.028). No differences were found between infants born to mothers with SDB and non-SDB in birth weight (3353.8 ± 284.8 vs. 3379.1 ± 492.4 g), gestational age (39.5 ± 0.9 vs. 39.2 ± 1.5 weeks), 5 minute Apgar scores (9.8 ± 0.6 vs. 9.9 ± 0.3), and neurologic examination scores (95.2 ± 3.9 vs. 94.6 ± 4.1). P value for all was not significant. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that maternal mild SDB during pregnancy has no adverse effect on neonatal neurologic examination or on perinatal complications.

N2  - Study Objectives: To examine the association between sleep apnea and pregnancy outcomes in a large population-based cohort. Methods: Population-based cohort study using linked birth and hospital records was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. Participants were all women who gave birth from 2002 to 2012 (n = 636,227). Sleep apnea in the year before pregnancy or during pregnancy was identified from hospital records. Outcomes of interest were gestational diabetes, pregnancy hypertension, planned delivery, caesarean section, preterm birth, perinatal death, 5-minute Apgar score, admission to neonatal intensive care or special care nursery, and infant size for gestational age. Maternal outcomes were identified using a combination of hospital and birth records. Infant outcomes came from the birth record. Modified Poisson regression models were used to examine associations between sleep apnea and each outcome taking into account maternal age, country of birth, socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking, obesity, parity, pre-existing diabetes and hypertension. Results: Sleep apnea was significantly associated with pregnancy hypertension (adjusted RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.18-1.73), planned delivery (1.15; 1.07-1.23), preterm birth (1.50; 1.21-1.84), 5-minute Apgar < 7 (1.60; 1.07-2.38), admission to neonatal intensive care/special care nursery (1.26; 1.11-1.44), largefor-gestational-age infants (1.27; 1.04-1.55) but not with gestational diabetes (1.09; 0.82-1.46), caesarean section (1.06; 0.96-1.17), perinatal death (1.73; 0.92-3.25), or small-for-gestational-age infants (0.81; 0.61-1.08). Conclusions: Sleep apnea is associated with higher rates of obstetric complications and intervention, as well as preterm delivery. Future research should examine if these are independent of obstetric history.

N2  - We spend one third of our life in sleep. Current data suggests high prevalence of sleep disorders in the current era of 24X7. There are growing concerns for sleep deprivation in society as it is affecting not only general health but is also a risk factor for diabetes, high blood pressure, heart diseases, stroke, cancer, obesity and metabolic syndromes. Sleep is also compromised in various disease conditions. Anxiety of having sleep disorders further adds to the sleeplessness. Sleep requirement differs across different age groups and thus sleep disruption affects brain differently during development. Sleep deprivation during pregnancy-postpartum and in growing children require attention. Sleep disruptions during pregnancy and post-partum lactation period is an emerging health concern. We have reported increased anxiety disorders and cognitive deficits in the offspring born to sleep compromised mothers. To assess the effects of sleep disruptions during pregnancy, study was conducted in animal model (female Wistar rats) taking two groups of animals, one normal time control and other sleep deprived. Sleep was assessed during pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning, in both set of animals. Sleep-wakefulness (S-W) was measured objectively taking electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG), which is gold standard for sleep evaluation. These electrodes were surgically implanted in nulliparous female Wistar rats maintained in standard laboratory conditions with food and water given ad libitum under anaesthesia. After post-surgical recovery, three control recordings of S-W were taken for 24 h before the animals were kept for mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, S-W recordings were acquired during different days of pregnancy, post-partum lactation/nursing days, and also after weaning. In one group, animals were sleep deprived during third term of pregnancy (5h/ day from gestational day 15 to 20 through gentle handling). The sleep in their pups was also recorded on different postnatal days (pnds 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20). The results indicated an increase in sleep during pregnancy, primarily due to an increase in light non-REM sleep (S1) during dark period. After parturition, there was a decrease in sleep, especially during daytime, with an increased number of short duration S1 episodes. It resulted in increased time in waking with fragmentation of sleep. In neonates, emergence of sleep pattern from primitive active and quiet sleep to more organized sleep patterns of NREM and REM sleep will be discussed. The physiological changes in sleep during pregnancy and post-partum period will be the correlated with the changing sleep patterns of the neonates..

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy is a complex process that brings along many changes in physiological, psychological and social aspects. While expectant mother experiences the initial excitement, she can also encounter undesired problems during pregnancy. Fatigue is one of the most important problems experienced. Although fatigue is observed at each stage of pregnancy, health behaviors can be an important factor in the decrease/increase of fatigue felt. Prenatal attachment is used in defining the emotional, cognitive and behavioral attachment established between the baby and the woman during pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to examine the relation of expectant mothers' health-related practices during pregnancy and fatigue in mother and prenatal attachment. Materials and methods: The descriptive correlational study was carried out at a State Hospital in Sakarya. The study sample consisted of pregnant women (at least 20-week gestation) who applied to prenatal care services and agreed to participate in the study. This study was approved by the Ethical Board in Sakarya University. The data were collected through a Personal Information Form, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and The Prenatal Attachment Inventory (PAI). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient in this study for PAI was 0.97. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient in this study for BFI was 0.93. The data collected were analyzed by percentage distribution, means square, Spearman's correlation, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. Clinical cases and summary results: 43.1% of the expectant mothers (n=91) participating in the study were in the 24-29 age range. 59.7% (n=126) of the participants had a middle income level, 35.5% (n=75) of them were secondary school graduates, and 92.4% (n=195) of them went for regular controls. While the PAI average of the expectant mothers going for regular control was 55.18±15.79, who did not go for regular control was 43.56±16.23, and the difference between them was found to be statistically significant (p=0.004). While the PAI average of the expectant mothers who smoked during pregnancy was 45.29±14.18, who did not smoke during pregnancy was 54.85±16.05, and the difference between them was found to be statistically significant (p=0.032). While the BFI average of the expectant mothers with planned pregnancy was 28.93±12.07, the BFI average of the expectant mothers with unplanned pregnancy was 38.69±12.88, and the difference between them was found to be statistically significant (p<0.001). While the BFI average of the expectant mothers with sufficient sleep duration was 31.26±12.56, the BFI average of the expectant mothers with insufficient sleep duration was 41.19±14.09, and a statistically significant negative relationship was found between fatigue and sleep duration (r= -0.331, p<0.001). The PAI averages of the participants were 54.30±16.09, and the BFI averages were 32.77±13.26, and a negative, weak but statistically significant relationship was found between BFI and PAI (r=-0.184,p=0.007). Conclusion: It was observed that the expectant mothers' healthrelated practices during pregnancy positively affected the fatigue and prenatal attachment. It was determined that the prenatal attachment was negatively affected as the fatigue increased in pregnant women. The fact that expectant mothers develop positive health behaviors during pregnancy will decrease the fatigue felt and positively affect the prenatal attachment.

N2  - Prenatal sleep disturbance has been associated with undesirable birthing outcomes. To determine the effectiveness of listening to music at home in improving sleep quality, 121 Taiwanese pregnant women with poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] score > 5) were systematically assigned, with a random start to music listening (n = 61) or control (n = 60) group. Participants in the music listening group self-regulated listening to music in addition to receiving general prenatal care similar to that in the control group for 2 weeks. The PSQI and State-Anxiety Inventory were used to assess outcomes. ANCOVA analyses were used with the pretest scores as covariates and showed significant improvement in sleep quality, stress, and anxiety in the music listening group compared with the control group. The most frequently used music genre by participants in the experimental group was lullabies, followed by classical music and crystal baby music. This study supported the theory that 2-week music listening interventions may reduce stress, anxiety, and yield better sleep quality for sleep-disturbed pregnant women. The analysis of participants' journals also implied that the expectant mothers' choices of musical genres may correlate more with perceived prenatal benefits or the desire to interact with their unborn child.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy is a crucial event in a woman's life. It is a delicate time that can result in the development or onset of psychopathology. We conducted this study of pregnant women with no obvious psychiatric symptoms to investigate the presence of psychopathological traits, in order to demonstrate the importance of an early screening. Finding mental changes and their treatment during gestation allows the prevention of more serious diseases (Post-partum Depression and Puerperal Psychosis) or organic and mental diseases in the fetus. Materials and methods: Our sample made up of 38 pregnant women (middle age 32.9 ± 5.61) recruited from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Gemelli Hospital, Rome, between January and July 2014. Psychiatric assessment, socio-demographic, psychosocial and anamnestic variables were recorded on the basis of a psychiatric talk, a non-standardized questionnaire and a psychometric assessment: EDI (Eating Disorder Inventary), BSQ (Body Shape Questionnaire), ORTO-15 (Orthorexia), BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), SCL-90-R (Symptom Check List-90-Revised). Moreover we sistematically recorded anthropometric newborn data and any childbirth complications. Clinical cases and summary results: 63% of the women had a pathological score, specially in BDI (31,6%) and in the subscale “maturity fear” in EDI (44,7%) emphasizing the evolutionary crisis presenting in this period. We detected elevated scores also in most of the subscales of SCL-90-R (somatization, depression, anxiety and sleep disorders). Correlation of Pearson highlights a statistically significant association between the BMI before pregnancy and the smoking status during pregnancy and some subscales in EDI, BSQ and SCL-90- R. They probably represent compensatory mechanisms to manage a new condition. We also observed that women with psychopathological traits who reported higher scores in SCL-90 had complications during childbirth, such as a slow descent of fetus and consequent an operative vaginal delivery. This underlines that maternal anxiety affects the course of pregnancy and childbirth, and consequently the physical and mental development of the child. Conclusion: The presence of psychopathological traits, detected in our research, shows the importance of an early screening, as part of a multidisciplinary approach to the welfare of pregnant women, to allow psychological support and prevent the onset of post-natal diseases.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether maternal obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with differences in fetal growth. STUDY DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of fetal growth in women with singleton gestations who underwent overnight polysomnography as part of several prospective studies investigating the relationship of OSA to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Snoring and non-snoring women were eligible, as were those with comorbidities. Subjects were excluded if they were currently receiving treatment for OSA. Fetal growth was estimated using sonographic biometric measurements obtained during routine prenatal care. GROW software was used to calculate customized estimated fetal weight (EFW) and birth weight centiles adjusted for maternal height, weight, ethnicity, parity, and fetal gender. Fetal growth problems were defined as birth weight less than the 10th centile, or a slowing of fetal growth by more than 30% during the last trimester. OSA was considered present when the apnea/hypopnea index (a measure of respiratory disturbance per hour of sleep) was at least 5/hr. RESULTS: Overall, 88 women participated with a mean maternal age of 32.3 ± 6.8 years and a median gestational age of 33.0 weeks at the time of polysomnography. Twelve women (14%) had a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and n=10 women (11%) had gestational diabetes. A birth weight of less than the 10th centile was observed in n=21 infants, while n=41 had fetal growth problems. In total, n=34 women (39%) had OSA which ranged in severity from AHI 5-140 (median AHI 7.7). In a logistic regression model, after accounting for co-morbid hypertension, diabetes, anti-hypertensives and antidiabetic medications, maternal age, and smoking, the presence of OSA was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of fetal growth problems (OR 3.0, 95%CI 1.1-8.3, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Obstructive sleep apnea is independently associated with altered fetal growth. Future studies focusing on treatment for OSA will help determine whether this is a causative relationship that is reversible with appropriate therapy.

N2  - Women with a diagnosis of bipolar and major depressive disorders are at higher risk to develop postpartum depression. The primary objective of this longitudinal study was to determine whether daily activity rhythms and sleep parameters differ between women with and without a history of a mood disorder across the perinatal period. A secondary objective was to determine whether changes in these parameters were associated with postpartum mood. In total, 33 women were included in this study, 15 of which had a history of a mood disorder (high-risk group) and 18 who did not (low-risk group). Sleep and daily rhythms were assessed subjectively and objectively during the third trimester (≥26 weeks gestation) and again at 6-12 weeks postpartum. Mood was also assessed at both time points. Women in the high-risk group showed greater subjective daily rhythms and sleep disturbances across the perinatal period. Objective sleep efficiency was worse in the high-risk group in the postpartum period. Changes in both subjective daily rhythms and objective sleep efficiency were predictive of changes in depressive symptoms across the perinatal period. These findings encourage the development of preventative therapeutics to ensure circadian rhythm and sleep stability throughout the perinatal period.

N2  - Many studies have shown that shorter sleep duration in childhood is associated with higher body mass index (BMI), and have proposed that it is due to an effect of sleep on adiposity. There is little evidence about the association of sleep with fat-free mass. This study examined the association between child's sleep duration at age 3 years and fat and fat-free mass at 4 years of age in a prospective cohort study of 302 boys and 285 girls. Study participants were taking part in the Southampton Women's Survey, a longitudinal study of mothers and children from preconception onwards. Total sleep duration at age 3 years was derived from parental report of night sleep and nap duration. Body composition was assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at 4 years. Mean total sleep duration was 11.5 hours. In linear regression analyses, adjusted for potentially confounding factors (maternal educational attainment, prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, child's gestational age at birth, age at DXA, sex, age last breastfed, dietary quality at 3 years, TV watching and hours actively on the move and parental social class), shorter sleep in hours was associated with higher BMI (kg/m2) [β: -0.2340, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.373 to -0.096], a greater fat mass index (kg) (β: -0.1182, 95% CI: -0.218 to -0.018) and a greater fat-free mass index (kg) (β: -0.100, 95% CI: -0.185 to -0.015). Previous research suggested that the association between shorter sleep and higher body mass index is due to an effect on adiposity. Our findings are novel, suggesting that the relationship between sleep and BMI is also determined by an effect on muscle.

N2  - The significance of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring during pregnancy has not been established. We performed a prospective study to elucidate whether ABP measures are associated with small-for-gestational-age birth weight (SGA). We studied 146 pregnant women who were seen for maternal medical checkups or suspected hypertension. ABP monitoring was performed for further assessment of hypertension. The outcome measure was SGA. The subjects were classified by their medical history and ABP as having preeclampsia or gestational hypertension (n=68 cases), chronic hypertension (n=48) or white-coat hypertension (n=30). There were 50 (34.2%) cases of SGA by the fetal growth reference standard. In multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, body mass index, the presence of prior pregnancy, current smoking habit and the use of antihypertensive medications, 24-h SBP (per 10 mm Hg (odds ratio (OR): 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-2.38; P<0.001)) was more closely associated with SGA than clinic BP (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.92-2.13; P=0.11). The results were essentially the same if 24-h BP was replaced by awake or sleep SBP. Ambulatory diastolic BP showed the same tendency. However, abnormal circadian rhythm was not associated with the outcome. In conclusion, ambulatory BP monitoring measures performed during pregnancy were more closely associated with SGA than clinic BP.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to gestational diabetes (GDM). This study aimed to determine the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on glucose metabolism in obese pregnant women with GDM and OSA. Obese pregnant women (pre-pregnancy BMI 25 kg/m2), gestational age (GA) 24-34 wk, with diet-controlled GDM had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and were screened for OSA. Those with OSA were randomly assigned to receive 2-weeks nightly CPAP or wait-list control. Glucose metabolism was assessed at baseline and 2 weeks using oral mixed-meal tolerance test with glucose and insulin levels. Changes between baseline and week 2 were compared between groups. Of the 66 women participated, 35 (53%) had OSA (Apnea hypopnea index, AHI, ≥5). After adjusting for pre-pregnancy BMI, OSA severity significantly correlated with FPG (AHI, r=0.238, p=0.06; Oxygen desaturation index, r=0.340, p=0.02, Minimum O2, r=-0.463, p<0.001). Fourteen women were randomized to CPAP and 13 were wait-list controls. There were no differences between groups in their ages, BMI, GA, FPG, or OSA severity. After two weeks, the CPAP group had a trend of lower FPG (p 0.11), but those who utilized CPAP for ≥70% of the days (n=10) had significantly lower FPG than controls [median change (IQR) -2 (-8.3, 0.3) vs. 1 (-3, 5) mg/dl, p=0.05]. Insulin secretion significantly improved in the CPAP compared to the control group as reflected by mean change (MC) in AUC insulin/AUC glucose [0.11±0.13 vs. 0.01±0.09 μIU/ml. (mg/dl)-1, p=0.04], insulinogenic index [MC: 0.38±0.54 vs. -0.02±0.28 μIU/ml. (mg/dl)-1, p=0.03], and disposition index [MC: 0.97±2.11 vs. -0.37±0.81, p=0.05], while insulin sensitivity as calculated by Matsuda index were not different [MC: -0.20±0.81 vs. -0.35±0.87, p=0.65]. In summary, OSA is prevalent in obese GDM women with its severity correlated to FPG. Two weeks of CPAP treatment results in lower FPG and improved insulin secretion without changes in insulin sensitivity.

N2  - Short sleep duration (SSD) is an established risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes in the adult population. It is unclear whether SSD is also a risk factor for developing diabetes in pregnancy (Gestational Diabetes (GDM)). The aim of the present study was to review the available evidence for an association between SSD and GDM using a systematic review and meta-analysis. EMBASE and Medline were searched for studies published prior to 2014 that included regression models assessing the relationship between SSD and GDM. Two independent reviewers (AAA and NAA) manually screened the search results for any relevant studies. Random effects models were used to calculate the combined odds of GDM, together with I2 and χ2 statistics to assess the level of heterogeneity amongst studies included in the models. A total of n = 79 studies were found that had examined the relationship between sleep and various pregnancy outcomes. Ten studies included SSD as an exposure and three of these explored the relationship between SSD and GDM.(1,2,3) All three studies were undertaken in the US using prospective longitudinal designs and multivariable analyses. GDM was diagnosed using an oral glucose tolerance test whilst sleep duration was assessed using subjective questionnaires across a range of different gestational ages in participants with single or multiple pregnancies, or both. Meta-analyses of these studies indicated that SSD (<7 hours/ night) was associated with 2·39 the odds of GDM (95 % CI = 1·48 to 3·86; p < 0·001; I2 = 0·0 %; p=0·803; Figure 1); the low level of heterogeneity reflecting similarities in the three studies' designs. (Figure Presented) The literature contains evidence that SSD is associated with an increased risk of developing GDM, though the volume, quality and consistency of published studies undermine the precision of the pooled estimates of association and indicate the need for more research in this area.

N2  - Introduction: New Zealand has the third highest prevalence of childhood obesity among OECD countries. Risk of later offspring obesity is associated with maternal diet and physical activity during gestation and early childhood. Reduced sleep duration may also be a risk factor. There are a number of hypotheses regarding the mechanisms for sleep-obesity associations including diet quality effecting sleep latency and duration. Purpose: To determine the effects of maternal diet during pregnancy and early childhood diet (3.5 and 7 years of age) on body composition and sleep latency and duration at 7 years. Materials and Methods: The longitudinal Auckland Birthweight Collaborative (ABC) Study included children born small for gestational age (SGA) and non-SGA. Data was collected on mothers at birth (n = 871), and their children at 3.5 (n = 550) and, 7 (n = 591) years. Dietary information was collected using food frequency questionnaires, and dietary pattern scores created using principal components analysis, resulting in 3 previously defined dietary patterns (Junk, traditional and healthy). At 7 years sleep duration and sleep latency were evaluated using both parent report and data collected from a single day using an G3TX Actigraph (Actigraph Ltd, Pensecola, Floida, USA). At 3.5 and 7 years Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated (weight (kg)/height (m)) and percentage body fat (PBF) was estimated via the BIM4 (Impedimed Ltd, QLD, Australia). The relationship between maternal pregnancy diet and childhood diet at 3.5 years on body composition, sleep duration and latency at 7 years was assessed using linear regression. Results: A higher maternal healthy dietary pattern score was inversely associated with offspring ZBMI at 3.5 years (-0.20; 95% CI -0.35, - 0.05), 7 years (-0.26; 95% CI -0.47, -0.04) and PBF at 7 years (-1.81%; 95% CI -3.42%, -0.19%). A higher traditional dietary score at 3.5 years was associated with a decrease in PBF at 7 years (OR-0.86%; 95% CI -1.65%, -0.08%). There was no association of childhood dietary patterns on sleep duration and latency but a higher maternal junk dietary pattern score was inversely associated with sleep duration at 7 years (OR-14min; 95% CI -22min, -7min). Conclusion: A healthy dietary pattern in pregnancy and early childhood was associated with lower childhood BMI and PBF at 7 years of age. The study findings emphasise the importance of the influence of maternal diet in pregnancy and early childhood diet on children's body composition. The effect of diet in pregnancy on sleep duration in mid-childhood requires further investigation.

N2  - This study aims to investigate whether change in sleep duration and insomnia symptoms in the postpartum period is related to change in body mass index from before to 2 years after pregnancy. This study is based on self-report data from a Norwegian cohort, the AHUS Birth Cohort Study. Data were collected at 8 weeks (T1) and 2 years (T2) postpartum. Data from 812 women were analyzed. The results showed that only women with symptoms of insomnia at both T1 and T2 (persistent symptoms) had a greater increase in body mass index compared to women with no insomnia symptoms at T1 or T2.The results indicate that persistent insomnia symptoms are related to a greater increase in body mass index.

N2  - Study Objectives: To evaluate the construct validity and factor structure of the Spanish-language version of the Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test questionnaire (FIRST-S) when used in early pregnancy. Methods: A cohort of 647 women were interviewed at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation to collect information regarding lifestyle, demographic, and sleep characteristics. The factorial structure of the FIRST-S was tested through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (EFA and CFA). Internal consistency and construct validity were also assessed by evaluating the association between the FIRST-S with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep quality. Item response theory (IRT) analyses were conducted to complement classical test theory (CTT) analytic approaches. Results: The mean score of the FIRST-S was 13.8 (range: 9-33). The results of the EFA showed that the FIRST-S contained a one-factor solution that accounted for 69.8% of the variance. The FIRST-S items showed good internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.81). CFA results corroborated the one-factor structure finding from the EFA; and yielded measures indicating goodness of fit (comparative fit index of 0.902) and accuracy (root mean square error of approximation of 0.057). The FIRST-S had good construct validity as demonstrated by statistically significant associations of FIRST-S scores with sleep quality, antepartum depression and anxiety symptoms. Finally, results from IRT analyses suggested excellent item infit and outfit measures. Conclusions: The FIRST-S was found to have good construct validity and internal consistency for assessing vulnerability to insomnia during early pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction and objective. Spontaneous abortion constitutes one of the most frequent complication of human pregnancy. Despite intensive research efforts undertaken to date, the etiopathogenesis of early pregnancy loss has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to analyze the role of selected non-somatic risk factors for early pregnancy loss in patients with various clinical manifestations of spontaneous abortion. Materials and methods. The study included 242 women hospitalized between 2001 and 2004 in the 3rd Chair and Department of Gynecology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland (Teaching Hospital No.4) with various clinical categories of spontaneous abortion. Each patient completed a questionnaire assessing her exposure to the examined factors. In patients with threatened abortion dismissed from the hospital with viable gestation, the course of pregnancy was followed-up using questionnaire data and medical records. Results. In the studied population of women with abnormal early pregnancy course, a significant impact on the risk of miscarriage was observed in case of such factors as: exposure to stress at home and limited number of hours of nightly sleep. Factors such as occupational hazards, diet, stress, heavy housework and use of cigarettes or alcohol did not exert a significant effect on the risk of miscarriage in the studied population. Conclusions. The results of this study confirm the complexity of the early pregnancy loss etiopatogenesis. Further research need to be conducted in order to identify the non-somatic causative agents of various clinical forms of miscarriage. It may help do select women in reproductive age at high risk of early pregnancy loss and show the ways in which effective preventive measures can be introduced in such population.

N2  - Depression at all ages is common, it is the 3rd leading cause of morbidity at present and is expected to be the 2nd leading cause by the year 2020. Depression is not only having low mood, worthlessness and hopelessness it also coexists with many different physical symptoms. Here we report an atypical presentation in a 24 year old pregnant woman complaining of bleeding from both the eyes at 32 weeks of gestation. History revealed, persistent low mood, decreased interest and concentration in daily activities and low self esteem since 2010. There was one episode in 2013 with increased intensity of symptoms and associated crying spells, worthlessness, hopelessness, mild aggressiveness, worsening of suicidal ideas, disturbed sleep and appetite, when she was sent to her maternal aunt where she grew up after her parents death.They didn't attend any psychiatrist instead went to a local faith healer, partial remission of symptoms was observed in 6months. In 2015 july, she presented with bloody tears from both the eyes associated with mild depressive symptomatology. Patient on her hospital stay developed repeated bleeding episodes. Bleeding sample was investigated for haemoglobin, peripheral smear, clotting time and cross-matched. MRI brain was normal, nasolacrimal duct was patent on ultrasonography. After detailed evaluation she was diagnosed as Persistant Mood Disorder-Dysthymia. Patient was started on SSRI and Psychoeducated about the illness. Improvement in symptomatology was noted after 4weeks of treatment and complete remission of bloody tears at the end of 2 months was observed. This case is reported for the rarity of its presentation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate if ocular light exposure affects salivary melatonin concentrations and frequency of uterine contractions. STUDY DESIGN: Six pregnant women [age 18-30 years; weeks 35-38 of pregnancy, first full-term pregnancy, singleton fetus], were studied overnight in our inpatient facility. A uterine tocometer was placed 4 hours prior to reported bedtime and was worn for 8 hours; ocular light exposure [randomized to blue/green (active) or red (control) wavelengths] began 2 hours prior to reported bedtime and lasted for 4 hours. Participants went to sleep 2 hours after their reported bedtime. Saliva was collected every hour when the participant was awake and assayed for melatonin. Participants were asked every 30 minutes to document the number of contractions they had felt. RESULTS: Salivary melatonin levels and the number of contractions were higher for the women in the red light condition than in the blue/green condition, as expected. The Spearman correlation between Area Under the Curve (AUC) of melatonin and number of contractions was 0.95 for the total 8 hours the tocomoter was on. There was no relationship between either AUC of melatonin or tocometer-measured contractions and self-reported number of contractions. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a positive relationship between melatonin concentrations and uterine contractions in women in after ∼35 weeks of pregnancy. This pilot data may be a basis for future research into modification of uterine contractions using light of specific intensities and/or wavelengths, melatonin, melatonin agonists, and/or melatonin antagonists.

N2  - Objective: The patients with untreated hypothyroidism have a high rate of unsuccess in getting a pregnancy, even using in vitro fertilization. Material and methods: The study included 26 pregnant women aged between 23 and 45 years old, who were admitted in “Elena Doamna” Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology Iasi, Romania: 14 patients had a personal medical history of thyroid problems (Lot I) and 12 who had their first morpho-functional thyroid evaluation (Lot II). To prevent miscarriages, the pregnant women with autoimmune thyroiditis were administered levothyroxina (Euthyrox). Results: Gestational age at the first thyroid evaluation varied from 5 to 34 weeks. Here are some of the signs and symptoms that characterized the diagnosis: heart palpitations at night (26.1%); tremor of the extremities (23.1%); restless sleep (23.1%); temporal headache (23.1%). The ultrasonographic evaluation shows: hyperechoic structures for 50% of the patients in Lot I and 8.3% in lot II (p=0.05). The thyroid was normally vascularized for 57.1% of the patients with a medical history of thyroid illnesses (p=0.044). The evaluation of thyroid markers for the patients with hyperechoic changes and increased vascularization showed: TSH (1.61 mUI/ml; p=0.028); FT3# (3.98pmol/l; p=0.045); antibodies ATPO# (11.60 UI/l; p=0.001) and ATG# (15 UI/l; p=0.001). Though, according to the cases studied, the only predictable parameter used in determining thyroid damage proves to be FT4 (AUC =0.733; IC95%: 0.452-1.015; cut off 1.10 ng/dl). 2 patients with a medical history of thyroid problems had miscarriages (14.3%). Conclusions: The monitoring of the thyroid function during pregnancy and the prompt treatment administration reduces the risk of complications, both for the mother and for the foetus.

N2  - Introduction: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered a safe treatment in pregnant women with sleep disordered breathing, which cardiovascular effects are known to be similar to gestational induced hypertensive diseases. As CPAP results in an increasing cardiac output (CO), it might be suggested as a treatment for maternal low-CO related gestational diseases such as intra-uterine growth retardation and preeclampsia. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of autoCPAP on maternal CO in pregnancies complicated with IUGR and/or gestational hypertensive diseases. Materials and methods: Patients admitted for hypertensive disorders and/or intra-uterine growth retardation were considered for inclusion. Cardiovascular parameters were obtained using impedance cardiography (ICG). Only patients with a CO <7.5L/min were asked to participate in the study (see figure). After a 2-hours habituation process at daytime (day 0), patients were asked to use the CPAPdevice every night till discharge or termination of pregnancy. ICG measurements were performed at day 0, day 1 and from then every other day during the CPAP treatment. Clinical cases and summary results: 43 patients were eligible for inclusion. In 17/43 (39.5%) patients, valid data were obtained (see figure). The maximal participation time was 7 days (n=1). Cardiovascular parameters are presented in table 1 (data presented as median and interquartile ranges): CO showed a small but significant increase (Z=-2.22, p=0.026) and diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure decreased (Z=-2.39, p=0.017 and Z=-2.38, p=0.017) after the first night of therapy. No differences were found for heart rate, systolic blood pressure and stroke volume. Overall, there was no difference of any parameter at day 3 and 5 (p>0.097). These observations were seen both in women with and without hypertension. Conclusion: Although there is a temporary small increase of CO in pregnant women with hypertension or IUGR, performing CPAP as a maintenance therapy seems difficult once gestational complications have occurred. CPAP may be a safe and non-invasive method to increase maternal CO, but needs further investigation.

N2  - Background. Mild obstructive sleep apnea is common in pregnancy and may have an exacerbating role in gestational hypertension, although currently the interaction between these two diseases is uncertain. Methods. We analyzed 43 pregnant subjects, 28 with gestational hypertension (GH) and 15 with normal healthy pregnancy, by level I polysomnography. Additionally, diastolic and systolic blood pressure changes in response to obstructive respiratory events were measured by noninvasive beat-by-beat monitoring. We also assessed a subgroup (n=27) of women with respiratory disturbance indexes <5, for blood pressure responses to very subtle obstructive respiratory disturbances ("airflow reductions"). Results. The mean ± standard deviation respiratory disturbance index of our 28 GH women and 15 healthy pregnant women was 10.1±9.9 mmHg and 3.0±3.8 mmHg, respectively. Systolic and diastolic pressure responses to these events were 30.1±12.8 mmHg and 16.0±6.1 mmHg for GH women and 29.1±14.2 mmHg and 14.3±7.7 mmHg for healthy women. For the 27 women in whom we assessed for airflow reduction events, the hemodynamic responses were 27.1±12.3 mmHg systolic and 14.4±6.7 mmHg diastolic. Interpretation. Upper airway obstructive events of any severity are associated with a substantial transient blood pressure response in both healthy pregnant and GH women. Whether or not these events have a clinically significant impact on women with GH remains uncertain.

N2  - Objective: To find which anesthesia type is better in managing stress and sleep quality of laboring mothers in Korea. Methodology: We surveyed pregnant women who were healthy, their first labor, under the age of 34, and delivering by elective cesarean section about their stress scale and sleep quality before the operation and 10 days after the operation. Sleep quality and stress scale were assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Fifty patients for elective cesarean section were divided into two groups; 25 patients had general anesthesia (group G) and 25 patients had spinal anesthesia (group S). Results: Both pre and postoperative mothers had no significant different scale of sleeping quality and stress regardless of the types of anesthesia (general or spinal) regardless of the time (timing) of cesarean section (P >0.05). Still, mothers had a sleeping problem and stress. Conclusion: No correlation about sleep quality and stress scale between two anesthetic types was found. However, preoperative and postoperative laboring mothers in both groups had slight sleeping problems and stress.

N2  - Background: Postpartum depression is a common condition, which consequences might be harmful for both mother and child. Since sleep and depression are closely related it is possible that women who suffer from sleep related problems during pregnancy are more likely to develop depression in the postpartum period. This study aims to investigate the possible association between depressive symptoms in the postpartum period and sleep related problems during pregnancy. Methods: In this study 293 women in the last trimester of pregnancy answered a questionnaire about symptoms of restless legs, snoring and daytime sleepiness. They also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The same women were screened for depressive symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) four to ten weeks after giving birth. Additional information about social data, pregnancy and delivery was received from the medical charts. Results: Women with postpartum depressive symptoms had higher prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness defined as ESS score ≥10 (OR 3.84, CI 1.57-9.39), and restless legs syndrome (OR 2.837 CI 1.18-6.84) in last trimester of pregnancy, when adjusted for socio-demographic factors and obstetric risk factors. No association was found between postpartum depressive symptoms and snoring. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms after childbirth are preceded by sleep related problems such as daytime sleepiness and restless legs, already during pregnancy. The results from Epworth Sleepiness Scale and a questionnaire concerning Restless Legs Syndrome completed during pregnancy might be a valuable contribution for detecting women at risk for postpartum depression, enabling preventive interventions.

N2  - Introduction: Reflexology is a complimentary treatment that uses compressions and skin contact to help the body release enkephalins and endorphins. Thus, the neural transmission of pain messages to the brain is stopped, anxiety and pain levels are decreased, as a result of improved lymphatic nerves and blood flow, the excretion of toxins from the body is increased. Further assessment of the evidence relating to the use of reflexology at pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum units is needed. This study is designed to evaluate the studies in reflexology and related fields systematically. Materials and methods: Data is obtained by scanning Medline, Pubmed, ScienceDirect, Google Academic, National Thesis center databases in the Celal Bayar University library between January 1 and April 1 2016. Databases were scanned with “antenatal, intranasal, postpartum, reflexology” keywords. Clinical cases and summary results: Nine full texts associated with the subject were found. Mollart (2003) concluded that reflexology is effective in reducing edema in the feet and ankles during pregnancy. Ghaffari and Ghaznein (2010) concluded that it helps reduce fatigue in pregnant women. Close et al (2015) concluded that reflexology can help in a back and pelvic pain management in pregnancy. Hanjani et al (2014) stated that reflexology shortens the delivery time, reduces the intensity of labor pain, reduces anxiety levels, contribute to natural childbirth and lead to an increase in Apgar scores. Chumth et al (2011) concluded that reflexology significantly decreases the stress levels of adolescent mothers after the birth. McNeill et al (2005) argue that reflexology applied before the birth have a positive effect on pain management in labor. Li et al (2011) found that during the postpartum period, reflexology improves the quality of sleep. Conclusion: Reflexology can help women during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum period without any side effects. There are a limited number of studies on reflexology. More randomized controlled studies have to be conducted to generate more evidence.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with nocturnal intermittent hypoxia, which may be responsible for increased circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inflammatory mediators, such as metalloproteinases (MMPs), and which contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic hypertension. Why some OSA patients remain normotensive is poorly understood. Relaxin-2, a pregnancy hormone, may sometimes circulate in men and could increase in hypoxic conditions. It exerts a vasodilatory activity and can modulate the release of molecules, such as MMPs and VEGF. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore if circulating relaxin-2 in male OSA subjects may be related to OSA severity, to circulating levels of MMPs, of their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases; TIMPs), and of VEGF, and if it may protect from hypertension. Patients andMethods: Fifty untreated male subjects with suspected OSA were recruited. After nocturnal polysomnography, a morning venous blood sample was withdrawn. Then, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed. Results: The respiratory disturbance index in the sample was 30.4 [interquartile range (IQR) 15.6-55.2]. Relaxin-2 was detectable in 20 subjects. These subjects did not differ in OSA severity or diurnal and nocturnal BP from subjects with undetectable relaxin-2, but they showed lower TIMP-1 (126.8 ± 29.1 vs. 156.9 ± 41.7 pg/ml, respectively; p = 0.007) and a marginally higher MMP-9/TIMP-1 molar ratio [0.58 (IQR 0.23-1.35) vs. 0.25 (IQR 0.15-0.56); p = 0.052]. Conclusions: Relaxin-2 in male subjects was not related to OSA severity, but it was associated with lower TIMP-1. As it was often undetectable, even when BP values were normal, it is unlikely that it plays a role as a major factor protecting from hypertension in OSA.

N2  - Objective. We report on the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution in the first trimester and on the association between TCM constitution and maternal symptoms related to pregnancy. Methods. Participants were followed up until delivery to observe primary measures (gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus) and secondary measures (signs of miscarriage, miscarriage, nausea and vomiting, and sleepiness and defecation during pregnancy). Descriptive analysis, t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis were used in this study. Results. 61.8% of the participants had unbalanced constitutions. We did not find a significant association between the TCM constitution and gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, miscarriage, signs of miscarriage, and defecation during pregnancy. And we found that women with unbalanced constitutions in early pregnancy had a greater likelihood of severe nausea and vomiting and poor sleep during pregnancy in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions. These results have implications for female health care providers and policy makers. Identification of TCM constitution may be helpful for understanding nausea and vomiting and poor sleepiness during pregnancy, especially in the condition that can not be explained by modern medical science, and be helpful for making program to improve these uncomfortable symptoms.

N2  - Depression is common in pregnancy and associated with increased risk of adverse effects for the neonate. Treatment and prevention options include antidepressant therapy. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on safety of mirtazapine during pregnancy and lactation. In 31 papers a total of 390 cases of neonates exposed to mirtazapine during pregnancy or lactation have been described. There might be an association between mirtazapine and spontaneous abortion, however, this might be attributable to underlying psychiatric disease.An increased risk of major neonatal malformations associated with mirtazapine in pregnancy has not been reported. Although one study showed a nearly significant increase in occurrence of respiratory problems and hypoglycaemia, no indication of causality could be given. No other significant adverse effects on neonates were reported. Limited available data, four papers on 11 exposed neonates, suggest that use of mirtazapine during breastfeeding is safe due to a low relative infant dose. High plasma levels might be associated with increased body weight and sleep. However, the reported data are too scarce to come to a clear assessment of the risk of mirtazapine in lactation.No information is available on the use of mirtazapine in pregnancy and Poor Neonatal Adaptation Syndrome (PNAS) or neurobehavioral development at an age over one year.In conclusion, mirtazapine seems to be safe in pregnancy, especially regarding incidence of congenital malformations. There are not enough data available to come to a conclusion on the safety of mirtazapine during lactation.

N2  - Personality may influence sleep in perinatal women. A follow-up study was conducted among 3,752 pregnant, then postpartum women at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. The Big Five personality dimensions were measured by the Mini-International Personality Item Pool in week 17 of pregnancy. Insomnia was measured by the Bergen Insomnia Scale in pregnancy week 32 and 8 weeks postpartum, along with self-reported sleep times. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale measured depression, and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist measured anxiety. Adjusted for current anxiety, depression, and demographic variables, the personality traits Neuroticism and Agreeableness were associated with insomnia in pregnancy. No personality traits were associated with postpartum insomnia. Extraversion was associated with longer postpartum sleep duration and better sleep efficiency, and Agreeableness with shorter sleep duration.

N2  - Objectives: In this study, we will primarily study the effectsof BLT on depression during pregnancy. Second, we will studywhether this clinical improvement is accompanied by improvedsleep quality and normalized melatonin and cortisol levels. Third,we will study the effects of BLT on gestational age, birth weight,infant behavior, infant cortisol stress response and long-term cortisol exposure of the infant. We will present the study protocol andpreliminary results.Methods: In this study, we aim to randomly allocate 150pregnant women (12-18 weeks pregnant) with a DSM-V diagnosisof depressive disorder in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatmentarms: treatment with BLT (9.000 lux) or treatment with dim redlight therapy (100 lux). Both groups will be treated for 6 weeks athome on a daily basis for 30 minutes, within 30 minutes of habitual wake-up time. Follow-up will take place after 6 weeks of therapy, 3 and 10 weeks after end of therapy, at birth and 2, 6 and 18months postpartum. Primary outcome will be the average changein depressive symptoms between the two groups, as measured bythe Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder version and the Edinburgh PostnatalDepression Scale (EPDS). Changes in rating scale scores of thesequestionnaires over time will be analysed using generalized linearmixed models. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in maternal cortisol and melatonin levels, in maternal sleep quality andgestational age, birth weight and infant behaviour, cortisol exposure and cortisol stress response.Results: We will present data on baseline characteristics, including comorbidity, chronotype, and symptom scores. After 5months of recruitment, we have included 8 women. In April 2017,28 women signed up for participation, of which 10 did not meetthe inclusion criteria. Ten women refused participation or did notrespond. Two women dropped out. Comorbidities in this studysample are PTSD (2), drug and alcohol abuse (2), panic disorderand social phobia (3). Five women experienced depression in thepast. Three women used antidepressant medication. At inclusion,the following chronotypes were scored with the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire: moderate early, slight early (2), normal (2),slight late and extreme late (2). At inclusion, mean EPDS is 12.9and mean 17-item Hamilton score is 11.8.Conclusions: The Bright Up study is an ongoing study inThe Netherlands, in which we study the effects of light therapy inantepartum depression. This study is the first to study these effectsin a large study sample and to study these effects in the child.

N2  - In the United States, roughly half of women are either overweight (24.5%) or obese (21.4%) when they become pregnant. Women who are obese before pregnancy are at increased risk for a number of pregnancy complications relative to normal-weight women. Specifically, obesity is associated with significantly increased maternal risks, including gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and sleep disordered breathing. Maternal obesity is also associated with increased risks of adverse fetal outcomes, including prematurity, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and abnormal fetal growth. In this review, we will discuss the implications of obesity with respectto antepartum care.

N2  - The environment in which individuals develop and mature is critical for their physiological and psychological outcome; in particular, the intrauterine environment has reached far more clinical relevance given its potential influence on shaping brain function and thus mental health. Gestational stress and/or maternal infection during pregnancy has been related with an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. In this framework, the use of animal models has allowed a formal and deep investigation of causal determinants. Despite disruption of circadian clocks often represents a hallmark of several neuropsychiatric disorders, the relationship between disruption of brain development and the circadian system has been scarcely investigated. Nowadays, there is an increasing amount of studies suggesting a link between circadian system malfunction, early-life insults and the appearance of neuropsychiatric diseases at adulthood. Here, we briefly review evidence from clinical literature and animal models suggesting that the exposure to prenatal insults, i.e. severe gestational stress or maternal immune activation, changes the foetal hormonal milieu increasing the circulating levels of both glucocorticoids and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These two biological events have been reported to affect genes expression in experimental models and critically interfere with brain development triggering and/or exacerbating behavioural anomalies in the offspring. Herein, we highlight the importance to unravel the individual components of the body circadian system that might also be altered by prenatal insults and that may be causally associated with the disruption of neural and endocrine developmental programming.

N2  - This article is part of a Special Issue "Parental Care".Jay Rosenblatt effectively promoted research on rabbit maternal behavior through his interaction with colleagues in Mexico. Here we review the activities of pregnant and lactating rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), their neuro-hormonal regulation, and the synchronization of behavior between mother and kits. Changing concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin throughout gestation regulate nest-building (digging, straw-carrying, fur-pulling) and prime the mother's brain to respond to the newborn. Nursing is the only mother-young contact throughout lactation. It happens once/day, inside the nest, with ca. 24 h periodicity, and lasts around 3 min. Periodicity and duration of nursing depend on a threshold of suckling as procedures reducing the amount of nipple stimulation interfere with the temporal aspects of nursing, though not with the doe's maternal motivation. Synchronization between mother and kits, critical for nursing, relies on: a) the production of pheromonal cues which guide the young to the mother's nipples for suckling; b) an endogenous circadian rhythm of anticipatory activity in the young, present since birth. Milk intake entrains the kits' locomotor behavior, corticosterone secretion, and the activity of several brain structures. Sibling interactions within the huddle, largely determined by body mass at birth, are important for: a) maintaining body temperature; b) ensuring normal neuromotor and social development. Suckling maintains nursing behavior past the period of abundant milk production but abrupt and efficient weaning occurs in concurrently pregnant-lactating does by unknown factors. Conclusion: female rabbits have evolved a reproductive strategy largely dissociating maternal care from maternal presence, whose multifactorial regulation warrants future investigations.

N2  - Obesity is associated with multiple interrelated disorders such as insulin resistance/diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea - all contributing collectively to the diagnosis of a metabolic syndrome, that reduces life expectancy (Flegal et al., 2013). Metabolic changes in obesity may also affect reproduction. In women, obesity is associated with a higher incidence of ovulatory disorders and idiopathic infertility (ASRM, 2015). On the other hand, obese women under treatment for infertility may face additional problems, such as the need for higher doses of drugs to induce/stimulate ovulation, oocyte morphological changes, reduction in fertilization and implantation rates, and embryo quality (ASRM, 2015; Provost et al., 2016). Compared to women of normal body weight, obese women submitted to IVF may present reduced rates of clinical pregnancy and live births, with an increased rate of abortion (Provost et al., 2016). In addition, obese pregnant women have a higher incidence of maternal and fetal complications, such as gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and increased perinatal morbidity/mortality (Aune et al., 2014). With respect to men, male obesity has been linked to reduced rates of pregnancy and live births (Campbell et al., 2015). However, studies on specific relationships between semen parameters and obesity have been contradictory. Although different studies have shown correlations between increased obesity and changes in sperm parameters, although selectively (MacDonald et al., 2010, Sermondade et al., 2013, Campbell et al., 2015), others did not report adverse effects (Bandel et al., 2015). On the other hand, recent studies point to a negative association between body weight and the very integrity of sperm DNA (Fariello et al., 2012; Taha et al., 2016); however, these results are not unanimous (Bandel et al., 2015; Campbell et al., 2015). Spermatogenesis requires a controlled testicular environment and intact endocrine signaling through the hypothalamic- pituitary-testicle axis; and the impact of obesity on fertility can be attributed mainly to the endocrine mechanisms that alter this relationship (MacDonald et al., 2010; Fariello et al. 2012; ASRM, 2015). Moreover, the preferential buildup of toxic substances and fat-soluble endocrine disruptors in adipose tissue, and hyperthermia resulting from the buildup of adipose tissue around the scrotum cause oxidative stress to the testes, thus broadening these alterations (Fariello et al., 2012; Sermondade et al., 2013, Taha et al., 2016). In conclusion, even considering the controversies, weighty reduction and lifestyle interventions should be included in the recommendations to obese infertile couples.

N2  - Introduction: Several epidemiological studies show that women with a history of preeclampsia have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. Few data are available on how those who stay healthy after preeclampsia differ from those who don't. Materials and methods: Women admitted to Danderyd University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden for severe preeclampsia (n=148) between 1999-2004 were invited to participate in a follow up after 11-14 years and 82 agreed to participate. Participants filled in questionnaires on health and family history, on physical activity, stress and sleep patterns. Blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI) and various blood markers were analysed. Data from the index pregnancy were retrieved from medical records Clinical cases & summary results: Of 82 participants, 24 had hypertension or were on antihypertensives at follow up. Of these 24, three had hypertension already before the index pregnancy, all 24 had higher blood pressure in early pregnancy, preeclampsia diagnosed at an earlier gestation and were more often treated for hypertension at discharge after delivery than those that stayed healthy. At follow up these 24 also had a higher BMI and HbA1c. There was no difference in age, family history of cardiovascular disease, physical activity, stress and sleep patterns. Conclusion: Women with high risk for cardiovascular disease after preeclampsia can possibly be identified already at the time of the index pregnancy. (Table Presented).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is impairment of thyroid hormone action due to defect in thyroid hormone receptor beta or alpha. (THR-β/α).It has an autosomal dominant inheritance with incidence of 1:40,000 to 1:50,000 live births. There are about 1000 cases identified in 400 families worldwide. Phenotypical manifestations vary and can include palpitations, hyperphagia, and goiter. Women with RTH often have a high rate of miscarriage. Unaffected fetuses are spontaneously aborted at 3-4 times the rate of affected fetuses and are often born with low birth weight and transient suppression of TSH. Live birth rate in RTH women carrying unaffected fetuses improved with the addition of propylthiouracil (PTU) during pregnancy. We gave PTU to such a patient as a test prior to planned IVF, and she developed PTU- induced hepatitis. CLINICAL CASE: A 30 year old female was found to have RTH during a workup for infertility. She has a 4 year old daughter whom she had no problems conceiving. She subsequently had 2 miscarriages at 7 weeks and 9 weeks gestation. She failed 2 rounds of IVF and has 5 embryos preserved. TSH was 1.55 uIU/ml (0.45-4.5), Free T4 2.36 ng/dL (0.82-1.77), Free T3 4.9 pg/ml (2-4.4). Anti-TPO antibody were negative, anti-TG antibody were positive. Genetic analysis showed p.ARG429GLN mutation in the THRB gene. All other infertility workup was negative. On history, she reports a 'high metabolism' since she was young. She eats a lot to maintain her weight at her stable BMI of 18. She has tachycardia if she has caffeine. She denies any abnormalities in menstrual pattern, bowel movements, sleep pattern, skin or hair. Neither her parents nor her daughter have had genetic testing yet, but her mother had several miscarriages and was told her Total T4 was high normal. Her daughter is healthy except that she has difficulty in gaining weight. Because she had the option to genetically screen her remaining embryos and to choose an unaffected one, we decided to see how she tolerated PTU so that she could take it during her pregnancy. Unfortunately, 1 month into therapy she developed fever and nausea and was found to have acute hepatitis with total bilirubin of 7 mg/dL, ALT- 1502 IU/L, AST- 904 IU/L, which improved after discontinuation of PTU. CONCLUSION: Treatment of RTH syndrome can be challenging. Symptomatic treatment is all that is usually recommended. In our case, we tried to see if PTU may help her to maintain pregnancy if she conceives naturally or with a genetically selected unaffected embryo. Given the above adverse event, her options are limited. She can attempt to implant an affected embryo which has a greater likelihood of survival. If the affected embryo is male, he will not have the same issue of carrying a successful pregnancy, but he could pass on the gene. Selecting an unaffected fetus carries a high risk of miscarriage or low birth weight..

N2  - Background: National guidelines in the UK, United States of America, Canada, and Australia have recently stressed the importance of identifying and treating antenatal anxiety and depression. However, there is little research into the most effective and acceptable ways of helping women manage their symptoms of anxiety and stress during pregnancy. Research indicates the necessity to consider the unique needs and concerns of perinatal populations to ensure treatment engagement, highlighting the need to develop specialised treatments which could be integrated within routine antenatal healthcare services. This trial aims to develop a brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, with a focus on embedding the delivery of the treatment within routine antenatal care. Methods/Design: This study is a two-phase feasibility trial. In phase 1 we will develop and pilot a brief intervention for antenatal anxiety, blended with group support, to be led by midwives. This intervention will draw on cognitive behavioural principles and wider learning from existing interventions that have been used to reduce anxiety in expectant mothers. The intervention will then be tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial in phase 2. The following outcomes will be assessed: (1) number of participants meeting eligibility criteria, (2) number of participants consenting to the study, (3) number of participants randomised, (4) number of sessions completed by those in the intervention arm, and (5) number of participants completing the post-intervention outcome measures. Secondary outcomes comprise: detailed feedback on acceptability, which will guide further development of the intervention; and outcome data on symptoms of maternal and paternal anxiety and depression, maternal quality of life, quality of couple relationship, mother-child bonding, infant temperament and infant sleep. Discussion: The study will provide important data to inform the design of a future full-scale randomised controlled trial of a brief intervention for anxiety during pregnancy. This will include information on its acceptability and feasibility regarding implementation within current antenatal services, which will inform whether ultimately this provision could be rolled out widely in healthcare settings.

N2  - Background: The FOXG1 congenital variant of Rett syndrome has been described as a clinically identifable pheno-type, called the.,FOXG1 syndrome”, an epileptic-dyskinetic developmental encephalopathy with features of classic Rett syndrome, but earlier onset since the frst months of life. The main phenotype comprises microcephaly, severe developmental delay and dyskinesia. Other features include hypotonia, strabismus, feeding difculties, bruxism, seizures and corpus callosum dysgenesis. Objectives: We present two novel cases with FOXG1 micro-deletion identifed by array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array-CGH). Patient 1: A 6-month-old female infant, born at 38 weeks of gestation after in vitro fertilization, presented with microcephaly, developmental delay, irritability and feeding difculties. A small forehead with bitemporal narrowing, dyspraxia, poor eye contact and strabismus were also noted. At 10 months the proband exhibited focal seizures and required valproic acid treatment. Sleep deprivation EEG showed signs of focal cerebral dysfunction. The brain MRI revealed a septum pellucidum cyst and brain asymmetry. Patient 2: A 3-year-old male who was born after a 33 weeks twin pregnancy, following in vitro fertilization, presented with microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, central hypotonia, strabismus and minor dysmorphic features. At the age of 12 months the proband had seizures. His EEG was normal while the brain MRI showed small and thin corpus callosum. Methods: In both patients, G-banding karyotype was normal, (46, XX) and (46, XY) respectively. In patient 1, the MECP2 gene DNA analysis was normal and further investigation by array-CGH (Agilent Technologies, resolution 200 Kb) was performed. In patient 2, high resolution 4X180K CGH+SNP Agilent Human Genome microarrays with average spatial resolution of 7.9-8.9 Kb were used. Results: In patient 1, array-CGH revealed a 14q12 microde-letion, 4.09 Mb in size. The breakpoints were mapped between genomic coordinates chr14:25,843,560-29,938,629 (GRCh37/hg19) and included FOXG1 and NOVA1 genes. In patient 2, array-CGH analysis revealed two small chromosome aberrations, a 6q22.32-q22.33 microdeletion, 2.1Mb in size, between nucleotides 126665820-128744012 (hg19/build 37) containing 9 genes, and a 1.13 Mb microdeletion at 14q12, between nucleotides 28625754-29758147 (hg19/build 37) encompassing FOXG1 and C14orf23 genes. Discussion: Patient 1 presented with similar features like patients carrying 14q12 deletions except for corpus callosum dysgenesis. NOVA1 gene possibly plays a signifcant role in the regulation of neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Despite the signifcant role of NOVA1 gene, defects of this have not been linked to any human phenotype yet. As our patient's phenotype is in line with the FOXG1 syndrome, it is difcult to estimate the impact of the NOVA1 haploinsufciency. NOVA1 haploinsufciency may act synergistically with FOXG1 deletion or it may cause no diference in the fnal clinical outcome. In patient 2, the 14q12 microdeletion encompasses the FOXG1 gene and the proband's phenotype is also in accordance with the FOXG1 syndrome. The impact of the 6q22.32-q22.33 microdele-tion in the patient's phenotype remains unclear. Such deletions are very rare and they have been linked to mild intellectual dis-ability, microcephaly, heart defects and cleft lip/palate. In conclusion, FOXG1 syndrome should always be considered in patients with early onset severe developmental delay, microcephaly and minor or absent dysmorphic features.

N2  - Introduction: There is a controversy concerning the terminology and definition of rhinitis in pregnancy. Gestational rhinitis is a relatively common condition, which has drawn increasing interest in recent years due to a possible association with maternal obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and unfavorable fetal outcomes. Objective: To review the current knowledge on gestacional rhinitis, and to assess its evidence. Methods: Structured literature search. Results: Gestational rhinitis and rhinitis "during pregnancy" are somewhat similar conditions regarding their physiopathology and treatment, but differ regarding definition and prognosis. Hormonal changes have a presumed etiological role, but knowledge about the physiopathology of gestational rhinitis is still lacking. Management of rhinitis during pregnancy focuses on the minimal intervention required for symptom relief. Conclusion: As it has a great impact on maternal quality of life, both the otorhinolaryngologist and the obstetrician must be careful concerning the early diagnosis and treatment of gestational rhinitis, considering the safety of treatment measures and drugs and their current level of evidence.

N2  - Introduction: Respiratory infections in infants - an actual problem of modern perinatal medicine in Ukraine. Respiratory syncytial virus (RS-virus) infection is a major cause of perinatal and infant mortality the leading cause of lower respiratory tract in infants and young children. RS virus infection are manifests primarily as bronchiolitis and/or viral pneumonia. Materials and methods: 50 preterm infants with clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis or pneumonia were examined in RS markers of infection by immunochromatographic rapid trial of the nasopharynx. Half of the children surveyed were found RS antigen. Clinical cases and summary results: We have established risk factors: premature birth, Down syndrome, congenital heart defect, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, multiple pregnancy, congenital immunodeficiency, lack of breastfeeding. The peak incidence accounted for the winter. The risk of infection was inversely proportional of gestational age. In infants with RS-viral infection observed the following symptoms: fever, cough; cold; wheezing and wheezing; retraction, cyanosis, shortness of breath, reduced hydration, sleep apnea, sepsis. Radiography of the chest reveals emphysematous changes in the lung fields. There have been pockets of focal atelectasis and/or infiltration of the lungs. Laboratory methods: serological - determination of specific antibodies titer in paired blood serum; used for retrospective diagnosis; virological - is the most accurate, but requires 3-7 days; rapid diagnosis of viral antigen - the fastest; should be used as a screening method for children with risk factors. Conclusion: The clinical course of RS-virus infection in newborns is fairly nonspecific. For a quick and accurate diagnosis must be guided by objective data, instrumental and laboratory examination methods with mandatory consideration of risk factors RS viral infection in newborns. Immunochromatographic rapid test is a quick and accessible method for diagnosing RSV in children. Early diagnosis will allow the maximum applied early stages of infection prevention and efficient treatment of sick newborns.

N2  - Case Presentation: An infant born at 35+1 weeks gestation was observed to develop abnormal frequent myoclonic bilateral leg movements and eye rolling during day 3 of life. Each episode, featuring clusters of movements for less than a minute, occurred during sleep. Grimacing was noticed with the episodes. Poor tone, lethargy and feeding difficulties arose concomitantly, necessitating nasogastric feeding. An EEG captured typical episodes without cortical discharges. Investigations including cranial ultrasound, lumbar puncture, blood culture and neurometabolic screen were unremarkable. The infant steadily normalized on NICU and the episodes spontaneously resolved by day 10 of life. It was noted that the baby's mother had been taking prescribed venlafaxine MR 150mg orally once daily throughout the last trimester of pregnancy. We therefore suspected that the infant was experiencing an abstinence syndrome. Literature Review: We conducted a literature review to investigate this phenomenon, which identified some common features with our case. Possible symptoms of venlafaxine withdrawal included movement disorders, lethargy and poor feeding, typically developing between days 2 and 4 of life. Seizure disorders are described, sometimes associated with abnormal EEG activity. Hypertonia, hypoglycaemia and tachypneoa have been reported in addition in other cases. Symptoms usually improved between days 6 to 14 of life. Breastfeeding or low dose venlafaxine to ease withdrawal, and phenobarbitone to control seizures were used in some reports. One study suggested the risk of neonatal abstinence from serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors as a class could be as high as 30%. From a limited evidence base, there were no reported long term sequelae of venlafaxine withdrawal. Conclusions: It is suggested that infants born to mothers using venlafaxine during pregnancy should be observed for signs of withdrawal for several days following delivery. Paediatricians should be aware of the manifestations of this syndrome.

N2  - Introduction: Although the recurrence rates and the risk of death in people with breast cancer have successfully reduced, many studies have indicated an increased association between infertility and cancer-related treatments. Objectives: To understand the situation of fertility desires and symptoms, and further to explore the influence on the factors of fertility desires, after reproductive-age women with breast cancer underwent chemotherapy. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study. The data were collected in 2011-2014 from the reproductive-age female (20-49 years old) who were diagnosed breast cancer in a medical center. The structured questionnaire contained sociodemographic data, MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Taiwan version and Reproductive Intention Inventory. Results: 178 participants were recruited to this study. Their average age was 44 years old (22-53, SD= 5.2). The time of suffering disease was an average of 2.8 years (0.8-4.88, SD= 1.1). Fatigue and sleep problems were showed the most serious, in all symptoms. The score of reproductive protection and pregnancy inclination was 21.1 (SD = 31.6) and 8.6 (SD = 22.3) from the Willingness Percentage Inventory. Linear regression analysis showed younger participants had more willing to protect reproduction (β = -1.8, p <0.01) and to conceive (β = -1.3, p <0.01). If the sleep problems were more severe, the willingness of reproductive protection would be decreased (β = -1.8, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Almost one fifth of reproductive-age women with breast cancer were willing to protect their fertility, especially in the young women. Therefore, fatigue and sleep problems should early deal with for increasing the willingness of reproduction protection.

N2  - The correct management of physical activity (PA) can improve glucose control in patients with GDM. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of controlling the effect of PA performed between the 3 main meals in terms of glucose control and nocturnal sleep quality (NSQ). In 8 patients with GDM, mean age 36.1±4.1 yrs, week of gestation 26.3±7.3, in therapy with diet and insulin (4) and with diet (4), and in 8 age-, sex-, matched healthy controls we evaluated: the daily PA divided into 3 different periods of the day: Evening (9 p.m. to 7.59 a.m.), Morning (8 a.m. to 1.59 p.m.) and Afternoon (2 p.m. to 8.59 p.m.), and NSQ for 1 week [...] by Actigraph GT9X Link, sleep and PA diary. Patients with GDM received diet and glucometer for monitoring glycemia while fasting and 1 hour after meals. The patients' daily PA and its distribution in the 3 different day periods (E.M.A.) was not significantly different from that of controls. Patients had poorer NSQ (76.52%±11.6) than controls (92.8%±2.4;p<0.005), which was correlated to the PA (steps number) performed in the previous A period (r=0.86, p<0.01) and inversely correlated to the sedentary lifestyle in the same length of time (r=0.89, p<0.01). Total evaluated glycemia was correlated with the amount and intensity of PA performed in the previous E.M.A. period (steps number: r=0.29, p<0.01; light: r=0.54, p<0.001; moderate: r=0.22;p<0.05), and inversely correlated to sed entary time (r=-0.46;p<0.001). Fasting glycemia was inversely correlated to PA (steps number) performed in the previous E period (r=0.45;p<0.05); postprandial glycemia was correlated with moderate PA performed in the previous M and A periods (lunch:r=0.52, p<0.01-dinner:r=0.39, p<0.05). The preliminary data of this study suggest that analysis of PA performed between the E.M.A. provides useful information on the condition of women with GDM. The E.M.A. method permits better analysis of the PA effect on glucose control and quality of sleep.

N2  - Studies have showed that prenatal exposure to some endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical developmental period may perturb the function of the affected tissues later in life. To assess the lasting effects of prenatal exposure to a type of known EDCs, di-(2- ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on hypothalamic neuroendocrine system of adult rats, we quantified genes expression profile in three specific nucleus regions of hypothalamus, including the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with corn oil (vehicle control), 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg d DEHP by gavage from gestational days 14 to 19. Around postnatal day 70, six offspring rats for each sex of each group (one offspring per litter) were euthanized. The micropunches from the AVPV, MPN and ARC were dissected for gene expression analysis using a 48 gene TaqMan low-density array. In general, we found thirteen genes' expression levels were changed. These affected genes could be classified into four groups based on their functions, including steroid hormone signaling (Esr1), neurotransmission (Drd2), neuropeptides signaling (Avp, Avpr1a, Crhr1, Kiss1, Kiss1r, Npy, Pomc, Tac3r and Trh) and circadian related (Mtnr1a and Mc3r). In the AVPV, expressions of Crhr1 and Drd2 in male rats wereup-regulated in 2 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.01 for all). For female rats, Tac3r expression was up-regulated in 2 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.01), while Crhr1 in 10 and 50 mg/kg d treatment groups, and Mc3r in 2 mg/kg d treatment group were down-regulated (P < 0.05 for all). In the MPN, Avp in 10 and 50 mg/kg d treatment groups (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), and Tac3r in 10 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.05) were down-regulated in male rats. For female rats, Mtnr1a was up-regulated in 2 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.05), while Avpr1a in 10 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.01), Crhr1 in all treatment groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively), Kiss1r in 50 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.01), and Tac3r in 2 and 10 mg/kg d treatment groups (P < 0.05 for all) were down-regulated. In the ARC of male rats, expressions of Avp in 50 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.05), Trh in 10 and 50 mg/kg d treatment groups (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) were up-regulated, Esr1, Kiss1 and Npy in 50 mg/kg d treatment group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively), and Pomc in all treatment groups (P < 0.01 for all) were down-regulated. No gene's expression was altered in the ARC of female rats. Our study showed the longlasting effects of prenatal DEHP exposure on neuroendocrine gene expression in three specific regions of hypothalamus in adult offspring rats. It indicated the potential influences of prenatal DEHP exposure on the hypothalamic regulation of reproduction, energy metabolism, circadian rhythm and neural behaviors in adulthood.

N2  - The hemangioma is the most common benign liver tumor. The estimated incidence is 0, 4 to 7, 5%, affecting more women than men. Usually hemangioma do not grow bigger than 4 cm in diameter. Hemangioma exceeding this size are called giant hemangioma. They are quite rare and cause pain when being 10 cm in diameter. The article at hand describes the case of a 39 year old female patient with 2 giant hemangioma. It was first diagnosed by coincidence during sonography and soon grew in size, especially during pregnancy. It caused abdominal troubles as well as micturition difficulties and sleep disturbances. Magnetic resonance imaging showed one 13,02 × 14,5 × 16,2 cm sized hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver and one 4,7 × 6,2 × 5,5 cm sized hemangioma in the liver segment II. After two attempts of embolization and due to the minor reduction in size we decided on operational resection. The whole hemangioma was being removed in the sense of a partial hepatectomy of the segments VII (in addition parts of VIII and VI) and II. Both, the operative and post operative process, were without any operation specific complications. At this point there are no standardized operational procedures of how to treat giant hemangioma. It is being recommended, depending on the size, to enucleate the hemangioma or to treat them by resecting parts of the liver. Further more it is not clear which criteria influence the increase of size.

N2  - Background and purpose: Mothers are highly vulnerable during pregnancy and after childbirth. Some problems could even lead to mortality and morbidity after childbirth. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of lifestyle educational package on prevention of postpartum’s health problems in nulliparous mothers. Materials and methods: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 220 nulliparous women in postpartum ward. The subjects were allocated into two groups using block randomization method. Intervention group received face to face training, telephone counseling, booklets and informative text messages (both fathers and mothers), while the control group had no education or training. Any health problem on the day of discharge and two and six weeks after delivery were compared between the two groups using logistic regression test. Results: By lowering the frequency of health problems during pregnancy, the chances of developing some complications including constipation, hemorrhoids, anal fissure, abdominal pain, headache, painful or infected suture, sleep problems during the second and sixth weeks postpartum as well as the chances of having cold and fever, backache, leg cramp, breast pain, nipple fissure, fatigue or weakness, sadness and discomfort and vaginal infection during the sixth weeks of postpartum decreased by more than 50% in educational group compared with the control group. Conclusion: In this study, postpartum lifestyle intervention reduced the chance of developing many health problems. Therefore, more comprehensive interventions should be carried out by healthcare providers during pureperium period in postpartum ward and the health centers for mothers and fathers.

N2  - SWAN is a multi-site, multi-racial/ethnic longitudinal study characterizing the physiological, behavioral, and psychosocial changes that occur during the menopausal transition (MT) and the effect of the MT on subsequent health and age-related diseases. Data collection for 3302 women enrolled at 7 sites in the US began in 1996. Baseline eligibility criteria included: age 42-52 years, uterus and 1+ ovary, no current exogenous hormones affecting ovarian function, at least one menstrual period in the previous 3 months, not pregnant or lactating, and self-identification with a site's designated racial/ethnic groups. About half of each site's sample, recruited from the community, consisted of white women and the other half from one minority population (African-Americans, Japanese, Chinese, or Hispanic). The cohort has thus far completed a baseline visit and 14 annual follow-up visits. SWAN investigators have reported findings on a variety of topics related to the MT, including age at menopause; onset, risk factors for, and duration of vasomotor symptoms; and changes in cognition, sexual functioning, mood, sleep, quality of life, body composition, and sex hormones. Nearly the entire cohort has reached early postmenopause. This presentation will highlight some of the key findings and lessons learned from SWAN. As an example, race/ ethnicity is an important predictor of multiple aspects of the menopause experience, lower risk of depressive symptoms in Chinese women, greater prevalence and longer duration of vasomotor symptoms in African American women, and highest rates of difficulty staying asleep in Caucasian women. SWAN's contributions have helped clinicians and women by increasing our understanding of the factors related to and consequences of the physiologic and symptomatic changes that occur during the MT that will aid in prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.

N2  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate dream anxiety, impulsivity, and chronotypes in patients with dipper/non-dipper hypertension and to compare with healthy controls. Sixty-two patients diagnosed with hypertension and 33 healthy individuals were recruited in this study. A history of current psychiatric illness or psychotropic drug usage, significant cardiac, medical or neurological disease and pregnancy were the exclusion criterias for the study. All patients and healthy controls underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The Van Dream Anxiety Scale, Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsivity Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were administered to all participants. There were two groups; patients with hypertension (dipper, n = 26 and non-dipper, n = 36) and healthy controls (n = 33). No differences between groups among gender (X2 = 4.42 and p = 0.110) and mean age (F = 0.239 and p = 0.795) were found. In patients with hypertension; dream anxiety, impulsivity, depression and trait anxiety scores were significantly higher than healthy controls. Sleep quality was poorer in patients with hypertension and there was no difference according to chronotype between patients and controls. There were no differences between dipper and non-dipper groups according to dream anxiety, sleep quality, impulsivity, state-trait anxiety, and depressive scores. In conclusion, dream anxiety is a previously unaddressed psychological entity that, in addition to anxiety, depression, impulsivity and poorer sleep quality, appears in hypertensive patients. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes would be valuable to elucidate the relationship between dream anxiety and hypertension patterns.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although cramp frequency has been used most commonly as a primary outcome measure in muscle cramp trials, a validated assessment scale which evaluates all aspects of clinically relevant change important to patients is lacking. DESIGN/METHODS: Patients over the age of 18 evaluated at the Prosserman Family Neuromuscular Clinic (Toronto, Ontario) experiencing muscle cramps across different medical conditions including polyneuropathy, motor neuron disease, pregnancy-induced and exercise induced cramps, cramps related to cirrhosis and hemodialysis and idiopathic nocturnal cramps were recruited. Semistructured interviews were taped, transcribed and analyzed. Using data saturation technique, a conceptual framework of cramp severity based on qualitative data of patients' experience was created. RESULTS: Fifteen patients, 8 males and 7 females ranging from 28 to 65 years of age representing all intended cramp etiologies were included in the qualitative assessments. Average duration of the interviews was 27 minutes. Two major domains identified during the interviews were issues relating to cramp severity and cramp impact on daily life. Within cramp severity, cramp duration, intensity, frequency and location were common sub-domains. Within the cramp impact domain, issues related to effects on daytimes activities, impact on sleep, daytime sleepiness and harm experienced from muscle cramps were identified as key features. CONCLUSIONS: Initial qualitative analysis of patients' cramps experience demonstrates that cramp severity including assessment of cramp intensity, duration, frequency and location as well as cramp impact including daytime impairment, sleep impairment and harm from muscle cramps are clinically significant to patients. The cramp experience appears to be consistent across disease states.

N2  - Introduction-Autonomic nervous activity(ANA) is fundamentally important for brain development in preterm period.-Purpose-Investigate the relation between ANA in preterm age and area of brain components in term age.-Subjects-Preterm infants without obvious brain lesions who cared for in Oita University hospital from Nov 2012 to Oct 2015 were enrolled. 23 cases with mean gestation 29w6d, weight 1132 g, and head circumference 26.8 cm were investigated.-Method-Two-hour heart rates were obtained every 2 weeks. We classified the baby's behavioral state from simultaneous video recording. Heart rate variability(HRV) spectrum was analyzed using the MemCalc system. ANA indices examined were normalized low frequency;LFnu(LF-Total power) as sympathetic &parasympathetic function and normalized high frequency;HFnu (HF-Total power) as parasympathetic function. The data on sleep state and in supine position were extracted for analysis. The area of brain components was measured at the level of foramen Monro in axial T2-weighted MRI scans. We measured the areas of whole brain, white matter and gray matter.-Results-A significant positive correlation were found between white matter area and LFnu at 32-33 w, 34-35 w, 36-37 w(P<0.01), and white matter area and HFnu at 34-35 w(P<0.05 Spearman's rho). Gray matter area did not present any correlation to ANA.-Conclusion-Active ANA might be related to white matter development in preterm period. LFnu would be a useful index for the evaluation of ANA.

N2  - Introduction: Activity trackers are used today to quantify the level of activity and are able to quantify health status. This concept is applicable to unborn children. In order to reduce poor perinatal outcome, a sensitive and effective measuring tool to asses fetal activity and wellbeing is needed. Fetal distress can result in a decrease in fetal motility. Nowadays, kick charts, ultrasound, . . . are used to measure fetal movement, but they have their limitations. We previously reported the use off on-body accelerometers to detect fetal activity. Based on this, Belli, a wearable sensor with a single highly sensitive accelerometer, was developed by Bloom Technologies. Here we report the use of Belli, to detect fetal movements and to distinguish between maternal movements. Clinical cases and summary results: A primigravida was admitted to the intensive care unit at 34 weeks of gestation. Ultrasound examination revealed a lateral positioned placenta. Belli was attached beneath the umbilicus, on a supine positioned mother. Figure 1A shows motion intensity as detected in Belli. During the first 7 minutes, maternal motion was detected by Belli but not identified as fetal activity. Figure 1B shows the output of the algorithm, some false positive fetal activities were identified (Fig 1B, green bars). After 7.5 minutes the mother rubbed her belly to wake the baby. This can be seen in Figure 1A and shows an increase in activity. After rubbing an increase in fetal activity was observed. This activity was annotated by the mother based on her perception. The majority of these activities were fetal kicks, the algorithm was able to identify these as such. After 3.5 minutes of intense activity the fetus returned to sleep. The mother did not annotate any activity from this point on. Conclusion: These results indicate that the Belli sensor, with a single high sensitivity accelerometer can be used to detect fetal kick-activity. Furthermore, the sensor was able to demonstrate a good sensitivity and selectivity to detect fetal activity and differentiate from maternal activity. It is clear that such a novel monitoring technology has the potential to deliver more information on maternal and fetal health by providing quantitative measures which are unavailable today.

N2  - Background Uncontrolled studies in human have suggested that memantine might be a suitable option for migraine prophylaxis. Objective To assess the efficacy and tolerability of memantine for migraine prophylaxis. Methods This was a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel-group study. Sixty patients with migraine without aura were randomized using a computer-generated list to receive memantine (10 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in change from baseline in the monthly attack frequency at week 12 between the two groups (using migraine diary). Secondary efficacy measures were assessed using several clinical, functional, and psychological instruments. We performed both complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat analyses (ITT). Results Twenty-five patients in the memantine group and 27 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Patients in the memantine group showed significantly greater reduction (mean change; 3.4; 95%CI, 2.3-4.4) in the monthly attack frequency than the placebo group (mean change, 1.0; 95%CI, 0.3-1.7) (mean difference [MD], 2.3; 95%CI, 1.1-3.5, P <.001). Both CC (MD, 4.9; 95%CI, 2.6-7.2 days), and ITT analyses (MD, 5.2; 95%CI, 2.0-8.5) showed significantly higher reduction in the mean number of migraine days in the memantine group than the placebo group (P <.01). Patients in the memantine group experienced greater reduction in the number of work absence days, severity, and disability score than the patients in the placebo group in both ITT and CC analyses. Changes in quality of life, sleep, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the two groups. Three patients in the memantine group complained of sedation, mild vertigo and nausea, and drowsiness. In the placebo group, one patient complained of nausea and another patient discontinued treatment after 2 weeks due to vertigo. Conclusion Memantine might be a tolerable and efficacious option for prophylaxis in patients with migraine without aura. Tolerability, short duration required for titration, and safety profile in pregnancy might give memantine an advantage over other antimigraine medications. The study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Registration number: IRCT2013120115616N1).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of non-violent, gender-based forms of maltreatment of women by husbands and in-laws [i.e., gender-based household maltreatment (GBHM)] during pregnancy and postpartum; to clarify the role of GBHM in compromising infant health, and whether this role extends beyond that previously observed for intimate partner violence (IPV).
METHODS: Cross-sectional, quantitative data were collected from women (ages 15-35) seeking immunizations for their infants <6 months of age (N = 1061) in urban health centers in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between maternal abuse (perinatal IPV, in-law violence and GBHM) and recent infant morbidity (diarrhea, respiratory distress, fever, colic and vomiting).
RESULTS: More than one in four women (28.4%) reported IPV during their recent pregnancy and/or during the postpartum period, 2.6% reported perinatal violence from in-laws, and 49.0% reported one or more forms of perinatal GBHM. In adjusted regression models that included all forms of family violence and maltreatment, perinatal GBHM remained significantly associated with infant morbidity (AORs 1.4-1.9); perinatal IPV and in-law violence ceased to predict infant morbidity in models including GBHM.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that non-violent expressions of gender inequity (e.g., nutritional deprivation, deprivation of sleep, blocking access to health care during pregnancy) are more strongly associated with poor infant health than physical or sexual violence from husbands or in-laws in urban India. These results strongly suggest the need to expand the conception of gender inequities beyond IPV to include non-violent forms of gendered mistreatment in considering their impact on infant health.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of infant allergic diseases have increased recently, and it may be caused by multiple influences of both genetic and environmental factors from the fetal stage through infancy. In this study, we analyzed a data subset from the South Kyushu and Okinawa (SKO) Study Area of Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS) to determine the relationship of allergic diseases in infants with mothers' characteristics and/or infants' life habits, especially sleeping.
METHODS: A total of 3873 mother-infant pairs from the SKO Regional Center of JECS were included. The mothers responded to questionnaires in the first trimester of their pregnancy and the self-reported questionnaire when their infants were 1 year old. Student's t-test, chi-square test, trend test, and logistic regression analysis were carried out to analyze the associations between the infants' allergic diseases and the mothers' genetic characteristics and/or sleeping habits of infants.
RESULTS: Maternal allergic diseases were significantly associated with increased infant allergy risk (OR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.63-2.27). The number of allergic diseases of mothers was also significantly associated with infant allergy, and the trend test showed an increasing risk of infant allergy (p<0.001). Regarding infants' life habits, the infants who sleep in the prone position had a higher allergic disease risk than those who sleep in other positions (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.17-1.83). These significant associations were observed regardless of the presence of allergy in mothers.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the development of allergic diseases in infants may be caused by the multiple participation of both genetic and environmental factors.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal heart rate (FHR) 'cyclicity' is defined as alternating episodes of low variability (quiet sleep) and reactivity (increased variability and/or accelerations, i.e. active sleep), Fig. 1. Antepartum, the Dawes-Redman normality criteria require at least one episode of FHR reactivity in an hour. During early labour, identification of the nonreactive FHR may also be informative, because of its association with pre-existing fetal compromise such as neurological injury, infection or inflammation (Phelan & Kim, Seminar Perinatol 24,2000) but this has only been subject to limited research (Spencer & Johnson, BJOG 93,1986). We used computerised methods to detect nonreactive FHR patterns in labour at the onset of FHR monitoring and report their incidence and association with perinatal outcome. Materials and methods: All singleton births at Oxford in Jan 1993- Dec 2011, of gestation >35 weeks with intrapartum FHR monitoring of ≥1 hour duration were included, excluded were breech presentations or congenital abnormalities. The first hour of the FHR was analysed regardless of what point in labour the FHR monitoring began. Cases in which FHR monitoring commenced during the latent phase of labour (cervical dilatation <3cm) were included provided they were delivered within 24 hours. Nonreactive FHR was defined automatically as Decelerative Capacity <1 (Georgieva et al, BJOG 128,2014) and no accelerations during the first hour. Severe compromise was a composite outcome of stillbirth, neonatal death (48hrs of intensive care. Clinical cases and summary results: In total 51 000 cases were included, 185 (0.36%) were identified as nonreactive (34% before established labour, 57% in the first stage of labour, 4% in the second stage and 5% with unknown dilatation). Their characteristics were compared with the remaining 50,815 births (Table 1). Those with nonreactive patterns were nearly five times more likely to have severe compromise, twice as likely to have thick meconium and three times more likely to be growth restricted (all significant). There were seven cases of severe compromise in the nonreactive group and 430 in the remaining cases. Thus, the sensitivity of the test was only 1.39%, but because a nonreactive FHR is so rare (0.36%) the false positive rate was also very low (about 3 in 1000). The risk for severe compromise was 1 in 118 for the entire dataset, but increased to 1 in 26 in the nonreactive cases, and to 1 in 5 in the nonreactive cases with thick meconium. Conclusion: Persistently nonreactive FHR in the first hour of intrapartum monitoring is rare. Computerised FHR monitoring can reliably alert clinicians if such a pattern is present. The nonreactive initial FHR detects over 1% of severe compromises early with minimal over-intervention. Moreover, nonreactive initial FHR in the presence of thick meconium presents a 1 in 5 risk for severe compromise, indicating the need for prompt intervention. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background and aims CCHS is considered as a very rare disease. There are two main problems for success: timely diagnosis and ventilation support. It gives a possibility not only to keep life, but also to provide adequate development. We demonstrate the first and successful experience of the CCHS in 30 years of our hospital existence. Methods CCHS was confirmed by the identification of PHOX2B gene mutations. Results The full-term girl from the first pregnancy (date of birth 05.10.2010, Apgar score 9/9) was hospitalized in NICU from maternity hospital for the 6th days of life because of episode of dyspnea and apnea, increasing hypercapnia and hypoxemia. The seizures were absent. The ventilation support was started from second day of life in maternity hospital. Numerous extubation attempts in NICU were unsuccessful. It was noticed that breath frequency decreased to 5/min during sleep and 25/min during wakefulness without ventilation support. These symptoms had given a possibility to think about CCHS. The diagnosis was proved at the age of one month of life by genetics researches in Russia and by Bristol Genetics Laboratory in 2012 year (Head of Laboratory Eileen Roberts). The 12th January 2011 the tracheostomy was made at the age of three month and now ventilation support is carried out in house conditions by the device Resmed Stellar 100 during sleep only. The girl is four years old now and her mental development corresponds to age. Conclusions Our report shows a possibility of high efficiency of maintaining the child with very rare congenital disease for Russia as CCHS.

N2  - Background: Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is one of the most common sleep disorders, affecting between 5% and 10% of the U.S. population.1 However, it has an unclear etiology, and is often over-medicated without a resulting qualitative improvement in lifestyle. It has not been determined whether iliofemoral or iliocaval venous disease resulting from either thrombotic lesions or external compression, has any association with RLS. Methods: A total of 510 patients treated for iliofemoral venous compression syndrome (IVCS) with angioplasty and stenting were documented to have concomitant RLS per NIH screening criteria,2 prior to endovenous revascularization. 367 of the following patients were selected for retrospective research analysis based on pre-procedural selection criteria which included: IVCS with > 60% luminal stenosis, confirmed RLS > 1 year with or without current treatment, diminished quality of life, and clinical signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease. Patients with Diabetes, End stage renal disease, current pregnancy, and Rheumatic disease were excluded from this study. Patients with thrombotic lesions of the iliofemoral veins were also excluded. Following revascularization, patients were followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months with doppler evaluation and asked to rate the severity of their RLS using a scale developed by the International Restless Leg Syndrome study group.3 Results: Of the 367 patients studied, 52% of patients had improvement of their RLS symptoms at 3 months, 90% reported significant relief with cessation of medication(s) within 6 months, and 10% did not have any statistically significant improvement by 6 months (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates a strong relationship between deep vein outflow obstruction, with either iliocaval or iliofemoral stenosis, and RLS. It is suspected that a large population suffers from iliofemoral venous disease, and including this subset of patients in the differential diagnosis for RLS can allow for earlier treatment of IVCS and prevention of RLS.

N2  - Background: The physiological changes of pregnancy may predispose females to develop restless legs syndrome (RLS). Studies evaluating outcomes of RLS symptoms in pregnancy are scarce. Objectives: We examined the risk of preterm birth in pregnant women with and without restless legs syndrome (RLS). Materials and Methods: A cohort study included 231 pregnant women attending Ardabil health care centers for prenatal care and delivery in the period of 2010, without any risk factors for preterm delivery and low birth weight. The instruments used were questionnaires about RLS, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), demographic data, and hemoglobin values. Data were analyzed via SPSS software using descriptive statistics, the t-test, χ2, Fisher's exact test, Pearson's correlation, and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: RLS complicated 43.7 percent of pregnancies. Sleepiness (ESS score > 8) was reported in 36.4% of the subjects with preterm birth and 35.9% of the term group. No significant correlation was found between the ESS score and the term and preterm groups (P = 0.843). The prevalence of preterm birth in the subjects with and without RLS was 69.7% and 30.3%, respectively: As a result, it significantly increased in the RLS group (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Pregnancies complicated by RLS are at increased risk for preterm birth. The improved sleep health of pregnant women could decrease pregnancy complications.

N2  - Insomnia affects 10% to 30% of the population with a total cost of $92.5 to $107.5 billion annually. Short-term, chronic, and other types of insomnia are the three major categories according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd ed. The criteria for diagnosis are difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, or early awakening despite the opportunity for sleep; symptoms must be associated with impaired daytime functioning and occur at least three times per week for at least one month. Factors associated with the onset of insomnia include a personal or family history of insomnia, easy arousability, poor self-reported health, and chronic pain. Insomnia is more common in women, especially following menopause and during late pregnancy, and in older adults. A comprehensive sleep history can confirm the diagnosis. Psychiatric and medical problems, medication use, and substance abuse should be ruled out as contributing factors. Treatment of comorbid conditions alone may not resolve insomnia. Patients with movement disorders (e.g., restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder), circadian rhythm disorders, or breathing disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) must be identified and treated appropriately. Chronic insomnia is associated with cognitive difficulties, anxiety and depression, poor work performance, decreased quality of life, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Insomnia can be treated with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Nonpharmacologic therapies include sleep hygiene, cognitive behavior therapy, relaxation therapy, multicomponent therapy, and paradoxical intention. Referral to a sleep specialist may be considered for refractory cases.

N2  - Introduction The circadian clock plays an important role in several aspects of female reproductive biology. Evidence linking circadian clock-related genes to pregnancy outcomes has been inconsistent. We sought to examine whether variations in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of circadian clock genes are associated with PA risk. Methods Maternal blood samples were collected from 470 PA case and 473 controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip platform. We examined 119 SNPs in 13 candidate genes known to control circadian rhythms (e.g., CRY2, ARNTL, and RORA). Univariate and penalized logistic regression models were fit to estimate odds ratios (ORs); and the combined effect of multiple SNPs on PA risk was estimated using a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS). Results A common SNP in the RORA gene (rs2899663) was associated with a 21% reduced odds of PA (P < 0.05). The odds of PA increased with increasing wGRS (Ptrend < 0.001). The corresponding ORs were 1.00, 1.83, 2.81 and 5.13 across wGRS quartiles. Participants in the highest wGRS quartile had a 5.13-fold (95% confidence interval: 3.21-8.21) higher odds of PA compared to those in the lowest quartile. Although the test for interaction was not significant, the odds of PA was substantially elevated for preeclamptics with the highest wGRS quartile (OR = 14.44, 95%CI: 6.62-31.53) compared to normotensive women in the lowest wGRS quartile. Discussion Genetic variants in circadian rhythm genes may be associated with PA risk. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings and to further elucidate the pathogenesis of this important obstetrical complication.

N2  - Introduction: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with increased risk of prematurity and neurodevelopmental delay. FGR alters sleep state distribution in utero and delays circadian rhythm maturation in infancy. Currently, few studies have investigated the longterm consequences of FGR on sleep. Accordingly, we assessed effects of FGR on sleep during childhood. Materials and methods: Overnight polysomnography was performed on children aged between 5 and 12. Three groups of children were studied: (1) 11 preterm FGR children (born at 30 ± 1 weeks' gestation; birth weight: 1117 ± 125 g, mean ± SEM), 6 preterm children (born at 30 ± 1 weeks' gestation; birth weight: 1627 ± 331 g) with appropriateweights for their gestational age (AGA) and 10 termborn (control) children. Children were classified as FGR if they had evidence of absent or reversed end-diastolic flow of the umbilical artery on their fetal Doppler ultrasounds, indicating placental insufficiency. Non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) were scored in the following stages NREM1 (N1), NREM2 (N2), NREM3 (N3) and REM sleep. Total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO %) and sleep efficiency (SE %) was assessed. Results: There were no differences for either age or weight at the time of testing between the three groups studied. Compared with term and preterm AGA born children FGR children had a higher amount of N2 sleep (preterm FGR children 59 ± 1% vs term children 45 ± 2% vs preterm AGA children 39 ± 2%, p < 0.05) and a lower amount of N3 sleep (preterm FGR children 25 ± 1% vs term children 29 ± 3% vs preterm AGA children 35 ± 4%, p < 0.05). Preterm AGA children had reduced SE%, TST and higher WASO compared with IUGR (p < 0.05) and term children (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Preterm birth and FGR have long-lasting effects on sleep in children. N3 sleep is important for brain maturation and consolidation of memory and poor sleep is associated with impaired neurocognition in childhood. Sleep disturbance and its potential impact on neurodevelopment in FGR and preterm children warrants further investigation.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is very common during pregnancy, and is most likely explained by hormonal, physiological and physical changes. Maternal obesity, one of the major risk factors for SDB, together with physiological changes in pregnancy may predispose women to develop SDB. SDB has been associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, early identification, diagnosis and treatment of SDB are important in pregnancy. This article reviews the pregnancy-­ related changes affecting the severity of SDB, the epidemiology and the risk factors of SDB in preg- nancy, the association of SDB with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and screening and management options specific for this population.

N2  - Introduction: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is one of the most common problems in pregnancy. This related to high morbidity and complications of both maternal and fetal outcomes. Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy (OSA) is also a problem of concern. The combination of GDM and OSA is far more complicated. Materials and methods: Prospective study demonstrated predictors and factors associated with OSA in gestational diabetes patients. Participants were enrolled to screening OSA with complete sleep questionnaire information and physical examination. The OSA was evaluated by using portable monitoring devices. An apnea-hypopnea index >5 times/h. was diagnosed as OSA. Factor associated gestational diabetes patients with and without OSA was compared by Student's t-test. The predictors related to OSA were performed after adjust other potential confounding factors by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: All 33 gestational diabetes patients were recruited to the study. Mean age was 33.24 + 3.79 years. Mean gestational age at enrollment was 18.11 + 6.11 weeks. The mean body weight pre pregnancy was 71.56 + 18.65 kg. There were 18 patients (54.55 %) diagnosed with pre pregnancy obesity by BMI > 28 kg/m2. OSAwas diagnosed in 16 pregnant patients with diabetes. Incidence of OSA in gestational diabetes is 48.5%. Gestational diabetes OSA patients had significantly higher pre pregnancy body weight and body mass index (BMI) compared with non OSA patients (body weight 80.69 + 21.44 kg, compared with 62.97 + 10.16 kg, p = 0.004; BMI 31.90 + 8.88 compared with 25.00 + 3.32, p = 0.005). Gestational diabetes OSA patients had higher pre pregnancy obesity more than non OSA patients. (obesity 75.00% compared with 35.29%; p = 0.037) Neck circumference in OSA group was also significantly higher than in non OSA group (36.47 + 3.65 cm, compared with 34.41 + 1.51 cm; p = 0.04). Body weight pre pregnancy remained the only significant predictor of OSA in gestational diabetes patients with odds ratio 1.17 and 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.36. Conclusion: The incidence of OSA in gestational diabetes patients was high. The body weight pre pregnancy is a great predictor for OSA in gestational diabetes patients. The pre pregnancy body weight, BMI, pre pregnancy obesity and neck circumference were important factors associated to OSA in gestational diabetes patients.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes and identify the effects of demographic and disease-related characteristics and physical activity on poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Materials and methods: The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Two hundred fifty patients with type 2 diabetes who were followed by a diabetes outpatient clinic in Ankara, Turkey were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria were aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 1 month, ability to communicate in Turkish and agreeing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were a severe comorbid condition, major psychiatric disorder, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, alcoholism, pregnancy, lactation, clinical instability and working in the night shift. The study group consisted of 180 patients (59.4% female). This study was approved by the Hospital's Local Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data were collected through face-to-face structured interviews and medical records. A questionnaire form, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQS) were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, reliability analyses and logistic regression analysis were used for the analysis of data. The level of significance was set at 0.05 in all tests. Results: The patients' mean age was 55.4 ± 17.1 years (range = 19- 88) and the median disease duration was 108 months (range = 1- 575). The global PSQI mean score of the patients was 7.1 ± 4.2 (range for subscales = 0-3) and 63.3% had poor sleep quality (PSQI ≥ 5). The median ESS score was 4 (range = 0-24). The excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS ≥ 10) was reported by 21.7% of the patients. Patients who took care of themselves (odds ratio (OR) = 0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22-0.91), those who had financial difficulties (moderate income vs. adequate income: OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.04-4.52, inadequate level vs. adequate income: OR = 4.19; 95% CI: 1.20-14.71, respectively), those with poor self-rated health (OR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.20-0.95) and patients who had a higher waist circumference (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06) were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Excessive daytime sleepiness was more common among patients who had a higher body mass index (OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02-1.16) and postprandial plasma glucose (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.01) and those with poor sleep quality (OR = 4.18; 95% CI: 1.51- 11.60). The IPAQ-S score was not associated with poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness were prevalent among patients with type 2 diabetes. This study emphasized the importance of implementing appropriate interventions by taking into account the factors contributing to the poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with type 2 diabetes.

N2  - Introduction: The function of sleep has not been understood yet. A popular belief, proposes that sleep is there for the body and the brain to rest. This paper shows that there is a correlation between sleep and weight among the mammals and an explanation based on Earth environment is proposed. Materials and methods: The paper is essentially based on experiments performed by Michel Jouvet, Lyon, and results collected by Sushil K. Jha, New Delhi. The conclusions reached by Jerome M. Siegel, Los Angeles, in “Clues to the functions of mammalian sleep” follow our result but the interpretation given here is more general and applies to all species. A further extensive and attentive review of the existing literature has been used to make a correlation between the total sleep time and the weight of more than 100 mammalian species. When the values for the weight of an animal species are different a mean value has been taken, and the same applies for the sleep duration. It is expected that for life sciences, results do show a trend and do not adhere to a mathematical law. Sleep of the human species follows the general finding. Theories proposed to explain the duration of sleep in mammals based on arguments like predator fear, gestation time, length of hindguts, parasitical protection, have been examined. Results: The Total Sleep Time has been plotted agains weight value for the 100 species. The tendency curve obtained shows a clear variation of the total sleep time with the weight. The heavier animals sleeping less than the light animals. This finding was already noted by a few authors, and in particular by Siegel who sees different slopes in the curves, depending on whether the mammal is vegetarian, carnivore or omnivore. Here the interpretation given for this trend, is that the level of adaptation to the environment and the conditions of life on earth, and the permanent presence of gravity can be the explanation. This adaptation to gravity, is analysed for the elephant and the little brown bat at the two ends of the scale. If gravity plays a role in sleep duration, then the sleep of fishes can be easily interpreted, the weight of the fishes in water is null because of the Archimedes' force. A straightforward conclusion do not apply to the sleep of reptiles, amphibians. For birds, the trend also indicates that heavy birds sleep less than light birds, but the scattering of the points is so large that this result has to be taken with precaution. Conclusion: Gravity is a price to pay for life on Earth. For the first time, a possible explanation of the duration of sleep in mammals is found. The weight is a sign of a good adaptation to gravity and the heavier animals sleep less.

N2  - Introduction: Short sleep in infancy has been identified to be associated with childhood obesity in Western literatures. However, limited longitudinal evidence exists for Taiwanese children. The aim of this study was to investigate the longitudinal association between sleep status and body weight changes in healthy children from birth to 2 years. Materials and methods: A convenient sampling technique were used to recruit interested primparous (singleton delivery) mother- newborn pair at a medical center located in North Taiwan. The newborns were eligible for a 2-year follow-up if the following criteria are met: (1) ≥ 37 weeks gestation, (2) birth weight ≥ 2500 g, (3) discharge from newborn nursery (baby-room) or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) without significant neonatal mobility, and (4) nursery or NICU stay less than 7 days. One hundred and fifty-three eligible newborns were recruited. Eligible newborns were scheduled for collecting sleep and anthropometric data every half-year from the first week after birth to second-year of age. Sleep assessment was performed in the home environment by mother-reported infant sleep diary, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire, and an actiwatch to monitor movement of the child. Data were analyzed based on the study aims. Results: The study results identified that infant sleep patterns are positively associated with body weight status from birth to 2 years-old. Poor sleeping status is not associated with body weight development among the age group of 0-2 years. Conclusion: This study described sleep patterns in a sample of healthy 0 to 2 year-old Taiwanese children. However, sleep problems of this age range did not affect their weight development in this study. More subject involvement in the future will be helpful to confirm the results.
