N2  - The decisions of if and when to have a first child are very important for any woman or couple. This paper develops a model to examine when a woman should begin trying to conceive, which depends on the personal circumstances and values of each woman. The model incorporates separate objectives for a woman's professional, social, and family aspects of life and integrates them into a quality-of-life function that includes the changing relative importance of these aspects with age over a woman's life. Descriptions of the relative quality of each of these three aspects of a woman's life are modeled over time for different cases. One case involves no child and other cases involve the woman giving birth at different ages from 21 to 50. The probabilities of conceiving when trying, as a function of a woman's age, are included. The relative pros and cons of waiting until the late thirties to have a child to avoid perceived detrimental impacts on one's career or social life are investigated. Several illustrations are included in the paper to demonstrate insights that can be generated using the model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Treatment in Psychiatry begins with a hypothetical case illustrating a problem in current clinical practice. The authors review current data on prevalence, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. The article concludes with the authors' treatment recommendations for cases like the one presented. The current article discusses two case studies. The first is a 30-year old woman, 6 weeks postpartum, who feels as if a "a curtain descended upon" her. Her symptoms include low mood, tearfulness, decreased sleep and appetite, significant weight loss, and anhedonia. She feels she cannot care for her son properly and has intrusive thoughts that some unspecified harm may come to him. The other case study looks at a 27-year-old woman with a history of recurrent major depression since age 18 presents for a consultation during her second trimester of pregnancy. The patient has a history of nonresponse to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been hospitalized twice for severe depressive episodes.

N2  - The IV All-Russian Symposium on Slow Oscillatory Processes in the Human Body and the II School/Seminar on Nonlinear Dynamics in Physiology and Medicine were held at the Laboratory of the Physiology of Slow Wave Processes. The scope of the symposium and school/seminar was substantially widened compared to previous symposia. The lecture by N.I. Kolchanov (Novosibirsk) dealt with the molecular genetic aspects of the complexity of, and control over, physiological processes. The circadian rhythm gene networks consisting of hierarchically organized oscillators were considered in terms of the symposium subject, with special emphasis on the generation and synchronization of oscillatory processes at the molecular genetic and physiological levels. The concluding part of the lecture concerned the molecular epidemiology of lipid metabolism. The factors of the current epidemic of obesity in the United States were discussed. The results of the spectral analysis of the heart rate wave dynamics in women were used to show the approaches to noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and prediction of pathological processes and complications of pregnancy and childbirth, including those related to the development of energy deficiencies in the mother. The achievements of Russian researchers serve as the basis for large-scale clinical implication of the promising developments in the field of functional diagnosis based on the slow-wave analyses of hart rate and other physiological processes.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor neurological disorder. It usually appears when patients try to relax in the evening or to sleep at night with, sometimes, unpleasant restless feelings in their legs and/or need to move them which can be relieved by movement or walking. RLS is a very common condition and, often, disabling; epidemiological studies suggest that it affects 5-10% of the general population in the United States and Northern Europe. It occurs typically in adults and elders, but it can affect also children. The prevalence and severity of RLS increase with age and its incidence in women is the double than in men. The most frequent form of RLS is idiopathic, but it can occur as a consequence of or in association with a series of different clinical conditions, such as iron deficiency, pregnancy, renal failure, spinocerebellar ataxia, spinal stenosis, polyneuropathies, lumbosacral radiculopathy, and Parkinson's disease. The current therapeutic approach is based on dopamine-agonists which are usually effective for the relief of the subjective symptoms and motor disturbances which precede and accompany RLS patients' sleep. The knowledge of this syndrome is important for the real possibility to modify positively its disturbing symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Richter fully appreciated the fundamental biological importance of sex differences, in particular the challenges of female reproductive function to the two classes of behavior that most engaged him, endogenous rhythms and "self-regulatory" behaviors. Indeed, his contributions in these areas justify honoring him as one of the founders of behavioral neuroendocrinology. During the 1920s Richter, together with Wang, Kinder and other students, performed elegant phenomenological and mechanistic studies of sex differences in rats' spontaneous locomotor activity, nest building, and food intake. All of these behaviors display rhythms entrained to the ovarian cycle in female rats, and Richter's analyses of them formed the bases of many current areas of behavioral neuroscience. Slightly later, Richter made fundamentally important discoveries related to nutrient self-selection in pregnant and lactating rats, including changes in micronutrient and macronutrient selection. These data played a major role in the development of his concept of behavioral regulation of homeostasis. Unfortunately, some of these discoveries are rarely recalled. This is both historically regrettable and potentially an impediment to contemporary research progress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, especially at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 350 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, 3 times per day, from day E14 until birth, and the pups allowed to mature. Intracellularly recorded PPN neurons in 12-21 day rat brainstem slices were tested for intrinsic membrane properties, including the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih, which is known to drive oscillatory activity. Type II (A-current) PPN cells from 12-16 day old offspring of treated animals had a 1/2max Ih amplitude of (mean ± SE) 4.1 ± 0.9 mV, while 17-21 day cells had a higher 1/2max Ih of 9.9 ± 1.1 mV (p h of 1.3 ± 0.1 mV, which was lower (p h of 3.3 ± 0.3 mV, which was also lower (p < 0.01) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring. In addition, changes in resting membrane potential [control -65. ± 0.9 mV (n=32); exposed -55.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], and action potential (AP) threshold [control -56.5 ± 0.7 mV (n = 32), exposed -47.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], suggest that prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke induced marked changes in cells in the cholinergic arm of the RAS, rendering them more excitable. Such data could partially explain the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders.

N2  - Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved by movement, and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day. All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features to confirm the diagnosis. Whilst many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, or in those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients quality of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In rodents, during late embryonic and early neonatal development, circadian rhythms develop in synchrony with those of their mothers, which in turn are synchronized with the environmental photoperiod. This paper examines the effect of maternal ganglionectomy (pineal gland sympathetic denervation) or extirpation of the pineal gland on pups' drinking rhythms, a behavior that is continuously monitored in individual animals starting after weaning and studied up to 3 weeks later. Maternal ganglionectomy or pinealectomy performed on the 7th day of gestation significantly disrupts rat pups' drinking behavior, within and among litters. In both treatments, circadian rhythm characteristics of the free-running period (tau), phase, amplitude and alpha were significantly altered compared to those of the control pups born from sham-operated mothers. With the exception of the alpha component, both maternal treatments have similar effects. When melatonin was given to the mothers instead of the endogenous pineal secretory activity for 5 days during the late period of gestation, this treatment reversed the effects of maternal ganglionectomy and pinealectomy. These observations, together with previous studies of our group, indicate that the maternal superior cervical ganglia and pineal gland are necessary components of the mechanism for maternal synchronization, and that maternal melatonin may, directly or indirectly, affect the performance of the pups' central oscillator during early pup rat development.

N2  - Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient.

N2  - Sentience and consciousness are prerequisites of suffering. Thus, animals must have sufficiently sophisticated neural mechanisms to receive sensory information and to transduce this information into sensations, and they must also be conscious to be able to perceive those sensations. Moreover, those sensations must be sufficiently noxious or aversive to cause suffering. The neural apparatus of embryos and fetuses of farm animals is inadequate to support sentience for at least the first half of pregnancy, but the required structures and mechanisms do develop by the time of birth. Thus, although one of the preconditions for suffering is satisfied shortly before birth, the embryo and fetus are apparently never conscious for the following reasons. The embryo-fetus initially does not have brain structures that are functionally capable of supporting consciousness, and subsequently, when the fetal brain might have that capability, it displays electrical activity indicating a continuous state of sleep and therefore unconsciousness. Furthermore, the fetus is apparently actively maintained in sleep-like states by several endogenous neuroinhibitory mechanisms which involve adenosine (a potent neuroinhibitory and sleep inducing agent), allopregnanolone and pregnanolone (two neurosteroidal anaesthetics), prostaglandin D₂ (a potent sleep-inducing hormone), a placental neural inhibitor, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation. Consciousness evidently appears for the first time only after birth. This results from a substantial withdrawal of the neuroinhibitors, especially adenosine, and the involvement of neuroactivators including 17β-oestradiol (a potent neuroactive steroid with widespread excitatory effects in the brain), noradrenaline (released from excitatory locus coeruleus nerves that extend throughout the brain), and a barrage of novel sensory information associated with the newborn's first exposure to air, gravity, hard surfaces, unlimited space and, usually, to cold ambient conditions. We conclude that the embryo and fetus cannot suffer before or during birth. Furthermore, we conclude that suffering can only occur in the newborn when the onset of breathing oxygenates its tissues sufficiently to substantially reduce the dominant adenosine inhibition of brain electrical activity. The implications of these observations for managing fetuses and newborns in ways that minimise suffering are considered briefly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 20 weeks). They were designated depressed (N = 172) or nondepressed (N = 258) on the Structured Clinical Interview of Depression (SCID) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). They were given a second assessment when they were approximately 32 weeks gestational age. At both assessments they were given self-report measures (CES-D, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the State Anger Inventory) and provided urine samples for assays of cortisol, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) and serotonin. They were also given the VITAS scale for lower back pain and leg pain and a sleep disturbance scale. The stability of mood states and biochemistry across pregnancy (20 and 32 weeks) were assessed inasmuch as mood states, and biochemistry have been noted to predict prematurity and low birthweight. Significant correlations were noted for all variables except serotonin. Relationships between mood states and biochemistry were also noted but only between cortisol and depression, cortisol and anxiety, and epinephrine and anxiety. Significant stability was noted between the 20-week measures and the 32-week measures including depression, anxiety, anger, and cortisol. These were, in turn, correlated with each other and with, low back pain, leg pain, and sleep disturbance. These data suggest the stability of mood states and cortisol across pregnancy.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to describe the association between the regularity of sleep patterns for first-time Japanese mothers in the early postpartum period and the sleep and wake activity of their infants and partners. Longitudinal time-series studies of 101 healthy Japanese childbearing couples were conducted between May 2002 and January 2003. Data were obtained from couples at 32-6 weeks pregnancy and 4-5 weeks after birth. The questionnaire packet for each father and mother included a demographic questionnaire, a sleep-wake log for 7 days, a social rhythm metric for 7 days and a morningness-eveningness questionnaire. A four-stage hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed in which the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength was the dependent variable. The variance in postpartum sleep-wake rhythm strength for first-time mothers was explained by three predictor variables. Household income, the mother's chronotype during pregnancy and the father's daily social rhythm at 4-5 weeks after birth made unique contributions to the variance (24.7%) in the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks postpartum. A mother's own tendency to be a morning or evening chronotype and the regularity of the father's daily schedule of activities appear to influence first-time mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength during early postpartum recovery more than disruptions from the infant's sleep-wake activity itself. Health-care providers should counsel couples on how factors associated with the parents themselves may impact on the regularity of a mother's sleep patterns.

N2  - Objective: To examine the extent to which maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits are associated with obesity and overweight in 5-year-old Japanese children. Research Method and Procedures: We studied 1417 mother-child pairs enrolled in Project Enzan--a prospective cohort study. The dependent variables, childhood overweight and obesity, were defined with an international cut-off value. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits were used as independent variables. Results: Maternal smoking habits were associated with overweight in the 5-year-old children [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 4.11]. Maternal sleep duration of ≥8 h/d negatively affected childhood overweight (adjusted OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.04). Children whose mothers skipped breakfast were likely to become overweight (adjusted OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.77). The results of childhood obesity analysis were similar to those of childhood overweight analysis. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that there are effects of smoking during early pregnancy and other maternal lifestyle habits on the onset of childhood obesity in Japan. Therefore, interventions in maternal lifestyle habits are required to prevent childhood obesity, and these interventions should be initiated before pregnancy.

N2  - Bed-sharing among Barbadian mothers and infants was studied in relationship to maternal and infant characteristics. This prospective study followed 226 healthy, well-nourished mother-infant dyads at birth, 7 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum. At each age, approximately half of the infants shared the same beds as their mothers. Bed-sharing was associated with demographic characteristics, especially fewer home conveniences, and also maternal characteristics, including less information seeking by the mother and younger maternal age at first pregnancy. Bed-sharing was also associated with lower infant birth weights. Maternal moods were significantly correlated with bed-sharing, such that mothers who reported having more despair and anxiety were also more likely to sleep with their infants. Bed-sharing was also significantly associated with increased breastfeeding at all infant ages, but this relationship was no longer significant once the effects of maternal moods were controlled. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing maternal moods in studies evaluating the risk and benefits of bed-sharing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Fetal behavioral states are important indicators of fetal physiology and pathology associated to typical fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. Aim: To provide linear and nonlinear analysis of FHR patterns associated with fetal behavioral states regarding a better understanding of these states and patterns. Study design and subjects: Fifty FHR tracings from normal term pregnancies with a median duration of 40.3 min were acquired with the SisPorto® 2.01 system for computerized analysis of cardiotocograms. Each tracing was divided into consecutive 10-minute segments and each segment was classified by two experts as pattern A, B, C or D. Outcome measures: Linear and nonlinear indices were computed in each segment, namely mean FHR, long-term irregularity index (LTI), very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency spectral indices, approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). Kappa statistic (κ) and proportions of agreement (Pa) were used for assessment of inter-observer agreement. Bootstrap percentile confidence intervals and nonparametric statistical tests were calculated for statistical inference. Results: Overall agreement between experts in pattern classification was good to excellent with values for κ and Pa of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.94) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96), respectively. Most linear domain indices increased significantly with rising fetal activity whereas the opposite occurred with nonlinear indices, except for SampEn(2, 0.1). LF/(MF + HF) ratio also significantly increased with fetal activity, denoting an increased sympatho-vagal balance. Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that entropy and linear variability indices measure different FHR features. FHR patterns associated with active sleep (B) and active wakefulness (D) evidenced more signs of autonomous nervous system activity, with sympatho-vagal imbalance, and less signs related to complexity or irregularity control systems than patterns associated with calm sleep (A) and calm wakefulness (C).

N2  - Study objectives: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). Design: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. Setting: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone. Participants: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 ± 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 ± 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 ± 6.34 years). Interventions: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors. Measurements and Results: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors. Conclusion: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

N2  - The primary goal of this study was to examine sleep problems in a sample of cocaine-exposed 7-month-old infants and to determine if maternal psychopathology mediated any existing association between substance exposure and sleep behaviors. We also examined the differences in sleep behaviors of cocaine-exposed infants in parental custody and cocaine-exposed infants in nonparental custody. Participants were 65 cocaine-exposed and 53 nonexposed infants and their primary caregivers who were recruited at delivery and assessed at 7 months of infant age. As expected, women who used cocaine during pregnancy had more psychiatric symptoms than nonusers. Prenatal exposure to heavier amounts of cocaine was significantly related to more severe sleep difficulties, and maternal anxiety mediated this association. Approximately 28% of cocaine mothers lost custody of their infants by 7 months of age. Nonmaternal caregivers had significantly fewer symptoms of psychopathology than the cocaine-using women who retained custody of their children. Infants who were in nonparental care at 7 months of age also had less severe sleep problems than did infants who remained in parental care.

N2  - The patient was a 15 year-old Caucasian female, 7 weeks pregnant when she presented to our outpatient clinic for increased irritability. Her current stressors were her pregnancy and subsequent termination of her relationship with her 16 year-old boyfriend. The patient had a medical abortion at 9 weeks gestation and was re-assessed 8 weeks after this procedure. Within 1 week of her abortion, she developed progressive hoarding behaviours, involving garbage, water bottles and dirty plates, and was eventually unable to sleep in her bedroom due to the collected items. A trial of fluoxetine was initiated at 10 mg per day in conjunction with cognitive-behavioural therapy. Due to her persistent symptoms, her fluoxetine dose was gradually titrated to 50 mg/day and risperidone 0.5 mg at night was added at week 18 to treat residual OCD symptoms and irritability. Her irritability was not suggestive of akathisia or mania. After 22 weeks of CBT and pharmacotherapy treatment, her CY-BOCS and BDI scores decreased to 16 and 14 respectively. She completed a 14 session course of CBT and was maintained on fluoxetine 60 mg and risperidone 0.5 mg per day. After 12-months of treatment, the patient no longer met the criteria for OCD (CY-BOCS = 0), although she had residual depressive symptoms (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Elizabeth Oness describes her sense of loss in a series of miscarriages. When our son was two years old, blue-eyed and precocious, strangers started telling me it was time to have another baby. I did want another child, or part of me did, but I was tired, physically and mentally, of juggling household logistics and childcare with my husband. We had just finished our PhDs without putting our son in day care. Motherhood was consuming, but right after my husband landed a tenure-track job in La Crosse, Wisconsin, we decided to have another child. Of course, I weighed it all: another baby, more insanity, more distraction, less sleep. I felt anxious about the idea that a second child would cut further into my writing time, but decided this was the time to do it, since life with a two-year-old was already full of upheaval. I was pregnant twice after Jensen was born, when he was two and a half, and when he turned three. Both times, I passed the "safe" twelve-week mark before losing the pregnancy. When I asked the midwife how long I should wait before getting pregnant again, she told me that I didn't need to wait--after one period I could get pregnant again. Later, searching medical studies on the web, I learned that when a woman gets pregnant within three months of a miscarriage, there's a significantly higher rate of her having another miscarriage or problem pregnancy. I wish someone had told me this. I would have waited, let my body gain a bit more strength--or would I? I didn't question whether it was the right thing to do. Like many women after a miscarriage, I wanted to get pregnant again, right away. And so I did. I lost the third pregnancy at sixteen weeks, a little girl with a profound genetic abnormality. The doctors said it was nothing I'd done. I was older; my eggs were older. It was simply bad luck. Still, I felt that something was terribly wrong--in the cosmic sense--that this should happen again. I consulted an acupuncturist, whose diagnosis didn't contradict what the Western doctors had said. It was simply put in different terms. I'd gotten pregnant when I was exhausted and this was the result. The acupuncturist provided specific directions for preparing for pregnancy again, including Chinese herbal regimens and chi management. I told myself that I could be more brave and optimistic, more spiritually centered with the next baby. But the genetic problems with my last pregnancy frightened me, and my desire to have another child didn't outweigh my fear of calamity. And that was it. I realized that if I couldn't conceive a child while feeling a certain measure of happiness and optimism, it simply wasn't the right thing to do. We are still three. And I have this to report: We are just fine. More than fine, we're happy, when not coping with life's vicissitudes. I don't feel regret about choosing not to get pregnant again. My sisters have had children in the last few years, and my nieces and nephews are adorable, but they don't make me want to roll the dice again.

N2  - Background: Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes. Methods: Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have been used for comparison. Findings: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone--rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed. Interpretation: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.

N2  - It is important to consider the potential contribution of seasonality to postpartum depression (PPD; Hiltunen et al, 2004). A possible link between seasonality and PPD may have implications for not only choice of treatment, but also in considering pregnancy planning. The objectives of this pilot study were to examine whether women with seasonal mood changes demonstrated greater incidence of PPD, and to determine if seasonality scores were predictive of PPD. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ; Rosenthal et al, 1987) was used to assess seasonality of mood. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between clinical factors, SAD diagnosis, SPAQ global seasonality score (GSS) and season of SPAQ administration and PPD. In our sample, twice as many women in the PPD group were found to have SAD compared to the control group. The PPD group also had a higher group GSS mean (10.44) than did the control group (8.84). However, logistic regression analysis showed that higher seasonality scores in women with PPD were not necessarily predictive of PPD. While more women in the PPD group reported increased seasonal weight fluctuation and less sleep in the spring and summer, these items alone did not predict depression after childbirth.

N2  - A sample of 750 women were interviewed during pregnancy on their depression and anxiety symptoms, substance use and demographic variables. A subsample was seen again at the neonatal stage (n = 152), and their infants were observed for sleep-wake behavior. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to caffeine use. Mothers who consumed more caffeine also smoked more often, were younger, were less educated, reported less sleep effectiveness and more obstetric complications. Their newborns were lower birthweight, they spent less time in REM sleep, and they showed more stress behaviors including hiccups, tremors and jerkiness.

N2  - Reports in the nursing literature suggest there is benefit when hospitalized premature twins share a single crib. Few studies have been done to support this practice yet many nurses implement co-bedding for premature twins. Case study design was used to study the effect of co-bedding hospitalized preterm twins on selected physiologic variables and behavioral cues. Four sets of premature twins born at 32-35 weeks gestation were observed before and during co-bedding. Neonatal physiologic monitors were used to record heart rate, pulse rate, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation levels. Infant behavior was continuously recorded by surveillance cameras. The Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP)reg; method was used to assess physiologic and behavioral signs of stability and stress before and during co-bedding. A significant increase in stability signs during co-bedding was found in half of the cases. Significant decreases in stress were seen more often during co-bedding than were increases in stability signs. The direction of change in the physiologic measures varied between and within the cases. No detrimental physiologic changes were seen in any infant during the co-bedding period. Infants demonstrated increased sleep and greater sleep/wake synchrony during the co-bedding period. A different pattern of physiologic and behavioral responses to co-bedding was seen in each case. Nurses must consider individual infant responses when implementing co-bedding for premature twins.

N2  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipú Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p=0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p < 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA=SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ=NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to describe depressive symptoms and sleep in first-time mothers. Predictors of postpartum depressive symptoms, including perceived stress, social support, and maternal adjustment were also examined. Another purpose was to compare objective and subjective sleep in mothers with and without depressive symptoms in the third trimester (Time 1) and at 12 weeks postpartum (Time 2). This descriptive, correlational, longitudinal, secondary analysis utilized data from two randomized clinical trials. Depressive symptoms, psychosocial measures, and subjective and objective sleep measures were collected on a sample of 161 first-time mothers between the ages of 18 and 43 years. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Mean CES-D scores at Time 1 (12.2 + 7.0) significantly improved at Time 2 (8.8 + 6.7). However, of the 46 women scoring in the depressed range at Time 1, 32.6% (n = 15) continued to experience depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Of the 115 women with minimal symptoms at Time 1, 7% (n = 8) experienced depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum. Depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance were significantly associated at Time 1 and Time 2. Overall sleep disturbance, minutes to fall asleep, ability to stay asleep, and daytime sleepiness significantly improved from late pregnancy to 12 weeks postpartum. Women with depressive symptoms in the late third trimester and 12 weeks postpartum reported significantly more sleep disturbance, trouble falling asleep and more daytime sleepiness than women without depressive symptoms. Fifty-seven percent of the variance in mothers' depressive symptoms at 12 weeks postpartum was explained by six independent variables. However, antenatal CES-D score alone was a significant predictor of postpartum depression scores, accounting for 16.7% of the variance in depression scores at 12 weeks postpartum. The results of this study underscore the need for health care providers to assess depressive symptoms and sleep during pregnancy and during the first few postpartum months. Furthermore, results suggest that complaints of sleep disturbance, especially prolonged sleep onset latency and increased daytime sleepiness, may be relevant screening questions in relation to risk for postpartum depression.

N2  - This longitudinal, year-long study compared sleep-wake state organization in two groups of infants--infants whose mothers abused substances during their pregnancies and nonexposed, typically developing, age-matched comparison infants--to determine whether differences in sleep-wake state organization existed between the two groups. Seventeen infants of mothers who were participating in a parent-infant residential treatment program for substance abuse were enrolled. Their sleep-wake state organization over the first year of life was compared to that of 17 age-matched comparison infants. The intent was to follow each infant on five occasions over the first year of life using established methods of time-lapse videosomnography to record sleep-wake state organization; however, attrition in the substance-abusing group was problematic. Some sleep-wake variables (i.e., Active Sleep%, Quiet Sleep%, Awake%, number of nighttime awakenings) were similar for both groups of infants at comparable ages across the first year. Total sleep time and the longest sustained sleep period (sleep continuity variables) differed significantly at some of the ages measured. Although overall sleep architecture appears highly resilient and well organized, some indications of sleep fragmentation and shortened nighttime sleep periods were observed in the substance-exposed infants. More research is needed to explain why sleep-continuity variables and not sleep-state proportion variables differed between the two groups.

N2  - Objective: To elucidate the synchronization of phases of diurnal rhythms in fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline between twin fetuses and the occurrence of sustained fetal tachycardia. Methods: FHR was simultaneously recorded in twins for 24 h in 7 monochorionic diamniotic (MD) and 8 dichorionic diamniotic (DD) twin pregnancies at 35 to 38 weeks of gestation. The diurnal rhythms of the hourly mean FHR baseline were tested in each fetus, and the time of occurrence of sustained fetal tachycardia was compared between twins. The correlation coefficients and phase lags of diurnal rhythms between the hourly mean FHR baselines of twins were calculated in each case. Results: There were significant diurnal rhythms in the hourly mean FHR baselines of all twin fetuses (p<0.01). The patterns of diurnal rhythms were similar for each pair of twins, with the exception of the periods of sustained fetal tachycardia. Sustained fetal tachycardia was not coincident between twins. Analysis in which the periods of sustained fetal tachycardia were excluded demonstrated a significant correlation between the hourly mean FHR baselines of twins in all cases (p<0.01). In the case of DD twins, the phase lag between twins was 0; however, phase lags were observed in 4 cases of MD twins. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that the diurnal rhythms in the FHR baseline correlated well between twins, and that the occurrences of sustained fetal tachycardia were completely independent.

N2  - Brief parent-infant psychotherapy is a short-term psychotherapeutic intervention method targeting parents with their child. This type of psychotherapeutic intervention was principally created for babies presenting functional symptoms (sleep or food disorders) or behavioral disorders. During research programs on brief mother-infant psychotherapy, the father sometimes wished to participate in the sessions with the mother and infant. Of course, the therapist accepted and thereafter worked with this triad. Thus, the present authors became interested in studying the specific characteristics of these brief psychodynamic psychotherapies carried out with the mother-father-infant triad. They have emphasized that the "third party role" is not exclusively the privilege of the father. Both parents are equally capable of playing this role in relation to the fantasies of exclusive fusion of his/her spouse with the infant. This paper will also emphasize the clinical impression that the father's and mother's fantasy experiences with their infant are quite similar. Both present oedipal and anaclitic fantasies concerning the child that are related to the problems of separation and loss of the object. The narcissistic parental scenario including the infant corresponds to the defense mechanisms erected by the parents to cope with painful feelings stemming from their past experiences of loss. However, the mother maintains closer biological ties with the child, developed during pregnancy, childbirth, and breast-feeding, that augment the intensity of her anaclitic fantasies. A mother-infant relationship of this type would impel the father to experience feelings of exclusion when faced with this "new" couple. At this point, the father more easily falls prey to oedipal fantasies stimulated by this situation in which the mother-infant relationship relegates him to the role of an outsider. The contrast existing between the conviction with which various authors emphasize the father's importance in mother-infant psychotherapies and the difficulty with which these distinctive elements are demonstrated when the father is present during these treatments has led us to a more systematic review of our clinical practice. For this reason, we have concentrated on the clinical and technical aspects of these cases, which were examined in great detail in our research on brief parent-infant psychotherapy treatments in which the father participated. Our theoretical and technical reflections will be represented through several illustrative clinical cases that demonstrate the types of difficulties encountered in these clinical situations.

N2  - A model of the development of L/M cone ratios in the Old World primate retina is presented. It is supposed that during gestation, the cone cycles randomly between states in which it transcribes either L or M opsin. The current state determines and increases the probability that it will transcribe the same opsin in future cycles. These assumptions are sufficient to formalize the process as a Markov chain that can be modeled as an urn containing two types of balls, L and M. Drawing one ball results in the increase of its species and the decrease of the other. Over the long run, the urn will become populated with a single type of ball. This state corresponds to the photoreceptor adopting a fixed identity for its lifetime. We investigate the effect of the number of states and the rule that regulates the advantage of transition toward one cone type or another on the relation between fetal and adult L/M cone ratios. In the range of 100 to 1000 states, small variations of the initial L/M ratio or the transition advantage can each generate large changes in the final L/M ratio, in qualitative accord with the variation seen in human adult retinas. The time course to attain stable L/M ratios also varies with these parameters. If it is believed that the cycling follows a circadian rhythm, then final L/M cone ratios would be expected to stabilize shortly after birth in the human being and the macaque.

N2  - Background: Emerging evidence on faster growth in preterm infants with higher heart rate as opposed to the classical approach calls for further research. Aims: to test whether (1) high or low heart rate and (2) heart rate during the first days of life predict greater weight gain in preterm infants. Methods: A retrospective study analyzing two daily measures of heart rate obtained during restful sleep, total daily calorie intake and daily weight gain measured always in the morning before meal were collected from the medical files. Results: Analysis of 90 healthy preterm infants born at 32-36 weeks of gestation revealed that increased mean heart rate during hospitalization predicted greater weight gain even when controlling for calorie intake, birth weight, gestational age, appropriateness of birth weight for gestational age, and length of hospitalization. Mean heart rate during the first three days of life yielded the same pattern of results. Post-hoc analysis of variance between infants with mean daily heart rate ≤ 139 bpm vs. ≥ 140 bpm showed that infants with higher heart rate achieved a significantly higher weight gain. Conclusions: It is suggested that, contrary to adults, in neonates an anabolic activity is represented by increased sympathetic functioning within the normal range. The implications of a slower growth rate for additional developmental care and individual considerations of appropriate stimulation in preterm infants are discussed.

N2  - The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, including drug and electroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major chronotherapeutic inventions--light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain longterm improvement.

N2  - Study Objectives: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Design: Cross-sectional, population-based study. Setting: Passo Fundo, Brazil. Participants: 2,285 newborns. Interventions: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed. Measurements and Results: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age ≤ 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. Conclusions: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of this study lies in the future application of this information via public health measures targeted at high-risk populations.

N2  - The interest in studying the brain electrical activity as a function of the development of intelligence has been spurred by the need to understand how the brain responds to environmental information. The description of sleep in mentally retarded children reveals deviant patterns of the EEG-spindles and of the eye movement activity (REM sleep) when compared to normal children. The patterns may be considered as a valuable index of mental function. According to experimental evidence, the distribution of the eye movements of sleep appears either as random or ordered. The latter are altered in the mentally handicapped in whom the appearance out of chaos, of the order which is needed for intelligence and memory to function, is altered. The sleep signs are redundant as from birth. Their pattern is also related to the psychomotor development of the infant. If their distribution remains random, or appears in long uninterrupted sequences of waves as in epilepsy, intelligence does not develop. A similar strategy appears to function in the foetus when nature organizes the structures that will lead to the development of intelligence. The eye movement patterns of sleep change in the pregnant women as a function of term and resemble those of premature babies of a similar gestational age. They also change as a function of the menstrual cycle and more generally as a function of age. The hypothesis that attention is the diurnal equivalent of REM sleep is discussed. Attempts at modelling the eye movement patterns of REM sleep as a function of near zero gravity environments have been made. 1) By means of a Montecarlo simulation using the semi Markov model during the Spacelab 1 flight. 2) With the method of the single and multiple g-phase transition analysis of the strange attractor dimension (d) during parabolic flights. The implication of the latter for the neural processes involved in learning is that the central nervous system can preserve intact, from input to output, over a period of several days, all the information it receives 3) The relation between spindles and eye movements has also been viewed by a quantum approach which is another medium between the information and the way of describing it.

N2  - Sleep quality is integral to optimal physical functioning and mental health during pregnancy. There has, however, been little work conducted to determine the most appropriate measure of sleep quality in this clinical group, a surprising observation given the complex and dynamic psychobiology of pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.

N2  - Objective: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for postnatal depressive symptoms in a cohort of mothers of Pacific Island infants in Auckland, New Zealand. Method: The data were gathered as part of the Pacific Island Families Study, in which 1376 mothers were interviewed when their babies were 6 weeks old. The interview included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: 16.4% of mothers were assessed as probably experiencing depression. Prevalence rates varied from 7.6% for Samoans to 30.9% for Tongans. In addition to ethnicity, risk factors identified by stepwise multiple logistic regression included low Pacific Island acculturation, first birth, stress due to insufficient food, household income less than $40,000, difficulty with transport, dissatisfaction with pregnancy, birth experience, baby's sleep patterns, partner relationship and home. A large prevalence difference between Tongans and other groups remained when the effects of other risk factors were controlled statistically. Conclusions: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Pacific mothers is at the upper end of the range typically reported. Focus on the overall rate, however, obscures substantial variation between groups. Risk factors are generally similar to those identified in previous research. Implications: The findings have implications for prevention and treatment and caution against assuming homogeneity within ethnic categories. Further research is required to explain differences in prevalence between Tongan and other Pacific Island groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Independently, prenatal malnutrition and psychological/physical stress have been shown to affect sleep architecture in adult rats. As malnutrition and stress commonly co-exist in malnourished human populations, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the combined effects of these two insults by examining sleep-wake parameters following a brief restraint stress in prenatally protein malnourished rats. The male offspring of rats provided with a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were implanted with recording electrodes beginning at postnatal day 90. Polygraph recordings were obtained to quantify sleep states during the first 4 h of the dark phase of the cycle on 2 consecutive days. The first followed a 24-h habituation session to the recording chamber (baseline). The second occurred at the same time of day but followed 20 min of restraint stress in a Plexiglas tube. During baseline, prenatally malnourished rats spent more time in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in the first 2 h after "lights off" (block 1), and greater amounts of wakefulness (W) with a corresponding reduction in slow wave sleep (SWS) in the second two hours (block 2), as compared with controls. Following stress, the sleep architecture of both groups of rats remained unaltered in block 1 relative to their baseline day. In block 2, both groups exhibited significant reductions in SWS and REMS with significantly greater reductions being expressed in the prenatally malnourished group (most dramatically, REMS was completely eliminated). These findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be more severe in those malnourished human populations subjected to acutely stressful experiences.

N2  - Objective: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Method: Five hundred institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Results: Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank. Conclusion: Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study.

N2  - Pregnant women (N=253) were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M=22.3 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N=83) and non-depressed groups based on a SCID diagnosis of depression. They were then given self-report measures on sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety and anger, and their urine was assayed for norepinephrine and cortisol. These measures were repeated during their third trimester (M=32.4 weeks). Their newborns were then observed during sleep. During both the second and third trimesters, the depressed women had more sleep disturbances and higher depression, anxiety and anger scores. They also had higher norepinephrine and cortisol levels. The newborns of the depressed mothers also had more sleep disturbances including less time in deep sleep and more time in indeterminate (disorganized) sleep, and they were more active and cried/fussed more.

N2  - The current study investigated the attentional mechanisms associated with goal engagement and disengagement in a lifespan context. Women approaching the end of their childbearing years (N = 29) were compared with women who had passed that deadline (N = 28). Participants' goal engagement was measured with a goal nomination task, an incidental recall task of goal-relevant sentences, visual attention to goal-relevant vs. goal-irrelevant images, and a memory task of goal-relevant images. The attention data indicated that women approaching the deadline had a longer first fixation on baby images than women who had passed the deadline. This novel finding was supported by a replication of the previous finding that women approaching the deadline were more engaged with the goal of childbearing than women who had passed the deadline. The connection between attention and memory of goal-relevant information is explored as evidence of cognition working in the service of motivation and developmental regulation.

N2  - Over the past generation, aging and female reproduction have been lodged within the gendered and gendering debates regarding women's involvement in the workforce and demographic shifts toward delayed parenting that culminate in discourses on the "biological clock". Technological solutions to the biological clock, specifically in vitro fertilization, have led to clinical attempts to assess "ovarian reserve", or qualitative and quantitative changes in the ovary that correlate with aging and with successful infertility treatment. Rupturing the longstanding historical connections between menstruation and female reproductive capacity by specifically focusing on the aging of a woman's eggs, the clinical designation of "diminished ovarian reserve" has come to imply that a woman has "old eggs". This is associated in practitioners' and patients' minds with the eclipse of a woman's reproductive potential and with hidden harbingers of menopause. In an ethnographic interview study of 79 couples in the US who conceived after using donor oocytes, we found that women voiced two different narratives that described their experience and attitudes when confronted with an apparent age-related decline in their fertility. The "eleventh-hour mom" narrative was voiced by women who initially tried to become pregnant with their own eggs and turned to donated oocytes as a second-choice option, whereas the "miracle mom" narrative was expressed by women who were generally older, some of whom had entered infertility treatment hoping to conceive with their own eggs, but some who knew from the outset that it was not going to be possible. Through their narratives women not only embodied and made meaningful "diminished ovarian reserve" in varying ways that connect with cultural, social, structural/organizational, symbolic and physical aspects of aging, they reproduced the socio-biological project of the biological clock, but rooted this social project in the metaphor of "old eggs" rather than menopause.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin. Methods: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Results: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance. Conclusion: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: We investigated whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) is associated with the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in young adulthood. Methods: The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5–27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring. Results: The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing. Conclusions: Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Experimental animal data link prenatal stress with sleep disturbance in offspring, but the link in humans is unclear. Aims: To investigate the link between prenatal maternal anxiety and depression and infant sleep disturbance from 6 to 30 months of age. Study Design: Longitudinal prospective study of a large birth cohort from pregnancy to 30 months. Questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression were completed by mothers at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks and 8 months postpartum. Subjects: The ALSPAC cohort, a prospective community study of women in the UK who have been followed since pregnancy. Outcome Measures: Measures of total sleep time, number of awakenings, and broadly defined sleep problems were available on children at ages 6, 18, and 30 months. Results: Reliable measures of total sleep time, nighttime awakenings, and sleep problems were identified at 6, 18, and 30 months. Higher levels of prenatal maternal anxiety and depression predicted more sleep problems at 18 and 30 months, after controlling for postnatal mood and obstetric and psychosocial covariates; the association was not restricted to clinical extremes. No link with total sleep time was observed. Conclusions: Mood disturbance in pregnancy has persisting effects on sleep problems in the child, a finding that is consistent with experimental animal research. The findings add to a growing literature showing that maternal prenatal stress, anxiety, and depression may have lasting effects on child development.

N2  - Health and well-being, as well as physical and cognitive functioning, can be severely compromised by poor sleep and chronic sleep loss. Most women’s sleep loss is attributable to lifestyle factors such as staying up late to complete household responsibilities, caring for young or elderly family members, or working long hours or at night in healthcare or transportation industries. At other times, women’s sleep can be disturbed by an acute or chronic illness. Although a single pregnancy and postpartum period spans only about 2 years in a woman’s entire life, sleep disturbance during this reproductive phase can have a major effect on the health of the mother as well as her infant. Beginning early in pregnancy, sleep can be disrupted by urinary frequency, nausea, leg cramps, and other discomforts. Insufficient sleep during the third trimester may place women at higher risk for longer labors and cesarean births. This special perinatal section primarily focuses on maternal sleep experiences prior to delivery and sleep loss associated with postpartum recovery and maternal mental health. It is hoped that the studies enclosed in the perinatal section of this special issue spotlight the essential sleep needs of new mothers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep disturbance is a typical complaint during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies of this phenomenon have not measured sleep in the last days of pregnancy as women transition into labor. Poor sleep can have potentially adverse effects on labor and delivery. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep obtained in the 5 days preceding childbirth, and the relationship between sleep in this time frame and both pain and fatigue during early labor. Methods: Thirty-five nulliparous women were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to hospital admission. Result and Discussion: Most women experienced spontaneous labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). Conclusion: There was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset. Results from this study can be used to advise women in late pregnancy about expected sleep patterns and measures to optimize sleep and rest.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. Methods: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. Results and Conclusions: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a “sleep consciousness,” and bed-sharing. Mercer’s stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objectives: This study describes the patterns of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in a sample of childbearing women from the third trimester through the postpartum period. The relationship between sleep and depressive symptoms is also examined. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. Methods: This longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time 1 and Time 4. Results and Conclusions: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

N2  - Study Objective: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by passive smoking. In this study we investigated the effects of passive smoking on sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Design: Two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys conducted in 2002 and 2006. Setting: Clinical institutions specializing in obstetrics and gynecology that participated in the nationwide surveys: 260 in the 2002 survey and 344 in the 2006 survey. Participants: 16,396 and 19,386 pregnant women in Japan surveyed in 2002 and 2006, respectively. Intervention: N/A. Measurements and Results: Pregnant women exposed to passive smoking were likely to have sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably. Smoking pregnant women had the same sleep disturbances and also experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and early morning awakening. The prevalence of 5 types of sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably) among nonsmokers with environmental tobacco smoke showed a mean value intermediate between that of active smokers and that of nonsmokers without environmental tobacco smoke. Conclusion: Passive smoking is independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL. Seventy-eight women scoring ≥10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form SF-36), sleep quality, life stress, and social support. All women underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status.
