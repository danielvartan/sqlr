T1  - Large-scale network organization of EEG functional connectivity in newborn infants
LA  - English
N2  - The organization of functional brain networks changes across human lifespan. The present study analyzed functional brain networks in healthy full-term infants (N = 139) within 1–6 days from birth by measuring neural synchrony in EEG recordings during quiet sleep. Large-scale phase synchronization was measured in six frequency bands with the Phase Lag Index. Macroscopic network organization characteristics were quantified by constructing unweighted minimum spanning tree graphs. The cortical networks in early infancy were found to be significantly more hierarchical and had a more cost-efficient organization compared with MST of random control networks, more so in the theta and alpha than in other frequency bands. Frontal and parietal sites acted as the main hubs of these networks, the topological characteristics of which were associated with gestation age (GA). This suggests that individual differences in network topology are related to cortical maturation during the prenatal period, when functional networks shift from strictly centralized toward segregated configurations.

N2  - Objectives: Good maternal health and fetal development require sufficient and good quality of sleep during pregnancy. This study investigated sleep duration and quality in pregnant women, assessing factors with possibly influence on sleep. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on pregnant women between June and August in 2015 in 16 hospitals in five provinces in China. A total of 2345 pregnant women aged 18 years and older were surveyed. Insufficient sleeping duration was defined as sleeping of less than 7 h per day. Excessive sleep duration was defined as sleeping of more than 9 h per day. Results: A total of 561 (23.9%) participants reported insufficient sleeping duration, whereas 485 (20.9%) claimed excessive sleep duration. A total of 358 (15.2%) of pregnant women reported problems regarding sleep quality. Compared to pregnant women with sufficient sleeping duration, those with insufficient sleeping duration were prone to have poor sleep quality, whereas those with excessive sleeping duration featured low possibility of poor sleep quality. High-risk groups of insufficient sleep duration include women of Han nationality, with siblings, in their first trimester of pregnancy, receiving care in low-capacity/quality hospital settings, and with daily or 1-3 days of secondhand smoke exposure. High-risk groups of excessive sleep duration include women living in rural areas, unemployed, in their third trimester of pregnancy, and receiving care in medium-capacity/quality hospital settings. High-risk groups of poor sleep quality include women of non-Han nationality, low income level, in their third trimester of pregnancy, and with insufficient sleep duration. Conclusions: Insufficient/excessive sleep duration and poor sleep quality commonly occur during pregnancy in China. Findings provide a better understanding of the influencing factors of insufficient/excessive sleep duration and poor quality of sleep. These findings have some implications for future interventions on sleep among pregnant women.

N2  - Objective: It has been shown in animal models that circadian clock exists in corpora luteum which is essential for maintaining pregnancy. However, it is unknown whether circadian clock exists in corpora luteum and its relation with steroidogenesis in human ovary. Study design: Human luteinized granulosa cells from patients who underwent in vitro fertilization treatment were purified and cultured in vitro. Accumulation patterns of circadian gene and steroidogenesis-related gene mRNAs in human luteinized granulosa cells were observed during the 48 hours after treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by quantitative PCR. Results: We found that the circadian genes CLOCK, PER2, and BMAL1 were expressed in cultured human luteinized granulosa cells. Among these genes, only expression of PER2 displayed oscillating patterns with a 16-h period in these cells after stimulation by hCG. Expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 did not show significant oscillating patterns. Expression of the steroidal acute regulatory protein (STAR) gene showed an oscillating pattern that was similar to that of PER2. Expression of CYP11A1, HSD3B2, and CYP19A1 increased significantly after hCG stimulation; however, none of these genes displayed significant oscillating patterns. Conclusions: Molecular circadian clock exists in human luteinized granulosa cells and may be related with steroidogenesis in human ovary.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the potential risk factors associated independently with central serous retinopathy (CSR) in a Greek population, using multivariate approach. Materials and methods: Participants in the study were 183 consecutive patients diagnosed with CSR and 183 controls, matched for age. All participants underwent complete ophthalmological examination and information regarding their sociodemographic, clinical, medical and ophthalmological history were recorded, so as to assess potential risk factors for CSR. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed. Results: Univariate analysis showed that male sex, high educational status, high income, alcohol consumption, smoking, hypertension, coronary heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, autoimmune disorders, H. pylori infection, type A personality and stress, steroid use, pregnancy and hyperopia were associated with CSR, while myopia was found to protect from CSR. In multivariate analysis, alcohol consumption, hypertension, coronary heart disease and autoimmune disorders lost their significance, while the remaining factors were all independently associated with CSR. Conclusions: It is important to take into account the various risk factors for CSR, so as to define vulnerable groups and to shed light into the pathogenesis of the disease.

N2  - Study question: To determine the risk for long-term neurological morbidity among children born after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and ovulation induction (OI) as compared to spontaneous pregnancies. Summary answer: Singletons conceived following IVF but not OI have an increased risk of long-term neurological morbidity What is known already: Controversy exists regarding the association between fertility treatments and adverse neurological outcome of the children. While previous studies of children up to school-age, found no significant difference in neurodevelopmental outcome, large cohort studies that followed the participants for a longer period, up to 14 years, reported an increased risk of neurological outcome in children born following infertility treatments. Yet, another study that followed children up to 17 years indicates that children born following fertility treatments perform above average on standardized testing and their cognitive development is normal Study design, size, duration: A population based cohort analysis was performed, including computerized database of all singleton infants born between the years 1991-2014 in Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC). This database was linked with the computerized dataset of all pediatric hospitalizations in the same medical center. SUMC is the largest birth center in Israel, and is the only tertiary medical center in Israel's southern region, including the single IVF unit in the region. Participants/materials, setting, methods: This study included all singleton deliveries occurring between 1991-2014 at a single tertiary medical center. Fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded. A comparison was performed between children delivered following IVF, OI and spontaneous pregnancies. Hospitalization rates up to the age of 18 years involving neurological morbidity were evaluated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare cumulative morbidity incidence. A Cox regression model was used to control for confounders. Main results and the role of chance: During the study period 242,187 singleton deliveries met the inclusion criteria; 1.1% were following IVF (n = 2603), and 0.7% occurred following OI (n = 1721). Hospitalizations up to the age of 18 years involving neurological morbidity were significantly more common in children delivered following IVF (3.7%) and OI (4.1%) as compared with those following spontaneous pregnancies (3.1%; p = 0.017 using the chisquare test for trends). Attention deficit disorders (ADHD), sleep disorders, movement disorders and headaches were more common in the IVF and OI groups as compared to the spontaneous pregnancies groups. Autism, cerebral palsy, eating disorders among other evaluated complications were comparable between the study groups. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated a significantly higher cumulative incidence of total neurological morbidity following IVF and OI (log rank p < 0.001). Using the cox regression model, controlling for multiple confounders such as maternal age, preterm delivery, maternal diabetes and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, IVF (adjusted HR = 1.37, CI 1.12- 1.67, p = 0.03), but not OI (adjusted HR = 1.15, CI 0.91-1.46, p = 0.242), was noted as an independent risk factor for long-term pediatric neurological morbidity. Limitations, reasons for caution: This study was limited by its retrospective nature. Fertility etiology is not applicable as well as the treatment protocol used. Wider implications of the findings: The increased rate of long term neurological pediatric complications in IVF but not OI conceived pregnancies should improve the consultation given to the patients prior to treatment. Further studies are required in order to address the underlying pathophysiology leading to these complications in IVF pregnancies in order to reduce it.

N2  - Much scientific progress has been made since progesterone was first isolated in 1930 s from the corpus luteum. We now know that progesterone is a 21- carbon atoms sex steroid, as opposed to androgens (19-cardon atoms) and estrogens (18-carbon atoms). Progestogen is a class of steroid hormones, which binds to, and activates the progesterone receptor and includes the natural hormone progesterone and synthetic forms (progestin). Progesterone and progestin are structural but not functional analogues. Progesterone is produced from cholesterol and acts as precursors to all other endogenous steroids including androgen, oestrogen, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and neurosteroid. Hence, whilst progesterone is central to many aspects of reproduction through nuclear and extra-nuclear receptor mechanisms, it is also crucial in many nonreproductive processes on bones, central nervous system and metabolism. In early pregnancy, progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum until the placenta takes over at around the 7th week of gestation. A defective luteal phase, where there is insufficient progesterone exposure to maintain a normal secretary endometrium to facilitate normal embryo implantation and growth has long been proposed as a possible cause of subfertility and miscarriage. However, until now, there is yet no consensus on the diagnosis of this condition. Clinical treatment strategies with progesterone supplementation to improve pregnancy outcomes face the conundrum of having to evaluate the treatment of a disease that cannot be accurately diagnosed. Results from studies on the supplement of progesterone to improve pregnancy outcomes remain conflicting. It is, however, clear that progesterone use during early pregnancy is non beneficial in women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. In assisted conception with ovarian stimulation, it is recognized that luteal phase support is required due to the presence of a dysfunctional luteal phase although the mechanisms behind this is still not completely clear. Studies have highlighted the presence of non-synchronized delay in endometrium development in approximately 25% of women undergoing assisted reproduction (IVF). Re-synchronisation of the implantation window, by way of personalized progesterone therapy, segmentation of luteal phase and/or realigning the circadian clock may be potential strategies to improve the outcomes of early pregnancy.

N2  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep occurs throughout a relatively large proportion of early development, and normal REM activity appears to be required for healthy brain development. The eye movements (EMs) observed during REM sleep are the most distinctive characteristics of this state. EMs are used as an index of neurological function postnatally, but no specific indices of EM activity exist for fetuses. We aimed to identify and characterize EM activity, particularly EM bursts suggestive of REM periods, in fetuses with a gestational age between 24 and 39 weeks. This cross-sectional study included 84 normal singleton pregnancies. Fetal EMs were monitored using real-time ultrasonography for 60 min and recorded as videos. The videos were manually converted into a time series of EM events, which were then analyzed by piecewise linear regression for various EM characteristics, including EM density, EM burst density, density of EMs in EM bursts, and continuous EM burst time. Two critical points for EM density, EM burst density, and density of EMs in EM bursts were evident at gestation weeks 28–29 and 36–37. Overall EM activity in human fetuses increased until 28–29 weeks of gestation, then again from 36–37 to 38–39 weeks of gestation. These findings may be useful for creating indices of fetal neurological function for prognostic purposes.

N2  - Background: Synchrony between daily feeding-fasting signals and circadian rhythms has been shown to improve metabolic health in animals and adult humans, but the potential programming effect on fetal growth is unknown. Objective: We examined the associations of the maternal night-fasting interval during pregnancy with offspring birth size and adiposity. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of mother-offspring dyads within the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. For 384 mothers aged 30.8 ± 4.8 y (mean ± SD), the night-fasting interval at 26-28 wk of gestation was determined from a 3-d food diary based on the average of the fasting duration at night (1900-0659). Offspring birth weight, length, and head circumference were measured and converted to weight-for-gestational age (GA), length-for-GA, and head circumference-for-GA z scores, respectively, by using local customized percentile charts. The percentage of neonatal total body fat (TBF) was derived by using a validated prediction equation. Multivariable general linear models, stratified by child sex, were performed. Results: The mean ± SD maternal night-fasting interval was 9.9 ± 1.3 h. In infant girls, each 1-h increase in the maternal night-fasting interval was associated with a 0.22-SD (95% CI: 0.05-, 0.40-SD; P = 0.013) increase in birth head circumference-for-GA and a 0.84% (95% CI: 0.19%, 1.49%; P = 0.012) increase in TBF at birth, after adjustment for confounders. In infant boys, no associationswere observed between the maternal night-fasting interval and birth size or TBF. Conclusions: An increased maternal night-fasting interval in the late second trimester of pregnancy is associated with increased birth head circumference and TBF in girls but not boys. Our findings are in accordance with previous observations that suggest that there are sex-specific responses in fetal brain growth and adiposity, and raise the possibility of the maternal night-fasting interval as an underlying influence.

N2  - Objectives To assess the associations of perceived financial satisfaction and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in an unselected pregnant population in early pregnancy. Methods 750 consecutive pregnant women attending the first communal ultrasound examination before gestational week 14 were invited to participate. Questionnaires assessing HRQoL (15D), depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Depression Scale, EPDS), medical, obstetric, and socioeconomic status were handed out. The participants were divided into three groups according to their satisfaction with their financial status, (unsatisfied, somewhat satisfied, and satisfied). Main outcome measures were 15D and EPDS-scores and dimensions of HRQoL. Results 325 (43,3%) questionnaires were returned. The mean 15D-score for HRQoL was 0,926 (SD 0,056). The financially unsatisfied women had lower HRQoL than women in more satisfied groups (0.906, 0.923 and 0.931, p = 0.012). The result remained significant, even after adjusting for age and education(p = 0.032). The unsatisfied women had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (25.4, 24.4 and 23.2 kg/m2, p for linearity = 0.002), were more often smokers, (13 vs. 4 and 3%, p = 0.029), and had experienced at least one abortion (18, 14 and 7%, p = 0.017). Dimensions of depression, distress and sleep explained the differences between the groups. 27% of unsatisfied women scored EPDS ≥10 points suggesting increased risk of depression. Conclusions Financial satisfaction in early pregnancy associates with HRQoL and risk of perinatal depressive symptoms. Unsatisfied women more often have risk factors for unfavourable pregnancy outcomes which may influence the later health and wellbeing of the mother and child.

N2  - Background and aims: The Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) Italian National Registry collects a series of genetic and clinical information. Methods: Patients adhering to the Registry can also fill online self-reported questionnaires related to five issues: pregnancy; orthotics; skeletal deformity surgery; anesthesia; sleep disorders. By December 2016, 180 patients and 30 healthy controls filled the questionnaires. Data collection is ongoing. Results: Pregnancy: 46/73 CMT women had at least one pregnancy; complications ranging from mild to severe occurred in 44/108 pregnancies (9/42 in controls). CMT worsened in 7 pregnancies (6 patients) with no recovery in 5 instances. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 8/108 pregnancies. Satisfaction related to surgical procedures for foot deformities, assessed with VAS (score 0-10), was 6.4±3.5 (n=110). Repeat surgery was required in 9/72 instances. Sleep: the Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire revealed abnormalities of sleep in 44/142 CMT patients (31%) and in 5/30 controls (17%). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (range 0-21, 0 good sleep): most CMT subjects (123/138; mean 9.1±3.2), but also controls (27/30; 8.6±2.9) are not good sleepers. Fatigue: scores of Modified-Fatigue Impact Scale (range 0-82, 0 no fatigue) were higher for CMT (mean 33±18.2) than controls (mean 16.6±12.5). Hospital Scale for Anxiety and Depression: 63/138 CMT subjects had mild-to-severe anxiety and 35/138 mild-to-severe depression as compared to 7/29 and 4/29 controls, respectively. Data analysis on orthotics and anesthesia is ongoing. Conclusion: The first data analyses confirm that there are problems related to all the five domains explored, that will need to be specifically addressed in patients' care.

N2  - The article presents analysis of application of time budget by contingent of female students-artists of different courses. The purpose of study is to investigate life-style and health indices of female students-artists. The study tasks included to determine time spending for various kinds of activity of female students, to analyze certain health indices of female artists and to substantiate activities related to health promotion of this contingent. The applied methods included analysis of publications, analysis of temporarily disability certificates, questionnaire survey, health indices testing. The study carried out in the Gzhelskii state university and covered female students of I--III courses. The greatest percentage in the time budget structure takes sleep (29.8%), though at I and II courses female students sleep less that standard requires. The study established an insufficient motion activity of female artists resulting in immunity decreasing and cold diseases that made up to 86.3% in the structure of morbidity. Certain health indices (breath holding at breathing in and breathing out, wrist dynamometry) in female students-artists are worse than in female students of other professions. The preparation of female artists to future child-bearing and efficient professional activity it is necessary to implement health-preserving technologies and mass physical culture and sport activities during out-learning period.

N2  - Background: During pregnancy, many women experience sleep problems and anxiety that require treatment. The long-term safety for the child of maternal benzodiazepine (BZD) and z-hypnotic use during pregnancy remains controversial. Method: We conducted a cohort and a sibling control study using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Data on use of BZD and z-hypnotics, internalizing and externalizing outcomes, and covariates were collected from mothers at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and when children were 0.5, 1.5, and 3 years of age. The total sample consisted of 71,996 children (19,297 siblings) at 1.5 years and 55,081 children (13,779 siblings) at 3 years. Short-term use was defined as use in one pregnancy period only. Long-term use was defined as use in two or more pregnancy periods. Linear full cohort random-effect and sibling-matched fixed-effect regression models were used to compare internalizing and externalizing behavior in children prenatally exposed compared to those unexposed in the full cohort of pregnancies accounting for family clusters, as well as within sibling clusters comparing pregnancies with discordant exposures. Propensity score (PS) adjustment included variables on indication for use (sleep problems, symptoms of anxiety and depression) and other potential confounding factors. Results: Long-term prenatal exposure to BZD or z-hypnotics was associated with increased internalizing behavior in crude cohort analyses and at age 1.5 years after PS adjustment in sibling-matched fixed-effect models [β 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.17–0.95]. Analyses on specific drug groups showed that prenatal exposure to BZD-anxiolytics was associated with increased internalizing problems at both 1.5 years [β 0.25, 0.01–0.49] and 3 years [β 0.26, 0.002–0.52] while exposure to z-hypnotics was not associated with any adverse outcomes after adjustment. Conclusion: The findings suggest a moderate association between BZD-anxiolytic exposure and child internalizing problems that is not likely due to stable familial confounding factors.

N2  - Night shift-work and circadian dysfunction have been linked to increased incidence of breast cancer. Circadian modulation of gene expression is often mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), small 18-25 nucleotide noncoding RNA molecules that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression via mRNA inactivation. Although miRNA dysregulation has been implicated in breast cancer development, the relationship between breast cancer incidence in women exposed to chronic circadian disruption and their miRNA profiles has not been examined due to the lack of existing normal profiles of expression. We first identified miRNA expressed in asymptomatic breast tissue and defined their baseline profiles in women exposed to a regular work schedule compared to those who experienced chronic circadian disruption by night shift work. Normal mammary tissue was obtained from women undergoing therapeutic breast reductions. Clinical metadata on work, stress, sleep, pregnancy, medical, medication, family, and surgical history were obtained through survey and chart review. We selected night shift work starting from 0700 to 0300 as a marker of circadian disruption. Our studies focused on two major comparisons. First, we determined qualitative oscillatory differences in miRNA variants expressed during day and night. Second, we determined statistically significant expression levels of those day and night miRNAs in shift workers. Mammary miRNA reads were mapped against the reference human genome and mature miRNA set. One-way ANOVA was used to compare miRNA expression levels between night shift and non-night shift workers, as well as miRNA expression between other clinical metadata. At present, twelve samples have undergone experimental and statistical analyses. Three out of the twelve samples were from night shift workers. One-way ANOVA was run on the top one hundred expressed miRNAs including hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-99a-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-10b-5p, and hsa-miR-148a-3p to exclude miRNAs with zero or extremely low counts. Analysis showed no significant difference in miRNA expression of normal samples between night shift and non-night-shift workers (p 0.06099), pregnant and nulliparous (p 0.2658), and women who breastfed and those who did not (p 0.111). There was significant difference in miRNA expression of normal samples between patients who had breast cancer in the opposite breast compared to those who did not (p 0.03269) and patients with sleep problems and those who did not (p 0.003448). It is interesting to note that night shift work and sleep problems both represent forms of circadian disruption, yet only the latter showed significant difference in miRNA expression between controls. It is expected that patients with cancer in the other breast may exhibit significantly different reads from patients who have never had breast cancer. Future analyses will be performed using additional samples to build on these findings.

N2  - Results: LF/HF ratio was higher in snus (mean 3.31; 95% CI 2.78-3.83) and smoke (3.51;2.54-4.47) compared to controls (2.15; 1.76-2.54, p = .002). Early prenatal nicotine exposure "without" any further exposure increased the LF/HF ratio (3.19; 2.55-3.84, p = .02). Continuous prenatal nicotine exposure "without" postnatal exposure was also associated with a residual increase in LF/HF ratio (4.40; 3.38-5.42, p < .001). There was no difference between infants exposed to smokeless versus smoked tobacco, suggesting a common constituent (nicotine) altering autonomic cardiac regulation.
Conclusion: Infants to mothers who used snus during pregnancy showed lower vagal activity with an increased LF/HF ratio compared to controls, and similar to infants of smokers. Even early prenatal exposure to snus has a lasting impact on autonomic cardiac regulation suggesting a fetal "re-programing" of the developing autonomic nervous system.
Implications: The results indicate that smokeless tobacco (Swedish snus) affects the developing autonomic nervous system during gestation. Even if exposure is interrupted during the first or second trimester, effects in autonomic cardiac regulation are seen in the 1-2 month-old infant. This underlines the importance of abstaining from all types of tobacco use during the whole pregnancy. Our findings may also have more general relevance to other routes by which nicotine can be delivered to a fetus and newborn.
Introduction: Maternal use of smoked tobacco during pregnancy causes significant morbidity and mortality in the human infant including alterations in autonomic control with increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. We hypothesized that maternal snus (smokeless tobacco) use during pregnancy affects autonomic cardiac regulation in the infant, as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) and the low frequency and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio).
Methods: A prospective observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19). The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and post-natally. The infants' urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of sleep were studied 1-2 months after birth.

N2  - Study question: Does infertility related to maternal exposure to night shift work increase the risk of urogenital defects after ART? Summary answer: Maternal night shift work was associated with urogenital anomalies among ART first births (aOR = 1.89,CI 1.13-3.38, particularly for multiples (aOR = 3.11,CI 1.33-7.28), but not natural conceptions. What is known already: Urogenital anomalies are among the most commonly diagnosed congenital anomalies, affecting up to 16 per 1,000 births per year, with significantly higher prevalence among births conceived using assisted reproductive technologies. Infertility may also increase the risk of urogenital anomalies by various pathways. Circadian perturbation is a potent endocrine disruptor, with higher rates of menstrual disturbance, endometriosis and miscarriage among shift workers. Circadian disruption of melatonin secretion is implicated in reproductive function, particularly during pregnancy, and is important in regulating the fetal circadian rhythm. Through its effects on estrogen levels, circadian disruption may also have a sex-specific role in sexual development. Study design, size, duration: Whole of population data-linkage cohort for the state of South Australia, comprising 302,811 births, from Jan 1986 to Dec 2002, with congenital anomalies detected until children reached age 5 years. Analysis was restricted to 98,359 nulliparous women who were in paid employment at the time of their first birth. Participants/materials, setting, methods: The South Australian Birth Cohort is based on all registrations of birth and terminations of pregnancy, linked to all cycles of ART, and to all congenital anomalies notified to the 5th birthday (ICD-9 British Paediatric Association codes). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between night shift imputed from maternal occupation, treatment modality and the presence of urogenital defects. Occupation recorded at birth was used to calculate probability of shiftwork. Main results and the role of chance: Nulliparous women employed in occupations involving night shift were older, more likely to be Caucasian, more likely to reside in wealthy areas and less likely to smoke. ART treatment received did not differ by night shift exposure status. ART first births showed that the risk of urogenital anomalies was significantly higher among multiple births to night shift workers, OR = 3.11 (95% CI 1.33- 7.28) compared to singletons without maternal exposure to night shift work. The risk of urogenital defects was elevated for singleton births to night shift workers (OR=1.85 (95% CI 0.96-3.59)), although this did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference in the risk of urogenital anomalies for multiple and single births conceived using ART where the mother was not exposure to night shift work. These results were adjusted for sex of the baby, maternal age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, infertility diagnosis, ART treatment type, pregnancy induced hypertension, pre-existing diabetes and asthma. A significant interaction indicated that the effect of ART conception on the risk of urogenital anomalies for night shift workers is 1.9 times higher than that of non-shift workers. Limitations, reasons for caution: Shift work was based on a job exposure matrix which calculated the probability of exposure, whereas a more precise measures of exposure using detailed occupational records may yield a more robust result. A caveat is that shift workers may have different patterns of exposure to unrelated occupational hazards. Wider implications of the findings: The interaction between maternal shift work and use of ART suggests that individual susceptibility to circadian disruption, and the impact of this on the severity of infertility, are important factors in predicting adverse outcomes, such as urogenital anomalies.

N2  - Study question: Is self-reported quality of life, psychosocial and physical wellbeing similar in short GnRH-antagonist and long GnRH-agonist protocol among women in their first ART treatment? Summary answer: Women in short antagonist protocol rated psychosocialand physical wellbeing during their first ART treatment superior to women in long GnRH-agonist protocol. What is known already: It is stressful and straining to undergo ART treatment and the psychological burden for the couple can be a major reason for discontinuing treatment. However, the literature on quality of life, psychosocialand physical wellbeing during different ART treatment protocols is scarce. GnRH-agonists have been associated with negative mood symptoms as depression, fatigue, anhedonia and anxiety due to the medically induced hypogonadism. The agonist protocol is also associated with a higher risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). On the other hand, GnRH-antagonist protocol has been associated with more pronounced mood variations during the stimulation phase compared to GnRH-agonist protocol. Study design, size, duration: Quality of life, psychosocial- and physical wellbeing was secondary outcomes in a phase IV, dual-centre, open-label, RCT including 1023 women, who started gonadotrophin stimulation in their first ART cycle. Women were randomized to either short GnRH-antagonist or long-GnRH agonist protocol using a web-based concealed randomization code in a 1:1 ratio and enrolled over a five-year period. The aim was to compare self-reported quality of life, physical- and psychosocial wellbeing in the two treatment groups. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Women referred for first ART cycle <40 years of age were included. All started standardized ART protocols with age-adjusted rFSH doses. A questionnaire on self-reported physical wellbeing was completed 4 times during treatment and self-reported quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing was completed at the end of treatment. Quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing were analysed in a regression model controlling for; treatment protocol, age, male-factor, previous delivery, pregnancy, severe OHSS and years of infertility. Main results and the role of chance: Baseline characteristics were similar and the overall response rate for all required questionnaires were 79.4% (419/528) in the GnRH-antagonist group compared to 74.3% (368/495) in the GnRHagonist group (P = 0.06). For the single item self-evaluated quality of life during ART treatment no difference was found between the two treatment groups (P = 0.25), the only covariate predictive of reduced quality of life was the development of severe OHSS (AOR=3.89; 95%CI: 2.34-6.46; P < 0.01). However, women in the short GnRH-antagonist group had a lower adjusted risk of being emotional during treatment (AOR=0.74; 95%CI: 0.56 to 0.97; P = 0.03), they had a lower adjusted risk of experiencing unexpected crying (AOR=0.69; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.91; P = 0.01) and had a lower adjusted risk of worse quality of sleep (AOR=0.65; 95%CI: 0.48 to 0.88; P < 0.01) compared to women in GnRH-agonist treatment. Three days after embryo transfer more women in the GnRH-agonist group felt worse physically (P < 0.01), felt bloated (P < 0.01) and had shortness of breath (P = 0.03). At the day of the pregnancy test more women in the GnRHagonist group had stomach pain (P < 0.01). Finally, significantly more women in the long agonist group experienced side-effects to the prescribed medication during ART treatment. Limitations, reasons for caution: Overall response rates were satisfying, however, response rates were significantly lower for women without embryo transfer. The randomization procedure makes the risk of bias less likely. Finally, neither physicians nor patients were blinded to GnRH-treatment group. Wider implications of the findings: ART protocols have improved over the years, but less focus has been on the physical- and psychosocial wellbeing among women treated with different protocols. We found that women in short GnRH-antagonist protocol have better physical and psychosocial wellbeing during their first ART treatment compared to women in long GnRH-agonist protocol.

N2  - Hypothesis/aims of study hMaxi-K is currently the only gene therapy approach to treat benign urologic conditions with FDA approved IND's. hMaxi-K is a plasmid vector expressing the gene for Maxi-K, a potassium channel involved in regulation of smooth muscle tone which has been demonstrated to play a key role in normal bladder physiology in animal studies. This is the first study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of direct bladder wall injections of this plasmid to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder and urinary incontinence in women. Study design, materials and methods: Primary Objective: To evaluate occurrence of adverse events and their relationship to hMaxi-K treatment following multiple intramuscular (IM) injections into the bladder wall of two dose levels (16000 μg and 24000 μg) in women with moderate OAB/DO of ≥ six months duration. Secondary Objective: To evaluate the following additional safety parameters (changes from baseline compared to placebo): Clinical laboratory tests, Electrocardiogram changes and Physical Examination. To evaluate efficacy parameters (change from baseline compared to placebo) that include: number of micturitions per day, volume per micturition, urgency episodes, incontinence episodes, pad weight, number of uninhibited contractions during cystometrogram (CMG) and other general and bladder-specific quality of life assessments. Methodology: This was a double blind, imbalanced placebo controlled sequential dose trial. Participants were healthy women of 18 years of age or older, of non-childbearing potential, with moderate OAB/DO of ≥ six months duration with at least one of the following: frequent micturition ≥ 8 times per day, symptoms of urinary urgency or nocturia (the complaint of waking at night two or more times to void), urge urinary incontinence (five or more incontinence episodes per week), and detrusor overactivity with ≥ 1 uncontrolled phasic contraction(s) of the detrusor of at least 5 cm/H20 pressure documented on CMG. All of the participants had failed prior treatment with anticholinergics. Four had failed onabotulinumtoxinA therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to either hMaxi-K at one of two doses (16,000 mcg, or 24,000 mcg, or placebo. Treatment was administered as 20-30 IM injections into the bladder wall during cystoscopy. Participants were seen 8 times within a 24-week period with a study follow-up of 18 months. All reported adverse events occurring after study drug dosing were recorded. Complex CMG's were done at screening visit 1A (week-1) and at week 4 (visit 5) and week 24 (visit 8) post-injection. Post void residual volume (PVR) was measured at every visit with a Bladderscan®. The data to assess efficacy were evaluated using summary descriptive statistics by treatment group (combined placebo vs 2 active treatment groups and combined placebo vs combined treatment groups). Linear mixed effect models were used to estimate difference of changes from baseline between placebo and active treatment and to test whether there was dose-response for different outcomes. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were to be used to estimate effects for the binary endpoints. Results There were 6 participants who received 16000 mcg, 3 participants who received 24000 mcg and 4 participants who received placebo. In both active treatment groups, the majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild in severity and all were considered unrelated to study drug. Two women had mild unrelated UTIs post-treatment with hMaxi-K: one receiving 24000 mcg at month after dosing and the other receiving 16000 mcg at 6 months after dosing. There was one unrelated serious AE reported in the 16000 mcg group; exacerbation of pre-existing asthma due to the cold weather which required an ER visit and resolved after asthma treatment was given. No subject was discontinued due to an AE and all enrolled subjects completed the 6 month trial. In addition, during the18 month long-term post study safety follow-up, no issues were reported in the subjects followed to date (9 of 13 completed 18 month follow-ups; 13 of 13 completed the 12 month follow-ups). The average of diary data collected for 7 days prior to each visit revealed statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements vs placebo and baseline with durable reduction in mean number of voids per day and mean number of urgency episodes per day over the 6 months of the trial. The changes displayed in the two tables below are mean changes (+/-SE) from baseline compared to placebo Quality of life parameters (King Health Questionnaire) showed statistically significant sustained mean changes for the individual active treatments and for the combined active treatment groups (all doses) vs placebo and vs baseline in the domains of Impact on Life, Role Limitations, Physical Limitations, Social Limitations and Sleep Energy. Interpretation of results This phase IB clinical trial extends and substantiates prior pre-clinical reports that the instillation into the rat bladder of a plasmid containing the gene that expresses the human Maxi-K channel can safely reduce untoward effects of detrusor instability. (1-3) The measured significant reduction of the number of voiding and urgency episodes after a single administration of hMaxi-K lasted for the 6 month duration of the trial. Those results were observed in the absence of a change in PVR and treatment-related serious adverse events. Concluding message The results of this novel clinical trial show for the first time that a single intradetrusor administration of human Maxi-K gene was safe. Though the number of participants was small, there was a durable, positive effect. These findings justify further study of this approach for treatment of OAB/DO.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the study was to present the biopsychosocial effects of foetal alcohol syndrome among the children from the Interventional Care Facility in Otwock in the years 2012-2015. Material and methods: We analysed medical records from the years 2012 to 2015. Medical documentation consisted of the child's stay record, psychological diagnosis, maternal interview, social interview, a round check report, medical assessment and consultation records, neurological examination reports and physiotherapist reports. The study included medical documentation of 18 girls (29%) and 44 boys (71%). In total, 62 children aged between 3 days and 1 year were included in the study group. Results: Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy is still declared by many women (69%), including 44% of mothers consuming alcohol throughout the duration of pregnancy. All children in the Interventional Care Facility had at least 2 dysmorphic facial features. Sucking dysfunction, which caused difficulty when feeding, was observed in 59 children, and dysaesthesia-in 56 children. Children with foetal alcohol syndrome were very tearful, experienced tensions (58 children), hyperactivity (59 children) as well as sleep disorders (60 children). They frequently experienced emotional disorders (60 children) and problems with establishing contact with other people (44 children). Conclusions: It was found that alcohol has teratogenic effects on the developing foetus. Any amount of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman can cause damage to the foetus. Foetal exposure to alcohol leads to multiple disorders that occur not only in the biological, but also in the psychological sphere. The study confirmed that children with foetal alcohol syndrome suffer from multiple health problems and have difficulty functioning in society due to their "otherness".

N2  - Sinus bradycardia which is a sinus rhythm with a resting heart rate of less than 60 bpm is caused by intrinsic cardiac disorders like sick sinus syndrome or inferior myocardial infarction, metabolic and environmental causes (such as hypothyroidism and electrolyte disorders), medications (such as beta-blockers and amiodarone), infection (such as myocarditis), increased intracranial pressure, and toxic exposure, while it can sometimes be a normal phenomenon, especially during sleep, in athletes, and during pregnancy. Symptomatic sinus bradycardia should warrant a thorough work-up in order to identify any reversible causes; otherwise, placement of a permanent pacemaker could be needed. We present the case of a patient who was admitted due to confusion and fever and was found to have pneumococcal meningitis and bacteremia, and during his hospital stay he developed symptomatic sinus bradycardia that was of intractable cause and persistent. Placement of a permanent pacemaker was chosen until the night staff of the hospital discovered by chance the neglected cause of his bradycardia.

N2  - (Pro)renin receptor ((P)RR) is a multi-functional molecule that is related to both the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), an ATP-dependent multi-subunit proton pump. Soluble (P)RR (s(P)RR), which consists of the extracellular domain of (P)RR, is present in blood and urine. Elevated plasma s(P)RR concentrations are reported in patients with chronic kidney disease and pregnant women with hypertension or diabetes mellitus. In addition, we have shown that plasma s(P)RR concentrations are elevated in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Interestingly, the levels are elevated in parallel with the severity of OSAS, but are not related to the presence of hypertension or the status of the circulating RAS in OSAS. It is known that v-ATPase activity protects cells from endogenous oxidative stress, and loss of v-ATPase activity results in chronic oxidative stress. We hypothesize that hypoxia and subsequent oxidative stress, perhaps in the brain, may be one of the factors that elevate plasma s(P)RR levels in OSAS.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), a common neurological sensorimotor disorder in western countries, has gained more and more attention in Asian countries. The prevalence of RLS is higher in older people and females. RLS is most commonly related to iron deficiency, pregnancy and uremia. The RLS symptoms show a significant circadian rhythm and a close relationship to periodic limb movements (PLMs) in clinical observations, while the pathophysiological pathways are still unknown. The diagnostic criteria have been revised in 2012 to improve the validity of RLS diagnosis. Recent studies have suggested an important role of iron decrease of brain in RLS pathophysiology. Dopaminergic (DA) system dysfunction in A11 cell groups has been recognized long ago from clinical treatment and autopsy. Nowadays, it is believed that iron dysfunction can affect DA system from different pathways and opioids have a protective effect on DA system. Several susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms such as BTBD9 and MEIS1, which are thought to be involved in embryonic neuronal development, have been reported to be associated with RLS. Several pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment are discussed in this review. First-line treatments of RLS include DA agents and α2δ agonists. Augmentation is very common in long-term treatment of RLS which makes prevention and management of augmentation very important for RLS patients. A combination of different types of medication is effective in preventing and treating augmentation. The knowledge on RLS is still limited, the pathophysiology and better management of RLS remain to be discovered.

N2  - Background/Objective:Reduced sleep is a strong and independent risk factor for weight gain and obesity. Maternal obesity preconception and throughout gestation can increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and impact on offspring health in later life. This study investigated the relationship between sleeping behaviour and macronutrient intake in childbearing aged women.Subjects/Methods:We used cross-sectional data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health 1973-78 cohort, aged 31-36 years in 2009 (n=8200). Subjective sleeping behaviour was reported and macronutrient intake was measured using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to derive sleeping patterns. Multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate the relationships between sleep and macronutrient intake.Results:LCA identified three sleep patterns: (LC1) average sleep (∼8 h) with no adverse sleep-related symptoms (n=3570); (LC2) average sleep (∼8 h) with sleeping difficulties and severe tiredness (n=2109); and (LC3) short sleep (∼6 h) with sleeping difficulties and severe tiredness (n=915). In fully adjusted models, LC2 was inversely associated with percentage energy as protein (b=-0.24; P=0.01) and the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio (b=-0.01; P<0.05). LC3 was positively associated with percentage of energy as fat (b=0.29; P=0.01), saturated fat (b=0.24; P=<0.001) and monounsaturated fat (b=0.09; P=0.04).Conclusions:Sleeping behaviour patterns were associated with macronutrient intake in childbearing aged women. Improved sleep patterns, together with diet and physical activity strategies, may make it easier for women to achieve a balanced diet and optimise their weight status in preparation for pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives To examine the association between sleep duration in early pregnancy and fetal growth in a prospective cohort study of 3567 Chinese women. Methods Pregnant women at 8–16 weeks of gestation were interviewed using a semi-quantitative questionnaire to assess sleep duration. Birth weight and birth length were measured by a midwife in the delivery room at birth; low birth weight (LBW) was defined as birth weight <2500 g and small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as <10th customized centile. Results The average age of participants was 28.21 ± 3.38 years old. The mean sleep duration was 8.39 ± 1.13 h/day. A total of 1290 women sleeping ≥9 h/day, 1563 sleeping 8 to <9 h/day, 550 sleeping 7 to <8 h/day, and 164 sleeping <7 h/day. Compared to the sleeping 8 to <9 h/day group, birth length and birth weight of the sleeping <7 h/day group decreased by 2.42 mm (95% CI: −4.27, −0.58, p = 0.010) and 42.70 g (95% CI: −103.02, 17.62, p = 0.165), respectively; and risk of LBW and SGA of the sleeping <7 h/day group increased by 83% (95% CI: 0.59, 5.73, p = 0.297) and 56% (95% CI: 0.84, 2.92, p = 0.159), respectively; birth length of the sleeping <7 h/day group was decreased more in male babies, and among mothers without a midday napping habit or with a history of abortion (all p for interaction <0.05). Conclusions Shorter sleep duration in early pregnancy was associated with birth length. Our findings indicate that midday napping may be a protective factor for birth length among pregnant women with shorter sleep duration.

N2  - Aim: Although it is known that sleep disturbance occurs due to the physiological and hormonal changes during human pregnancy, there have been few studies on sleep/wakefulness behaviors in pregnant mice. Since mice are used as research models for human health and diseases, it is crucial to elucidate how sleep/wakefulness behaviors in mice change as the pregnancy progresses. Method: At the age of 8-12 weeks, C57/BL6N female mice were subjected to implant electroencephalographic (EEG)/electromyography (EMG) electrodes under anesthesia of isoflurane. After recovery from the surgery, EEG/EMG was recorded for4consecutive days for basal sleep/wakefulness. Then, the female mice were mated with a male mouse. The male mouse was removed from the cage when a vaginal plug was confirmed. The plug positive day was designated as pregnant day 0 (PD0). EEG/EMG was recorded again from PD0 and continued until the delivery, usually at PD18. Results: NREM sleep time increased as pregnancy progressed. NREM sleep increase was mainly observed in the dark phase, active period of mice. Delta power during NREM sleep, an index of sleep depth, increased significantly during pregnancy. Total REM sleep time was constant during pregnancy, but the duration of REM sleep episode shortened with pregnancy progression. The power spectrum analysis revealed that delta wave during wakefulness was enhanced in the late pregnancy. Conclusion: We showed that the NREM sleep amount increased with the progression of pregnancy. Increased delta power during NREM sleep suggests that sleep demand increases during pregnancy. REM sleep time was constant but fragmented as gestational age advanced. Our observation in sleep/wakefulness behaviors during pregnancy in mice may provide a basis for future studies on health and disease during pregnancy.

N2  - Purpose: We evaluate the impact of maternal and post-weaning high-fat (HF) diet on ovarian follicular population, steroidogenesis, and gene expression with a focus on the circadian clock system and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) in adult offspring ovaries, and to elucidate whether a maternal and post-weaning diet confers similar risks. Methods: Virgin Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with normal chow (C) diet or HF diet for 5 weeks before mating, during gestation, and lactation. Female offspring were fed with the C or HF diet from weaning to 6 months of age, resulting in four study groups (n = 6 per group): C/C, C/HF, HF/C, and HF/HF. Results: Ovaries from offspring exposed to post-weaning HF diet (i.e., the C/HF and HF/HF groups) had a decrease in small follicle numbers, but with similar numbers of antral follicles and corpora lutea. Offspring from HF-fed dams (i.e., the HF/C and HF/HF groups) had increased plasma estradiol concentrations and decreased luteinizing hormone levels at 6 months of age. In addition, Igf2 and each of the circadian rhythm core genes Clock, Per1, Per2, and Per3 were increased in the ovaries of offspring exposed to maternal HF diet (both HF/C and HF/HF groups). Conclusions: Maternal and post-weaning HF diet programs the reproductive profile of the female offspring in adult life through different manners. Post-weaning HF intake resulted in the reduction of small follicles in adulthood, whereas maternal HF diet had long-term deleterious consequences on female offspring steroidogenesis and coincided with alteration of the upregulation of the imprinted gene Igf2 and changes in ovarian circadian rhythms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Poor sleep during pregnancy has been associated with poorer birth outcomes. High body mass index (BMI) is often associated with poor sleep, but little is known about the relationship between gestational weight gain and sleep in late pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships of both gestational weight gain and pre-pregnancy BMI to objective and subjective measures of sleep during late pregnancy.
METHODS: Pregnant women (n=128) were recruited from prenatal clinics and childbirth classes primarily serving low-income women. Their sleep (disruption and duration) was objectively assessed in their last month of pregnancy with 72 hours of wrist actigraphy monitoring. Their perceived sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pre-pregnancy and late pregnancy height and weight were assessed by self-report and used to calculate BMI and gestational weight gain, which were then grouped into standardized categories.
RESULTS: Mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score was 6.8 ± 3.1 (range 2-16). Sixty percent had excess gestational weight gain and it was associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, but was unrelated to objective measures of sleep duration and disruption. Pre-pregnancy BMI was unrelated to all sleep parameters. However, analyses of the interaction of pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain indicated that excess weight gain was associated with shorter sleep duration and more sleep disruption, but only among women who were overweight before pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is an opportunity to promote long-term women's health with a better understanding of the relationship between weight management and healthy sleep habits.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been shown to be associated with gestational diabetes (GDM) and adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia, caesarean section and premature delivery. However, the data on the effect of continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP) on pregnancy outcomes were lacking. We previously reported an improved insulin secretion as a result of a 2-week CPAP treatment in women with diet-controlled GDM and OSA in the third trimester. The aim of this study was to report pregnancy outcomes in these women, and compare them with GDM women without OSA. Methods: Obese pregnant women (pre-pregnancy BMI >=25 kg/m2) with diet-controlled GDM were asked to participate. OSA was screened using an overnight home monitor. Those diagnosed with OSA were randomized to receive CPAP treatment for 2 weeks or be wait-list controls. After randomization period ended, all women were offered CPAP treatment until delivery. Pregnancy outcomes were collected in all women from medical records. Results: Of the 82 women screened at a median gestational age (GA) of 29 weeks, 43 had OSA (apnea hypopnea index >=5). Of these, 28 had CPAP treatment and 15 did not. Pregnancy outcomes were available in 78 women (38 in No-OSA group, 28 in OSA/CPAP group and 11 OSA/no-CPAP group). When comparing women among the three groups; No-OSA vs. OSA/CPAP vs. OSA/No-CPAP, there were no significant differences their age, pre-pregnancy BMI, gravida and para. There were also no significant differences in the pregnancy outcomes including subsequent rates of insulin use, preterm delivery (<37 weeks), preeclampsia, unplanned caesarean section, birth weight (3164±489 gm vs. 3099±509 gm vs. 3196±608, p=0.821), Apgar score at 1 minute and 5 minutes, or the rate of small for gestational age and large for gestational age. Of the 28 women exposed to CPAP, 23 had used CPAP for >=2 weeks. There was no significant difference in GA at CPAP start between those using CPAP >=2 vs. <2 weeks (30.7±3.0 vs. 30.0 ± 3.7 weeks, p=0.619). Those using CPAP >=2 weeks used the device on average for 37±16 days and for 74±18% of the days. When comparing women in No-OSA group (n=38) vs. OSA with CPAP use >=2 weeks (n=23) and OSA with CPAP use <2 weeks (n=16), the rate of preterm delivery was significantly less in those who used CPAP >=2 weeks (13.1% vs. 0% vs. 31.2%, p=0.017). In addition, unplanned caesarean section was also significantly less (34.2% vs. 13.0% vs 52.0%, p=0.026). Other pregnancy outcomes were similar among groups. Conclusion: CPAP use in pregnant women with diet-controlled GDM and OSA was safe. CPAP use for >=2 weeks in the third trimester was associated with a significantly less risk for premature delivery and unplanned caesarean section. This information supported the benefits of CPAP treatment in this patient group and should be confirmed in a larger study.

N2  - Objective: To determine the frequency of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnant women and its impact on quality of sleep (QoS) and quality of life (QoL). Background: RLS is a relatively common disorder occurring more frequently in certain groups, such as people with anaemia, uraemia, in pregnancy and as a side effect of certain medication. Methods: Authors designed a sociodemographic questionnaire that was completed by pregnant women and a control group of non-pregnant, age-matched women. In addition, pregnant women positive for RLS (based on IRLSSG) were given a standardised international questionnaire about the QoL for people suffering from RLS (RLS-QoL). Pregnant women without neurological disorders were used as a control group when testing for QoS and QoL. All participants signed an informed consent and ethical committee approved the study. Rights to use RLS-QoL translated to Croatian were obtained by the authors (SF-MPQ-2© R. Melzack and the IMMPACT, 2017.) Results: Data was analysed using R software. By applying Fisher's exact test, frequency of RLS was found to be significantly higher (p<0.05) in the group of pregnant women when compared to non-pregnant women. Analysis of different variables determining QoS and QoL showed consistently significantly lower values for the group of RLS positive pregnant women compared to pregnant women without neurological disorders. Conclusions: The study showed that the frequency of RLS was higher in the group of pregnant women when compared to the control group. Considering RLS is common disorder often left unrecognised, and therefore untreated, we feel studies such as this help raise awareness about RLS. Proper education of both general population and medical community would lead to an increase in diagnosing and thus properly treating RLS in pregnancy. In addition, during the study, pregnant women with RLS were given instructions on how to best cope with symptoms, including lowered quality of sleep that was detected. Authors believe this will lead to an increase in QoS and subsequently QoL.

N2  - Objective Our objective was to test the primary hypothesis that maternal non-left, in particular supine going-to-sleep position, would be a risk factor for late stillbirth (28 weeks of gestation). Methods A multicentre case-control study was conducted in seven New Zealand health regions, between February 2012 and December 2015. Cases (n = 164) were women with singleton pregnancies and late stillbirth, without congenital abnormality. Controls (n = 569) were women with on-going singleton pregnancies, randomly selected and frequency matched for health region and gestation. The primary outcome was adjusted odds of late stillbirth associated with self-reported going-to-sleep position, on the last night. The last night was the night before the late stillbirth was thought to have occurred or the night before interview for controls. Going-to-sleep position on the last night was categorised as: Supine, left-side, right-side, propped or restless. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for known confounders. Results Supine going-to-sleep position on the last night was associated with increased late stillbirth risk (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 3.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74 to 7.78) with a population attributable risk of 9.4%. Other independent risk factors for late stillbirth (aOR, 95% CI) were: BMI (1.04, 1.01 to 1.08) per unit, maternal age ≥40 (2.88, 1.31 to 6.32), birthweight <10th customised centile (2.76, 1.59 to 4.80), and <6 hours sleep on the last night (1.81, 1.14 to 2.88). The risk associated with supine-going-to-sleep position was greater for term (aOR 10.26, 3.00 to 35.04) than preterm stillbirths (aOR 3.12, 0.97 to 10.05). Conclusions Supine going-to-sleep position is associated with a 3.7 fold increase in overall late stillbirth risk, independent of other common risk factors. A public health campaign encouraging women not to go-to-sleep supine in the third trimester has potential to reduce late stillbirth by approximately 9%.

N2  - It was recently reported that pregnant women were more likely to have minor depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale (PHQ-8), (as reported by Kroenke and Spitzer (Psychiatr Ann 32(9):1–7, 2002), and Kroenke et al. (J Affect 114(1–3):163–173, 2009)) compared to women who were not pregnant (as reported by Ashley et al. (Arch Womens Ment Health 19(2):395–400, 2015)). The present study is designed to investigate if somatic symptoms (energy level, appetite, sleep) associated with both pregnancy and depression were responsible for this increased prevalence of minor depression. A sample of pregnant women (n = 404) was compared to women who were not pregnant (n = 6754). Both groups scored within the minor depression range on the PHQ-8 and comparisons were based on participants’ responses to PHQ-8 items. Results indicate that of the somatic symptoms of depression, only changes in energy level accounted for the elevated prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant. Removing the decreased energy item from the score determination reduces the prevalence of minor depression among pregnant women to a level significantly below that of women who are not pregnant. Emotional symptoms such as feeling down and feeling like a failure were less likely to be reported by pregnant women compared to women who were not pregnant. Implications for depression screening during pregnancy are discussed.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has emerged as a risk factor for gestational diabetes (GDM). The exact prevalence of OSA in pregnancy is unknown. In addition, studies revealed that questionnaires typically used to screen for OSA in non-pregnant population were not accurate in predicting OSA in pregnancy. Factors predicting OSA in GDM women have not been studied to date. The objectives of this study were to investigate the characteristics of GDM women with OSA, and to develop a simple and practical screening tool for OSA in GDM using classification tree analysis. Methods: Diet-controlled, obese GDM women were enrolled at gestational age (GA) 24-36 weeks. Baseline characteristics, glycemic parameters and neck circumference were obtained. The participants completed the Berlin questionnaire which assessed three categories (snoring, daytime fatigue and hypertension/BMI). High risk for OSA was considered when two of three categories were positive. The participants underwent a diagnostic test for OSA using an overnight home monitoring device (WatchPAT200). OSA was diagnosed when an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5. Parameters were compared between OSA and non-OSA groups. A classification tree method was applied to develop an algorithm to predict OSA. Results: Of the 82 women who completed the study, 43 (52.4%) had OSA. The prevalence of OSA was 52.4%. There were no significant differences in age, pre-pregnancy BMI, current BMI, GA at sleep assessment, fasting glucose or HbA1c at sleep assessment between OSA and non-OSA women. Neck circumference was significantly larger in the OSA than in the non-OSA group (median 35.0 vs. 34.5 cm, p = 0.018). High risk for OSA as assessed by Berlin questionnaire (2 of 3 positive categories) did not differ between OSA and non-OSA groups (16% vs. 10%, p=0.424). However, significantly more women with OSA scored positive in at least 1 category of Berlin questionnaire than the non-OSA women (74%. vs. 49%, p=0.017). We developed a screening tool using a decision tree by including the two variables, neck circumference and Berlin questionnaire. The result was validated using statistical bootstrap. Using this model, the number of positive categories from Berlin should be considered first. Those with ≥1 positive category were considered high risk for OSA (63% by WatchPAT200 testing). For those with negative results in all categories of Berlin, neck circumference should be considered next. Those with neck circumference >35.5 cm were considered as high risk for OSA (100% by WatchPAT200). Those with neck circumference ≤35.5 cm were considered as low risk for OSA (23% by WatchPAT200). The sensitivity and specificity using this classification tree were 86% and 51% respectively. The overall accuracy was 70%. Conclusion: OSA is highly prevalent in diet-controlled obese GDM women. An algorithm using a neck circumference and Berlin questionnaire could help in the screening for OSA in GDM.

N2  - Background: Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication with potentially life-threatening consequences for both mother and baby, diagnosed when new onset hypertension and proteinuria develops after 20 weeks gestation. Early onset preeclampsia (EOP; onset <34 gestational weeks), is associated with higher maternal and fetal risks than late onset preeclampsia. At the extreme end of the severity spectrum, HELLP syndrome is characterised by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. Previous studies have demonstrated enhanced platelet activation in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia, using cell surface markers and platelet microparticles1. Although severe pre-eclampsia is associated with increased inflammatory markers in vitro, levels of platelet activation do not necessarily correlate with severity of disease2. Aims: To assess the presence, and degree, of platelet activation in a cohort of patients with early onset preeclampsia (EOP)±HELLP syndrome, and to correlate this with evidence of in vivo coagulation activation using D-dimers. Methods: Plasma samples from patients with EOP were accessed from a clinical biobank. Platelet activation markers were characterized using ELISA assays measuring platelet factor 4 (PF4), soluble glycoprotein VI (sGPVI) and neutrophil activating peptide-2 (NAP-2). Platelet microparticles (CD42a+ microparticles) were measured by flow cytometry. Platelet activation biomarker levels were adjusted by platelet count and expressed as /108 platelets/ml). All data was analysed using GraphPad Prism 7. Parameters were reported as mean±SEM. Results: Plasma samples from 19 individual patients were included. Patients with HELLP syndrome demonstrated significantly greater numbers of CD42a+ microparticles when corrected for platelet count compared with those without HELLP syndrome (598×103±203×103 versus 297×103±37×103, CD42a + microparticles/108 platelets/ml p=0.04). Similarly, patients with HELLP syndrome demonstrated increased levels of sGPVI than those without HELLP, corrected for platelet count (2.576±0.9667 versus 1.22±0.124 ng/ 108platelets/ml, p=0.0334). There was no difference in NAP-2 or PF4 levels between those with HELLP and those without HELLP, nor between severe and moderate preeclampsia patients. Severe pre-eclampsia patients in this cohort had a D-dimer level of 3.71±0.7742 μg/ml compared with non-severe patients 1.852±0.3501 μg/ml, p=0.0537. There was a significant correlation between sGPVI levels and D-dimer levels (Spearmann Rank correlation coefficient, r =0.532, p=0.04). Summary/Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate a positive correlation between severity of pre-eclampsia and platelet activation, as measured by levels of platelet-derived microparticles and platelet GPVI expression. A number of randomised controlled trials have evaluated the role of low-dose aspirin therapy as prevention for pre-eclampsia, and there is Grade 2B evidence for its use in those at risk of severe pre-eclampsia3. The evidence of enhanced platelet activation in our study provides rationale for the efficacy of aspirin in this setting, and the potential for novel antiplatelet agents to be studied for the same indication.

N2  - Background: Several studies have shown a relationship between sleep (especially duration) and poor cardiometabolic health in young adults. Individuals with short sleep duration have reportedly increased body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and blood pressure. However other studies have not reported such a relationship. Reasons for the discrepant fndings might relate to the use of subjective methods of sleep measurement, which can be influenced by recall bias. Aims: To examine the relationship between objective sleep characteristics and cardiometabolic risk factors in participants from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study at 22 years of age. Methods: Demographic, lifestyle and medical questionnaires were obtained from 975 participants that attended the Centre for Sleep Science, at the University of Western Australia. Physical assessments included weight, height and waist measurements, and blood pressure. Venous fasting blood samples were collected and analysed for glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides (TG) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Participants were required to wear a wrist accelerometer device (GTX3) continuously for 7 days and complete a sleep diary. Raw accelerometer data were recorded in one-minute periods. Data were downloaded and analysed using the Actilife software (Actigraph 2012, Actilife 6.8). Derived measurements included total sleep time, sleep effciency, sleep latency and Wake After Sleep Onset. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the relationships between sleep and cardiometabolic measures. Results: Of subjects, 59% of males and 64% females had normal weight. More males were categorized as overweight and pre-hypertensive compared to females (P<0.001). No signifcant association with sleep (quantity and quality) was detected in either univariate or multivariate linear regression (adjusting for gender, smoking, alcohol intake and physical activity) for any cardiometabolic variables. There was no signifcant association between sleep (quantity and quality) and glucose, insulin, lipids and hs-CRP. Conclusion: No association was observed between objective sleep characteristics and cardiometabolic risk factors In the study population. More studies are, however, required in this age group to verify these fndings.

N2  - We describe the case of a 23-year-old white female, 10-12 weeks pregnant, with a history of intravenous drug use and a recently diagnosed pneumonia, who was found deceased in her bed after a night of sleep. Although postmortem serum toxicology tested positive for alprazolam, tetrahydrocannabinol, and morphine, the ultimate cause of death was determined to be cardiac tamponade secondary to an isolated abscess in the ascending aorta. The patient had several risk factors for aortic rupture and cardiac tamponade including intravenous drug use, pneumonia, and pregnancy. However, an autopsy of the patient showed an isolated abscess of the ascending aorta without evidence of infective endocarditis, coronary artery rupture, aortic aneurysm, or aortic dissection making this an unusual case of cardiac tamponade. The aim of this case report is to encourage providers to obtain a tissue culture of any aortic abscesses so that the organisms involved can be identified. The identification of such organisms may help guide antimicrobial treatment in similar presentations in the future.

N2  - Many metabolic disorders may present with similar symptoms and signs as cerebral palsy. Some of these disorders which are slowly progressive are more likely to be misdiagnosed as CP. A 5- years-old boy was born at 40 weeks gestation to unrelated parents. The pregnancy was complicated by anemia and gestosis. The vaginal delivery was uncomplicated. Birth weight was 3360 g, length was 51 cm. APGAR scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 min. Child developed well up to 2,5 months. At 3 months of age he manifested irritability and sleep problems. After 3 months the early developmental milestones were abnormal. Since the age of 6 months he had periodic petechial rash, acrocyanosis and diarrhea. At 1 year old the diagnosis of hypotonic cerebral palsy was made. Instead of permanent rehabilitation child had severe psychomotor dysfunction and development delay. At 5 years of life he developed his first epileptic seizure. The treatment with Levetyracetam was started. At the age of 5 years the patient had development delay and spactic diplegia. According to Gross Motor Function Classification System he has level IV. Due to atypical course of the disease and to the specific symptoms diagnosis of cerebral palsy has been questioned and the child underwent appropriate evaluation. Blood amino acids and acylcarnitines analysis revealed high C4 level. The level of ethylmalonic acid in urine was elevated. Genetic analysis revealed two heterozygous variants in the ETHE1 gene: NM-014297.3: c.487C>G, p.R163G (CM077533) and NM-014297.3: c. 487C>T, p.R163W (CM040420). The diagnosis of Ethylmalonic encephalopathy was confirmed. The treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine and metronidazole was started with good effect. Metabolic evaluation should be performed in all children with CP for an underlying cause, particularly in situations when there is a presence of a positive family history of “cerebral palsy”, occurrence of developmental regression, multisystemic involvement.

N2  - This article reviews three new and emerging risk factors for stillbirth that may be modifiable or might identify a compromised fetus. We focus on fetal movements, maternal sleep, and maternal diet. Recent studies have suggested than a sudden increase in vigorous fetal activity may be associated with increased risk of stillbirth. We review the papers that have reported this finding and discuss the implications as well as potential future directions for research. There is emerging literature to suggest that maternal sleep position may be a risk for stillbirth, especially if the woman settles to sleep supine. This risk is biologically plausible. How this knowledge may be utilized to assist stillbirth reduction strategies is discussed. Finally, we examine the somewhat limited literature regarding maternal diet and pregnancy outcome. Introducing probiotics into the diet may prove useful, but further work is required. The possible next steps for research are considered, as well as some potential intervention strategies that may ultimately lead to stillbirth reduction.

N2  - Background: Fatigue is a common problem in patients with rheumatic disease. It may cause disability and poor quality of life (1). Although fatigue and its determinants are studied in several rheumatic diseases, there is no study in Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate fatigue in FMF patients as a disabiling symptom and its associations with clinical and demographic variables. Methods: FMF patients were recruited into the study according to FMF Tel Hashomer criteria (2). Control group composed of healthy individuals. Patients who were pregnant or who had concomitant medical illnesses such as cancer, fibromyalgia, or psychiatric conditions such as psychosis or bipolar disorder were excluded. Age, gender, disease duration, education, marital status were noted as demographic features. Number of attacks in the last year, type of attack, involvement of joints, dosage of colchicine, genotype, amyloidosis, and severity of FMF was assessed with PRAS score, visual analogue score of pain (VAS-pain) and VAS-fatigue were used as clinical parameters. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were filled out by both control and study group. Assessment of normality was analyzed with Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences in the mean scores of control and study group were compared with independent samples Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis test. Relationship between continuous variables was assessed with Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho). Results: 61 FMF patients and 61 age, gender (44 female, 17 male in each group) matched controls were enrolled into the study. Mean age of FMF and control group were 35.5±11.8 and 35.8±11.7 years, respectively. The mean disease duration was 82.5±81.7 months. Difference between mean of VAS-pain, VAS-fatigue, PSQI total score, MAF, all subsets of NHP, FSS, FIS, HADS scores of FMF patients were significantly higher than control group (p<0.0001). The correlations between scales assessing fatigue and other outcome measures in FMF patients was shown in Table. Conclusions: This study has shown that fatigue in FMF is associated with a number of psychological, sleep, quality of life and disease related factors. FMF group had increased pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and decreased quality of life compared to control group. FMF patients with fatigue may benefit from pharmacological and psychological interventions which target these factors. (Table Presented).

N2  - Objective Evaluate benefit and risk of low dose growth hormone treatment (GHT, 4.5 mg/m2/week) in very young children with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Design Prospective longitudinal clinical intervention. Methods We evaluated 31 infants (aged 2–12 months) and 42 toddlers (13–24 months) from the PWS-OZGROW database for height, weight and BMI using the World Health Organization standard deviation scores (SDSWHO) and PWS specific BMI (SDSPWS), bone age, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) levels and adverse events over 3 years of GHT. Results At commencement of GHT infants had a lower BMI SDSWHO (− 0.88 vs 0.40) than toddlers, while toddlers had a lower height SDSWHO (− 1.44 vs − 2.09) (both P < 0.05). All increased height SDSWHO (2 year delta height infants + 1.26 SDS, toddlers + 1.21 SDS), but infants normalised height sooner, achieving a height SDS of − 0.56 within 1 year, while toddlers achieved a height SDS of − 0.88 in two years. BMI SDSWHO increased, while BMI SDSPWS decreased (both P < 0.0001) and remained negative. The GHT response did not differ with gestation (preterm 23%) or genetic subtype (deletion vs maternal uniparental disomy). Bone age advancement paralleled chronological age. All children had low serum IGF-I at baseline which increased, but remained within the age-based reference range during GHT (for 81% in first year). Four children had spinal curvature at baseline; two improved, two progressed to a brace and two developed an abnormal curve over the observation period. Mild to severe central and/or obstructive sleep apnoea were observed in 40% of children prior to GHT initiation; 11% commenced GHT on positive airway pressure (PAP), oxygen or both. Eight children ceased GHT due to onset or worsening of sleep apnoea: 2 infants in the first few months and 6 children after 6–24 months. Seven resumed GHT usually after adjusting PAP but five had adenotonsillectomy. One child ceased GHT temporarily due to respiratory illness. No other adverse events were reported. Two children substantially improved their breathing shortly after GHT initiation. Conclusion Initiation of GHT in infants with 4.5 mg/m2/week was beneficial and comparable in terms of auxological response to a dose of 7 mg/m2/week. Regular monitoring pre and post GH initiation assisted in early detection of adverse events. IGF-I levels increased with the lower dose but not excessively, which may lower potential long-term risks.

N2  - Background: In 2007, we published an opinion document to review the role of pegvisomant (PEG) in the treatment of acromegaly. Since then, new evidence emerged on the biochemical and clinical effects of PEG and on its long-term efficacy and safety. Aim: We here reviewed the emerging aspects of the use of PEG in clinical practice in the light of the most recent literature. Results: The clinical use of PEG is still suboptimal, considering that it remains the most powerful tool to control IGF-I in acromegaly allowing to obtain, with a pharmacological treatment, the most important clinical effects in terms of signs and symptoms, quality of life and comorbidities. The number of patients with acromegaly exposed to PEG worldwide has become quite elevated and the prolonged follow-up allows now to deal quite satisfactorily with many clinical issues including major safety issues, such as the concerns about possible tumour (re)growth under PEG. The positive or neutral impact of PEG on glucose metabolism has been highlighted, and the clinical experience, although limited, with sleep apnoea and pregnancy has been reviewed. Finally, the current concept of somatostatin receptor ligands (SRL) resistance has been addressed, in order to better define the acromegaly patients to whom the PEG option may be offered. Conclusions: PEG increasingly appears to be an effective and safe medical option for many patients not controlled by SRL but its use still needs to be optimized.

N2  - Introduction: In term infants, regular mouthing movements (RMMs) are known to occur in clusters during non-rapid eye movement sleep. We have observed that RMMs occur in fetuses. Moreover, previous studies have also indicated that RMMs occur during non-eye movement (NEM) period after 35 weeks of gestation. However, those studies did not reveal when RMMs occur and synchronize with NEM period. Objectives: The aim was to clarify the existence of an association between eye movement and RMMs at 24- 39 weeks of gestation. Methodology: Normally developing fetuses were examined from 24-39 weeks of gestation. Fetal eye and mouth movements were observed using real-time ultrasonography, and they were stored on a HDD. The standard plane was determined to be a nearly frontal section of the fetal face from the lips to the lens margin, with the fetal lens being detected as a ring-like, round echo. EM period and NEM period was defined when the lens moved and when it did not move for a minute, respectively. RMMs were defined as a sequence of mouth movements for a second. Results: The median values (range) of RMM clusters (/ min) for each group at 24-25, 26-27, 28-29, 30-31, 32-33, 34-35, 36-37, and 38-39 weeks of gestation were 0.283 (0.1-0.661), 0.81 (0.262-1.102), 0.561 (0.233-0.833), 0.695 (0.383-1.717), 0.617 (0.237-1.593), 0.797 (0.383-0.966), 0.517 (0.161-1.655), and 0.695 (0.102-1.458), respectively. There were no inflectional points. The median values (range) of RMMs (%) during the NEM period for each group at 24-25, 26-27, 28-29, 30-31, 32-33, 34-35, 36-37, and 38-39 week gestation were 60 (0-94), 50 (0-92), 52 (0-88), 42 (7-87), 42 (0-92), 54 (5-92), 64 (0-99), and 74 (33-85), respectively. There was an inflectional point at 34-35 week of gestation. Conclusion: This study revealed that RMM cluster rate increased after 34-35 weeks of gestation.

N2  - Purpose: No treatment is of proven efficacy for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) patients with frequent recurrences or the chronic severe variant with diffuse pigment epitheliopathy and chronic subretinal fluid. There is clinical and experimental evidence of autonomic nervous system dysfunction with sympathetic system over activity in CSC but questionable efficacy of beta adrenergic blocking agents. We evaluated the use of labetalol in a prospective series to test the hypothesis that combined alpha-1 and beta-1 and 2 blockade could reduce the number and duration of episodes of CSC. Methods: A total of 5 patients were included. 4 patients had frequent recurrent disease and 1 had the chronic severe variant with pigment epitheliopathy and subretinal fluid bilaterally. All findings were confirmed by fluorescein angiography and/or OCT. Subjects were all male with ages ranging from 44 to 52 years old at presentation. Treatment was initiated with labetalol, an alpha-1 and beta-1 and 2 adrenergic blocking drug which has been shown to have increased affinity for melanin in the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. All patients had received medical clearance by their internist prior to initiating labetalol. Results: All 5 patients had improvement in vision with resolution of neurosensory retinal detachments, reduced or no frequency of recurrences, and absence of leakage on fluorescein angiography. Duration of therapy ranged from 2.5 months to 10 years. 1 patient had a positive challenge, de-challenge, and re-challenge with labetalol. 3 patients had side effects of lethargy. 1 patient discontinued the drug and 1 continued at a reduced dosage. Follow-up ranged from 8.5 months to greater than 10 years at last visit. Conclusions: The results of this prospective series support the hypothesis that some patients with CSC have an underlying autonomic nervous dysfunction with sympathetic system over activity that may be amenable to pharmacologic therapy. CSC episodes may be triggered by other factors that exacerbate this dysfunction. These may include psychological stress, use of adrenergic agents, exogenous or endogenous corticosteroids, sleep disorders, pregnancy, or other factors. Blockade of both alpha-1 and beta adrenergic receptors therefore seems to be a rational approach to treat patients with frequent recurrences or the severe variant. We believe this treatment is worthy of further investigation.

N2  - Background Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) is a disorder of unknown etiology that typically manifests in the first year of life with chronic tachypnea, retractions, hypoxemia and crackles as well as occasionally wheezing on chest auscultation. Chest radiograph almost invariably shows hyperinflation, whereas high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging typically shows air trapping, geographic ground glass opacities (GGO) attenuation pattern affecting at least 4 lobes;most conspicuous in the rightmiddle lobe and lingula. Most patients with NEHI are born at term after uncomplicated pregnancies, but cases occurring in late preterm infants have been reported. Many patients come to our attention with persistent symptoms after a presumed viral infection, although further history usually reveals respiratory symptoms that predate the acute illness. Patients with NEHI frequently have failure to thrive and gastroesophageal reflux is common. Our purpose is to present 2 cases of NEHI, with different degrees of severity. Case Descriptions The first case is a previously well 10-month-old male infant followed at the Pediatric Pulmonology Unit. Reported clinical onset of progressive dyspnea mostly at sleep time was at the age of four months. There were no respiratory problems in the neonatal period, or any relevant familial antecedents and absence of consanguinity. Physical examination revealed normal weight and length, tachypnea, retractions, hypoxemia and crackles on both lungs. The patient started a continuous home oxygen supplementation. An extensive diagnostic workup was performed including complete blood count and measurement of serum immunoglobulin levels, sweat test, blood gas analysis and echocardiography. The HRCT imaging revealed diffuse groundglass opacities mostly in the right middle lobe, lingula and zones of air trapping. Because of the typical findings of clinical improvement, we decided not to perform open lung biopsy. During the followed period, there was significant clinical and radiological improvement and no more oxygen requirement at 2 years of age. The second case is a previously healthy child of 5-months, diagnosed with NEHI from chest CT with typical findings of the disease, made during investigation of dyspnea and triggered by an acute viral bronchiolitis of atypical evolution. The child was late preterm, without complications or any respiratory problems in the newborn period. He had a prolonged hospitalization due to wheezing, crackle, retractions, hypoxia and feeding problems. Despite of normal swallowing fluoroscopy, the patient experienced gagging and wheezing was difficult to treat due to probable gastroesophageal reflux. Conclusion NEHI is a rare childhood disorder presenting in the first 2 years of life with common but challenging key clinical features, in particular hypoxemia, respiratory distress and failure to thrive, and distinct imaging and histological findings. Close follow up is necessary since patients can have different outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Placental histologic examination can assist in revealing the mechanism leading to preterm birth. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between intrauterine pathological processes, morbidity and mortality of premature infants, and their long term outcome. Neonatal brain activity is increasingly monitored in neonatal intensive care units by amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) and indices of background activity and sleep cycling patterns were correlated with long term outcome. We hypothesized an association between types of placental lesions and abnormal neonatal aEEG patterns. Objective: To determine the association between the placental lesions observed in extreme preterm deliveries, and their neonatal aEEG patterns and survival. Patients and methods: This prospective cohort study included extreme premature infants, who were born ≤28 weeks of gestation, their placentas were available for histologic examination, and had a continues aEEG, soon after birth)n = 34). Infants and maternal clinical data were collected. aEEG data was assessed for percentage of depressed daily activity in the first 3 days of life and for sleep cycling. Associations of placental histology with clinical findings and aEEG activity were explored using parametric and non-parametric statistics. Results: Twenty two out of the 34 newborns survived to discharge. Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) or chorioamnionitis were associated with placental lesions consistent with fetal amniotic fluid infection (AFI) or maternal under perfusion (MUP) (P < 0.05). Lesions consistent with fetal response to AFI were associated with absence of SWC pattern during the 1st day of life. Fetal-vascular-thrombo-occlusive lesions of inflammatory type were negatively associated with depressed cerebral activity during the 1st day of life, and with aEEG cycling during the 2nd day of life (P<0.05). Placental lesions associated with MUP were associated with depressed neonatal cerebral activity during the first 3 days of life (P = 0.007). Conclusions: Depressed neonatal aEEG patterns are associated with placental lesions consistent with maternal under perfusion, and amniotic fluid infection of fetal type, but not with fetal thrombo-oclusive vascular disease of inflammatory type. Our findings highlight the association between the intrauterine mechanisms leading to preterm parturition and subsequent depressed neonatal cerebral function early after birth, which eventually may put premature infants at risk for abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome.

N2  - The intriguing aspect of the relationship between obesity and respiratory health is although obesity is an independent risk factor for conditions such as asthma, not all obese patients are affected by respiratory disease. It is therefore important to disentangle true causal relationships from mere associations when considering the triad of obesity, systemic inflammation and respiratory disease. As the majority of research to date that has investigated interactions between obesity, inflammation and respiratory disease in children has focused on asthma, this update will explore relationships in the context of asthma. One of the biggest conundrums that we are faced with when considering obesity and asthma is that although more children with asthma are obese, it is not known whether asthmatic children are at increased risk of weight gain due to modifiable lifestyle factors. A cross-sectional study that aimed to investigate the impact of asthma on lifestyle factors also associated with obesity has shown non-obese children with asthma had greater sleep latency and plasma triglycerides compared to non-obese, non-asthmatic children,1 suggesting asthma per se is a risk factor for obesity. Although a specific phenotype of asthma associated with obesity has been accepted and described in adult patients, specifically those with severe disease (adult onset, predominantly females with little evidence of airway inflammation), there is now increasing evidence of an obese asthma phenotype in children. Obese asthma is complex and influenced by numerous factors including nutrition and its impact on the gut and lung microbiome, metabolism, airway wall mechanics, genetic susceptibility, and systemic inflammation.2 Th2 Low Inflammation and Systemic IL-6 Levels in Obese Asthma A key difference between adult onset and the pediatric obese asthma phenotype is the role of maternal weight during pregnancy and the rate of the child's weight gain in early postnatal life. Maternal obesity has been associated with childhood asthma, and has been associated with altered immune profiles in cord blood including a switch towards pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-alpha.3 Interestingly, the pro-inflammatory state was not associated with an increase in the expected allergic inflammatory mediators such as IL-4 or IL-5. Indeed, numbers of eosinophils and CD4+ T helper2 cells were lower in babies born to obese mothers. This underscores a likely fundamental difference in the pathophysiology of childhood onset obese asthma from allergic asthma. A specific systemic inflammatory profile has recently been described in adult obese patients with a non-Th2 high phenotype. Systemic IL-6 inflammation and clinical features of metabolic dysfunction occurred most commonly in a subset of obese asthma patients, and were associated with more severe asthma.4 These data, together with the cord blood data from maternal obesity, suggest the mechanisms underpinning obese asthma in both adults and children may be very similar with IL-6 as a potential central mediator driving the disease. Furthermore, the absence of a Th2 inflammatory profile may explain why obese asthma is a relatively steroid resistant phenotype. Experimental studies have also shown that although steroids may help to reduce the allergen-induced component of airway inflammation in mice fed a high fat diet and exposed to house dust mite, a second Th2 independent inflammatory component including macrophage markers and type 1 inflammation persisted.5 An important point to consider when assessing inflammation associated with asthma is the relevance of tissue specific inflammation versus systemic inflammation. The cross-talk between airway structural cells and inflammatory cells is key to determining protective or pathological consequences.6 This may be of relevance in the context of obese asthma, since evidence suggests the location of eosinophils in different tissues is crucial in determining their effect. When in the lung (specifically the airway wall), they cause inflammation, yet when located in visceral fat, they improve glucose homeostasis.7 Clinical data that correlate lung tissue eosinophilia with obesity may therefore shed light on the role of eosinophils in obese individuals with asthma and on how to improve treatments in these patients. Nutrition, the Gut and Airway Microbiome and Downstream Immune Responses A critical component of the growing prevalence of obesity in the Western world is the shift towards a diet that is high in fat content, but low in fiber. The direct impact of a low fiber diet, specifically low in short chain fatty acids (SCFA) on the composition of the gut microbiome and metabolites from the microbiota has been shown to influence the development of allergic airways disease. Dietary fiber content changed the composition of both the gut and lung microbiota. The gut microbiota metabolized the fiber, with an increasing concentration of circulating SCFAs. Therefore, mice that were fed a high-fiber diet had increased circulating levels of SCFAs and were protected against allergic inflammation in the lung, whereas a lowfiber diet decreased levels of SCFAs and increased allergic airway disease.8 Airway Mechanics and Dysanapsis in Obese Asthma In addition to the low Th2 inflammation, an additional explanation for a relatively poor response of obese asthma to steroids may be the presence of altered airway mechanics. Obese children have been consistently shown to have a low FEV1/FVC ratio, and this obstructive picture may explain why they are more susceptible to the development of more severe asthma. A recent finding that has been reported in relation to lung structure in obese children is the presence of airway dysanapsis.2 Airway dysanapsis describes a physiological incongruence (mismatch) between the development of the lung parenchyma and size, specifically the caliber (not length) of the airways and is reflected by the presence of an abnormal FEV1/FVC ratio despite the presence of normal values for both FEV1 and FVC. Airway dysanapsis was present in obese children with and without asthma, and was consistent in longitudinal measurements if obesity was present. However, in children with obese asthma, the presence of dysnapsis had a clinical impact manifested as more severe exacerbations and increased use of systemic steroids.9 The Impact of Weight Loss on Respiratory Health and Inflammatory Status Sustained weight loss using dietary and lifestyle modification is difficult and has not revealed conclusive results about impact on asthma control or inflammatory status to date in children, primarily because of an inability to sustain the weight loss. However, the impact of bariatric surgery on asthma and systemic inflammation has been investigated in adults with obese asthma.10 This has highlighted the complexity of the relationship between obesity, systemic inflammation and asthma. Adults with obese asthma and low IgE had improved airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) after weight loss, but they did not have a change in resting airway resistance. In contrast, obese asthma with high IgE had improved airway mechanics (resistance) but no change in AHR after weight loss. These data suggest at least 2 phenotypes of obese asthma, with distinct pathophysiology and contribution from both allergy and obesity, exist. The challenge in children is to disentangle the 2 phenotypes and target treatment accordingly. Those with the allergic obese asthma phenotype (perhaps they have an acquired phenotype related predominantly to diet and lifestyle) may benefit from aggressive weight loss measures as they may become more responsive to steroids once the impact of altered airway mechanics has been removed. But the second group, who have a non-allergic, predominantly systemic non-Th2 inflammatory phenotype, which may be driven by IL-6, are likely those with a predominant genetic susceptibility to obesity and asthma, and may not benefit from aggressive weight loss measures, but from systemic anti-inflammatory agents, such as anti-IL-6 antibody. Summary There is mounting evidence for the association between obesity and asthma in children, and both are increasing in prevalence. However, the pathogenesis linking the two conditions is complex and multifactorial. Obesity causes a variety of mechanical, metabolic and immunological changes in the airways and systemic circulation which significantly impact clinical asthma control. The pathways that can lead to reduced sensitivity to steroids and the molecular mechanisms driving obese asthma are being uncovered and suggest the presence of two pathophysiological phenotypes within obese asthma. A Th2 high, allergic phenotype that likely reflects an inherent susceptibility to AHR with the added acquisition of obesity, and a Th2 low, non-allergic phenotype that may reflect a susceptibility to obesity and is associated with airway dysnapsis and obstructive airways disease. Studies confirming these phenotypes in children and investigating the efficacy of phenotype specific treatment approaches are needed to help tackle the challenge of obesity, inflammation and asthma.

N2  - Objective: Mutations in QARS, encoding glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, have been recently reported in 7 children with earlyonset epileptic encephalopathy with intractable seizures and progressive microcephaly. We report on a 3.5-year-old girl with West syndrome due to QARS mutations. Methods: Genetic screening was performed using a 82-gene panel for Mendelian epilepsies. Results: The patient was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. Birth parameters were normal: head circumference 33.5cm -(-0.5SD). There is no familial history of epilepsy. Epilepsy started at 5.5 months, following a viral infection, with partial seizures and infantile spasms associated with developmental regression, hypotonia, loss of eye contact and smiling. EEG showed modified hypsarythmia with multifocal spikes, predominant in the right temporal occipital area. Two partial seizures were recorded, staring with diffuse or left hemispheric fast activity, corresponding to motion arrest, followed by eye and head deviation to the right, consistent with left occipital temporal involvement of the discharge. Association of vigabatrin, hydrocortisone and ACTH led to spasm cessation. Persistent focal seizures were partially controlled with Valproate at 7 months of life. At 3.5 years of age, she had an average of 4 partial seizures per year. Head circumference was 46.7 cm (-2DS). She had moderate development delay. She could stand up, started walking with help, but had no language and displayed manual stereotypies. EEG showed normal background activity with some residual left-occipital or right-frontal temporal paroxysmal abnormalities during sleep. Brain MRI, normal at 6 months, showed moderate cerebellar and cerebral atrophia at 27 months. Array-CGH, screening of CDKL5 gene and extensive metabolic screening in blood, urine and CSF, were normal. Heterozygous compound mutations of QARS were identified (c.[1389-3C>A];[134G>T], p.[?];[Gly45Val]). Conclusion: This observation expands the phenotype associated to QARS mutations that can have onset out of the neonatal period, such as West syndrome.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Environmental toxicants are increasingly implicated in the global decline in metabolic health. Focusing on diabetes, herein, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs) impair energy homeostasis are discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging data implicate MDC perturbations in a variety of pathways as contributors to metabolic disease pathogenesis, with effects in diverse tissues regulating fuel utilization. Potentiation of traditional metabolic risk factors, such as caloric excess, and emerging threats to metabolism, such as disruptions in circadian rhythms, are important areas of current and future MDC research. Increasing evidence also implicates deleterious effects of MDCs on metabolic programming that occur during vulnerable developmental windows, such as in utero and early post-natal life as well as pregnancy. Recent insights into the mechanisms by which MDCs alter energy homeostasis will advance the field's ability to predict interactions with classical metabolic disease risk factors and empower studies utilizing targeted therapeutics to treat MDC-mediated diabetes.

N2  - Purpose of Review: To critique the evidence from recent and ongoing obesity prevention interventions in the first 1000 days in order to identify evidence gaps and weaknesses, and to make suggestions for more informative future intervention trials. Recent Findings: Completed and ongoing intervention trials have had fairly modest effects, have been limited largely to high-income countries, and have used relatively short-term interventions and outcomes. Comparison of the evidence from completed prevention trials with the evidence from systematic reviews of behavioral risk factors shows that some life-course stages have been neglected (pre-conception and toddlerhood), and that interventions have neglected to target some important behavioral risk factors (maternal smoking during pregnancy, infant and child sleep). Finally, while obesity prevention interventions aim to modify body composition, few intervention trials have used body composition measures as outcomes, and this has limited their sensitivity to detect intervention effects. The new WHO Healthy Lifestyles Trajectory (HeLTI) initiative should address some of these weaknesses. Summary: Future early obesity prevention trials should be much more ambitious. They should, ideally: extend their interventions over the first 1000 days; have longer-term (childhood) outcomes, and improved outcome measures (body composition measures in addition to proxies for body composition such as the BMI for age); have greater emphasis on maternal smoking and child sleep; be global.

N2  - Background: Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a known incapacitating complication after dural puncture. There are many risk factors for the development of this complication. Night work time is associated with sleep interruption and exhaustion with consequent work incidents. The effect of night time work on development of PDPH is speculative and non-conclusive so far. The aim of this study was to test this work time effect on obstetric ward. Methods: In this prospective observational study at a university hospital, we compared the incidence of PDPH in parturient women undergoing spinal anesthesia for caesarean section based on different work-time periods. Using standard diagnostic criteria, patients were followed up to five days postoperatively using clinical visits and phone calls. Working time was further tested as a risk factor for the development of PDPH using appropriate statistical techniques. Results: Patients were comparable between the two work time groups in their demographic, obstetric, and procedure profiles (P>0.05). The overall incidence of PDPH was 26% (44/167). The on-call work period group had a significantly (P<0.05) higher incidence of PDPH compared to day time group: 40% (17/42) vs 21.6%(27/125), respectively. Regression analysis showed that work time was also a significantly correlated risk factor with PDPH (OR=2.58, CI 1.07-6.23, P<0.05). Conclusions: our study has shown that caesarean section under spinal anesthesia during on-call period is associated with higher incidence of PDPH than those at day time period. Specially designed studies are encouraged to search for the underlying cause of this difference.

N2  - Background: Endocrine Society Guidelines recommend surgical resection of the causal lesion/s as the firstline treatment for Cushing's syndrome (1). However, chronic severe hypercortisolism renders the patient highrisk for adverse surgical outcomes, and medical therapy could be considered for preoperative risk optimization. We present a patient with PMAH effectively treated with mifepristone (MIFE), a competitive glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prior to undergoing bilateral adrenalectomy (BLA). Case: A 27 yo woman presented with severe hypercortisolism: new onset hypertension (156/104 mmHg), prediabetes (A1C 6.3%), weight gain (30 kg in 2 yrs), secondary amenorrhea, dorsocervical and supraclavicular fat pads, abdominal striae, insomnia, depression, anxiety, proximal myopathy, easy bruising, hirsutism, acne, and facial plethora. Hormonal testing showed multiple elevated 24hr UFC (729.3, 444.2, 292.3, 231.7 μg/24hr, ULN < 50 μg/24hr), late night salivary cortisol (5.7, 11.2, 11.8, 13.6, 14.9, 15.4, 15.5, 28.3 nmol/L, ULN < 4.1 nmol/L), and suppressed AM ACTH (< 1.1 pg/mL, normal 7.2-63.3 pg/mL). Abdominal CT revealed symmetrically enlarged adrenal glands with nodules measuring 1.5-2.9 cm. Her comorbidities precluded immediate BLA, and MIFE was initiated to optimize the patient's condition in preparation for surgery. After 2 weeks of MIFE (300 mg/d), improvements in blood pressure (122/94 mmHg), hyperglycemia and weight loss (10.83 kg) were noted. After 6 months of MIFE (900 mg/d), hypertension and pre-diabetes resolved, and BMI dropped from 32.43 to 25.26 kg/m2 . Patient reported lightening of striae, reduction of supraclavicular and dorsocervical fat, and improved sleep, energy, headaches, cognitive function and mood. While on MIFE, the patient experienced transient cortisol withdrawal symptoms (nausea, fatigue), which resolved without intervention. The patient subsequently underwent BLA. Given the substantial improvement in her symptoms post-BLA, the patient was treated on low dose hydrocortisone taper (20 mg BID) and did not report cortisol withdrawal symptoms. Her menstrual periods returned spontaneously within 1 month and she is currently 8 months post- BLA with no significant symptoms, detectable ACTH levels, and is 4 weeks pregnant. Conclusion: Short-term MIFE therapy rapidly improved clinical symptoms and cardiometabolic derangements of a young woman with severe hypercortisolism due to PMAH, allowing successful BLA, and subsequent conception.

N2  - Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined by the American College of Rheumatology as a syndrome of unknown etiology, characterized by chronic and widespread musculoskeletal pain. In 2010, a new diagnostic criteria was proposed and involves not only pain but symptoms such as depression, muscle fatigue, non-restorative sleep and urinary disorders. This may lead to a lack of interest or difficulty in the sexual act, which tends to be aggravated by depression, which is manifested by low self-esteem, decreased desire and orgasm, and pain during sexual intercourse. Objectives: Compare the sexual function of women with and without FM. Methods: Sexually active women aged between 19 and 65 years with and without medical diagnosis of FM in a single center, matched for age and menopausal status, were evaluated. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy and use of medications with urinary side effects (urinary loss or retention). In a single interview the participants signed the Informed Consent Form and answered questions about personal and gynecological data. The protocol The Sexual Quotient - Female Version (QS-F) was applied to assess sexual performance. We used for statistical analysis t test for independent variables and Mann-Whitney Test for the others. Results: In this study, 126 women were evaluated with age of 43.73±10.48 years. Most of the patients were married, representing 58.7%. A total of 50% participants had 1 or 2 children, 22.2% between 3 and 4 children and 27.8% had no children. Regarding the age of menarche and manopausal status, no differences were observed between groups (p=0.70 and p=0.08, respectively). The QS-F score revealed significantly lower scores for women with FM when compared to the healthy group (p<0.001). We observed the same results in the domains: Desire and Sexual Interest (p<0.001), Excitation Phase (p=0.019) and Satisfaction and Orgasm (p<0.001). Regarding the Pain and Comfort domain, no differences were observed between the groups (p=0.307). However, when they were questioned about dyspareunia in the physiotherapeutic evaluation, it was observed that 51.6% of FM patients reported pain in sexual act against only 26.6% of healthy women (p=0.005). Conclusions: Women with FM performed poorly on QS-F general score and in most domains, except for pain and comfort. When they were questioned in the physiotherapeutic evaluation about dyspareunia, we observed that women with FM had more pain in sexual intercourse, which may occurred due to the way the question was asked. As consequence, women with FM report worse sexual performance, especially with regard to desire, arousal phase and orgasm rate.

N2  - The regulation of linear growth by nutritional and inflammatory influences is examined in terms of growth-plate endochondral ossification, in order to better understand stunted growth in children. Linear growth is controlled by complex genetic, physiological, and nutrient-sensitive endocrine/paracrine/autocrine mediated molecular signalling mechanisms, possibly including sleep adequacy through its influence on growth hormone secretion. Inflammation, which accompanies most infections and environmental enteric dysfunction, inhibits endochondral ossification through the action of mediators including proinflammatory cytokines, the activin A-follistatin system, glucocorticoids and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). In animal models linear growth is particularly sensitive to dietary protein as well as Zn intake, which act through insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its binding proteins, triiodothyronine, amino acids and Zn2+ to stimulate growth-plate protein and proteoglycan synthesis and cell cycle progression, actions which are blocked by corticosteroids and inflammatory cytokines. Observational human studies indicate stunting to be associated with nutritionally poor, mainly plant-based diets. Intervention studies provide some support for deficiencies of energy, protein, Zn and iodine and for multiple micronutrient deficiencies, at least during pregnancy. Of the animal-source foods, only milk has been specifically and repeatedly shown to exert an important influence on linear growth in both undernourished and well-nourished children. However, inflammation, caused by infections, environmental enteric dysfunction, which may be widespread in the absence of clean water, adequate sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and endogenous inflammation associated with excess adiposity, in each case contributes to stunting, and may explain why nutritional interventions are often unsuccessful. Current interventions to reduce stunting are targeting WASH as well as nutrition.

N2  - Background: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by the American College of Rheumatology as chronic widespread pain referred for at least 3 months. In 2010, a new diagnostic criteria was proposed and includes symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disorder and memory. Currently, pelvic floor dysfunctions and urinary incontinence (UI) are considered public health problems with high prevalence and great impact on quality of life (QoL) and on women's self-esteem. Physiotherapists have been working to create a new treatment proposal that can cover all aspects of FM, however there are few studies that include pelvic floor evaluation and urinary continence of this population. Objectives: To assess the strength of the pelvic floor and urinary loss in women with FM. Methods: We evaluated 126 sexually active women, aged between 19 and 65 years, with and without medical diagnosis of FM, matched for age and menopausal status, in a single center. The exclusion criteria were sexually transmitted or neurological diseases, pregnancy and use of medications with urinary side effects (urinary loss or retention). We collected in a single interview personal and gynecological data, applied the King Health Questionnaire (KHQ) for incontinent women and accomplished the evaluation of pelvic floor muscle strength according to the Oxford Classification Modified and perineometry. The participants signed the Informed Consent Form. We used for statistical analysis t test for independent variables and Mann-Whitney Test for the others. Results: The FM patients presented the weaker pelvic floor (p<0.001) and had lower values in perineometry (p=0.04) than control women. Regarding urinary loss, 64.5% reported UI against 26.6% of women without FM. In the KHQ evaluation, in General Health and Emotions domains, women with FM presented worse performance (p<0.001 and p=0.046, respectively). Conclusions: Urinary incontinence is a frequent finding in FM, and it could be related to the degree of strength of the pelvic floor muscles. This condition affects negatively QoL, especially with regard to emotions and general health.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women with depression and/or anxiety prior to pregnancy are at higher risk of preterm birth, breastfeeding problems, postpartum depression, and disruption of the mother-infant attachment. It is well documented that exercise improves psychological well-being in nonpregnant subjects with symptoms of depression. However, in only a few small studies have researchers examined the effect of exercise on symptoms of depression among pregnant women. We hypothesize that physiotherapist-supervised group exercise for pregnant women at risk of antenatal depression increases their psychological well-being. This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a supervised group exercise intervention for pregnant women with a current or previous history of depression and/or anxiety. Methods/design: The RCT is being carried out at the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, in the period 2016-2019. The inclusion criteria are pregnant women ≥18years of age with depression and/or anxiety requiring treatment by a psychiatrist or a psychologist within the last 10years and/or intake of antidepressants in the 3months prior to conception and/or during pregnancy. The women must have appropriate Danish language skills, be pregnant with a single fetus, give written informed consent, and be at 17-22 gestational weeks when the intervention begins. The primary outcome is psychological well-being (the five-item World Health Organization Well-being Index). Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), functional ability (General Health Questionnaire), clinical symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), sleep quality and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and pregnancy and delivery outcomes. The intervention is supervised group exercise twice weekly for 12weeks. The control group will receive standard antenatal care. On the basis of sample size calculation, a total of 300 women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group in a ratio of 1:1. Discussion: The trial is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge used in planning antenatal care for pregnant women at risk of depression. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02833519.

N2  - An affordable, user-friendly fertility-monitoring tool remains an unmet need. We examine in this study the correlation between pulse rate (PR) and the menstrual phases using wrist-worn PR sensors. 91 healthy, non-pregnant women, between 22-42 years old, were recruited for a prospective-observational clinical trial. Participants measured PR during sleep using wrist-worn bracelets with photoplethysmographic sensors. Ovulation day was estimated with "Clearblue Digital-Ovulation-urine test". Potential behavioral and nutritional confounders were collected daily. 274 ovulatory cycles were recorded from 91 eligible women, with a mean cycle length of 27.3 days (±2.7). We observed a significant increase in PR during the fertile window compared to the menstrual phase (2.1 beat-per-minute, p < 0.01). Moreover, PR during the mid-luteal phase was also significantly elevated compared to the fertile window (1.8 beat-per-minute, p < 0.01), and the menstrual phase (3.8 beat-per-minute, p < 0.01). PR increase in the ovulatory and mid-luteal phase was robust to adjustment for the collected confounders. There is a significant increase of the fertile-window PR (collected during sleep) compared to the menstrual phase. The aforementioned association was robust to the inter- and intra-person variability of menstrual-cycle length, behavioral, and nutritional profiles. Hence, PR monitoring using wearable sensors could be used as one parameter within a multi-parameter fertility awareness-based method.

N2  - Recent data from our group revealed that women with a diagnosis of bipolar (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) report worse sleep and more disruption in biological rhythms across the perinatal period, even during remission (euthymia). We also showed that changes in biological rhythms and objective sleep parameters (actigraphy) from late pregnancy to early postpartum period were associated with postpartum mood worsening. The objective of the present study is to replicate our previous findings using an independent sample, and expand the measures of rhythms by including nocturnal melatonin secretion. To date, 50 women (26 euthymic women with a diagnosis of BD or MDD [high risk for postpartum depression] and 24 pregnant controls [low risk group]) were enrolled. Women were assessed at 3 times: third trimester of pregnancy, 1-3 weeks postpartum and 6-12 weeks postpartum. Validated clinical questionnaires assessing mood, anxiety, sleep and biological rhythms; 2 weeks of actigraphy; and urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin were collected at each time point. Our preliminary results replicate our previous finding that pregnant women at higher risk to develop postpartum depression (those with BD and MDD) report worse mood, anxiety, sleep and biological rhythms even during euthymia. Furthermore, actigraphy data showed that high-risk women have lower sleep efficiency, longer wake after sleep onset, more awakenings and more intradaily variability during pregnancy (all p<0.05), as well as lower mesor and amplitude at 6-12 weeks postpartum (p<0.05). These findings replicate and confirm sleep and biological rhythm disturbances across the perinatal period in women at higher risk for postpartum episodes.

N2  - Background and Aims: The role of biological rhythms in perinatal mood disorders has been little investigated. Here, we evaluated subjective and objective measures of biological rhythms associated with mood changes in euthymic women with bipolar and major depressive disorders from pregnancy to the early postpartum period. Methods: Forty-eight pregnant women (N=25 Mood, N=23 Controls) completed 15-day actigraphy and the Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) during the third trimester of pregnancy and again between 1-3 weeks postpartum. Participants also completed validated self-reported questionnaires assessing depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, GAD7) and sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI). Results: During pregnancy, euthymic mood disorder women had poorer subjective sleep and anxiety. Actigraphy revealed worse sleep efficiency, longer wake after sleep onset (WASO), higher intradaily variability and more awakenings in the mood group. At 1-3 weeks postpartum, women with mood disorders had lower interdaily stability compared to the control group (all P<.05). Pregnancy: Linear regression model combining sleep efficiency, intradaily variability, WASO, awakenings and BRIAN scores, number of awakenings (P=.013) and BRIAN scores (P=.001) predicted 37.4% of the variance in EPDS scores (F5,38=6.132, P<.001). Postpartum: Linear regression model combining acrophase and interdaily stability, acrophase (P=.023) predicted 19.9% of the variance of EPDS scores (F2,27=4.60, P=.019). Conclusions: In this study, both objective and subjective measures of sleep and biological rhythms predicted depression scores in pregnancy and postpartum.

N2  - Background: Disruptions in sleep and biological rhythms are linked to mood and anxiety disorders. Here we prospectively investigated the influence of biological rhythms on anxiety in women with mood disorders during the perinatal period. Methods: Fifty-six euthymic women (N529 with bipolar or major depressive disorder, N527 controls) completed 15-day actigraphy and the self-reported Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) at three time points: 3rd trimester of pregnancy, 1-3 weeks and 6-12 weeks postpartum. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale anxiety subscale (EPDS3A). Results: During pregnancy, the mood group had poorer sleep efficiency, longer wake after sleep onset (WASO), higher intradaily variability and more awakenings. At 1-3 weeks postpartum, the mood group had lower interdaily stability compared to the control group, while at 6-12 weeks postpartum the mood group only differed by a shorter mesor compared to controls (all p<0.05). Pregnancy: Linear regression model combining sleep efficiency, intradaily variability, WASO, awakenings and BRIAN scores, revealed that awakenings (p50.004) and BRIAN scores (p50.009) were independent predictors of GAD7 (F5,3854.16, p50.004, r250.27), but not EPDS3A scores. 1-3 Weeks Postpartum: Linear regression model of BRIAN scores, acrophase and interdaily stability revealed that BRIAN scores (p50.006) were predictive of EPDS3A (F3,23 55.13, p50.007, r250.34), but not GAD7 scores. 6-12 Weeks Postpartum: Linear regression model using BRIAN scores and mesor, BRIAN scores (p50.005) predicted GAD7 (F2,2157.47, p<0.004, r250.36), but not EPDS3A scores. Conclusions: Both subjective and objective measures of sleep and biological rhythms predicted perinatal anxiety symptoms.

N2  - Objectives Sleep problems and deprivation are common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies are mostly descriptive or focused on specific clinical groups and late pregnancy. We aimed to identify sleep duration trajectories during the pregnancy period, their associated factors, and impact on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods We studied 200 women from a mother-child cohort recruited in 2009-2011 from the French general population. We used semi-parametric models to analyze data collected through questionnaires. Results We detected three sleep duration trajectories during pregnancy: short-decreasing (<6.5h/night, 10.8% of the sample), medium-decreasing (6.5-8h/night, 57.6%), and long-increasing (>8h/night, 31.6%) trajectories. Factors associated with the short-decreasing trajectory relative to the medium-decreasing trajectory were older age (odds-ratio/year = 1.13 [95%Confidence-Interval 1.00-1.29]) and working > 28 weeks of gestational age (odds-ratio = 0.30 [0.10-0.90]). Sleep duration during pregnancy in this trajectory group was modified by insomniac symptoms (regression coefficient/trimester = -0.74 [Standard-Error 0.12]) and naps (regression coefficient/trimester = 0.58 [0.25]). Restless legs syndrome was the only factor associated with the long-increasing trajectory and decreased sleep duration (regression coefficient/trimester = -0.88 [0.25]). Assisted delivery (i.e. cesarean section and/or instrumental delivery) and post-partum depression were more frequent among women with the short-decreasing and long-increasing trajectories whereas cesarean section alone was more prevalent among those with the short-decreasing trajectory. Proportion of premature births was higher in the short-decreasing trajectory group. Birth-weight-z-score was lower in the long-increasing trajectory group. Conclusion We identified sleep trajectories among pregnant women with specific risk factors that could affect both pregnancy and birth outcomes. Taking these into consideration could improve both maternal and child health.

N2  - Study Objectives: To characterize sleep duration, timing and continuity measures in pregnancy and their association with key demographic variables. Methods: Multisite prospective cohort study. Women enrolled in the nuMoM2b study (nulliparous women with a singleton gestation) were recruited at the second study visit (16-21 weeks of gestation) to participate in the Sleep Duration and Continuity substudy. Women <18 years of age or with pregestational diabetes or chronic hypertension were excluded from participation. Women wore a wrist activity monitor and completed a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. Time in bed, sleep duration, fragmentation index, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep midpoint were averaged across valid primary sleep periods for each participant. Results: Valid data were available from 782 women with mean age of 27.3 (5.5) years. Median sleep duration was 7.4 hours. Approximately 27.9% of women had a sleep duration of <7 hours; 2.6% had a sleep duration of >9 hours. In multivariable models including age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, insurance status, and recent smoking history, sleep duration was significantly associated with race/ethnicity and insurance status, while time in bed was only associated with insurance status. Sleep continuity measures and sleep midpoint were significantly associated with all covariates in the model, with the exception of age for fragmentation index and smoking for wake after sleep onset. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the relationship between sleep and important demographic characteristics during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Dysregulation of mood and sleep are independent risk factors for adverse health outcomes, as are high levels of adverse childhood events (ACE). Pregnant adolescents are at increased risk for all three factors and therefore an enriched sample for beginning to differentiate the causal associations amongst these factors. Methods: We followed a cohort of pregnant adolescents (ages 14-19, N 5 185) throughout gestation, gathering abuse history and assessing pregnancy-related distress and sleep quality approximately once per trimester. We sought to: (1) clarify the directionality of associations between sleep and mood dysregulation using a cross-lagged auto-regressive path model, and (2) Examine variability in this association as a function of abuse history, using a multiple group analysis via the grouping command in Mplus. Results: Across the sample, higher levels of sleep problems in the 2nd trimester were associated with increases in psychological distress by the 3rd (β 5.18, p 5.036). For the subsample who met criteria for abuse history, psychological distress in the 2nd trimester was associated with an increase in maternal sleep problems in the 3rd (β 5.25, p 5.013) Conversely, for women without an abuse history, higher levels of maternal sleep problems in the 2nd trimester were associated with an increase in maternal prenatal psychological distress by the 3rd trimester (p =.25, p =.010). Conclusions: The interaction between psychological distress and sleep quality during pregnancy is not necessarily fixed. By using a woman's personal history to inform her prenatal care, she can receive more targeted interventions.

N2  - Background Allostatic load (AL) measures the cumulative impact of chronic stress and is associated with adverse health outcomes. A novel scoring system has previously been developed for AL in early pregnancy that is associated with pre-eclampsia. It was hypothesized that AL, as identified by the present model, is associated with psychosocial stressors and, specifically, poor sleep quality. Methods Women were selected from a low-risk, community-dwelling study population who enrolled at <15 weeks gestation. Nine physiologic components were divided among the domains of cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory function. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the association of AL with age, income, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (IDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare AL by race and educational attainment. Results A total of 103 women were identified, with: a mean age of 29.8 ± 5.0 years, 17.5% black, and mean gestational age 12.2 ± 1.1 weeks. Allostatic load was positively correlated with the PSQI (ρ = 0.23, p = 0.018). There were no associations with age, income, prenatal distress, race, or depression scores. College-educated women had lower AL compared with those with less education (0.57 ± 0.43 vs 0.81 ± 0.55, p = 0.045). Conclusion Higher AL, measured by the pregnancy-specific model, was associated with poorer sleep quality and lower educational attainment, both of which were considered to be chronic stressors. These relationships were consistent with previous findings in non-pregnant populations, and suggest that AL may be useful for capturing the physiologic impact of chronic stress in early pregnancy.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) results in increased maternal and pregnancy morbidity including hypertensive disorders, preterm birth and low birth weight. Questionnaires to screen for OSA have been used in the non-pregnant population. As part of the expanded CARN study, our aim was to evaluate patient sleep patterns and presence of risk factors for sleep apnea in pregnant patients without history of OSA. METHODS: Women receiving prenatal care at a tertiary care center were given an anonymous survey. We ascertained age, race, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), gestational diabetes, and sleep patterns. RESULTS: From December 2015 to May 2016, one hundred eightytwo women completed an anonymous survey. Of participants who completed the survey, 96.1% were Caucasian with a mean age of 25 and 45% were obese based on pre-pregnancy BMI. When questioned about sleep patterns, 93.4% denied a history of sleep apnea, 2.7% were unsure of a diagnosis of sleep apnea, 1.1% had pre-pregnancy diagnosis of OSA, and 2.8% did not answer. Patients reported the following sleep patterns: snoring (36.1%), being told they snore (44.3%), waking from sleep with a choking sensation (6.2%), witnessed apnea (2.2%), and falling asleep while talking to someone (7.3%). CONCLUSION: In our survey, more than one-third of patients had risk factors (obesity) and sleep patterns concerning for OSA. Our study highlights the importance of a need for increased awareness among obstetricians to screen for OSA. Evaluation by a sleep medicine specialist should be considered in these patients to decrease the morbidity associated with OSA in pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction To determine the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with overall sleep duration among pregnant women. Methods Data from the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) were used. All women (n = 2951) of childbearing age (18-44 years) who were pregnant and responded to all fruit and vegetable consumption and sleep duration questions were included. Covariates included age, race, education level, exercise, and marital status. Data were analyzed using linear and ordinal logistic regression. Results Total daily fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with sleep duration among pregnant women, controlling for confounders [β = -0.03, (-0.07, 0.00)]. Orange and green vegetable consumption were both inversely associated with sleep duration [β = -0.19, (-0.38, -0.01) and β = -0.20, (-0.33, -0.08) respectively]. Ordinal logistic regression found that the odds of meeting or exceeding sleep time recommendations increased slightly with each unit increase in total fruit and vegetable consumption [OR = 1.05 (1.003, 1.092)] and for every unit increase in fruit consumption [OR = 1.12 (1.038, 1.208)]. Women who exercised within the past 30 days reported approximately 20 min of additional sleep compared to those who did not [β = 0.32 (0.16, 0.49)]. Age, employment status, and marital status were also independently associated with sleep duration. Discussion Sleep duration in pregnant women was associated with exercise and other demographic factors, but only mildly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption. Future research should investigate the effects of additional factors including sleep quality, gestational age, family status and other medications as potential confounders.

N2  - Health-related quality of life (QOL) is reported to be reduced during pregnancy. Associations between QOL, physical activity (PA), insomnia, depression and worry are insufficiently investigated among pregnant women. The aim of this study was to evaluate QOL and PA patterns among healthy pregnant women, and to examine how QOL might correlate to PA, sleep, worry and depression. This is an observational cross-sectional study, conducted among a convenient sample of 141 healthy pregnant women using five questionnaires: WHOQOL-brief (WHO quality of life questionnaire, brief version, ISI (Insomnia Severity Index), PSWQ (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), ZSRDS (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale), and Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ). Pre-gestational BMI was inversely correlated to overall health while education was positively correlated to psychological health, social relationships and environment domains. Smoking before and during pregnancy significantly impacted the general health and psychological health. Total and light PA were positively correlated to psychological health and social relationships. Sports/exercise showed positive correlations with several QOL domains. Insomnia and depression were significantly associated with a decrease in all domains of QOL, while worries were associated with a decrease in physical, psychological and environmental domains. There were significant negative correlations between ZSRDS scores and total activity. PA, worries, depression and insomnia affected QOL during pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnant women presenting depression had a reduced total PA. Sleep and mental health as well as encouraging PA during pregnancy are necessary to improve the quality of life of pregnant women.

N2  - Background: Accumulating evidence supports a role for immune system function in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous research shows that immune activation during critical developmental periods can trigger a phenotype that reproduces core features of ASD, including altered social interaction and communication. We recently developed a “multiple hit” immune model, whereby mice are exposed to repeated perinatal immune activation and then evaluated in tests representing behavioral domains dysregulated in ASD. Methods: Pregnant mice (C57/BL6) were injected with PolyI:C (20 mg/kg) on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and a subset received a second hit of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10mg/kg) on postnatal day 9 (PND9). We then examined numerous behaviors related to key features of ASD over a period of weeks. We also used a wireless electroencephalography (EEG)/electromyography (EMG) system to assess two physiological measures commonly dysregulated in ASD: sleep and epileptiform activity. Results: Our multi-hit model produced a behavioral phenotype that resembles ASD in numerous domains, with significant alterations (p<0.05) in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), adult USVs, social interaction, and open field behavior. Interestingly, males were more prominently affected than females. Postnatal LPS treatment was sufficient to produce many of these effects. In the EEG telemetry study, the multi-hit treatment produced significant alterations (p<0.05) in activity, temperature, and sleep (increased slow-wave sleep). Further, postnatal LPS produced elevations in epileptiform activity (spike-wave discharges). Conclusions: Perinatal immune activation produces a sex-dependent behavioral phenotype, accompanied by alterations in sleep and epileptiform activity. This models key features of ASD, supporting an immunological involvement in subtypes of this condition.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Environmental disturbance of the circadian rhythm is associated with the development of hypertension. Hypertension can originate from early-life insults. Adult rats exposed to continuous light cause melatonin deficiency and leads to hypertension, while it is unclear whether maternal continuous light exposure can induce programmed hypertension in adult offspring. We reported previously that melatonin can be protective in a variety of models of programmed hypertension. Therefore, the present study examined whether maternal melatonin or its analogue agomelatine therapy prevented maternal continuous light exposure-induced programmed hypertension in adult offspring and explored the melatonin signaling pathway in the kidneys. Additionally, we employed the whole-genome RNA nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) to further quantify the abundance of RNA transcripts in the offspring kidney from maternal exposure to continuous light, melatonin, or agomelatine. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats randomly divided into four groups: controls, rats exposed to continuous light, exposed to continuous light plus treated with agomelatine (50mg/day i.p.), and exposed to continuous light plus treated with 0.01 % melatonin in drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation period. Male offspring (n=10/group) were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. RESULTS: Maternal continuous light exposure induced hypertension in male offspring, which was prevented by melatonin or agomelatine therapy. Maternal exposure to continuous light impaired melatonin synthesis and signaling in the developing kidney, but not persisted into adulthood. Continuous light exposure modified 718 renal transcripts in developing offspring kidney analyzed by RNA next generation sequencing (NGS). Our NGS data showed peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway is significantly regulated pathway among different groups. Genes that belong to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), sodium transporters, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and circadian rhythm were potentially involved in the maternal exposure to continuous light-induced programmed hypertension. Maternal agomelatine therapy decreased Ace expression but increased Agtr2 and Mas1. Maternal melatonin therapy prevented the increases of Slc9a3, Slc12a3, and Atp1a1 expression induced by maternal continuous light exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal melatonin or agomelatine therapy prevents programmed hypertension induced by maternal exposure to continuous light. Agomelatine and melatonin reprogram the RAS and sodium transporters differentially, to prevent programmed hypertension. By providing new information of candidate pathways on BP regulation whose effects can be modified by agomelatine or melatonin, our NGS results are of significance to the development of novel interventions in the prevention of programmed hypertension in children exposed to maternal night shift work and circadian disruption.

N2  - Understanding risk factors that may vary culturally can help improve preventive strategies for obesity. This is the first cross-sectional study aimed to determine the risk factors for overweight/obesity in children aged 2-6 years in a central Anatolian city in Turkey. A total of 1582 children (1351 healthy, 231 overweight/obese) aged 2-6 years were included from the Anthropometry of Turkish Children aged 0-6 years database. Age, gender, birth weight, birth order, mother's age, mother's body mass index (BMI), weight gain of mothers during pregnancy, presence of gestational diabetes, breastfeeding duration, history of formula feeding, mother's and father's education, mother's job, monthly income, smoking at home and physical activity, sleep duration and duration of television (TV) watching of the children were evaluated as independent risk factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate risk factors for overweight/obesity. Having a high family income compared to bad [odds ratio (OR)=1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.237-3.106], increased the time of watching TV during the weekend (OR=1.094; 95% CI: 1.032-1.159), and similar physical activity level according to their peers compared to less (OR=2.957; 95% CI: 1.056-8.282) were found to be significantly associated with a higher risk of overweight/obesity in children aged 2-6 years old. The early childhood period seems to be important in the establishment of healthy behavioral patterns, especially limitation of TV watching and encouragement of physical activity. Obesogenic environment in families with high incomes need to be revealed.

N2  - Aim: To identify and illustrate risk markers for the development and progression of multiregional musculoskeletal pain (MMP), chronic widespread pain (CWP) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods: Non-modifiable and modifiable risk markers for MMP were determined by a twin family case-control study in collaboration with the Australian Twin Registry (ATR) and by collaborative epidemiological research on the Western Australian Raine Study pregnancy cohort database at age 22. Risk markers with best evidence forCWP and FMS were identified by extensive literature search. Progression from regional musculoskeletal pain to CWP and FMS and related risk markers is illustrated by two case histories. Results: Analysis of the twin family study (481 responders, 11.4% with 3 + sites) showed current (one month) MMP influenced by age across adolescence, female gender, twin concordance and familial evidence of genetic effect. The Raine database analyses (N = 1076-1096) showed MMP independently associated with age, female gender, anxiety and depression, poor sleep quality. Literature review identified life-course risk markers for CWP and/or FMS: familial/genetic, female, child adversity, cognitive and psychosocial, trauma, primary pain disorders, hypermobility, rheumatic disorders, sleep problems, iron deficiency, infectious illness, polyneuropathy. Case 1 illustrated the pain extension over 25 years in an adult female from regional distribution (bilateral shoulder capsulitis) to FMS, substantially influenced by long sustained central sensitisation. Case 2, in contrast, illustrated the evolution from childhood to 25 years of regional musculoskeletal pain to FMS, probably influenced by high vulnerability from no fewer than 10 evidenced-based risk markers. Conclusions: The prospects of prevention or minimizing CWP and FMS would probably be improved by identification and management of the modifiable risk markers over the life course.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Prenatal yoga has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for depression and pain, while improving high-risk pregnancy outcomes. This study investigated the feasibility of establishing a prenatal yoga program for hospitalized high-risk antepartum patients. METHODS: Patients admitted for at least 72 hours to the antepartum service at a tertiary care center were screened for eligibility and consented. Additional medical clearance was obtained from their primary obstetrician. A 30-minute prenatal yoga session was held once a week by a certified prenatal yoga instructor. Physical activity level was adapted to accommodate patients on modified bed rest. Participants completed a questionnaire following the conclusion of each session addressing class timing, length, and frequency. Antepartum nurses were also surveyed to evaluate their perspective. RESULTS: The majority of antepartum patients hospitalized for pregnancy-related complications were offered participation. Of these, 34 women consented and were eligible to participate; 13 attended at least one session during their hospitalization. Others did not participate due to scheduling conflicts with fetal testing, change in clinical status, lack of interest the day of, and delivery or discharge. Post session patient surveys revealed that all patients enjoyed class length and frequency and viewed them as beneficial for managing stress, musculoskeletal discomfort, and sleep quality. Nursing surveys revealed the class did not affect their ability to provide medical care for the patients. CONCLUSION: Inpatient prenatal yoga is a feasible and acceptable intervention for high risk women admitted for antepartum management. Future study of the effect on maternal and fetal outcomes should be strongly considered.

N2  - Background The Baby Box (BB) comes with a firm waterproof mattress that provides a safe place for babies to sleep; and helps to prevent co-sleeping, which has been identified as a risk factor for SIDS [1]. An online educational package on safe sleeping (SS) is going to be an integral part of the intervention. Working in an area of deprivation and diversity, understanding our parents is vital in order to promote SS and the BB effectively. Aims To assess; 1) Whether parents received SS advice antenatally 2) Parental knowledge on SS practices 3) Parental views on the BB Methods We used a questionnaire to explore parental knowledge and views on using the BB. Google translate was used to communicate with non-English speaking parents. SS advice was offered to all parents. Results 30 parents, of 15 different ethnicities were assessed. Only 10 out of 30 women received SS advice during pregnancy, which is reflected in the parental SS assessment results in Table below. (Table Presented) 10% of parents had not made baby sleeping arrangements. 27% of parents had heard of the BB and 47% of parents would use the BB after being shown it. Barriers to using the BB included concerns about hygiene, about other children being able to climb into the BB and concerns about design. Reasons for using the BB included the portability, proximity to parents and safety. Conclusions Providing SS advice needs to improve and be available in several languages with the use of pictures to meet the needs of a diverse yet captive population; a need which is anticipated to be met by the launch of the online education package. The BB is now going to be promoted to parents at booking when sleep arrangements have not been made. Promoting the safety and portability aspects of the BB is key to increasing its use.

N2  - Introduction Growth hormone has been proven to improve lean body mass and muscle strength. We report three cases where growth hormone replacement had a significant effect on gross motor function. Case series A 15 month old boy was born at 33 weeks of gestation. During infancy, he was noted to have global developmental delay secondary to cerebral atrophy and isolated growth hormone deficiency. He was not able to pull himself to standing position but after commencing growth hormone replacement, he demonstrated a dramatic improvement in his gross motor skills and was able to stand independently and walk with support. A 4 year old boy with global developmental delay and was unable to stand independently. On investigation for short stature, he was noted to have isolated growth hormone deficiency and was commenced on growth hormone replacement. Three months later, he was noted to have made significant improvement in his muscle tone and general alertness. He was able to walk unaided for short distances. A 10 year old boy with developmental delay and isolated growth hormone deficiency was commenced on growth hormone replacement at a small dose in January 2015. At his next neurology review ten months later, he was able to walk unaided for short distance with an associated improvement in his muscle tone. The growth hormone dose was later increased to the standard dose. At his most recent review in July 2016, he was walking well independently and had an improved sleep pattern. Conclusions Our case series demonstrates that growth hormone treatment in children with combination of growth hormone deficiency and gross motor delay could significantly improve gross motor function.

N2  - Introduction: Tere is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of primary interventions aiming to prevent excess weight gain among young children. Evaluating behavioral changes, such as physical activity (pa), may add to future development of efcient interventions. The objective was to evaluate the effect of the 15 months intervention on pa outcomes in the Healthy Start intervention that focused on changing diet, pa, sleep and stress management among normal weight but obesity-prone preschool children. Methods: From a baseline study population of 635 normal weight chil-dren from the greater Copenhagen area, who had either a birth weight ≥ 4,000 g, mothers with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of ≥ 28 kg/m2, or mothers with an educational level ≤10 years of schooling, parents of 307 children had given information on pa at both the baseline and follow-up examinations. pa was obtained from a 7 days recording in the Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire. Time used for sport activities were com-bined with outdoor playing time to achieve a proxy of total pa level. Results: Linear regression analyses revealed that the intervention group spent more time being physically active per week in per protocol (pp), as well as in the intention to treat analyses (pp analyses: intervention: 400 min/week; 95% ci: 328, 472; control: 325 min/week; 95% ci: 281, 369; p = 0.03), although no signifcant intervention effects were seen for each of the subcategories making up total pa, e.g. sports participation, outdoor activities, screen time, or commuting frequency. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the overall time spent being physically active was increased among normal weight obesity-prone children, as a result of the Healthy Start intervention.

N2  - Aims To determine whether adverse childhood experiences (ACE) influence child behaviour and correlation with final diagnosis of ASD in a cohort of children referred for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods We did a retrospective analysis of 156 children referred to a district level child development centre for assessment of ASD. Correlation by means of univiarate chi squared tests using SPSS of behavioural features (sensory difficulties, poor sleep, loses temper, physical aggression and sad or self-harm) in relation to potential predisposing factors including: age, sex, gestation, epilepsy, chromosomal defect, presence of developmental delay, final diagnosis of ASD and ACE in the form of maternal depression, domestic violence and child protection plan (past or present). Source of information was electronic records (SystmOne), where the evidence for domestic violence and the child protection plan was derived directly from police and social care. Results The average age of the children at the time of referral was 6.5 (median 5.4, range 1-15) years, 40 (26%) were girls, only 3 had been born pre-term (<36 weeks). 115 had been through the complete ASD diagnostic process and 63 (55%) had received a diagnosis of ASD. In relation to ACE; 12 (8%) had or had had a protection plan, 19 (12%) had experienced domestic violence and 9 (6%) maternal depression. Significant associations were: domestic violence with temper (p=0.037) and aggression (p=0.030), maternal depression with aggression (p=0.049), child self-harm with temper (p=0.001) and aggression (p=0.04), sleep difficulties with aggression (p=0.002), developmental delay with temper (p=0.012). The diagnosis of ASD correlated with sensory difficulties (p<0.001) and developmental delay (p=0.014). Many aggressive children received medication (p=0.003). Conclusion The results show exposure to domestic violence and maternal depression had an impact on behaviour but not on the diagnosis of ASD which was strongly correlated with developmental delay. Computerised medical records systems deriving information from a variety of sources can reveal the impact of ACE on child behaviour. It is important two of the three ACE were recorded independently of parental history. These relationships, using these types of information sources, deserve further systematic prospective study with larger cohorts.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: The female's adolescent reproductive health is based on her knowledge, practices and attitude towards her menstrual cycle to safely predict safe periods, understand her body physiology and any pathologic changes/patterns hence preventing psychological, social and academic challenges, unnoticed ailments, unintended pregnancies, leading to unsafe abortions, infections; thereby, increasing the morbidity and mortality rate of adolescents e a key population of the world's demography e hence achieving the worlds SDGs. Population Sample and Methodology: A descriptive cross sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among 408 adolescent girls in public secondary (Junior/Senior) schools in Ado-Odo Ota (Semi-Urban) LGA. Results: Respondents mean age is 14.17±3.64 years. Knowledge assessment of menstruation included information on safe period, menstrual cycle and menopause. Well over half of the girls (68.38%) had positive attitude towards menstruation. 63.97% of the girls had attained menarche (mean menarchal age; 12.85±1.49 years) and mothers were the main source of information and help for menstruation. Most prevalent menstrual symptom and method of relief were abdominal pain (45.60%) and Rest/Sleep (31.03%). Majority of the respondents had fair to good menstrual hygienic practices, with cost of sanitary pads, lack of knowledge and conducive bathroom/toilet in schools as constraints/ obstacles. Conclusion: Complete knowledge about menstrual related issues among adolescents is relatively low, attitude e although e good but some ideal practices are left behind with some unhygienic practices, menstrual patterns and disorders; prevalent (as health seeking behaviour is low). Recommendation: Mothers, sisters, schools, media, the community, health professionals and government should be well equipped and provide a conducive and total enabling environment for adolescents' health.

N2  - Objective/Background The objective of this study was to evaluate medical comorbidity patterns in patients with a narcolepsy diagnosis in the United States. Patients/Methods This was a retrospective medical claims data analysis. Truven Health Analytics MarketScan® Research Databases were accessed to identify individuals ≥18 years of age with ≥1 diagnosis code for narcolepsy (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9, 347.0, 347.00, 347.01, 347.1, 347.10, or 347.11) continuously insured between 2006 and 2010, and controls without narcolepsy matched 5:1 on age, gender, region, and payer. Narcolepsy and control subjects were compared for frequency of comorbid conditions, identified by the appearance of >1 diagnosis code(s) mapped to a Clinical Classification System (CCS) level 1 category any time during the study period, and on specific subcategories, including recognized narcolepsy comorbidities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and depression. Results The final study group included 9312 subjects with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59% female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a statistically significant excess prevalence in all the CCS multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds ratio (OR) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; OR 3.7, 95% CI 3.4, 3.9). Conclusions In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at significantly higher rates than matched controls.

N2  - Introduction: We present a case of epidural catheter entrapment, a rare but potentially serious complication of epidural insertion. Case report: A 24-year-old woman (BMI 28 kg/m2) attended labour ward at 38+6 weeks gestation for induction of labour. She had received uncomplicated epidural analgesia in her first labour. She requested an epidural soon after the onset of labour. Insertion of the epidural was uneventful (sitting position, midline L3-4, 16 G x 80 mm Pajunk Surety Tuohy needle, LOR to saline at 6 cm, fixed at 11 cm at skin). The epidural provided good analgesia and she delivered 3 h after insertion. After two failed midwifery attempts to remove the epidural catheter, the problem was escalated to the anaesthetic team who flushed the catheter and attempted gentle manual traction in both sitting and left lateral decubitus positions. Further attempts at removal using manual force alone were resisted due to concerns the catheter was stretching and risked breaking. A lumbar CT (Fig.) was performed. The catheter is seen to enter the skin at L3 before descending caudally for 35 mm and making a 90° turn within the paraspinal muscles, entering the epidural space at L3-4 and ending at the right L3 nerve root. A plan was made for exploratory spinal surgery within 24 h. Before induction of anaesthesia, one final and successful attempt to remove the catheter was made in the sitting position with downwards traction of the skin to remove the two right angles in its path. Subsequent measurement confirmed the catheter had been stretched by 25 mm. Discussion: We identified a high incidence of FI and DI compared to recently published figures.1 FI and DI were associated with more morbidity. Situational factors were similar to previous reviews (trainees, emergency cases, out-of hours, distant supervision). Improvements focus on controlling human factors in the pressurised setting of obstetric airway management. We have developed an obstetric GA checklist incorporating recommendations from the OAA/DAS guidelines,2 using the acronym OPTIMISE (Oxygen, Positioning, Theatre noise, I.V. access, Monitoring, Intubation equipment, Sleep Drugs, Emergency (FI) planning). Simulated airway drills have been introduced into trainee teaching. Prospective collection of data will identify impact of changes. Discussion: Entrapment of epidural catheters is a rare complication. Published case reports describe knots, coils and entanglement in tissues posterior to the epidural space.1 We postulate that the redirection of the Tuohy needle after skin puncture with caudal displacement of the skin and superficial tissues may potentially explain the tortuous course of the catheter in this case. Additionally, marked movement in epidural catheter position with respect to the skin is documented.2 Various manoeuvres are described to overcome catheter entrapment including using small and steady force of withdrawal, patient positioning (most advocating the same position as on insertion) and flushing with normal saline.1 None of these methods proved successful. In our case the problem was finally overcome without surgery, and the associated morbidity, by simple skin traction thus aligning the force of removal with the angles of the catheter within the paraspinal muscles. We believe this to be a novel solution, applied only with the benefit of CT, highlighting the importance of quality imaging.

N2  - Objectives: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder affecting 5% of the children.1 Although the morbidity of children with ADHD has been examined; most studies are curtailed and unable to control for genetic and parental factors and others are focused on singular comorbidities and their associations with ADHD. Our study investigates the general medical and mental health conditions present in children with ADHD compared to their non-ADHD sibling. Method: Data were collected from a cross-sectional community study of 130 children who met the DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD and commenced on stimulant medication, compared with their siblings closest in age not diagnosed with ADHD. All parents received paired questionnaires to complete for both index case and sibling. Information on demographics, general paediatric conditions and doctor diagnosed mental health conditions and the need for early allied services were included. Results: There was no difference between the ADHD cases and controls for birthweight, gestation, mean age, but significantly more female non-ADHD siblings. The ADHD child was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition including depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism and learning difficulties when compared with their sibling controls, which corroborates findings from previous study.2 In their infancy, they were two and half times more likely to be described as a fussy eater (OR 2.68; CI 1.26-5.66); five times more likely to be hospitalised for irritability (OR 5.00; CI 1.10-22.82) and four times more likely to experience sleep issues (OR 4.29; CI 1.85-9.95) in comparison to their non-ADHD sibling. Children with ADHD were more likely to have had significant injury requiring admission, as supported by earlier study4 and be affected by preservatives and migraine. Children with ADHD were more likely to require allied services which included speech therapy, OT, physiotherapy and psychology support in primary school when compared to their non-ADHD sibling. Conclusion: Our findings suggest children affected with ADHD, from a very early age experience considerably more medical and mental health problems than their non-ADHD siblings despite their shared genetic and environmental factors; hence requiring significantly more services.

N2  - This study investigated the correlation between the body surface temperature (BST) and core body temperature of ewes and changes in BST during the prepartum stage in pregnant ewes. Four non-pregnant adult ewes were used in the first experiment. The BST of the upper neck, vaginal temperature (VT), and ambient temperature (AT) were measured every 10 min for seven days and analyzed for correlations. The mean (± SD) BST and VT of ewes during the study period were 35.4 ± 1.7°C and 39.1 ± 0.4°C, respectively, with a correlation of r = 0.62, P < 0.001. This finding suggested that the BST was associated with core body temperature in ewes. In the subsequent experiment, seven pregnant ewes in their third trimester were used to evaluate changes in BST measured at the upper neck 72 h before parturition. The mean BST at -24-0 h (0 h = time of parturition) was significantly lower than that at -72- -48 h and -48- -24 h (P < 0.05). The BST tended to decrease toward parturition; all BST measurements at -16- -3 h were significantly lower than those at -72 h (P < 0.05). A clear circadian rhythm in the BST was observed at two days and the day before parturition and an unclear circadian rhythm was observed on the day of parturition. Therefore, these findings indicate that the BST also decreases before parturition, as do vaginal and rectal temperatures.

N2  - Key points: Late gestation during pregnancy has been associated with a relatively high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Intermittent hypoxia, a hallmark of OSA, could impose significant long-term effects on somatic growth, energy homeostasis and metabolic function in offspring. Here we show that late gestation intermittent hypoxia induces metabolic dysfunction as reflected by increased body weight and adiposity index in adult male offspring that is paralleled by epigenomic alterations and inflammation in visceral white adipose tissue. Fetal perturbations by OSA during pregnancy impose long-term detrimental effects manifesting as metabolic dysfunction in adult male offspring. Abstract: Pregnancy, particularly late gestation (LG), has been associated with a relatively high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Intermittent hypoxia (IH), a hallmark of OSA, could impose significant long-term effects on somatic growth, energy homeostasis, and metabolic function in offspring. We hypothesized that IH during late pregnancy (LG-IH) may increase the propensity for metabolic dysregulation and obesity in adult offspring via epigenetic modifications. Time-pregnant female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to LG-IH or room air (LG-RA) during days 13–18 of gestation. At 24 weeks, blood samples were collected from offspring mice for lipid profiles and insulin resistance, indirect calorimetry was performed and visceral white adipose tissues (VWAT) were assessed for inflammatory cells as well as for differentially methylated gene regions (DMRs) using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on chip (MeDIP-chip). Body weight, food intake, adiposity index, fasting insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol levels were all significantly higher in LG-IH male but not female offspring. LG-IH also altered metabolic expenditure and locomotor activities in male offspring, and increased number of pro-inflammatory macrophages emerged in VWAT along with 1520 DMRs (P < 0.0001), associated with 693 genes. Pathway analyses showed that genes affected by LG-IH were mainly associated with molecular processes related to metabolic regulation and inflammation. LG-IH induces metabolic dysfunction as reflected by increased body weight and adiposity index in adult male offspring that is paralleled by epigenomic alterations and inflammation in VWAT. Thus, perturbations to fetal environment by OSA during pregnancy can have long-term detrimental effects on the fetus, and lead to persistent metabolic dysfunction in adulthood.

N2  - Background: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been most recently defined as the sudden unexpected death of an infant less than one year of age, with onset of the fatal episode apparently occurring during sleep, that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation, including the performance of a complete autopsy and a review of the circumstances of death and clinical history. Despite the success of several prevention campaigns, SIDS remains a leading cause of infant mortality. In 1994, a 'triple risk model' for SIDS was proposed that described SIDS as an event that results from the intersection of three factors: a vulnerable infant; a critical development period in homeostatic control (age related); and an exogenous stressor. The association between pacifier (dummy) use and reduced incidence of SIDS has been shown in epidemiological studies since the early 1990s. Pacifier use, given its low cost, might be a cost-effective intervention for SIDS prevention if it is confirmed effective in randomised controlled trials. Objectives: To determine whether the use of pacifiers during sleep versus no pacifier during sleep reduces the risk of SIDS. Search methods: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL to 16 March 2016. We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. Selection criteria: Published and unpublished controlled trials using random and quasi-random allocations of infants born at term and at preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or with low birth weight (< 2500 g). Infants must have been randomised by one month' postmenstrual age. We planned to include studies reported only by abstracts, and cluster and cross-over randomised trials. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently reviewed studies from searches. We found no eligible studies. Main results: We identified no randomised controlled trials examining infant pacifiers for reduction in risk of SIDS. Authors' conclusions: We found no randomised control trial evidence on which to support or refute the use of pacifiers for the prevention of SIDS.

N2  - Objective The quality and quantity of sleep represent important health issues in pregnant women. Sleep disturbances could be associated, beyond alteration of quality of life, with poor pregnancy outcome. Our aim was to investigate the effect of a regular, specific, medium-term physical training program on sleep characteristics in healthy pregnant women. Materials and methods A total of 132 healthy pregnant women, with gestational age between 18 weeks and 22 weeks, were enrolled in a prospective study. They were allocated into two groups; the first group involved 79 women (average age, 29.4 years) who performed a specific gymnastics program of 10 weeks, and the second group involved 53 pregnant women (average age, 27.9 years) who did not perform gymnastics. All participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire at baseline and after 10 weeks concerning general data, sleep characteristics, and psycho-emotional status. The changes arising within a diverse set of characteristics were followed and compared for the two groups using parametric and nonparametric statistics. Results In the control group, we observed significant worsening of 12 out of the 14 studied parameters during the 10-week period. In comparison with the women who did not perform gymnastics, women who performed specific gymnastics showed the following characteristics: (1) significantly less deterioration of psycho-emotional status (stress and anxiety levels); (2) the same general pattern of decrease in sleep quality, which is related to the progression of pregnancy; and (3) a significant attenuation of the worsening of several sleep characteristics, such as restless sleep, snoring, diurnal tiredness, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Nocturnal and diurnal sleep quantity increased significantly in both groups. Conclusion The 10-week training program designed for pregnant women has an overall beneficial effect on sleep characteristics, not by improving them but by attenuating their general deterioration related to the progression of pregnancy. Our data strengthen the general recommendation regarding participation of pregnant women in specific exercise programs, mainly for maintaining their psycho-emotional and general well-being.

N2  - Background Both short and prolonged sleep duration have been linked to impaired glucose metabolism. Sleep patterns change during pregnancy, but prospective data are limited on their relation to gestational diabetes. Objective We sought to prospectively examine the trimester-specific (first and second trimester) association between typical sleep duration in pregnancy and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes, as well as the influence of compensatory daytime napping on this association. Study Design In the prospective, multiracial Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort, 2581 pregnant women reported their typical sleep duration and napping frequency in the first and second trimesters. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes (n = 107; 4.1%) was based on medical records review. Adjusted relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for gestational diabetes were estimated with Poisson regression, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy body mass index, and other risk factors. Results From the first and second trimester, sleep duration and napping frequency declined. Sleeping duration in the second but not first trimester was significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes. The association between second-trimester sleep and gestational diabetes differed by prepregnancy obesity status (P for interaction =.04). Among nonobese but not obese women, both sleeping >8-9 hours or <8-9 hours were significantly related to risk of gestational diabetes: 5-6 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.27–4.99); 7 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–3.68); or ≥10 hours (adjusted relative risk, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–4.67). Significant effect modification by napping frequency was also observed in the second trimester (P for interaction =.03). Significant and positive association between reduced sleep (5-7 hours) and gestational diabetes was observed among women napping rarely/never (adjusted relative risk, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–5.13), whereas no comparable associations were observed among women napping most/sometimes. Conclusion Our data suggest a U-shaped association between sleep duration and gestational diabetes, and that napping and prepregnancy obesity status may modify this association.

Depression is a common disorder that can be accompanied with obstetric, neonatal and postnatal complications. This study aimed to determine the relationship between depression and sleep quality among pregnant women in Tabriz-Iran, 2014. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 565 pregnant women who referred to Tabriz health centers by 2-stage cluster sampling. The data were collected using socio-demographic questionnaire, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). General linear model was used in order to estimate the effect of independent variables (sleep quality and socio-demographic characteristics) on dependent variable (depression). Results: The mean (SD) of sleep quality score was 3.6 (1.4) from possible score range of 0-21 and the mean (SD) of depression score was 4.7 (3.7) from attainable score of 0-30. A significant correlation was found between depression score and total score of sleep quality and all its sub-domains except delay in sleeping. Also, according to adjusted general linear model, the variables of sleep quality, age, marital relationship, satisfaction of husband job, place of residence and place of receiving prenatal care were predictors of depression.Conclusion: Considering that the relationship between depression and sleep quality in pregnant women and also maternal and neonatal complications of depression, sleep hygiene education will be necessary in order to improve the quality and quantity of mothers sleep.

N2  - Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) deficiency, poor sleep quality, and night-time eating, have been independently associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, but their interrelationships are yet to be evaluated. We aimed to investigate the associations between maternal plasma 25OHD status and sleep quality and circadian eating patterns during pregnancy. Data on pregnant women (n = 890) from a prospective cohort (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes) were analyzed. Plasma 25OHD concentration was measured, while the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and 24-h dietary recall were administered to women at 26–28 weeks’ gestation. Plasma 25OHD status was defined as sufficient (>75 nmol/L), insufficient (50–75 nmol/L), or deficient (<50 nmol/L). Poor sleep quality was defined by a total global PSQI score >5. Predominantly day-time (pDT) and predominantly night-time (pNT) were defined according to consumption of greater proportion of calories (i.e., >50%) from 07:00–18:59 and from 19:00–06:59, respectively. After adjustment for confounders, women with plasma 25OHD deficiency had higher odds of poor sleep quality (odds ratio (OR) 3.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84–6.63) and pNT eating (OR: 1.85; 95% CI 1.00–3.41) than those who were 25OHD sufficient. Our findings show the association of maternal plasma 25OHD deficiency with poor sleep quality and pNT eating at mid-pregnancy.

N2  - The Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) National Registry is fully operative (https:www.registronmd.it) with collection of clinical/genetic information (minimal dataset) and reporting of clinical scales; 522 CMT patients have registered thus far and have chosen one of the 9 reference centers; information collected during the ad hoc visit has been entered in the Registry for 384 of them. Registered patients have the chance to participate in a study that requires filing online self-reported questionnaires related to five important issues: disease course and complications during pregnancy; use, efficacy and tolerability of orthotics and assistive devices; outcome of surgery for skeletal deformities; safety of anesthesia; occurrence of sleep disorders (including evaluation of fatigue, anxiety and depression). By December 2016, 188 patients and 35 relatives/friends (as healthy controls) have filed the questionnaires.We are performing a first explorative analysis of results, but data collection on all questionnaires will be prolonged to obtain a larger sample. Pregnancy: 46/73 CMT women had at least one pregnancy; complications ranging frommild to severe occurred in 44/108 pregnancies vs 9/42 in controls. CMT worsened in 7 pregnancies (6 patients) with no recovery in 5 instances. Prenatal diagnosis was performed in 8/108 pregnancies. Satisfaction related to surgical procedures for foot deformities, assessed with VAS (score 0-10),was 6.4±3.5 (n = 110). Repeat surgery was required in 9/72 instances. Sleep: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire revealed abnormalities of sleep in 44/142 CMT patients (31%) and in 5/30 controls (17%). The vast majority of CMT subjects (123/138; mean 9.1 ± 3.2), but also of controls (27/30; 8.6 ±2.9) were not good sleepers according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (range 0-21, 0 good sleep). Fatigue: Scores of Modified-Fatigue Impact Scale (range 0-82, 0 no fatigue) were higher for CMT (mean 33 ±18.2) than controls (mean 16.6 ±12.5). Hospital Scale for Anxiety and Depression: 63/138 CMT subjects had mild-to-severe anxiety and 35/138 mild-to-severe depression as compared to 7/29 and 4/29 controls, respectively. Data analysis on orthotics and anesthesia is ongoing. In conclusion, the first data analyses confirm that there are problems related to all the five domains explored, that will need to be specifically addressed in patients' care.

N2  - Sleep disorders are a common problem during pregnancy and may affect quality of life. This study aimed to determine the status of sleep quality and its relationship with quality of life in Iranian pregnant women. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 565 women recruited using 2-stage cluster sampling methods. Data were collected using sociodemographic characteristics; quality of life; and Pittsburgh sleep quality questionnaire between March and May 2015. About 6% of the women had a sleep disorder. There were significant correlations between quality of life and total score of sleep quality, subdomains of habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, and daytime dysfunction. Paying attention to the sleep quality as an effective factor of quality of life can promote sleep quality and hence quality of life of pregnant women.

N2  - Background Late gestational sleep fragmentation (SF) is highly prevalent particularly in obese women, and induces metabolic dysfunction in adult offspring mice. SF induces activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), which might be involved in metabolic disorders. We hypothesized that adult offspring of double mutant mice (DM) involving the critical ISR genes CHOP and GADD34 would be protected from developing obesity and insulin resistance following SF. Methods Time-pregnant CHOP/GADD34 DM and wild type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to sleep control (SC) or SF conditions during the last 5 days of gestation. At 24-weeks of age, body weight, fat mass, and HOMA-IR were assessed in the offspring. Tregs lymphocytes, Lyc6chigh, M1 and M2 macrophages were examined in visceral white adipose tissues (vWAT) using flow cytometry. The effects of plasma exosomes on adipocyte cell line proliferation, differentiation and insulin sensitivity were also evaluated. Results SF-WT male showed significant increases in body weight, vWAT mass and HOMA-IR compared to SC-WT mice, while SF had no effect in SF-DM mice. Inflammatory macrophages (Ly-6chigh) and the ratio of M1/M2 macrophages were increased while FoxP3 + Tregs counts were decreased in SF-WT but not in SF-DM mice. Exosomes from SF-WT, but not from the SF-DM offspring increased pre-adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and decreased in vitro adipocyte insulin sensitivity. Conclusion Activation of the ISR during late gestation, as induced by late gestational SF, appears to underlie some of the transgenerational modifications in metabolic genes ultimately contributing to a metabolic syndrome phenotype in adult offspring.

N2  - Prenatal psychosocial health has been linked with health behaviors, maternal health, and birth outcomes. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of a prenatal depression intervention on birth outcomes and maternal physical and psychological status at 42 days postpartum. Three hundred fifty-two high-risk pregnant women exposed to obstetric complications with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) ≥ 9 or a Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) ≥ 60 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 176) and control group (n = 176). The intervention group underwent a six-session couple-separated psycho-educational program; the control group received the usual care. All participants were asked to complete questionnaires at late pregnancy (>28 weeks), 3 days postpartum, and 42 days postpartum. The intervention group had a significantly lower cesarean rate and shorter third stage of labor (p < .05). At 42 days after delivery, only 5.1% of participants were lost to follow-up, and the intervention group had significantly less minor and major depression, more sleep time, more satisfaction with their husband and other family members, less concern about taking care of baby, and less breast milk insufficiency than the control group (p < .05). A prenatal psychological intervention model for high-risk pregnant women holds potential as a preventive program that addresses maternal health and birth outcomes.

N2  - Background: Sleep duration and sleep quality are crucial for decision-making and optimizing health however, sleep during pregnancy is often disrupted. This research aimed to ascertain whether disrupted sleep affects women's food choices. Methods: Women completing a Massive Open Online Course 'Food As Medicine', responded to a questionnaire that explored their experiences regarding sleep and food choices. Chi-squared was used to explore how sleep quality affected food choices during pregnancy between sub-groups (age, parity, residing in a Westernized country, and pregnancy), p = 0.05. Results: 302 women (n = 67, 22% pregnant) completed an online questionnaire. Women reported sleeping a median 7.0 hours per night (range 3.5-10 hours). A larger proportion of women living in Western countries (62%) found it more difficult to make healthy food choices when their sleep quality is poor than women in non-Western countries (41%), χ2 (1) = 5.614, p = 0.018. A larger proportion of non-pregnant women (63%) reported that it was more difficult to make healthy food choices when their sleep quality was poor than women who were pregnant (49%), χ2 (1) = 4.090, p = 0.043. There were no differences between women of different ages or parity. Conclusion: Women who reside Western countries found it more difficult to make healthy food choices after poor sleep, however pregnancy appeared to be a protective factor. In order to improve women's food choices, multi-faceted interventions that prioritize optimizing sleep quality during pregnancy are required, particularly in Western populations.

N2  - Maternal metabolic adaptations are essential for successful pregnancy outcomes. We investigated how metabolic gestational processes are coordinated, whether there is a functional linkwithinternal clocks, andwhether disruptions are related to metabolic abnormalities in pregnancy, by studying day/night metabolic pathways in murine models and samples from pregnant women with normally grown and large-for-gestational age infants. In early mouse pregnancy, expression of hepatic lipogenic genes was up-regulated and uncoupled from the hepatic clock. In latemouse pregnancy, rhythmicity of energymetabolism-relatedgenes inthemuscle followed the patterns of internal clock genes in this tissue, and coincided with enhanced lipid transporter expression in the fetoplacental unit. Diurnal triglyceride patterns were disrupted in human placentas from pregnancies with large-for-gestational age infants and this overlapped with an increase in BMAL1 expression. Metabolic adaptations in early pregnancy are uncoupled fromthe circadian clock, whereas in late pregnancy, energy availability is mediated by coordinated muscle-placenta metabolic adjustments linked to internal clocks. Placental triglyceride oscillations in the third trimester of human pregnancy are lost in large-for-gestational age infants and may be regulated by BMAL1. In summary, disruptions in metabolic and circadian rhythmicity are associated with increased fetal size, with implications for the pathogenesis of macrosomia.

N2  - Overexposure to maternal cortisol in utero has been associated with lower birth weight of offspring. In order to regulate fetal exposure to this hormone, placental expression of 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2, an enzyme that converts active cortisol to inactive cortisone, increases across pregnancy. Because of this increase in 11-βHSD2 activity, measuring maternal cortisol in isolation may not reflect actual fetal exposure to the hormone. Previous work by Hellgren et al. (2016) has shown that maternal serum cortisone:cortisol ratio was a better predictor of offspring birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This paper sought to replicate these results when examining maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio. Data come from 55 pregnant women from Auckland, New Zealand. Cortisol and cortisone were measured in saliva samples collected at waking and prior to going to sleep on two consecutive weekdays between 34 and 36 weeks of gestation. We found that salivary cortisol and cortisone followed the expected diurnal rhythm and that cortisone was higher than cortisol at both times of day. Maternal bedtime cortisone:cortisol ratio was significantly and inversely related to offspring birth weight. However, waking and bedtime cortisol, as well as waking cortisone:cortisol ratio, were unrelated to birth weight. These results show that maternal salivary cortisone:cortisol ratio, like serum cortisone:cortisol ratio, is a more sensitive biomarker for predicting infant birth weight than cortisol measured in isolation. This ratio could be a valuable, minimally-invasive measurement for future studies interested in understanding the relationship between maternal HPA-axis function and offspring birth weight.

N2  - Objective: To assess demographic predictors of short sleep duration and insufficient rest among adults. Background: Insufficient sleep or rest are risk factors for cognitive impairment, reduced quality of life, mood disorders, and impaired ability to fight infection. Design/Methods: A cross-sectional examination was conducted using data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nation-wide telephone-administered survey. Outcomes included sleep time as a continuous variable (total sleep hours/day) and categorized as optimum (7-9 hours/day) or insufficient (<6 hours per day) and the number of days participants felt unrested in the past month. BMI, age, race, education, marital status, exercise, number of children in the household, employment status, income and snoring were examined as predictors. Linear and logistic regression analyses included survey weighting procedures, adjusted for all predictors, and were stratified by sex. Results: Among men (N=2,897), longer sleep duration was associated with higher education (p=0.0002) and snoring (p=0.02); among women (N=2,908), having children was inversely associated with sleep duration (p=0.002), while being unemployed (p=0.009) and having a higher household income (p=0.03) were associated with longer duration. Among participants aged ≤45 years, men with less than a high school education were more likely to report insufficient sleep compared to college graduates (OR=10.00, 95% CI=1.87, 53.42) and snoring was inversely associated with insufficient sleep (OR=0.31, 95% CI=0.11, 0.87). Among women aged ≤45 years, the only variable associated with insufficient sleep was having children in the household, with each child increasing the odds by nearly 50% (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.14, 1.87). Children in the household were also associated with the frequency of feeling unrested among younger women (β= 1.76 ± 0.54, β=0.001), but not among younger men (β= 1.06 ± 0.64 (SE), β=0.10). Conclusions: Predictors of insufficient sleep and feeling unrested differed by sex, with children adversely impacting women, particularly those of childbearing age.

N2  - Objective: To describe a presentation of lower extremity neuropathy in pregnancy and its treatment. Background: Upper extremity peripheral neuropathies involving median and ulnar nerves are commonly encountered in pregnancy; however, neuropathies involved in lower extremity are less common. Treatment options are often limited, which poses challenges for the clinicians. We report a case of bilateral sural neuropathy during pregnancy. No similar cases were found through an extensive literature search in PubMed. Design/Methods: Our patient is a 38-year-old right-handed, gravida 1, para 0, Caucasian female with no significant past medical history except for mild sleep apnea and osteoarthritis developed painful paresthesias in the lateral aspect of her foot and ankle bilaterally, accompanied with peripheral edema during her first trimester. However, five weeks postpartum, the patient's symptoms persisted. There was no history of trauma. Family history was negative for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy or other neuromuscular diseases. Results: The patient was initially concerned for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Physical examination showed no ligamentous laxity, muscle weakness or reflex changes. There was a reduction to light touch and pinprick in the sural nerve distribution. Extensive laboratory examination and imaging studies including x-ray of the feet were unremarkable. Nerve conduction studies of bilateral lower extremities revealed absent bilateral sural sensory nerve potentials and normal motor nerve potentials. Given the patient's breastfeeding status, bilateral sural nerve block under ultrasound guidance was performed. The patient reported significant improvements after the procedure. In a recent follow-up, the patient reported reduced symptoms and continued to recover fairly well. Conclusions: Our case highlights a rare entity of peripheral neuropathy during pregnancy; clinicians must increase knowledge and awareness of this uncommon presentation. In the setting of pregnancy and breastfeeding, in which oral therapeutic options are limited, nerve block under ultrasound guidance is an effective diagnostic and treatment modality.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Shift work negatively impacts circadian rhythms and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, an integral regulator of spermatogenesis. Here we examine the impact of shift work on semen parameters and reproductive hormones in infertile men. METHODS: Men presenting with infertility to an academic andrology clinic between January 2014 and October 2016 completed shift work and sleep quality surveys and underwent semen analysis and hormone testing. Men were included in this analysis if unable to achieve a pregnancy within 12 months, and had no known genetic or obstructive causes of infertility. Fertile control men, all having fathered a child within the past 5 years, underwent semen analysis and hormone testing, and also completed the above surveys. Controls prior to starting testosterone therapy (TTh) underwent semen analysis, hormone testing, and completed the same surveys as infertile men. No men in either group had prior TTh use. RESULTS: The analysis comprised 198 men: 75 infertile shift workers, 96 infertile non-shift workers, and 27 fertile controls. When comparing shift to non-shift workers, male age, female age, and duration of infertility were not different (Table 1). Sperm density, total motile count (TMC), and testosterone levels were lower in shift workers (p=0.012, 0.019, 0.026, respectively). No differences in semen volume, sperm motility, LH or FSH levels were observed. When comparing infertile shift workers to fertile controls, lower sperm density and TMC, and higher LH and FSH, were observed among shift workers. Semen parameters among infertile men were regressed against sleep quality, sleep quantity, and difficulty sleeping, and an inverse U-shaped trend observed, as previously published [Jensen et al.]. The TMC of men with moderate sleep difficulty was 15.4 M sperm/ mL greater than men with no difficulty sleeping, and 4.72 M sperm/mL greater than men with severe sleep difficulty (p=0.018). This inverse U-shaped trend was also observed for sleep quality, but only approached significance. CONCLUSIONS: Infertile shift workers have worse semen parameters than non-shift workers, consistent with alterations in the HPG axis observed in shift workers. Sleep quality influences TMC, but this relationship follows a U-shaped, rather than linear, trend. (Table presented).

N2  - Pregnant women with sleep-disordered breathing experience intermittent hypoxia, especially during late pregnancy. To test whether intermittent hypoxia exposures during pregnancy (G-IH; gestational intermittent hypoxia) alter breathing in newborn rats, pregnant rats were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (2 min 10.5% oxygen / 2 min normoxia for 8 h) from gestational day 10 to 21 (exposures completed prior to birth). Newborn rats (P0-P3) were anesthetized and their brainstem-spinal cords isolated under in vitro conditions. Spontaneous respiratory motor bursts were recorded on cervical spinal roots (C4-C5). G-IH preparations from P0-P1 rats had a lower baseline burst frequency (8.2 +/- 0.6 bursts/min; n=10) compared to normoxic controls (11.0 +/- 0.3 bursts/min; n=21). After 90 min, burst frequency decreased with time nearly 2× times greater in G-IH preparations compared to controls. In most G-IH preparations, there were frequent “pauses” in the rhythm, which resembled spontaneous apneas. With respect to respiratory neuroplasticity, dihydroxyflavone (DHF) application (5 micromolar, 9 min; TrkB receptor agonist) induced long-lasting 19% increase in respiratory motor burst amplitude in control preparations (n=5) after 90 min. However, only 2/4 G-IH preparations expressed a DHF-dependent increase in motor burst amplitude. Also, episodic substance-P application (100 nanomolar, 3 min on / 7 min wash ×3) induced a long-lasting (60-min) increase in respiratory burst frequency in control preparations. However, there was no substance-P induced frequency plasticity in any G-IH preparations (n=4). These data suggest that gestational intermittent hypoxia disrupts respiratory rhythm generation and reduces the capacity for expressing respiratory neuroplasticity in newborn rats.

N2  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is characterized by the sudden death of a seemingly healthy infant during a sleep period under the age of 12 months. Abnormalities in the medullary serotonin (5HT) system, e.g. decreased tissue levels of 5HT and 5HTT, and increased immature 5HT neurons, have been identified in approximately 70% of infants that died of SIDS. Failed autoresuscitation (inability to recover breathing and heart rate following hypoxic apnea) is considered a possible mechanism of SIDS deaths, and animal studies have shown that 5HT neurons are critical for neonatal mice and rats to survive repeated episodes of severe hypoxia/asphyxia. Gestational chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and preeclampsia both are risk factors for SIDS. In this study we asked whether the stressors, e.g. gestational/prenatal chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and/or hypertension, would increase stress hormone levels, impair the maturity and integrity of medullary 5HT neurons and the ability to autoresuscitate from repetitive asphyxia in developing rat pups. The pregnant dams of normotensive Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were exposed to CIH or room air (RA) from gestation E4-21, and then the serum corticosterone level (ELISA), the number and integrity of the medullary serotonin neurons (immunostainings), and in vivo autoresuscitation were assessed in the offspring pups at Postnatal (P) days 5-15. We found 1) SHR-CIH pups have significantly higher serum corticosterone levels than SHR-RA and SD-RA pups at P7 (11,485 vs. 8078 & 8970 pg/mL respectively, P<0.05) and P10 (11,708 vs. 9040 & 6,529 pg/mL respectively, P<0.05). At P15 SD-CIH, SHR-CIH and SHR-RA pups all have significantly higher corticosterone levels than SD-RA pups; 2) Relative to the SD-RA pups, SD-CIH pups have a significantly higher total number of 5HT neurons and primarily due to increased number of Ki67/5HT-ir positive neurons in the medulla. When compared to SD rats, we noticed that SHR pups appear to have more Ki67/5HT-ir neurons which contribute to an increase in total number of 5HT neurons in the medulla than SDCIH & SD-RA (P<0.01); and 3) the offspring pups of SHRs have the highest mortality rate during repetitive exposure of anoxia at all ages tested. Our data suggest that both gestational CIH and uncontrolled hypertension may lead to an impaired 5HT system in the offspring pups. The uncontrolled high blood pressure during pregnancy may cause placental insufficiency and contribute to failed autoresuscitation in response to repetitive anoxia in early postnatal life.

N2  - Opioid abuse during pregnancy may cause drug dependence in the fetus, and the abrupt discontinuation of opioid exposure at birth may induce neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) during the first week of life. NAS is characterized by inconsolable high-pitched crying, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, and sleep disturbances. Buprenorphine (BUP), a mu-opioid receptor partial agonist, is administered as a substitution therapy to treat opioid use disorder during pregnancy. BUP improves neonatal outcome compared with methadone or no treatment, but BUP exposure often leads to NAS. Furthermore, NAS severity is independent of maternal BUP dose throughout pregnancy, suggesting that individual differences in maternal-fetal BUP pharmacology may increase NAS susceptibility in some newborns. One possible explanation is that fetal exposure to norbuprenorphine (NorBUP), a metabolite of BUP that has high affinity and efficacy at the mu-opioid receptor, differs across the BUP-treated population and drives individual differences in the development of opioid dependence. This study tested the hypothesis that NorBUP can induce NAS. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel model of NAS in which exposure to opioids occurs continuously across fetal development. Pregnant rats were implanted with subcutaneous minipumps containing NorBUP (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg∗day) or vehicle (5 % Emulphor) on gestation day (GD) 9. Treatment continued until delivery. Upon delivery, half of the pups were observed and scored for signs of precipitated withdrawal for 10 minutes after administration of the mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (1 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline (10 ml/kg). Because of the CNS immaturity of the neonatal rat pup relative to the human newborn, this group models opioid dependence in preterm newborns. To model NAS at term, the other half of each litter was fostered to an untreated dam and received subcutaneous injections of NorBUP (0.05 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg) every 12 hours (BID) until they were tested for precipitated opioid withdrawal on postnatal day (PD) 7. Few withdrawal signs were observed in the pups tested within 24 hours of delivery, but PD7 pups exposed to the high dose of NorBUP in utero and after birth exhibited significantly more “wall climbing” and less “quiet” signs when challenged with naltrexone, indicating opioid withdrawal. The results of these preliminary studies suggest that NorBUP can induce opioid dependence in the neonatal pup. Ongoing experiments will determine fetal brain concentrations of NorBUP after maternal exposure to NorBUP (GD 9- GD20). Results of this experiment will be used to determine additional doses of NorBUP to be tested in the novel rat model of NAS.

N2  - Objectives Chronic hypertension and preeclampsia are the most common complications of pregnancy and are associated with increased risk of adverse events in both mother and offspring. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in particular, make significant contributions to support basic and clinical research on pathophysiology of hypertension in the general population. However, since the extramural community may not be aware of this commitment we performed a portfolio analysis of currently NHLBI funded awards related to preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated hypertension. Analysis A list of currently active NHLBI awards (including subprojects) was obtained through an NIH RePORTER search using the following terms: “preeclampsia” and “pregnancy hypertension”. A similar search was performed to asses currently active awards related to these topics across the entire NIH. All awards retrieved from the search were individually reviewed to eliminate “false positive” hits. NHLBI-funded awards were further categorized according to type of research (basic, clinical, clinical trials and early translational research) and general research topics being funded noted. Results Overall, 263 awards related to preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated hypertension totaling $143.8 million are currently funded across the NIH. Out of these, NHLBI currently funds 67 awards for a total dollar investment of $30.4 million. The NHLBI is the second-leading NIH institute funding research related to preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated hypertension, with the leading being the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). However, the focus of NICHD-funded awards is primarily onfetal/neonatal outcomes, while the NHLBI-funded awards are focused on maternaloutcomes. At NHLBI, 43% of these awards are related to basic science research, 16%to clinical studies, 34% to clinical trials and 7% to early translational research. Some of the research topics these awards focus on include: vascular remodeling, placental development, adverse pregnancy outcomes in obesity, sleeps disorders in pregnancy, fetal programing of cardiovascular disease etc. In addition, the NHLBI is supporting the largest yet planned clinical trial to investigate the optimal clinical management of hypertension during pregnancy, called the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP)study (NCT02299414), currently enrolling. Conclusions NHLBI is the leading NIH funder of research on maternal outcomes for preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated hypertension. The current research portfolio in this field is well balanced, with ongoing studies on basic and clinical science, clinical trials and early translation. The NHLBI welcomes applications from extramural research community with interest in research on preeclampsia and pregnancy-associated hypertension and will continue to search for potential knowledge gaps in need of support to further this important research field that impacts the health of vulnerable populations.

N2  - Background: Preterm infant physiological stability during skin-to-skin care (SSC) remains a concern. Exposure to too much or too little oxygen contributes to adverse outcomes. Nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to non-invasively measure regional cerebral oxygenation (rcO2). We aimed to compare rcO2 and physiological measurements during SSC with measurements during incubator care in preterm infants <33 weeks gestation who were not receiving respiratory support. Methods: Prospective, observational, non-inferiority study. The primary outcome was the mean difference in rcO2 during SSC compared with incubator care. Secondary outcomes included oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), bradycardic episodes, oxygen desaturations, temperature, and the proportion of time spent in quiet sleep. The non-inferiority margin was set at-1.5% rcO2. Each infant underwent three 90-minute study periods, before, during and after SCC, each including a 30-minute washout. Infants were their own control. Results: Forty preterm infants (median (IQR) 30.6 (29.1-31.7) weeks' gestation) were studied on day 14 (8-38). Regional cerebral oxygenation during SCC was not non-inferior by our definition: Mean (SD) 73.6 (6.0)% vs. during incubator care 74.8 (4.5)%, mean difference (95% CI)-1.3 (-2.2,-0.4), p < 0.01. During SSC, HR was 5 beats/minute higher, SpO2 1% lower, and time in quiet sleep 24% longer. No difference was observed in the number of bradycardic or desaturation episodes, or temperature. Conclusion: Regional cerebral oxygenation was statistically lower during SCC. However, the absolute differences in rcO2, and in HR and SpO2, were of minimal clinical importance. These data provide reassurance for the promotion of SSC in preterm infants.

N2  - Background: PCOS is a heterogeneous disease defined by multiple sets of diagnostic guidelines that are based on adult norms. PCOS in adolescents is diagnosed and treated by various medical subspecialties, which contributes to variability in approach. Thus, diagnosis and treatment of PCOS can be challenging. It is important to establish clear, accurate guidelines for all ages given the short and long-term medical comorbidities associated with PCOS. This quality improvement project aimed to standardize the approach to diagnosis and metabolic screening in adolescents seen in several different clinics at an academic medical center after an educational intervention. Methods: Data from individual encounters in four clinics were collected, including (1) adolescent gynecology, (2) endocrinology, (3) adolescent medicine and (4) an obesity referral clinic. Inclusion criteria were obese or overweight girls ages 12-24 with PCOS, oligomenorrhea or irregular menses documented by ICD-9 codes. A systematic chart review was completed and baseline data were collected from December 2013 through September 2015. Baseline data included history suggestive of PCOS (infrequent or irregular menses, hirsutism, acne) and laboratory analysis performed (thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin, free and total testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone and hyperandrogenism labs). Metabolic screening was also recorded, including evaluation for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, transaminitis, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). After collection of baseline data, an educational intervention was performed consisting of: (1) provider education with small-group tutorials and educational material posted in clinical work areas, and (2) creation of provider tools including electronic medical record order sets and note templates. Each clinic was given the same intervention by the same personnel. Following the intervention, charts were again reviewed to collect follow-up data and a chi square test was performed on overall data to assess significance. Results: 120 patient encounters were included in the study; 74 prior to intervention and 46 post-intervention. Race and insurance status was similar between groups with the exception of more African Americans seen in Adolescent Medicine. At baseline, diagnostic testing was insufficient in all clinics, with pregnancy tests omitted most frequently. Following the intervention, rates of appropriate diagnostic testing improved in all clinics. At baseline >60% of obese girls with PCOS received appropriate metabolic screening. The most commonly missed test was OSA screening. Conclusions: Adolescents with PCOS require adequate, appropriate and evidence-based care regardless of where they enter the medical system. Our results confirm that practitioners in different medical subspecialties approach the diagnosis and evaluation of PCOS and comorbidities differently and that QI projects can standardize the approach regardless of specialty and presenting complaint. Within a single improvement cycle, appropriate diagnostic testing improved by 50% in all specialty clinics. However, additional studies are needed to evaluate whether multiple cycles can effect further improvements.

N2  - Background: Elpida® (VM1500) is the prodrug of Elsulfavirine (VM1500A), a new potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with unique pharmacokinetic properties (T1/2 is ∼8 days). A 20 mg once daily dosing was chosen for further study based on 12-week efficacy, pharmacology and safety data. Methods: Compare the efficacy and safety of an ART regimen including Elpida or Efavirenz (EFV) plus tenofovir/emtracitabine (TDF/FTC). Phase IIb randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind, multicenter study in ART-naïve HIV-1-infected patients treated for 48 weeks. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive; 1) Elpida 20 mg QD, or 2) EFV 600 mg QD. All patients were treated with TDF/FTC. Results: 120 patients enrolled, 60 Elpida/60 EFV. Baseline plasma HIV RNA median was 4.7-4.8 log10 copies/ml; median CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 349 and 379 cells/mm3 for Elpida and EFV respectively. A total of 55/60 (91.7%) Elpida and 47/60 (78.3%) EFV (p=0.041) completed treatment. At Week 48 of therapy 45/55 (81%) of Elpida and 35/47 (73.7%) of EFV patients had HIV-1 RNA values <50 copies/ml (MITTI-analysis) and all patients in both groups who completed treatment had HIV-1 RNA value < 400 copies/ml. Patients with baseline HIV-I RNA > 100 000 copies/ml, with HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at week 48 were 14/18 (77.7%) and N15/22 (68.2%) of patients respectively after 48 weeks of therapy. No patient demonstrated virologic failure defined as two consecutive HIV RNA plasma levels of >400copies/ml. CD4+ T lymphocyte counts increased at Week 48 by 179 and 182 cells/mm3 respectively. Median CD4/CD8 ratio increased in both groups from 0.41 to 0.78 and from 0.34 to 0.63 respectively. Study drug-associated adverse events were observed in N22/60 (36.7%) of Elpida patients and 45/58 (77.6%) of EFV patients (p <0.0001). AEs of special interest (CNS disorders, skin disorders) with a frequency > 5% occurred in 31.7% and 62.1% of patients respectively (p = 0.008). The most frequent were headache (15% and 24.1%), dizziness (6.7% and 27.6%), sleep disorders (5% and 20.7%). Only EFV patients had abnormal dreams (17.2%), skin rash (17.2%), and pruritus (5.2%). Only 5 patient discontinued Elpida (2 AE [1 pregnancy], 1 lack of compliance, 1 LTFU, 1 withdrew consent), and 13 patients discontinued EFV (7 AE, 5 LTFU, 1 withdrew consent) because of drug-related AEs. Conclusion: Elpida was significantly better tolerated than EFV-based therapy offering a safer alternative to EFV-based ART.

N2  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated to affect one in twenty people worldwide. MDD is highly comorbid with cardiovascular disease (CVD), itself one of the single largest causes of mortality worldwide. A number of pathological changes observed in MDD are believed to contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, although no single mechanism has been identified. There are also no biological markers capable of predicting the future risk of developing heart disease in depressed individuals. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a prothrombotic plasma protein secreted by endothelial tissue and has long been implicated in CVD. An expanding body of literature has recently implicated it in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder as well. In this study, we review candidate pathways implicating MDD in CVD and consider how PAI-1 might act as a mediator by which MDD induces CVD development: chiefly through sleep disruption, adiposity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) metabolism, systemic inflammation and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)-axis dysregulation. As both MDD and CVD are more prevalent in women than in men, and incidence of either condition is dramatically increased during reproductive milestones, we also explore hormonal and sex-specific associations between MDD, PAI-1 and CVD. Of special interest is the role PAI-1 plays in perinatal depression and in cardiovascular complications of pregnancy. Finally, we propose a theoretical model whereby PAI-1 might serve as a useful biomarker for CVD risk in those with depression, and as a potential target for future treatments.

N2  - Background: Placing a preterm infant in the prone position, the opposite position recommended for term infants, is frequently employed to improve respiratory function in the nursery. Prone sleeping impairs cerebral oxygenation in term and preterm infants after term-corrected age, however the effect of prone sleeping on cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants in the NICU remains unknown. Method: Seventeen extremely preterm (<29 weeks' gestation) and 14 preterm (?29 weeks' gestation) infants were studied weekly for 3 weeks after birth, in prone and supine positions, in active (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) in NICU. Routine cardiorespiratory monitoring, oximetry (SaO2), and cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were recorded. Cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (CFOE) was calculated as (SaO2-TOI)/SaO2. Results: The extremely preterm infants had higher TOI in prone compared to the supine position, in AS at 2 weeks of age and in QS at 3 weeks of age (P < 0.05). SaO2 in the prone position was also significantly higher compared to supine in AS, at all postnatal age (P < 0.05), and was higher in QS compared to AS at all postnatal ages. CFOE tended to be elevated in the prone position in the extremely preterm infants at 1 week of age (P = 0.06). Conclusions: In extremely preterm infants, the increase in CFOE in the prone position may represent lower cerebral blood flow and hence an increased risk of hypoxic-ischaemic injury, despite both cerebral TOI and SaO2 being higher in the prone position during the first 2 weeks of life.

N2  - Objective: A study was conducted to determine if an online medical education activity could successfully improve the knowledge and competence of neurologists regarding management of clinically challenging cases of narcolepsy, which involve pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, and the impact of medications on objective sleep tests. Background: The Burden of Narcolepsy Disease study showed that patients with narcolepsy were more likely to experience an increased rate of comorbidities compared with the general population. The medical complexity of many patients with narcolepsy contributes to suboptimal recognition and treatment. Design/Methods: The online continuing medical education (CME) activity consisted of a 30-minute video panel discussion between experts on the management of narcolepsy. The educational effect was assessed by comparing a matched sample of responses to four identical questions before and directly after exposure to the education. A chisquare test was used to identify significant differences between pre-and post-assessment responses. Cramer's V was used to calculate the effect size of the online education. Data were collected between May 16, 2016, and June 21, 2016. Results: Participation of neurologists in the online activity resulted in an overall improvement in knowledge and competence with a medium effect (n = 115; V=0.196; P <0.05). Significant improvements were observed in the following areas (P<.05): knowledge of diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy, selection of appropriate narcolepsy medication in comorbid cardiovascular disease, the effect of narcolepsy medications taken during pregnancy, and interpretation of diagnostic testing for narcolepsy in a patient taking an antidepressant. Conclusions: The results show that an online CME-certified video-recorded panel discussion was effective at improving both knowledge and competence among neurologists in the management of clinically challenging cases of narcolepsy. Neurologists would benefit from additional education on patient factors that can impact the diagnosis and management of narcolepsy.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of sleep disturbances during pregnancy with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. Methods: In this prospective study, 688 healthy women with singleton pregnancy were selected from three hospitals in Chengdu, China 2013–2014. Self-report questionnaires, including the sleep quantity and quality as well as exercise habits in a recent month were administered at 12–16, 24–28, and 32–36 weeks’ gestation. Data on type of delivery, gestational age, and the neonates’ weight were recorded after delivery. After controlling the potential confounders, a serial of multi-factor logistic regression models were performed to evaluate whether sleep quality and quantity were associated with cesarean delivery and preterm birth. Results: There were 382 (55.5%) women who had cesarean deliveries and 32 (4.7%) who delivered preterm. Women with poor sleep quality during the first (OR: 1.87, 95% CI [1.02–3.43]), second (5.19 [2.25–11.97]), and third trimester (1.82 [1.18–2.80]) were at high risk of cesarean delivery. Women with poor sleep quality during the second (5.35 [2.10–13.63]) and third trimester (3.01 [1.26–7.19]) as well as short sleep time (<7 h) during the third trimester (4.67 [1.24–17.50]) were at high risk of preterm birth. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery and preterm birth throughout pregnancy. Obstetric care providers should advise women with childbearing age to practice healthy sleep hygiene measures.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence implicates daily or circadian rhythms in the timing of birth in humans and other mammals. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) generates endogenous daily cycles in physiological processes and is believed to coordinate circadian oscillations in most tissues including the reproductive system. SCN-lesioned rodents deliver at random times of day although gestation length is unaffected, implicating the SCN in gating the time of day of parturition, but not gestation length. In mice, the uterus has been shown to have intrinsic daily regulation of core clock genes, such as Period2 (Per2). We therefore investigated the hypothesis that daily rhythms in reproductive tissues change during pregnancy to coordinate gestation length and the circadian gating of birth. METHODS: Homozygous knock-in mPERIOD2::Luciferase (PER2::Luc) mice were maintained on a 12h:12h light dark cycle. Pregnant dams were sacrificed at day 8.5, 9.5, 14.5, 15.5 or 18.5 of pregnancy. Explants of uterine, cervical and placental tissue from pregnant or non-pregnant females were cultured and placed under a photomultipier tube to monitor PER2::Luc bioluminescence for a minimum of 4 days of continuous recording. All bioluminescence traces were analyzed for circadian periodicity using custom software (Chronostar 1.0, A. Kramer and B. Maier). RESULTS: We found that both the uterus and cervix were intrinsically circadian with similar periods in the non-pregnant state (uterus: 23.2 ± 0.2h, mean±SEM and cervix: 23.2 ± 1.8h). Similarly, uterine (23.4 ± 0.3h), cervical (24.2 ± 0.4h) and placental tissue (23.9 ± 0.3h) were circadian and had similar periods throughout pregnancy. We conclude that uterine, cervical and placental tissues contain an endogenous circadian clock throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that, regardless of reproductive state or stage of pregnancy, the uterus, cervix and placenta express intrinsic daily rhythms in PER2. These tissues may, therefore, act as peripheral circadian clocks in the timing of birth.

N2  - Background: Pregnancy is a risk factor for sleep disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Progesterone, one of the key hormones in pregnancy, a known respiratory drive stimulant, increases ventilation and may protect against OSA. We aimed to examine the relationship between circulating progesterone and OSA, after accounting for body weight and gestational age. Methods: A case control study was conducted of pregnant women with OSA and those at low risk for the disorder. Cases were identified by ICD-9 code and review of medical record. Controls were identified if they scored zero (never) for snoring, apnea, and gasping on the multivariable apnea prediction index questionnaire immediately following delivery. Subjects with available stored first and/or second trimester residual serum samples were then included in this study and serum analyzed for progesterone. Raw progesterone levels were adjusted for the effects of gestational age and maternal weight. Results: Twenty-seven cases and 64 controls with available serum were identified. Women with OSA had greater maternal weight and higher rates of related comorbidities, compared to controls. Progesterone levels correlated positively with gestational age and negatively with greater weight. Progesterone levels, adjusted for gestational age and maternal weight and expressed as multiples of median (MoM), were significantly lower in OSA cases compared to controls in both the first trimester (MoM = 0.71, confidence interval [95% CI] 0.60-0.83) relative to the MoM in controls of 1.00. In the second trimester levels were also lower in OSA cases (MoM = 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-0.96) compared to the MoM of 1.00 in controls. Conclusions: Progesterone levels, after accounting for weight and gestational age, were lower in women with OSA than controls. Progesterone may play a protective role against OSA.

N2  - To develop an animal model for studies on peri-partum sleep disorders, sleep patterns in female Wistar rats during pregnancy, post-partum and after weaning, were assessed and associated adaptive changes in their anxiety were examined. Adult nulliparous female rats, maintained in standard laboratory conditions with ad libitum food and water, were surgically implanted with electroencephalogram and electromyogram electrodes under anaesthesia for objective assessment of sleep-wakefulness (S-W). After post-surgical recovery, three control recordings of S-W were taken for 24 h before the animals were kept for mating. After confirmation of pregnancy, S-W recordings were acquired during different days of pregnancy, post-partum lactation/nursing days, and also after weaning. Their anxiety levels were tested in the elevated plus maze. During pregnancy, sleep increased primarily due to increase in light non-REM sleep during dark period. There was an increase in non-REM sleep delta power after parturition, though the sleep was fragmented, especially during daytime. Simultaneous behavioural recording showed increased anxiety during third trimester of pregnancy and gradual reversal of it after parturition. This is the first report where diurnal and nocturnal variations in S-W and delta power, along with adaptive changes in anxiety, were studied before, during and after pregnancy. This study also provides an animal model for drug trials and studies on sleep disorders during peri-partum window.

N2  - Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in non-obstetrical and obstetrical patients. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of OSA and its relationship with pregnancy-related complications in a general obstetric population of Department of Defense beneficiaries receiving direct-care at military treatment facilities. Study design A retrospective cohort study of all women (N = 305,001) who gave birth at a military treatment facility from 2008 to 2014. OSA cases were randomly selected and matched on age (3:1 ratio) to non OSA cases. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes (cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, postoperative wound complications, hospital stay greater than five days, acute renal failure, pulmonary edema, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, and stillbirth) between pregnant women with and without a diagnosis of OSA. Cases were identified using ICD-9 codes, while controlling for demographics, obesity, and medical comorbidities associated with OSA and the outcomes of interest. Results We identified 266 cases of OSA (OSA rate = 8.7 per 10,000; increased from 6.4 to 9.9 per 10,000 from 2009 to 2013). OSA was associated with a higher odds of cesarean delivery (AOR,1.60; 95% CI, 1.06–2.40), gestational hypertension, (AOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.30–4.68), preeclampsia (AOR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.43–4.09), and preterm delivery (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09–3.30). Conclusions Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.

N2  - Background: Prior research has shown a J shaped association between parity and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and several confounding factors have been identified. Sleep is emerging as an important, potentially modifiable risk factor for CVD, however few data have examined the relationship between parity and sleep. Methods: We studied 50 women in the AHA Go Red for Women Strategically Focused Research Network who provided information on pregnancy history and sleep patterns [56% non-white (n=28), mean age = 41±18 y]. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess sleep duration and quality, and the Insomnia Severity Index was used to assess level of insomnia. Parity was assessed using a standardized questionnaire as any pregnancies lasting > 6 mo. We used linear and logistic regression to examine the cross-sectional relation between sleep (duration, quality, and insomnia severity) and parity. Results: Prior pregnancy was reported in 32% (16 of 50) women and 36% (18 of 50) sleep ≤ 6 h/night. Parous women were significantly older (55 vs 34 y), more likely to have a BMI ≥25 kg/m2, HTN, and hyperlipidemia compared to nulliparous women. Sleep duration was significantly shorter in parous women (6 h vs 7 h), and the relationship remained significant for primiparous women (1 birth) after adjustment (Figure). More than half of parous women reported poor sleep quality (56%, 9 of 16) and insomnia (63%, 10 of 16) compared to 29% of nulliparous women (10 of 34) who reported each sleep disorder. After adjustment for age, there was no difference in sleep quality or insomnia between groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: In a diverse cohort of women, sleep duration was inversely related to parity. Primiparous women may be at heightened risk for the adverse cardiometabolic consequences of inadequate sleep duration, and may represent a teachable moment for CVD prevention. Ongoing studies to examine the relationship between sleep and pregnancy may provide important information on the pathways through which these risk factors modify future CVD.

N2  - Introduction: Women of child-bearing age are the population at greatest risk for depression. The stress experienced during pregnancy and the associated antidepressant treatments can both affect fetal development. Fluoxetine (FLX) is among the most common antidepressants used by pregnant women. We have previously demonstrated that perinatal exposure to FLX can alter expression of circadian rhythms in adulthood. Here, we examine the combined effects of maternal stress during pregnancy and perinatal exposure to the antidepressant FLX on the circadian behavior of mice as adults. Methods: Mouse dams were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (embryonic (E) day 7 to E18), FLX (E15 to postnatal day 12), a combination of both stress and FLX, or were left untreated. At 2 months of age, male offspring were placed in recording chambers and circadian organization of wheel running rhythms and phase shifts to photic and non-photic stimuli were assessed. Results: Mice exposed to prenatal stress (PS) had smaller light-induced phase delays. Mice exposed to perinatal FLX required more days to re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance of their light–dark cycle. Mice subjected to either perinatal FLX or to PS had larger light-induced phase advances and smaller phase advances to 8-OH-DPAT. FLX treatment partially reversed the effect of PS on phase shifts to late-night light exposure and to 8-OH-DPAT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in mice, perinatal exposure to either FLX, or PS, or their combination, leads to discernible, persistent changes in their circadian systems as adults.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this article is to investigate the determinants of sleeping patterns in children up to age 9 on a large and geographically homogeneous sample of British children and parents, focusing in particular on the role of economic and social factors, specifically on income. Aims and Methods: The data of this study come from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a long-term health research project that recruited over 14 000 pregnant women who were due to give birth between April 1991 and December 1992 in Bristol and its surrounding areas, including some of Somerset and Gloucestershire. Logistic regression models for the sleep problem dummies and log-linear models for the sleep quantity. Results: One additional item in the material deprivation index is associated to an increase of around 10-20% in the odds of having at least 1 sleep problem. Similarly, children from the richest families are less likely to have any sleep problem up to 115 months (around 20% reduction in the odds). Mother's characteristics (i.e., education and mental health in the pregnancy period) are also significant predictors. Sleep quantity does not vary much and is not sensitive to socioeconomic factors. Conclusion: Exposure to income-related inequalities affects child sleep. Further research is needed to understand if sleep in early life influences future health and economic trajectories.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The few existing early-life obesity prevention initiatives have concentrated on nutrition and physical activity, with little examination of sleep. METHODS: This community-based, randomized controlled trial allocated 802 pregnant women (≥16 years, <34 weeks' gestation) to: control, FAB (food, activity, and breastfeeding), sleep, or combination (both interventions) groups. All groups received standard well-child care. FAB participants received additional support (8 contacts) promoting breastfeeding, healthy eating, and physical activity (antenatal-18 months). Sleep participants received 2 sessions (antenatal, 3 weeks) targeting prevention of sleep problems, as well as a sleep treatment program if requested (6-24 months). Combination participants received both interventions (9 contacts). BMI was measured at 24 months by researchers blinded to group allocation, and secondary outcomes (diet, physical activity, sleep) were assessed by using a questionnaire or accelerometry at multiple time points. RESULTS: At 2 years, 686 women remained in the study (86%). No significant intervention effect was observed for BMI at 24 months (P = .086), but there was an overall group effect for the prevalence of obesity (P = .027). Exploratory analyses found a protective effect for obesity among those receiving the "sleep intervention" (sleep and combination compared with FAB and control: odds ratio, 0.54 [95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.82]). No effect was observed for the "FAB intervention" (FAB and combination compared with sleep and control: odds ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.81]). CONCLUSIONS: A well-developed food and activity intervention did not seem to affect children's weight status. However, further research on more intensive or longer running sleep interventions is warranted.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: In adults, circadian disruptions alter metabolism. Constant light exposure in utero and during the neonatal period, individually or in combination, disrupts circadian rhythms in rodents and humans. In utero, peripheral circadian clocks oscillate with maternal rhythms, such that when the mother is subjected to constant light, both maternal and offspring rhythms are disrupted. The superchiasmatic nucleus and its resulting circadian rhythm develop in the postnatal environment. Constant light during this developmental period, as frequently used in NICUs , can delay the development of normal daynight cycles. We hypothesized that exposure to constant light during these critical developmental periods has a lasting effect on metabolism. METHODS: To test this, we exposed C57BL/6 mice to constant light (CL) during mating, gestation, and the first four weeks of postnatal life of the offspring. After those four weeks, offspring were maintained on a 12h light:12h dark cycle (LD). Control mice were maintained on LD throughout the study. One cohort of mice was sacrificed for tissue collection at 19 weeks, and the second at 31 weeks, with half the mice from each cohort being challenged with a high fat, high sucrose diet (HFHS) for 8 weeks prior to sacrifice. At 4, 12, 20, and 28 weeks, the chow-fed mice were placed in metabolic cages that recorded activity, food and water consumption, and metabolism for three days. Additionally, mice fed HFHS were placed in the metabolic cages at 30 weeks. RESULTS: On chow diet, mice exposed to CL during early development were much less active than mice raised in LD at all time points. However, when they were fed HFHS, the activity level of LD mice fell to that of CL, which was not affected by HFHS. The energy expenditure of CL mice was consistently below that of LD, except at 12 weeks. Adult CL males weighed more than LD males and that difference continued when both groups were placed on HFHS. CL males had significantly higher body fat percentage at 4, 12, and 20 weeks. On a chow diet, CL females weighed less than LD females, but on HFHS CL females weighed more than LD controls. At 19 weeks, CL females on chow diet had significantly higher leptin concentrations, and both had significantly higher insulin levels. At 31 weeks, CL males and females on a chow diet had significantly higher leptin levels than LD. CONCLUSIONS: Constant light exposure during development causes metabolic dysfunction later in life.

N2  - Bariatric surgery is an effective tool for weight reduction, however it has recognised long-term complications. It is recommended that pregnancy should be avoided for at least 12-18 months following surgery to avoid ongoing catabolism and intrauterine growth retardation. We report a case of a 26 year old caucasian female with history of morbid obesity and gestational diabetes who became pregnant four months after Roux-en-Y bypass surgery. She was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and initially managed with metformin and insulin. First hypoglycaemic episodes occured at 15 weeks of pregnancy. Hypoglycaemic episodes were symptomatic and occured mostly at night causing sleep disturbance and daytime somnolence. Treatment with rapid-acting carbohydrates precipitated further hypoglycaemia. Laboratory investigations confirmed hypoglycaemia at 2.2mmol/l with appropriately low insulin and cpeptide, intact HPA axis and negative IgG insulin antibodies. Regular bariatric dietitian reviews followed but a degree of dietary non-compliance persisted. A FreeStyle Libre system was used from 21 weeks enabling the patient a real-time feedback of changes in interstitial glucose post high or low GI index food intake. The patient refused a trial of acarbose and we eventually opted for iv infusion of 5% dextrose at 100mls/h overnight resulting in improvement but not complete abolishment of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Growth scan at 25 weeks showed viable foetus with head and abdominal circumference at 50th centile. This case illustrates challenges in the management of pregnant women with dumping syndrome. To our knowledge this is the first use of FreeStyle Libre in dumping syndrome in pregnancy post bariatric surgery with troublesome nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

N2  - The occurrence of Epidural/Paravertebral abscess following central neuraxial blockade is rare, with a reported incidence of 1:42,000 in the general population according to NAP 3. (1) Risk is substantially lower when epidurals are placed for short duration as in obstetrics with one UK study of 506,000 women across 203 obstetric units, reporting only 1 spinal/epidural abscess (SEA) (2). To date there is no report in the literature, of ante-natally diagnosed paravertebral abscess without prior instrumentation of the spine. We present the case of a spontaneously occurring paravertebral abscess at the level of T 8 vertebral body, with extension into the spinal canal, in a multiparous woman at 28 weeks gestation, and highlight diagnostic and management challenges specific to pregnancy, with this rare cause of back pain. We describe important management principles in order to avoid the potentially catastrophic sequelae of this condition if left undetected. Diagnostic and imaging modalities of choice along with rationale for medical versus surgical decompressive approaches to management in certain situations are presented. Diagnostic challenges arising from altered maternal physiology, and the importance for the perioperative physician to consider this rare condition in the differential for back pain in pregnancy, even with no prior instrumentation of the spine, are highlighted. This case re-iterates the importance of an effective multi-disciplinary approach in ensuring a successful outcome for mother and baby.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Maternal shift work during pregnancy is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans, but effects on the children and their long-term health have not yet been reported. In our studies in rats, simulated shift work exposure throughout gestation severely disrupted normal circadian profiles in the mother and fetus, and also programmed poor glucose homeostasis and increased adiposity of offspring as adults (Varcoe et al. PLoS ONE, 6, e18504, 2011; Varcoe et al. PLoS ONE, 8, e53800, 2013). We are now using a large animal model, with gestation length and maturity at birth more similar to human, to test the hypothesis that maternal and progeny outcomes worsen with increasing duration of shift work in pregnancy. METHODS: Merino ewes entered pen housing in a light-proof facility 3 d after timed mating to Merino rams near equinox. Ewes were randomised to be housed in 12L:12D photoperiod throughout pregnancy (Control), or were subjected to twice-weekly phase shifts of lighting and feeding time (simulated shift work, SW), throughout the first third (mating-week 7), first and second third (mating-week 14), or all of pregnancy. In early and late pregnancy (weeks 7 and 18), we measured maternal central (activity, circulating melatonin, cortisol and glucose) and peripheral rhythms (skeletal muscle expression of Clock genes) every 4 h for 72 h, and maternal glucose tolerance by intravenous glucose tolerance test (0.25 g glucose/kg, IVGTT). Lambs were weighed at birth (n=9-11/group). RESULTS: Exposure to simulated shift work profoundly disrupted maternal central and peripheral rhythms in early and late pregnancy. Melatonin rhythms rapidly phased-shifted in response to the 12 h changes in light onset, but Clock gene expression rhythms remained abnormal 24-48 after phase shifts. At both stages of pregnancy, ewes currently housed in SW conditions took longer for blood glucose to return to fasting concentrations during IVGTT (P<0.05), but had similar glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, compared to ewes housed in control lighting. Despite these changes during pregnancy, gestation lengths and lamb birth weights were similar in SW and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Simulated shift work profoundly disturbs circadian rhythms and mildly impairs metabolic control during pregnancy in sheep. Long-term effects on progeny are currently under investigation.

N2  - Introduction Epileptic women have a ten fold risk of death in pregnancy compared to non-epileptic women. The MBRRACE-UK report highlighted substandard care in these patients. Methods We compared our practice to recently published recommendations. We used computerized data, searching for those coded “epilepsy” attending antenatal appointments in Craigavon Hospital between January 2015 and March 2016, excluding those currently pregnant. Thirty-four charts and electronic records were reviewed. Results Standards-100% 1 Women with “low-risk” epilepsy can receive low-risk antenatal care. 2 24% had “low-risk” epilepsy. 100% treated accordingly. In 24 high-risk patients: 1 Documented prepregnancy counselling. Achieved: 33% 2 Received peri-conceptual high dose folate. Achieved: 67% 3 Documentation regarding risks/benefits of medications. Achieved: 84% 4 Discussed safety precautions (Bathing/sleep deprivation, etc.). Achieved: 21% 5 Invitation to join 'epilepsy and pregnancy register'. Achieved: 4% 6 Documented neurology referral antenatally. Achieved: 62%, one third went to regional epilepsy care team. 7 Fetal anomaly scan undertaken. Achieved: 100% 8 If prescribed medications with serum drug level fluctuations in pregnancy, documented discussion regarding drug monitoring. Achieved: 40% 9 Postnatally, documented precautionary nursing in a bay. Achieved: 4% 10 Documented epilepsy related plan of management postnatally. Achieved: 12% 11 Documentation regarding contraception. Achieved: 8%, 12 Five patients stopped medication without consultation, one was admitted postnatally with overdose of epileptic medications. One patient taking sodium valproate had no documented discussion regarding risks in pregnancy. Conclusion This audit highlighted deficiencies in care. Recent RCOG guidance should facilitate professional learning and provide a multidisciplinary framework for management of these patients.

N2  - Introduction: By the time children start school, inequities in learning, development and health outcomes are already evident. Sustained nurse home visiting (SNHV) offers a potential platform for families experiencing adversity, who often have limited access to services. While SNHV programmes have been growing in popularity in Australia and internationally, it is not known whether they can improve children's learning and development when offered via the Australian service system. The right@home trial aims to investigate the effectiveness of an SNHV programme, offered to women from pregnancy to child age 2 years, in improving parent care of and responsivity to the child, and the home learning environment. Methods and analysis: Pregnant Australian women (n=722) are identified after completing a screening survey of 10 factors known to predict children's learning and development (eg, young pregnancy, poor mental or physical health, lack of support). Consenting women - surveyed while attending clinics at 10 hospitals in Victoria and Tasmania - are enrolled if they report having 2 or more risk factors. The intervention comprises 25 home visits from pregnancy to 2 years, focusing on parent care of the child, responsivity to the child and providing a good quality home learning environment. The standard, universal, Australian child and family health service provides the comparator (control). Primary outcome measures include a combination of parent-reported and objective assessments of children's sleep, safety, nutrition, parenting styles and the home learning environment, including the Home Observation of the Environment Inventory and items adapted from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Ethics and dissemination: This study is approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committees (HREC 32296) and site-specific HRECs. The investigators and sponsor will communicate the trial results to stakeholders, participants, healthcare professionals, the public and other relevant groups via presentations and publications.

N2  - Background: Preterm delivery may affect the development of the upper airways resulting in a higher risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We investigated whether children born at early term (37-38 6/7 weeks’ gestation) are at an increased risk for childhood OSA as compared with those born later. Methods: In this population-based cohort analysis all singleton deliveries occurring between 1991–2013 at a single regional tertiary medical centre were included. Gestational age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early preterm (<33 6/7 weeks’ gestation), late preterm (34-36 6/7), early term, full term (39-40 6/7), late term (41-41 6/7), and post term (>42 0/7). Incidence of OSA related hospitalizations of the offspring, up to the age of 18 years, was evaluated. A survival curve and a Cox model were used to assess the association. Results: During the study period 240 953 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. OSA hospitalization (n = 1320) rates decreased as gestational age increased from 1.1% in the early preterm group, 0.8% in late preterm, 0.7% at early term, 0.5% in full term, 0.4% in late term, to 0.3% in post term born children. In the Cox regression, early term delivery exhibited an increased risk for paediatric OSA (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.3 95% Confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 1.5) while late and post term deliveries were associated with significantly lower OSA risk when compared with full term (HR 0.8 95% CI 0.6, 0.9 and HR 0.6 95% CI 0.4, 0.8, respectively). Conclusions: Early term deliveries are associated with higher rates of paediatric OSA, which decrease gradually as gestational age advances.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Pregnancy related disorders, including preterm birth (PTB) are caused by complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors such as lifestyle and living environments. We have designed a prospective cohort study named “Maternity Log Study” to investigate unrevealed mechanisms of those disorders. METHODS: Three hundred participants have been recruited by written informed consent at Tohoku University Hospital. We collected daily lifelogs of physiological data (body weight, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, daily step count, body temperature, sleep duration) and symptoms (morning sickness, abdominal pain, uterine contraction, bowel movement) as well as blood samples at several time points throughout pregnancy. We investigated potential lifelog predictors of PTB. RESULTS: Heart rate in the morning after 24 weeks of gestational age was significantly different between the control and women with PTB (77.5±9.3 vs 88.4±11.2 bpm at 25 weeks, p<0.001). Caloric expenditure of the PTB group was lower than the control after 20 weeks (1676±271 against 1919±232 Kcal at 21 weeks, p<0.01). A PTB prediction model was generated from BMI change per week, caloric expenditure, bedtime, heart rate, age, diastolic BP in the evening, and the change in caloric expenditure. Cross-validation demonstrated the accuracy of 0.81 and 0.90 at 24 and 32 weeks of gestational age, respectively. The areas under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve were 0.908 and 0.913, respectively. (Figure Presented) CONCLUSIONS: Combination of several daily maternal lifelogs might serve as a predictive marker for PTB. These findings may contribute to the development of wearable monitoring devices specific for pregnant women to predict onset of PTB.

N2  - Background: Black women in the United States have 50% higher rates of hypertension (HTN) than white women. This disparity persists after accounting for many known HTN risk factors. Evidence indicates that pregnancy complications may reveal increased risks for later HTN, and some complications, such as preterm delivery, are more common in black vs. white women. Hypotheses: 1) Adjustment for multiple HTN risk factors measured at mid-life will explain some, but not all, of the black-white disparity in mid-life HTN among women. 2) Markers of pregnancy health will help explain the remaining black-white disparity in mid-life HTN. Methods: Data came from a Michigan-based cohort study of women enrolled during pregnancy and followed-up at mid-life (n=678, mean age = 37, range 25-58). We included women without pre-pregnancy hypertension (n=652) categorized as African American (AA) (n=242) and white (n=373). We categorized women as hypertensive (systolic BP ≥140, diastolic BP ≥90, or self-reported use of antihypertensive medications, n=126), pre-hypertensive (systolic BP 120-139 or diastolic BP 80-89, n=149), and normotensive (n=340). Mid-life risk factors for HTN were grouped into 4 domains: socioeconomic status ([SES], based on education, occupation, marital status, insurance, and wealth), psychosocial (depression, hostility, job strain), behavioral (current smoking, diet quality score, sedentary hours/day, global sleep score), and physiological (body mass index [BMI], lipids, c-reactive protein [CRP]). We used generalized logit models to assess the degree to which each individual factor attenuated the AA (vs. white) odds ratio (OR) for HTN at mid-life and then sequentially added variables to a multivariable model. We then added indicators of pregnancy health (preterm delivery, pre-pregnancy BMI, and CRP, depressive symptoms, hypertensive disorders, and lipids during pregnancy). Results: AA women had 3.28(95% CI:1.96,5.51) times the odds of HTN compared to white women after adjusting for age. Adjustment for SES attenuated the OR to 2.52(95% CI:1.46,4.36). Further adjustment for psychosocial factors and behaviors attenuated the OR to 2.30(95% CI:1.29,4.11), and BMI and CRP attenuated it to 2.13(95%CI:1.15,3.93). Adjustment for preterm delivery, pre-pregnancy BMI, and CRP and depressive symptoms during pregnancy reduced the OR to 1.88(95%CI:0.97,3.64), with BMI, CRP, and depressive symptoms playing a larger role than preterm delivery. Adjustment for hypertensive disorders and lipids during pregnancy did not further reduce the race disparity. Conclusions: SES, psychosocial factors, behaviors, and biomarkers measured at mid-life explained some, but not all, of the race disparity in mid-life HTN. Indicators of pregnancy health, particularly pre-pregnancy BMI, inflammation (CRP), and depressive symptoms contributed substantially to the race disparity in HTN at mid-life.

N2  - The cardiovascular parameters of canine bitches were assessed during the estrous cycle. A total of eleven mongrel female dogs were enrolled in a longitudinal prospective investigation. Six animals were bred during the study and were assigned into group I, in which evaluations were performed during proestrus, estrus, gestational diestrus and anestrus. The five remaining bitches were not bred and underwent evaluations during proestrus, estrus, nongestational diestrus and anestrus. The holter data showed a gradual increase in the minimum and mean heart rate along pregnancy, as well as a reduction during anestrus, which differed significantly among the distinct periods. The values for maximal heart rate documented during pregnancy were significantly lower than those recorded during anestrus, and a variation in the heart rate circadian rhythm was also found, as demonstrated by decreases at night and rises during the day. Cardiac rhythm had a similar performance in both pregnancy and anestrus. Likewise, the blood pressure, electrocardiography, and echocardiography data did not vary during the estrous cycle. The results support the role played by the autonomic nervous system during these two distinct periods in order to attain a heart rate that provides the blood needed by the female's body during the various stages of the reproductive cycle. Further studies are needed to better clarify the cardiovascular compensatory neuroendocrine events that accompany gestation in this species.

N2  - Introduction The use of long term oxygen therapy has many benefits and is used to facilitate early and safe discharge in infants who remain oxygen dependent. Methods A retrospective study was performed looking at infants discharged from NHS Lanarkshire Neonatal Unit on oxygen in 2014/15. Data was collected from the community nursing team records. Results The majority of infants were discharged between 40- 45 weeks corrected gestation. Age at discharge did not differ greatly between 24 and 26 weeks of gestation. Birthweight may be a more accurate indicator of the concentration of oxygen required than gestational age. Infants born under 1 kg were more likely to go home on 0.3 L/min, above 1.5 kg they were more likely to go home on 0.1 L/min. If born less than 26 weeks the infant was more likely to stay on home oxygen for longer than 4 months. Based on the gestational age, infants <26 weeks had minimum of 8 sleep studies; maximum of 12. Infants born at 27-28 weeks had 6-8 sleep studies and infants born 29 weeks onwards had 6 or less sleep studies. Conclusion This study shows that babies born at lower gestation are more likely to require longer on oxygen and birthweight was a better predictor of the oxygen concentration at discharge. Babies born at lower gestation are likely to need more sleep studies after discharge. Further collection of data and analysis will help clinicians to counsel parents, prepare them better, plan discharge and provide community support effectively.

N2  - Nitric oxide (NO) may have a role in persistent breeding-induced endometritis in mares through an inhibitory effect on uterine contractility. The objectives of this study were to test the effect of NO on spontaneous uterine contractility in-vitro and to evaluate whether this effect varied between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers of the uterus. Reproductive tracts were collected from eight euthanized non-pregnant mares (age 4-19 years; body weight 405-530 kg). Transrectal examination of the reproductive tract was performed before euthanasia to evaluate stage of the estrous cycle and presence of any apparent abnormality. After euthanasia, one uterine tissue sample was collected for histological evaluation and four full-thickness uterine tissue strips (10-12 mm × 2 mm), two parallel to each muscle layer, were excised for in-vitro contractility evaluation. Strips were suspended in tissue chambers containing Krebs-Henseleit solution, with continuous aeration (95% O2-5% CO2; pH 7.4) at 37 °C. After equilibration, spontaneous contractility was recorded (pre-treatment) and strips excised in each direction were randomly allocated to each of two groups: 1) SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, an NO donor); or 2) NAP (N-acetyl-d-penicillamine, vehicle and time-matched control). These were treated at 15 min intervals with increasing concentrations (10-7 M to 10-3 M) of SNAP and NAP, respectively. Contractility data was recorded throughout the experiment. An interaction effect of group-by-concentration was observed (P < 0.0001). The mean contractility after treatment with 10-4 M and 10-3 M SNAP were significantly lower than the pre-treatment contractility and the mean contractility after treatment with lower SNAP concentrations. In contrast, contractility did not change significantly in the NAP treated controls. The effect of treatment on uterine contractility was not influenced by age or weight of the mare, stage of estrous cycle, uterine histology grade, or muscle layer. Secondary findings included significant main effects of stage of estrous cycle (increased contractility in estrus compared to diestrus), uterine histology grade (decreased contractility in grade IIB compared to grade I) and age (decreased contractility in mares aged > 8 years compared to mares aged ≤ 8 years). In conclusion, results of this study indicate that NO has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on spontaneous uterine contractility irrespective of the muscle layer in the mare.

N2  - Preconception health refers to the health of males and females at any point in time prior to a potential pregnancy. A goal of preconception health research is to use preventive behaviour and healthcare to optimize the health of future offspring that result from both planned and unplanned pregnancies. This paper briefly reviews evidence of the importance of various preconception health behaviours, and examines the extent to which specific preconception health behaviours have been included in recent studies of such knowledge, behaviours, and intentions. To describe this recent research in highly developed countries, a scoping review of the literature was completed of studies published within the past seven years. A total of 94 studies on preconception health were identified and reviewed: (a) 15 examined knowledge and attitudes, (b) 68 studied behaviours, (c) 18 examined interventions designed to improve knowledge or behaviour, and (d) no studies examined intentions to engage in preconception health behaviours. Over 40% of studies examining preconception health behaviour focussed exclusively on folic acid. Overall, folic acid, alcohol, and cigarettes have consistently been topics of focus, while exposure to harmful environmental substances, stress, and sleep have been largely neglected. Despite strong evidence for the importance of men's health during the preconception period, only 11% of all studies included male participants. Based on existing gaps in the research, recommendations are provided, such as including men in future research, assessing a wider variety of behaviours, consideration of behavioural intentions, and consideration of the relationships between preconception health knowledge, intentions, and behaviour.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neuraxial morphine is the most commonly used analgesic technique after cesarean delivery. The incidence of respiratory depression is reported to be very low (0%-1.2%) in this patient population as measured by pulse oximetry and respiratory rates. However, hypercapnia may be a more sensitive measure of respiratory depression. In the current study, the incidence of hypercapnia events (transcutaneous CO2 [TcCO2] >50 mm Hg) for ≥2-minute duration was evaluated using the Topological Oscillation Search with Kinematical Analysis monitor in women who received intrathecal morphine for postcesarean delivery analgesia. METHODS: Healthy women (>37 weeks of gestation) scheduled for a cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia with intrathecal morphine were recruited. Baseline STOP-BANG sleep apnea questionnaire and TcCO2 readings were obtained. Spinal anesthesia was initiated with 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine, 15 μg fentanyl, and 150 μg morphine. The Topological Oscillation Search with Kinematical Analysis monitor was reapplied in the postanesthesia care unit and TcCO2 measurements obtained for up to 24 hours. Supplemental opioid administration and adverse respiratory events were recorded. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypercapnia events, defined as a TcCO2 reading >50 mm Hg for ≥2 minutes in the first 24 hours after delivery. RESULTS: Of the 120 women who were recruited, 108 completed the study. Thirty-five women (32%; 99.15% confidence interval, 21%-45%) reached the primary outcome of a sustained hypercapnia event. The median time (interquartile range [IQR]) from intrathecal morphine administration to the hypercapnia event was 300 (124-691) minutes. The median (IQR) number of events was 3 (1-6) and longest duration of an event was 25.6 (8.4-98.7) minutes. Baseline median (IQR) TcCO2 measurements were 35 (30-0) mm Hg and postoperatively, median (IQR) TcCO2 measurements were 40 (36-43) mm Hg, a difference of 5 mm Hg (99.15% confidence interval of the difference 2-8 mm Hg, P <.001). The incidence of hypercapnia events was 5.4% in women with a baseline TcCO2 value ≤31 mm Hg, 22.5% with a baseline TcCO2 between 32 and 38 mm Hg, and 77.4% with a baseline TcCO2 >38 mm Hg (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Hypercapnia events (>50 mm Hg for ≥2-minute duration) occurred frequently in women receiving 150 μg intrathecal morphine for postcesarean analgesia. Higher baseline TcCO2 readings were observed in women who had hypercapnia events.

N2  - Objective To assess the association between maternal birth country and adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations in a national sample of Hispanic mothers, given that data assessing the heterogeneity of infant care practices among Hispanics are lacking. Study design We used a stratified, 2-stage, clustered design to obtain a nationally representative sample of mothers from 32 US intrapartum hospitals. A total of 907 completed follow-up surveys (administered 2-6 months postpartum) were received from mothers who self-identified as Hispanic/Latina, forming our sample, which we divided into 4 subpopulations by birth country (US, Mexico, Central/South America, and Caribbean). Prevalence estimates and aORs were determined for infant sleep position, location, breastfeeding, and maternal smoking. Results When compared with US-born mothers, we found that mothers born in the Caribbean (aOR 4.56) and Central/South America (aOR 2.68) were significantly more likely to room share without bed sharing. Caribbean-born mothers were significantly less likely to place infants to sleep supine (aOR 0.41). Mothers born in Mexico (aOR 1.67) and Central/South America (aOR 2.57) were significantly more likely to exclusively breastfeed; Caribbean-born mothers (aOR 0.13) were significantly less likely to do so. Foreign-born mothers were significantly less likely to smoke before and during pregnancy. Conclusions Among US Hispanics, adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations varies widely by maternal birth country. These data illustrate the importance of examining behavioral heterogeneity among ethnic groups and have potential relevance for developing targeted interventions for safe infant sleep.

N2  - Purpose: To gain further understanding of the general medical comorbidity of binge eating disorder (BED) beyond its association with obesity. Method: We reviewed studies of general medical comorbidity in people with BED or clinically significant binge eating behavior beyond obesity. We also reviewed studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Results: Three broad study categories of medical comorbidity in BED were found: cross-sectional studies of medical conditions in BED; prospective studies of medical conditions in BED; and studies of BED in specific medical conditions. Cross-sectional epidemiologic data suggest that BED is associated with medical conditions related to obesity, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, sleep problems/disorders, and pain conditions, and that BED may be related to these conditions independent of obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Prospective data suggest that BED may be associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. BED or binge eating behavior is also associated with asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and among women, menstrual dysfunction, pregnancy complications, intracranial hypertension, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Conclusions: BED is associated with substantial medical comorbidity beyond obesity. Further study of the general medical comorbidity of BED and its relationship to obesity and co-occurring psychiatric disorders is greatly needed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Following institution of the Back to Sleep Campaign, the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome decreased while the prevalence of positional skull deformation increased dramatically. The management of positional deformity is controversial, and treatment recommendations and outcomes reporting are variable. The authors reviewed their institutional experience (2008-2014) with the treatment of positional plagiocephaly to explore factors associated with measured improvement. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted with risk factors and treatment for positional head shape deformity recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the impact of these variables on the change in measured oblique diagonal difference (ODD) on head shape surface scanning pre- and posttreatment. RESULTS: A total of 991 infants aged less than 1 year were evaluated for cranial positional deformity in a dedicated clinical program. The most common deformity was occipital plagiocephaly (69.5%), followed by occipital brachycephaly (18.4%) or a combination of both deformities (12.1%). Recommended treatment included repositioning (RP), physical therapy (PT) if indicated, or orthotic treatment with a customized cranial orthosis (CO) according to an age- and risk factor-dependent algorithm that the authors developed for this clinic. Of the 991 eligible patients, 884 returned for at least 1 follow-up appointment. A total of 552 patients were followed to completion of their treatment and had a full set of records for analysis: these patients had pre- and posttreatment 2D surface scanner evaluations. The average presenting age was 6.2 months (corrected for prematurity for treatment considerations). Of the 991 patients, 543 (54.8%) had RP or PT as first recommended treatment. Of these 543 patients, 137 (25.2%) transitioned to helmet therapy after the condition did not improve over 4-8 weeks. In the remaining cases, RP/PT had already failed before the patients were seen in this program, and the starting treatment recommendation was CO. At the end of treatment, the measured improvements in ODD were 36.7%, 33.5%, and 15.1% for patients receiving CO, RP/PT/CO, and RP/PT, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that sex, race, insurance, diagnosis, sleep position preference, torticollis history, and multiple gestation were not significantly associated with magnitude of ODD change during treatment. On multivariate analysis, corrected age at presentation and type of treatment received were significantly associated with magnitude of ODD change. Orthotic treatment corresponded with the largest ODD change, while the RP/PT group had the least change in ODD. Earlier age at presentation corresponded with larger ODD change. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier age at presentation and type of treatment impact the degree of measured deformational head shape correction in positional plagiocephaly. This retrospective study suggests that treatment with a custom CO can result in more improvement in objective measurements of head shape.

N2  - Objectives Infant developmental outcomes may be influenced by a range of prenatal maternal characteristics. While there is some evidence to suggest that maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, there is a need to systematically review this evidence to guide future research and clinical practice. Methods Five electronic databases were systematically scanned. Key journals and reference lists were hand-searched. Papers were included if: (1) pregnant women were assessed for maternal-foetal attachment; (2) the infants were later assessed, under 2 years old, for any developmental outcome (e.g., social-emotional, cognition, motor, language, adaptive behaviour); and (3) they were published in English. Two independent reviewers used the STROBE checklist to appraise the quality of each paper. Results Of the 968 papers identified, eight were included in the review, and four of these were of low quality (<60 %) based on the STROBE. The developmental domains that were examined included: infant temperament (n = 5), adaptive behaviour (e.g., colic, sleep) (n = 2), and milestone attainment (n = 1). There is some evidence to suggest that lower maternal-foetal attachment is related to suboptimal developmental outcomes. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited and low quality studies available. Conclusions Although maternal-foetal attachment may be associated with infant developmental outcomes, future research is required which: (1) considers a range of developmental outcomes, (2) has increased scientific rigour, (3) assesses mother-infant dyads at different prenatal and postnatal time points, and (4) examines different target populations.

N2  - Introduction: Postpartum weight retention plays an important role in the development of obesity and its associated health risks in women. The objective of this study was to determine the postpartum weight retention rate and its relationship with postpartum depression. Materials and Methods: An analytical study performed on 309 women, 6 months after childbirth. Data was collected by self-constructed demographic/obstetric characteristics questionnaires and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale. Results: At six months after child birth 83.5% of the women did not achieve pre-pregnancy weight and the average retained weight was 4.04 kg. Forty five point five percent of women faced substantial postpartum weight retention (≥5 kg). Eighteen point one percent of women were at risk of postpartum depression. Based on logistic regression analysis, inadequate sleep (P<o.oo1) and lack of postpartum care (P<0.04) had important role in causing depression. There was no significant difference between the mean weight retention in depressed and non-depressed women. Conclusion: The results of this research highlight the importance of postpartum weight retention and its role in women’s health. Due to the high levels of postpartum weight retention, the need for specific educational programs about postpartum weight management by healthcare providers is crucial.

N2  - Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) which includes obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), has emerged as a risk factor for adverse maternal–foetal outcomes in pregnancy. Physiological changes of pregnancy predispose a woman ‘at risk’ towards developing SDB. The increasing incidence of OSA in pregnancy closely correlates with the population trends of obesity. Common screening tools validated in non-pregnant subjects including Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) are poor predictors of SDB in pregnancy. Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are linked with SDB. Preeclampsia and OSA share common pathological associations. It is unclear if one predisposes the other. Foetal morbidity includes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and Apgar score of less than seven at one minute. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a well-documented treatment of SDB in pregnancy and has been shown to reverse some of the adverse events. It becomes imperative to diagnose and manage this condition as OSA causes substantial morbidity in the untreated pregnant patient and foetus. Three short clinical cases and a literature review on SDB on pregnancy are presented.

N2  - Key points: Fetal behavioural state in healthy late gestation pregnancy is affected by maternal position. Fetal state 1F is more likely to occur in maternal supine or right lateral positions. Fetal state 4F is less likely to occur when the woman lies supine or semi-recumbent. Fetal state change is more likely when the woman is supine or semi-recumbent. Fetal heart rate variability is affected by maternal position with variability reduced in supine and semi-recumbent positions. Abstract: Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. In acute hypoxaemia, the human fetus adapts to a lower oxygen consuming state with changes in the cardiotocograph and reduced fetal activity. Recent studies of late gestation stillbirth described the importance of sleep position in the risk of intrauterine death. We designed this study to assess the effects of different maternal positions on FBS in healthy late gestation pregnancies under controlled conditions. Twenty-nine healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings under standardized conditions in four randomly allocated positions, left lateral, right lateral, supine and semi-recumbent. Two blinded observers, assigned fetal states in 5 min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Compared to state 2F, state 4F was less likely to occur when women were semi-recumbent [odds ratio (OR) = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.02, 0.55], and supine (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.07, 1.10). State 1F was more likely on the right (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.11, 5.04) or supine (OR = 4.99, 95% CI 2.41, 10.43) compared to the left. State change was more likely when the mother was semi-recumbent (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.19, 3.95) or supine (OR = 2.67, 95% CI 1.46, 4.85). There was a significant association of maternal position to mean fetal heart rate. The measures of heart rate variability (SDNN and RMSSD) were reduced in both semi-recumbent and supine positions. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are likely fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress.

N2  - Objectives Whether racial/ethnic differences in prevalence/reporting of sleep disorders exist in pregnant women/women of child-bearing age is unknown. Study objectives were to estimate prevalence of sleep disorders and to examine racial/ethnic differences in sleep disorders, reporting of sleep issues, and amount of sleep among women of child-bearing age (15-44 years) in the US. Methods Through a secondary analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2010 (3175 non-pregnant, 432 pregnant women in main analysis), prevalence of sleep disorders, reporting of sleep disorders to a physician/health professional, and amount of sleep were estimated overall, by pregnancy status, and by race/ethnicity stratified by pregnancy status. Racial/ethnic differences in reporting of trouble sleeping by pregnancy status were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders among women of childbearing age was 4.9 % [3.9 % pregnant; 5.1 % non-pregnant (p < 0.01)]. Significantly fewer pregnant and non-pregnant minority women reported adequate sleep (7-8 h) than non-Hispanic white (white) women (p < 0.05). Among non-pregnant women, odds of report of trouble sleeping were significantly higher for white compared to black (aOR 0.47 [95 % CI 0.36, 0.61]) or Mexican-American women (aOR 0.29 [95 % CI 0.21, 0.41]); non-pregnant minority women were also significantly less likely to report trouble sleeping than white women when controlling for amount of sleep. Among pregnant women, these same trends were found. Discussion Compared to white women, minority women, despite reporting less adequate sleep, are less likely to report trouble sleeping, providing evidence of an important health disparity.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, yet underdiagnosed and under-investigated. We evaluated sleep quality during pregnancy and assessed associated factors, especially depressive and anxiety symptoms. Material and methods: A total of 78 healthy pregnant women from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study were studied twice prospectively during pregnancy (in mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy). Sleep quality was evaluated by the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, depressive symptoms by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and anxiety symptoms by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: Poor general sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep, the number of nocturnal awakenings per night, and too-early morning awakenings increased in late pregnancy compared with mid-pregnancy (all p-values < 0.020). The total insomnia score (p < 0.001) and sleep latency increased (p = 0.005), but sleep duration and preferred sleep duration did not change. Women tended to snore more often in late pregnancy, but apneas remained rare. Almost one-fourth of the women reported both morning and daytime sleepiness, but the frequencies did not increase during the follow up. In late pregnancy, depressive and anxiety symptoms were cross-sectionally related to sleep disturbances, but depressive or anxiety symptoms in mid-pregnancy were not associated with sleep disturbances in late pregnancy. Conclusions: We found deterioration in sleep quality across pregnancy. However, no increase in negative daytime consequences was found, presumably indicating a compensatory capacity against sleep impairment. Additionally, depressive and anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances were only cross-sectionally associated. Our study calls for further research on the factors that influence sleep disturbances during pregnancy.

N2  - Study Objectives: To examine the influence of maternal sleep quality and nocturnal sleep duration on risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in a multiethnic Asian population. Methods: A cohort of 686 women (376 Chinese, 186 Malay, and 124 Indian) with a singleton pregnancy attended a clinic visit at 26-28 weeks of gestation as part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes mother-offspring cohort study. Self-reported sleep quality and sleep duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). GDM was diagnosed based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test administered after an overnight fast (1999 WHO criteria). Multiple logistic regression was used to model separately the associations of poor sleep quality (PSQI score > 5) and short nocturnal sleep duration (<6 h) with GDM, adjusting for age, ethnicity, maternal education, body mass index, previous history of GDM, and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score). Results: In the cohort 296 women (43.1%) had poor sleep quality and 77 women (11.2%) were categorized as short sleepers; 131 women (19.1%) were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality and short nocturnal sleep duration were independently associated with increased risk of GDM (poor sleep, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 to 2.76; short sleep, adjusted OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.66). Conclusions: During pregnancy, Asian women with poor sleep quality or short nocturnal sleep duration exhibited abnormal glucose regulation. Treating sleep problems and improving sleep behavior in pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk and burden of GDM.

N2  - Most women experience the worse sleep quality of their life during pregnancy and the early postpartum period. Although pregnancy typically accounts for a relatively short part of a woman's life, the related sleep disturbances may have a significant and negative impact on her long-term health. Approximately 78-80% of pregnant women experience sleep disturbances, including interruptions in deep sleep, decreased total sleep time, poor subjective sleep quality, frequent night waking, and reduced sleep efficacy. Sleep disturbances during pregnancy start during the first trimester and become prevalent during the third trimester. Related factors include physiological and psychosocial changes and an unhealthy lifestyle. As non-pharmacological interventions have the potential to improve sleep quality in 70% to 80% of patients with insomnia, this is the main approached that is currently used to treat pregnancy-related sleep disturbances. Examples of these non-pharmacological interventions include music therapy, aerobic exercise, massage, progressive muscle relaxation, multi-modal interventions, and the use of a maternity support belt. The efficacy and safety of other related non-pharmacological interventions such as auricular acupressure, cognitive therapy, tai chi, and aromatherapy remain uncertain, with more empirical research required. Additionally, non-pharmacological interventions do not effectively treat sleep disturbances in all pregnant women.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the independent and combined associations of maternal self-reported poor sleep quality and antepartum depression with suicidal ideation during the third trimester Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1298 pregnant women (between 24 and 28 gestational weeks) attending prenatal clinics in Lima, Peru. Antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used to assess sleep quality. Multivariate logistical regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) after adjusting for putative confounders. Results Approximately, 17% of women were classified as having poor sleep quality (defined using the recommended criteria of PSQI global score of >5 vs. ≤5). Further, the prevalence of antepartum depression and suicidal ideation were 10.3% and 8.5%, respectively in this cohort. After adjusting for confounders including depression, poor sleep quality was associated with a 2.81-fold increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR=2.81; 95% CI 1.78–4.45). When assessed as a continuous variable, each 1-unit increase in the global PSQI score resulted in a 28% increase in odds for suicidal ideation, even after adjusting for depression (OR=1.28; 95% CI 1.15–1.41). The odds of suicidal ideation was particularly high among depressed women with poor sleep quality (OR=13.56 95% CI 7.53–24.41) as compared with women without either risk factor. Limitations This cross-sectional study utilized self-reported data. Causality cannot be inferred, and results may not be fully generalizable. Conclusion Poor sleep quality, even after adjusting for depression, is associated with antepartum suicidal ideation. Our findings support the need to explore sleep-focused interventions for pregnant women.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To compare an indigenous sleep device (wahakura) for infants at high risk for sudden unexpected death with a bassinet, for measures of infant sleep position, head covering, breastfeeding, bed-sharing, and maternal sleep and fatigue. METHODS: A total of 200 mainly Māori pregnant women were recruited from deprived areas of New Zealand. They were randomized to receive a bassinet or wahakura and asked to sleep the infant in this device from birth. Questionnaires at 1, 3, and 6 months and an overnight infrared video in the home at 1 month were completed. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat and an "as-used" analysis of questionnaires showed no group differences at 1, 3, and 6 months in infant-adult direct bed-sharing (7% vs 12%, P = .24 at 1 month), and at the 6-month interview, the wahakura group reported twice the level of full breastfeeding (22.5% vs 10.7%, P = .04). Maternal sleep and fatigue were not significantly different between groups. Video identified no increase in head covering, prone/side sleep position, or bed-sharing in the wahakura group, either from intention-to-treat analysis, or when analyzed for actual sleep location. CONCLUSION There were no significant differences in infant risk behaviors in wahakura compared with bassinets and there were other advantages, including an increase in sustained breastfeeding. This suggests wahakura are relatively safe and can be promoted as an alternative to infant-adult bed-sharing. Policies that encourage utilization are likely to be helpful in high-risk populations.

N2  - Methods: Child sleep duration (h/day) was parent-reported by questionnaire and indices of total (body weight, body mass index, percent body fat (%BF), sum of skinfolds) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference) were measured using standard anthropometric procedures at approximately 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age in 1,338 children (58% South Asian; 42% White). Mixed effects models were used to quantify independent associations (expressed as standardised β-coefficients (95% confidence interval (CI)) of sleep duration with adiposity indices using data from all four time-points. Factors considered for adjustment in models included basic demographics, pregnancy and birth characteristics, and lifestyle behaviours.
Results: With the exception of the sum of skinfolds, sleep duration was inversely and independently associated with indices of total and abdominal adiposity in South Asian children. For example, one standard deviation (SD) higher sleep duration was associated with reduced %BF by -0.029 (95% CI: -0.053, -0.0043) SDs. Higher adiposity was also independently associated with shorter sleep duration in South Asian children (for example, %BF: β = -0.10 (-0.16, -0.028) SDs). There were no significant associations in White children.
Conclusions: Associations between sleep duration and adiposity are bidirectional and independent among South Asian children from a disadvantaged location. The results highlight the importance of considering adiposity as both a determinant of decreased sleep and a potential consequence.
Study Objectives: To examine independent associations of sleep duration with total and abdominal adiposity, and the bidirectionality of these associations, in a young biethnic sample of children from a disadvantaged location.

N2  - Objectives: Purpose: Childcare has been associated with obesity in children in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, although some observed no association. Few studies have focused on care during infancy, a period when children may be especially vulnerable. Participants: The Nurture Study is an observational birth cohort designed to assess longitudinal associations of childcare and the presence of multiple caregivers on infant adiposity and weight trajectories throughout the first year of life. We examine as potential mediators feeding, physical activity, sleep and stress. We completed recruitment in 2015. Of the 860 women who enrolled during pregnancy, 799 delivered a single live infant who met our inclusion criteria. Of those, 666 mothers (77.4%) agreed to participate in the study for themselves and their infants. Findings to date: Among the 666 women in the study, 472 (71%) identified as black, 127 (19%) as white, 7 (1%) as Asian or Asian American, 6 (1%) as Native American and 49 (7%) as other race or more than one race; 43 (7%) identified as Hispanic/Latina. Just under half (48%) had a high school diploma or less, 61% had household incomes 20 000/year and 59% were married or living with a partner. The mean (SD) infant gestational age was 41.28 weeks (2.29) and birth weight for gestational age z-score was ?0.31 (0.93). Just under half (49%) of infants were females, 69% received some human milk and 40% were exclusively breast fed at hospital discharge. Data collection began in 2013, is currently underway, and is scheduled to conclude in late 2016. Future plans: Results will help assess the magnitude of associations between childcare in infancy and subsequent obesity. Findings will also inform intervention and policy efforts to improve childcare environments and help prevent obesity in settings where many infants spend time.

N2  - Introduction: One patient has been described to be responsive to pramipexole for treatment of burning mouth syndrome (BMS) (Stuginski-Barbosa, 2008). Two additional patients are reported. METHODS: Case 1: A 35-year-old pathological left handed female, three years prior to presentation, when pregnant, developed an unpleasant phantogeusia which resolved on delivery. The following year she began having burning and stinging sensation on the side and tip of the tongue, which has persisted without change. There is diurnal variation in the pain: absent in the morning, progressing to 8/10 in the evening. The pain is better with eating, chewing gum, and moving her tongue. It worsens with drinking coffee and eating dark chocolate. It was unresponsive to plethora of treatments including clonazepam, primidone, vitamins, herbs, and acupuncture. On pramipexole at dose of 1mg PO QHS, the BMS was markedly better, eliminated most of the time, and only worsening at maximum of 6/10 at the end of the day. CHEMOSENSORY TESTING: Olfactory Testing: Alcohol Sniff Test (AST): 18 (normosmia). Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT): 9 (normosmia). Quick Smell Identification Test: 2 (hyposmia). Retronasal Smell Index (RSI): 6 (normal). Gustatory Testing: Propylthiouracil Disc Taste Test: 10 (normogeusia). Taste threshold: Normogeusia to hydrochloric acid and phenylthiocarbamide. Mild hypogeusia (10-30%) to sucrose and urea. Taste quadrant testing with decreased sucrose anteriorly, decreased citric acid on the left tongue and palate, and decreased alcohol on the posterior tongue, bilaterally. CASE 2: A 47-year-old right handed woman having previously consulted with 15 MDs, several dentists, and an oral surgeon, presented with a four year history of persistent BMS of unknown origin,. Onset of burning was sudden, localized to her tongue, and when severe would spread to the gums, top of the mouth, palate, and even outside her lips. The pain level was 5-8/10 in severity, worst in the evening. It was constant, everyday, and worse with stress, certain food, and strong odors. The BMS was resistant to myriad medications including clonazepam, ä-aminolevulinic acid, diazepam, alprazolam, buspirone, primidone, amantadine, fluconazole, and clonidine. Sleep and tongue movement reduced the pain. After starting pramipexole at dose of 0.25 mg PO QHS, the pain dropped down to an average of 3/10. CHEMOSENSORY TESTING: Olfactory Testing: AST: 27 (normosmia). BSIT: 11 (normosmia). RSI: 10 (normal). Gustatory Testing: Propylthiouracil Disc Taste Test: 9 (normogeusia). Taste Quadrant Testing: Left palate decreased to sodium chloride. Decreased anterior tongue to all modalities. Quinine hydrochloride impaired throughout. Other: Fungiform Papillae Count: Left 34, Right 32 (normal). DISCUSSION: These cases confirm and extend Stuginski-Barbosa's case study of BMS responsive to pramipexole and suggest a trial of pramipexole for BMS may be worthwhile.

N2  - The symptoms of asthma, breathlessness, insomnia, etc. all have relevance to pulmonary rhythmic disturbances. Epidemiology and toxicology studies have demonstrated that exposure to ambient air particles can result in pulmonary dysfunction. However, there are no data directly supporting a link between air pollution and circadian rhythm disorder. In the present study, we found that breathing highly polluted air resulted in changes of the molecular clock genes expression in lung by transcriptome profiling analyses in a rodent model. Compared to those exposed to filtered air, in both pregnant and offspring rats in the unfiltered group, key clock genes (Per1, Per2, Per3, Rev-erbα and Dbp) expression level decreased and Bmal1 expression level increased. In both rat dams and their offspring, after continuous exposure to unfiltered air, we observed significant histologic evidence for both perivascular and peribronchial inflammation, increased tissue and systemic oxidative stress in the lungs. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to particulate matter can induce alterations of clock genes expression, which could be another important pathway for explaining the feedbacks of ambient particle exposure in addition to oxidative stress and inflammation.

N2  - Aims: To examine the association between sleep disturbances during pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods: From 2010 to 2012, 12 506 women in Tianjin, China, were screened using a 50-g 1-h glucose challenge test at 24–28 weeks’ gestation. Those with glucose challenge test values of ≥ 7.8 mmol/l were invited to further undergo a 75-g 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational diabetes was determined according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group's definition. Self-reported sleep duration and sleep quality during pregnancy was documented using a modified questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% CIs. Results: A total of 919 women (7.3%) had gestational diabetes. Sleep duration was found to have an approximate J-shaped association with gestational diabetes risk after adjusting for covariates. Compared with a sleep duration of 7–9 h/day (43% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios for sleep duration of ≥ 9 h/day (55%) and < 7 h/day (2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.21 (95% CI 1.03–1.42) and 1.36 (95% CI 0.87–2.14), respectively. Compared with good sleep quality (37.9% of 12 506 women), the adjusted odds ratios of moderate (59.9%) and poor sleep quality (2.2%) for gestational diabetes were 1.19 (95% CI 1.01–1.41) and 1.61 (95% CI 1.04–2.50), respectively. Conclusion: In pregnant Chinese women, poor sleep quality, and shorter and longer duration of sleep during pregnancy were independently associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

N2  - The circadian clock involves co-operative transcription of circadian genes including Clock and regulates circadian rhythms in mammals such as therhythm of sleep and wakefulness. In reproductive physiologies in mammals, there are several time-dependent events such as progression of theoestrous cycle and embryonic development, and we therefore checked the reproductive characters of mice homozygous for Clock delta-19 mutation(CL) having a diminished circadian clock to elucidate the effect of the circadian clock on reproductive physiologies. Profiles of the oestrous cyclewere the same in female (f) wild-type mice (WT) and fCL: oestrous cycles of both fWT and fCL consisted of the same 3 stages, proestrous, oestrous,and metestrous/diestrous stages, and the average lengths of each stage and one oestrous cycle were the same in 10 fWT and 14 fCL. We thereforecompared outcomes from the 4 possible mating groups between WT and CL. Average numbers of newborn pups obtained from mating pairs of14 male (m) WT × fWT, 10 mCL × fWT, 14 mWT × fCL, and 15 mCL × fCL were 13.4 ± 0.8, 12.6 ± 0.4, 12.3 ± 0.7, and 8.6 ± 1.5, respectively,and gradually decreased depending on the number of mutated Clock alleles in mothers and embryos. Since increases in body weights of the mothersduring the gestation period were not different in the 4 mating groups and since there were no signs of spontaneous abortion from mid to late gestation,we reasoned that some embryos were lost before or at the time of implantation. Immediately before implantation (88 h after fertilization), neither thenumber of embryos collected from uteri nor the percentage of embryos that reached the pre-implantation stage (blastocyst stage) differed significantlyamong mating groups. In contrast, immediately after implantation (160 h after fertilization), the average numbers of implantation sites in mating pairsof 12 mWT × fWT, 11 mCL × fWT, 13 mWT × fCL, and 13 fCL × fCL were 13.0 ± 1.5, 13.1 ± 1.2, 11.7 ± 0.8, and 7.0 ± 1.3, respectively, and alsogradually decreased with increase in the number of mutated Clock alleles in mothers and embryos. This decrease was accompanied by a significantlowering of the positions of implantation sites in uteri, a possible cause of the decrease of the number of newborns and implantation sites, and averagepercentages of embryos implanted in a lower part of the uterus were 48.8, 59.3, 69.7, and 77.7% in mWT × fWT, mCL × fWT, mWT × fCL, andmCL × fCL, respectively. The difference between the mCL × fWT and mWT × fWT groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05), and thisdifference was thought to be due to the difference in embryonic genotype, specifically between WT and heterozygous embryos. However, thedistribution of implantation sites in the mWT × fCL group was significantly smaller than that in the mCL × fWT group (P < 0.05), presumably due tothe difference in maternal genotype, specifically between WT and homozygous mutant dams. This study showed involvement of the circadian clock,possibly the maternal and embryonic circadian clock, in implantation among events that occur from fertilization to parturition.

In contrast, immediately after implantation (160 h after fertilization), the average numbers of implantation sites in mating pairs of 12 mWT × fWT, 11 mCL × fWT, 13 mWT × fCL, and 13 fCL × fCL were 13.0 ± 1.5, 13.1 ± 1.2, 11.7 ± 0.8, and 7.0 ± 1.3, respectively, and also gradually decreased with increase in the number of mutated Clock alleles in mothers and embryos. This decrease was accompanied by a significant lowering of the positions of implantation sites in uteri, a possible cause of the decrease of the number of newborns and implantation sites, and average percentages of embryos implanted in a lower part of the uterus were 48.8, 59.3, 69.7, and 77.7% in mWT × fWT, mCL × fWT, mWT × fCL, and mCL × fCL, respectively. The difference between the mCL × fWT and mWT × fWT groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05), and this difference was thought to be due to the difference in embryonic genotype, specifically between WT and heterozygous embryos. However, the distribution of implantation sites in the mWT × fCL group was significantly smaller than that in the mCL × fWT group (P < 0.05), presumably due to the difference in maternal genotype, specifically between WT and homozygous mutant dams. This study showed involvement of the circadian clock, possibly the maternal and embryonic circadian clock, in implantation among events that occur from fertilization to parturition.

N2  - Background: The Auckland Stillbirth study demonstrated a two-fold increased risk of late stillbirth for women who did not go to sleep on their left side. Two further studies have confirmed an increased risk of late stillbirth with supine sleep position. As sleep position is modifiable, we surveyed self-reported late pregnancy sleep position, knowledge about sleep position, and views about changing going-to-sleep position. Methods: Participants in this 2014 survey were pregnant women (n = 377) in their third trimester from South Auckland, New Zealand, a multi-ethnic and predominantly low socio-economic population. An ethnicallyrepresentative sample was obtained using random sampling. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with non-left sided going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy. Results: Respondents were 28 to 42 weeks' gestation. Reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left side (30%), right side (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%) and other (6%). Two thirds (68%) reported they had received advice about sleep position. Non-left sleepers were asked if they would be able to change to their left side if it was better for their baby; 87% reported they would have little or no difficulty changing. Women who reported a non-left going-to-sleep position were more likely to be of Maori (aOR 2.64 95% CI 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR 2.91 95% CI 1.46-5.78) ethnicity; had a lower body mass index (BMI) (aOR 0.93 95% CI 0.89-0.96); and were less likely to sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR 3.29 95% CI 2.03-5.32). Conclusions: Maternal going-to-sleep position in the last week was side-lying in 91% of participants. The majority had received advice to sleep on their side or avoid supine sleep position. Sleeping on the left-hand side of the bed was associated with going-to-sleep on the left side. Most non-left sleepers reported their sleeping position could be modified to the left side suggesting a public health intervention about sleep position is likely to be feasible in other multi-ethnic communities.

N2  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in pregnancy is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality to both mother and foetus. In the South African setting the proportion of pregnant females suffering from OSA has not been well studied; nor has the association with pre-eclampsia. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of OSA in females before 35 weeks gestation using the STOP-BANG questionnaire and to determine the association with pre-eclampsia in a local South African setting. Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study including 234 patients was conveniently sampled from Kalafong Hospital’s antenatal ward, clinic and labour ward. Participants were of more than 20 weeks and less than 35 weeks gestation. All participants were interviewed with a modified STOP-BANG questionnaire. Patients were consecutively enrolled without prior knowledge of the presence of pre-eclampsia. At Kalafong hospital all pregnant patients are routinely screened and investigated for pre-eclampsia according to standard criteria. Results: The median gestational age in this sample was 28 weeks; 80.3% (CI 74.62–85.2%) of pregnant females had a low risk for OSA, 15.4% (CI 11.01–20.65%) had an intermediate risk and 3% (CI 6.47–14.58%) had a high risk for OSA. A modified STOP-BANG questionnaire had a sensitivity of 62.5% and a specificity of 82.1% for pre-eclampsia when a score of 3 and more was scored. Females at high risk of OSA had an OR of 8.4 (CI 2.88–24.6) for having pre-eclampsia. Conclusions: The authors report 15.4% of the study’s pregnant population to be at intermediate risk and 3% at high risk of OSA. The association between the hypertensive disorders and OSA must be considered and screening implementation considered.

N2  - Study Objectives: To estimate the association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances in pregnancy. Methods: A cohort of 1,563 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were recruited from prenatal clinics between March 2007 and December 2010. Demographic, pregnancy, and delivery data were extracted from medical records and sleep information was collected with questionnaires. To diagnose RLS, we used standardized criteria of RLS symptoms and frequency that were developed by the International Restless Legs Study Group. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate the association of RLS and its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances (poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, poor daytime function) and delivery outcomes. Results: Overall 36% of the pregnant women had RLS, and half had moderate to severe symptoms. Compared to women without RLS, those with RLS were more likely to have poor sleep quality (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-2.9), poor daytime function (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.4), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0). A dose-response relationship also was evident between RLS frequency and each of the sleep-wake disturbances. There was no evidence for any association between RLS and delivery outcomes. Conclusions: RLS is a significant contributor to poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and poor daytime function, all common and often debilitating conditions in pregnancy. Obstetric health care providers should be aware of these associations and screen women for RLS. Commentary: A commentary on this article appears in this issue on page 857.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnant and postpartum women experience significant sleep disruption, but the role that perinatal sleep disturbance plays in breastfeeding is not well understood. This analysis examined whether differences in sleep quality during pregnancy predicted initiation and continuation of breastfeeding and the use of formula. We hypothesized that women with higher sleep efficiencies during pregnancy would be more likely to initiate and continue breastfeeding. Methods: We studied 48 women (mean age 28.2 ± 4.9 years) with a past history of major depression (n=43) or bipolar disorder (n=5) at 33 weeks gestation and postpartum weeks 2, 6, and 16. Sleep onset, sleep offset, and total sleep time (TST) were estimated with wrist actigraphy averaged over each week. Time in bed was defined as the duration between sleep onset and sleep offset, and sleep efficiency was calculated as TST ÷ Time in Bed x 100. We divided the sample into two groups: “lower sleep efficiency” (LSE) and “higher sleep efficiency” (HSE) based on a median split (cutoff was sleep efficiency = 84.9%). Breastfeeding status was obtained through daily diaries and structured interviews performed at the postpartum time points, and we classified new mothers as No-BF, Mixed-BF (breastfeeding with formula supplementation), and Exclusive-BF. Results: The percentages of women who did any breastfeeding were: Week 2=72.3%, Week 6=62.5%, Week 16= 50%. The LSE group was less likely than the HSE group to initiate breastfeeding (percent No-BF in LSE=45.8% vs. percent No-BF in HSE=16.7% Chi Square (df=1) = 4.752, p=.029). 62.5% of the Exclusive-BF group and 52% of the Mixed-BF groups were in the HSE group, compared to only 14% of the No-BF group (Chi Square (df=2) = 4.611, p=.10). Conclusion: In our sample of women a history of depression or bipolar disorder, preserved sleep efficiency during pregnancy was associated with initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is an important aspect of maternal and infant physical and mental health. Future work should examine how sleep impacts this complex behavior and whether interventions to improve sleep during pregnancy can increase breastfeeding.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy is a period of relational challenge with the transition to parenthood and reworking of current relationships. Sleep disturbance has been identified as a contributory factor to partner- relationship strain and poor postpartum mother-infant attachment. However, few studies have examined these associations during pregnancy. We examined whether poorer sleep quality operationalised as sleep efficiency, was associated with reduced prenatal infant-attachment quality, and lower partner-relationship satisfaction. We also explored sleep-related mood disturbance and adult-attachment styles as potential underlying mechanisms to any significant associations we observed. Methods: A community sample of 141 partnered first-time mothers (Mage 33.32, SDage 3.27) completed the following questionnaires online between 25-27 weeks' gestation: Consensus Sleep Diary - modified (sleep efficiency), Prenatal Attachment Inventory (mother-infant attachment quality), Dyadic Adjustment Scale (partner-relationship satisfaction), PROMIS Depression and Anxiety Short Forms (negative- mood), and Attachment Styles Questionnaire (adult-attachment). Hierarchical multiple regression, mediation, and moderation analyses were undertaken, controlling for maternal age, mental health history, and planned pregnancies as covariates. Results: Higher sleep quality was associated with significantly higher partner-relationship satisfaction, explaining 9% unique variance. The significant effect of sleep on partner-relationship was not mediated by mood, but was moderated by adult attachment security. Poorer sleep quality was associated with significantly reduced partner-relationship satisfaction for low-secure, but not high-secure adult-attachment style. The association between sleep efficiency and infant-attachment was not significant. Conclusion: Findings add to the existing perinatal sleep literature by considering women's sleep and wellbeing in a wider relational context. Results highlight the importance of sleep to partner-relationship quality, and secure adult-attachment style as an underlying mechanism to this association. Low-secure adult-attachment may confer vulnerability, while high-secure adult-attachment may confer resilience in relationship satisfaction in the face of prenatal sleep disturbance. The association between sleep and prenatal infant-attachment requires further research.

N2  - The significant variation in stillbirth rates between and within High Income Countries suggests that more could be done to reduce stillbirth rates. One approach is to identify modifiable risk factors. Two case-control studies from New Zealand and Australia have described an association between going to sleep position and the risk of late stillbirth. In the Midlands and North of England Stillbirth Study (MiNESS) we investigated maternal sleep practices and their association with late (> = 28 weeks' gestation) stillbirth. MiNESS was a multi-centre case control study conducted in 40 maternity units in England. In total 291 cases (women with a nonanomalous singleton late stillbirth) and 733 controls (women with ongoing pregnancies) participated. Extensive data were collected using a researcher-administered questionnaire which included questions on sleep practices before pregnancy, and in the four weeks prior to and on the night before the interview/stillbirth. In multivariable analysis supine going to sleep position the night before stillbirth was thought to have occurred had a greater than 2-fold increased risk of late stillbirth (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 2.31, 95%CI 1.04-5.11) compared to the left side. In addition, sleep duration less than 5.5 hours (aOR 1.83, 95%CI 1.24-2.68), getting up to the toilet once or less (aOR 2.81, 95%CI 1.85-4.26) and a daytime nap every day (aOR 2.22, 95%CI 1.26-3.94) were also associated with late stillbirth. No interaction was detected between the effect of supine going to sleep position and a small for gestational age infant, maternal body mass index or gestation. The population attributable risk for supine going to sleep position was 3.7% (95% CI 0.5-9.2). This UK study confirms findings from New Zealand and Australian studies that going to sleep position is associated with late stillbirth. We should now consider the best way to change practice via a public health campaign.

N2  - Introduction: A substantial percentage of pregnant women report disturbed sleep, including increased awakenings, long periods of wake after sleep onset, and poor sleep quality. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and insomnia are common and the co-occurrence of these disorders has been described in non-pregnant cohorts with a prevalence of 30%-50%. Independently, each is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease in the general adult population, yet when co-morbid, risk for morbidity substantially increases. To date, no study has examined the co-morbid status or impact in pregnant women. Methods: The prevalence of insomnia and symptoms of SDB were examined in third trimester women. Habitual snoring (snoring ≥3 times/week) was determined by self-report. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ). Women were classified as SDB-/ISQ- (n=161; 36.7%), SDB-/ISQ+ (n=146; 33.3%), SDB+/ISQ- (n=63; 14.4%), SDB+/ISQ+ (n=69; 15.7%). Logistic regression models were conducted to investigate the relationship between the groups and adverse outcomes after controlling for key variables including age, race, BMI, parity, and smoking status. Results: Overall 439 women were included with a mean gestational age of 34.1 ± 3.7 weeks. In separate logistic regressions, comorbid SDB/insomnia was independently associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 6.7 95%CI 1.7-23.3, p=0.006) but no association was found for either insomnia alone or SDB alone. Insomnia alone and comorbid SDB/insomnia were both associated with a baby born large-for-gestational age (aOR 3.4 95%CI 1.3-8.6, p=0.01 and aOR 3.0, 95%CI 1.0-9.5, p=0.05 respectively); However, the presence of SDB alone was not. Women with SDB alone and those with comorbid SDB/insomnia were at increased odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.6 95%CI 1.1-5.9, p=0.025 and aOR 2.4, 95%CI 1.0-5.4, p=0.04 respectively). Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that comorbid insomnia/SDB is associated with key adverse pregnancy outcomes even in the absence of a relationship with SDB alone. Screening of pregnant women with these symptoms could identify those at high risk for adverse outcomes.

N2  - Stillbirth is a major health burden and is twice as common as neonatal death in developed countries. Identifying potentially modifiable risk factors for stillbirth may reduce the prevalence of this tragic condition. Previous studies have reported that goingto-sleep supine may increase late stillbirth (≥28 weeks') risk by more than two-fold compared to left side going-to-sleep position. However, it is not clear if this risk differs between preterm (≥28-36 weeks') and term (≥37 weeks') gestations. A multicentre case-control study was conducted in seven New Zealand health regions, between February 2012 and December 2015. Cases (n = 164) were women with singleton pregnancies and late stillbirth, without congenital abnormality. Controls (n = 569) were women with ongoing singleton pregnancies, frequency matched for health region and gestation. The going-to-sleep position was the position on the night before the stillbirth was thought to have occurred or the night before interview for controls. Multivariable logistic regressions were conducted in all pregnancies and by term and preterm, and adjusted for known confounders. The overall risk of supine going-to-sleep position is 3.67 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74-7.78). In term pregnancies, there was an increase in stillbirth risk in women who went to sleep supine (aOR 10.26, 95% CI 3.01-35.04) compared to women who went to sleep on their left. In preterm pregnancies, the aOR for late stillbirth in women who went to sleep supine was 3.12 (95% CI 0.97-10.05) compared to those who went to sleep on their left. The prevalence of supine going-to-sleep position was 2.8% in term controls, and 4.4% in preterm controls. The magnitude of risk associated with supine going-to-sleep position may be greater for term pregnancies compared with those between 28 and 36 weeks'. The prevalence of supine going-to-sleep position is lower in term gestation than in preterm gestation. Ethical approval for the New Zealand multicentre stillbirth casecontrol study was obtained from the Northern “X” Regional Ethics Committee: NTX/06/05/054. Written informed consent was obtained by all study participants.

N2  - Introduction: This study examined the course of antidepressant use, sleep quality and depression severity from pregnancy through 6-months postpartum in women with and without a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Methods: Women (N=215) were interviewed during pregnancy, 1-month and 6-months postpartum. Mixed linear models were used to examine the longitudinal course and inter-relationships for the time-varying variables of antidepressant use, subjective sleep quality and depression severity. Results: Pregnant women with a depressive disorder who did not use antidepressants had more variable depression severity over time with improvements in depression severity by 6-months postpartum. In contrast, the depression severity of their medicated counterparts remained stable and high throughout. Pregnant women without a depressive disorder had worse sleep quality when using antidepressants compared with when they were not. Antidepressant use significantly strengthened the magnitude of the effect of sleep quality on depression severity in women with a depressive disorder during pregnancy. Conclusion: When prenatally depressed women use antidepressants, their sleep disturbance is more highly linked to depression severity than when they do not. Furthermore, antidepressants are not adequately treating the sleep disturbance of these women or their remitted counterparts, leaving both groups vulnerable to significant negative mental and physical health outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: An estimated 4.6-9.2% of pregnancies are complicated by GDM which is an important public concern due to its association with maternal and fetal complications. Data on sleep disturbances including sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in GDM is controversial. Evidence investigating the associations between GDM and SDB using objective measures is limited. This study aimed to determine if SDB is associated with an increased risk of GDM. Methods: Women with GDM (n=38) and healthy pregnant women (n=33) matched for race, maternal age (32.2 ± 3.9 yrs vs 31.8 ± 4.3 yrs, respectively) and parity underwent a full lab-polysomnography after being screened for GDM (24-36 wks pregnancy). They also completed questionnaires including Sleep Apnea Symptom Score (SASS) from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction index. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the clinical characteristics that were significantly associated with GDM. Using GDM diagnosis as the dependent variable, sleep and demographic variables having a P<0.2 in a bivariate analysis were reevaluated in full regression models as independent variables. Results: Subjects' characteristics were similar between the two groups including pre-pregnancy BMI (mean BMI, 30.5 ± 8.5 vs 30.5 ± 7.2, p=0.98). SASS, objective and subjective-measured sleep duration and sleep quality, habitual snoring, mean oxygen saturation were not different between the two groups. However, women with GDM had higher apnea hypopnea index (AHI) compared with matched controls (mean AHI±SD; 3.5 ± 5.8 vs 1.2 ± 1.6, p=0.027, respectively). The diagnosis of OSA by PSG and AHI were significantly associated with GDM diagnosis (OR 16.60; 95% CI, 1.41 -196 vs OR 1.30; 95% Cl, 1.02-1.63, respectively), after adjustment for pregnancy BMI, education, marital status, smoking and family history. Further analysis demonstrated that the different models, ODI3 and ODI4 (the number of oxygen desaturations >3% and >4% per hour), were significantly linked with GDM diagnosis (OR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41 vs OR 1.40; 95% CI, 1.02-1.92, respectively), adjusting the same variables mentioned above. Conclusion: This study indicates that PSG-confirmed OSA diagnosis and oxygen desaturations were associated with the occurrence of GDM. The clinical significance of these associations needs to be investigated in a future study with larger sample size.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, nulliparous women underwent in-home sleep-disordered breathing assessments in early (6-15 weeks of gestation) and midpregnancy (22-31 weeks of gestation). Participants and health care providers were blinded to the sleep test results. An apnea-hypopnea index of 5 or greater was used to define sleep-disordered breathing. Exposure-response relationships were examined, grouping participants into four apnea-hypopnea index groups: 0, greater than 0 to less than 5, 5 to less than 15, and 15 or greater. The study was powered to test the primary hypothesis that sleep-disordered breathing occurring in pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of preeclampsia. Secondary outcomes were rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, defined as preeclampsia and antepartum gestational hypertension, and GDM. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Three thousand seven hundred five women were enrolled. Apnea-hypopnea index data were available for 3,132 (84.5%) and 2,474 (66.8%) women in early and midpregnancy, respectively. The corresponding prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing was 3.6% and 8.3%. The prevalence of preeclampsia was 6.0%, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 13.1%, and GDM 4.1%. In early and midpregnancy the adjusted odds ratios for preeclampsia when sleep-disordered breathing was present were 1.94 (95% CI 1.07-3.51) and 1.95 (95% CI 1.18-3.23), respectively; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy 1.46 (95% CI 0.91-2.32) and 1.73 (95% CI 1.19-2.52); and GDM 3.47 (95% CI 1.95-6.19) and 2.79 (95% CI 1.63-4.77). Increasing exposure-response relationships were observed between apnea-hypopnea index and both hypertensive disorders and GDM. CONCLUSION: There is an independent association between sleep-disordered breathing and preeclampsia, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and GDM.

N2  - Background and objectives: Evidence on the association between sleep, diet and dietary behaviours in pregnant women is lacking. We examined this in a cohort of pregnant women in Singapore. Methods: Pregnant women at 26-28 weeks gestation (n=719) from the GUSTO cohort completed the Pittsburgh sleep quality index to assess sleep quality (score 0-21; higher scores represent poorer sleep), sleep duration (hours), dietary intake and behaviours were assessed. Diet quality was defined by the Healthy Eating Index for pregnant women in Singapore (HEI-SGP) on a 0-100 scale and three dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis of food records: fruit-vegetables-rice, seafood- noodles, and pasta-cheese-meat. Dietary behaviours examined included longest fasting duration during night- (19:00-06:59), meal frequency, breakfast skipping, and predominantly night-time eating. Multivariate linear regression and Poisson regression were used to examine the relationship. Results: Mean (SD) sleep quality score was 5.5 (2.9) and sleep duration 7.2 hours (1.5). Poorer sleep quality was associated with lower HEI-SGP sores [β -0.04 (95%CI -0.07, 0.00)], lower adherence to the fruit-vegetables-rice pattern [β -0.02 (-0.02, 0.00)], shorter night-time fasting intervals [β -0.05 hours (-0.09, -0.01)] and higher likelihood of skipping breakfast [prevalence ratio 1.06 (95% CI 1.01-1.10)]. Longer sleep duration was only associated with a longer night-time fasting interval [β 0.08 hours (95%CI 0.00, 0.16)]. Conclusions: Poorer sleep quality was associated with unhealthier diets and dietary behaviours, while longer sleep duration was associated with longer night-time fasting. Prospective studies are warranted to investigate the direction of causality.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have a higher risk of developing gestational hypertensive disorders. Mechanisms behind this association have not been elucidated however; one of the hypotheses includes intermittent hypoxemia and airflow limitation leading to an enhanced sympathetic drive. Pulse transit time (PTT) is the time it takes a pulse wave to travel from the left ventricle to a peripheral site. PTT is altered by both intrathoracic pressures and arterial stiffness and is a marker of sympathetic drive. We hypothesized that PTT is associated with OSA status and correlates with OSA severity. Methods: Women with obesity in the 1st trimester of a singleton pregnancy who complained of loud snoring were recruited as part of an interventional positive airway pressure trial. Baseline home sleep apnea monitoring study was obtained prior to an intervention using a level III monitoring device, which included electrocardiographic leads and a plethysmograph for oxygen saturation measurement. PTT measured the time from the peak of the R wave on electrocardiogram to the time that the pulse wave rises 50% from its nadir by plethysmograph. Results: The sample consisted of 89 women with a mean age of 29.2 + 6.5 years, BMI 34.3 + 8.0 Kg/m2. Mean gestational age at screening was 10.7 + 1.0 weeks. 29% of women were nulliparous, 11% had a history of chronic hypertension, and 19% had OSA. Mean systolic blood pressure was 116.2 ± 11.4 mmHg, and mean diastolic blood pressure was 68.9 ± 9.4 mmHg. Median apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was 0.4 (interquartile range 0, 2.1) events per hour; 11.1% were severe (AHI >30), 5.6% were moderate (AHI 15-29.9). There were no significant differences of average PTT in women with OSA when compared with snoring women without OSA (331.7+ 194.8 vs 317.7 + 148.1 msec, p=0.09). However, there were significant positive correlations between drops in PTT variables and respiratory events such as hypopnea count/index (Beta=0.77, p<0.001), apnea count/index (Beta=0.68, p<0.0001), and desaturation count/index (Beta=0.81, p<0.0001). Conclusion: In the present study, pregnant women with and without OSA exhibited similar PTT, however there were significant differences in PTT associated with respiratory events. These findings suggest that OSA does not add to changes in PTT beyond the changes associated with snoring; however, large swings in PTT following respiratory events in women with OSA suggest alterations in the sympathetic nervous system. Collection of data from a sample of non-snoring pregnant women is ongoing. (Table Presented).

N2  - Over the past decade there has been emerging evidence that suggests that maternal sleep position may be associated with stillbiirth. It has been postulated that approximately one quarter, to one third of stillbirths might be prevented by simply asking women to change their sleep position. However, there are concerns that giving women information about sleep position and stillbirth risk may make them anxious. This study aimed to determine underlying messages being conveyed to pregnant women especially with respect to sleeping position during pregnancy in order to understand any anxiety associated with giving this message. An online survey of 537 Australian women (107 of whom were “currently pregnant”). The survey examined participant's views regarding sleep position messages, type of information source, and pre-existing knowledge. Participant characteristics such as general anxiety and the 'Fetal Health Locus of Control' Scale were also collected. The results showed that of the participants who were currently pregnant 65% (n = 66) settled to sleep on their left side, whereas only 23% (n = 23) said they settled in this position when not pregnant. When asked on a 5 point Likert scale how anxious they may have been about sleep position in their current pregnancy 85% held a “neutral” to “not at all anxious” view. Data analysis is still underway examining the correlation between state trait anxiety, fetal locus of control and any anxiety about the sleep position message in the pregnant group and these results will be presented at the conference. This study indicates that many pregnant women were already changing their sleeping position in pregnancy. A small subset of pregnant women may feel anxiety associated with the sleep position in pregnancy message and therefore some care needs to be taken to inform women about the importance of sleep position without unduly provoking anxiety.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy appears to be predispose to the development of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) due to dynamic physiologic changes. OSA has also been associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, both causes of short-term and long-term maternal cardiovascular and metabolic complications and adverse outcomes in the offspring. Objective: The goal of this study was to examine the association of a diagnosis of OSA with adverse maternal outcomes. Methods: The National Perinatal Information Center data -an organization with a charter membership from major perinatal centers in the United States- was used to identify women who had a pregnancy diagnosis between 2010 and 2014. Among these women, we used the international classification of Diseases, ninth revision for OSA diagnosis and other outcomes. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI). Results: The sample consisted of 1,577,632 pregnant women with an overall rate of OSA of 0.1%. Mothers with OSA were older (32.3 + 6.9 vs. 29.6 + 6 years, p<0.001), more likely to be Black (aOR 1.90; 95% CI 1.72-2.11, p<0.001) or smokers (aOR 1.72; 1.51-2.06 p<0.001). There was a significant association between OSA and pre-pregnancy hypertension (aOR 5.20; 4.69-5.77), diabetes (aOR 4.37; 3.81-5.01), coronary artery disease (aOR 7.74; 4.18-14.3) and chronic renal disease (aOR 2.49; 1.67-3.71), after adjusting for maternal obesity. There was also a significant association between OSA and gestational hypertensive disease and its complications after adjusting for maternal obesity: Preeclampsia (aOR 2.07; 95% CI 1.09-1.50), gestational hypertension (aOR 1.28; 1.09-1.50), ecclampsia (aOR 2.50; 1.75-3.56), acute renal failure (aOR 5.24, 3.33-8.33), pulmonary edema (aOR 9.92, 4.56-21.6) and stroke (aOR 8.25, 1.10-62.0). The risk of gestational diabetes was also significantly elevated (aOR 1.78, 1.59-2.00). Length of stay was significantly longer in women with OSA (5.1 + 5.6 vs. 3.0 + 3.0, p<0.001) and odds of an admission to the intensive care unit were higher (aOR 4.64, 4.03-5.35). Conclusion: Pregnant women with OSA are older, more likely to be African American and have a significantly higher risk of having morbid pre-pregnancy conditions and pregnancy-specific complications such as gestational hypertensive conditions and gestational diabetes. Pregnant women with OSA also have a longer length of stay and higher odds of an admission to the intensive care unit.

N2  - Introduction: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are prescribed for ∼30% of pregnant women with depression and are reported to disrupt sleep architecture. Furthermore, prenatal maternal depression itself is associated with disrupted circadian rhythms and sleep problems in offspring. However, little is known about the effects of prenatal SRI exposure on child sleep and circadian rhythms. We examined the effects of prenatal exposure to maternal depression and SRIs on circadian neurohormone excretion and sleep in 36-month-olds. Methods: Mothers were originally enrolled during pregnancy into a larger, longitudinal study and were interviewed with standardized instruments for psychiatric diagnoses and treatment status. Motherschild pairs (n=59) were categorized as: 1) No depression or SRI treatment during pregnancy (NoEXP, N=25); 2) Depression, no SRIs (DEP, N=15); 3) Depression with SRIs (SRI, N=19). Videosomnography and respiration recordings were collected on the children for two consecutive nights at 18 and 36-months post-birth. Recordings were manually scored by a trained rater, who was blinded to group status, for percentage of time in bed in wake, Non-REM, REM, and sleep-wake transitional states as well as sleep onset latency (SOL) and number of behavioral arousals. Overnight and daytime urine samples were obtained to determine melatonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol excretion. Results: Overnight melatonin levels were significantly lower in the DEP group compared to NoEXP (Wald χ2=8.2, p<.02). The SRI group had higher cortisol levels overall compared to NoEXP and DEP groups (Wald χ2=6.6, p<.05). Higher daytime cortisol was related to shorter SOL (β=.87, p<.02) and lower amounts of NREM sleep in the early night period (β=.1.1, p<.03). Higher nighttime cortisol was related to longer SOL (β=1.3, p<.02) and more REM sleep (β=.1.1, p<.02). Higher overnight norepinephrine was related to more REM sleep (β=1.75, p<.02) across groups, while higher daytime norepinephrine was related to longer SOL (β=3.56, p<.01) in DEP and SRI groups. Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to maternal depression and SRIs affected sleep and neurohormone secretion of the pineal and the sympathetic nervous system in early childhood. The impact of such prenatal exposure on specific aspects of sleep might act via distinct biological pathways.

N2  - Sleep problems during pregnancy impair maternal health and increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcome. The circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with sleep problems in previous studies. Here, we studied whether evening-type women had more sleep problems during their pregnancy, as compared with other chronotypes, in a sample consisting of 1653 pregnant women from the Finnish CHILD-SLEEP Birth Cohort. Chronotype was assessed with a shortened version of the morningness-eveningness questionnaire. Pregnant evening-type women reported more sleep problems, including troubles of falling asleep (OR = 3.4, p < 0.0001), poor sleep quality (OR = 2.9, p < 0.01) and daily tiredness (OR = 3.2, p < 0.0001) than the morning-type women, even after controlling for sleep duration and sleep deprivation. They had higher scores on Epworth Sleepiness Scale (p < 0.05), Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (p < 0.0001) and Global Seasonality Score (p < 0.01) and were also more often smokers, also during pregnancy (p < 0.001) and reported poorer general health (p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. They also reported having had more sleep problems during their childhood (OR = 1.5, p < 0.05) and adolescence (OR = 2.0, p < 0.001) than the morning-type women. Our results indicate that eveningness is associated with more sleep problems and unhealthy life habits during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with adverse neonatal outcomes such as preterm birth and growth restriction in some studies. There are no data regarding resuscitation at birth or risk of congenital anomalies following in-utero exposure to OSA. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of OSA with resuscitative efforts at birth and the risk of congenital anomalies. Methods: The National Perinatal Information Center collects administrative discharge and select medical record data from major perinatal centers in the US. We studied linked maternal records and newborn records with a delivery hospitalization from 2010-2014 to assess newborn outcomes of maternal OSA based on diagnosis and procedure codes. Congenital anomalies were defined based on international classification of diseases-9, and encompassed “any” congenital anomaly as well as specific anomalies. Univariate and Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI). The model included maternal obesity, pre-pregnancy DM, gestational DM, pre-pregnancy HTN, gestational HTN, preeclampsia, tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Results: There were 1,577,632 pregnant women; 0.1% had OSA; 1,423,099 of all records were linked to live newborn records. Mothers with OSA had a higher likelihood of having obesity, pre-gestational hypertension and diabetes. Neonates born to mothers with OSA were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (25.3% vs. 8.1%, p<0.001) or special care nursery (34.9% vs. 13.6%, p<0.001). Similarly these newborns were more likely to have resuscitation at birth (aOR 2.76, 1.35-5.64), and a longer hospital stay (aOR 2.25, 1.85-2.65) even after adjusting for covariates. The risk for congenital anomalies was higher in babies of women with OSA (aOR 1.26, 1.11- 1.43), with the highest risk being that of musculoskeletal anomalies (aOR 1.89, 1.16-3.07). The risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was no longer significant after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate a higher risk of congenital anomalies and resuscitation at birth in neonates born to mothers with OSA. These data further highlight the importance of identifying this condition in pregnancy and testing the impact of therapy on these complications.

N2  - Study objectives Maternal and paternal sleep insufficiency during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for health and wellbeing in young families. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of sleep insufficiency and symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy (at 32nd pregnancy week) and their relationship to depression, anxiety and environmental stress. Methods The study is based on a population based sample from Finland consisting of 1667 mothers and 1498 fathers from the Child-sleep birth cohort. We evaluated both the core symptoms of insomnia (sleep onset problems, nocturnal awakenings, too-early awakenings, and poor sleep quality) and the presence of insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep was defined as a two-hour difference between self-assessed sleep need and reported sleep duration, or sleep duration shorter than six hours per night. Results We found that symptoms of insomnia were more prevalent among women than among men (9.8% vs. 6.2%), whereas sleep debt was less prevalent among women than among men (4.5% vs. 9.6%). Overall, 11.8% of the women and 14.9% of the men reported either significant insomnia or short sleep. Symptoms of insomnia were related to symptoms of depression both among women and men (AOR 3.8, 95% CI 2.6–5.6 vs. AOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.2), while short sleep was related to depression among women (AOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.8–5.8), and to low education, poor health and a larger number of children among men. Conclusions The study showed that insomnia and sleep insufficiency are prevalent among women and men during pregnancy. The findings underline the impact of insomnia to both maternal and paternal health during pregnancy as well as to the implementation of effective interventions to prevent negative consequences of sleep disturbances.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Daytime sleepiness is a frequent complaint in women during pregnancy. It has also been linked to negative obstetric consequences. Although high prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness throughout pregnancy is well-documented, neither the causes of persistent daytime sleepiness nor new-onset daytime sleepiness during pregnancy have been investigated. Identifying predictive factors may play an important role in the management of daytime sleepiness in pregnant women and improve prenatal care and maternal-fetal outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: To examine first-trimester maternal characteristics associated with the persistence and new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women.
DESIGN: A longitudinal, prospective cohort design.
SETTING: One medical center in Taipei, Taiwan and participating women's homes.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 204 pregnant women.
METHODS: First-trimester pregnant women recruited from an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center provided socio-demographic and health information, wore an actigraphy monitor for 7 days, and completed sleep, mood, and daytime sleepiness questionnaires. Data were collected again when the women were in the second and third trimester.
RESULTS: Thirty-one (15.2%) women experienced excessive daytime sleepiness that persisted across all three trimesters. Nulliparous women and women who snored in the first trimester were 2.28 and 2.10 times more at risk of being classified of persistent daytime sleepiness than multiparous women and women who did not snore in the first trimester, respectively. Thirty-one (15.2%) women developed new-onset daytime sleepiness with advancing gestation. Women were more likely to develop new-onset daytime sleepiness if they worked longer hours per week (OR=1.04, p<0.001), if they reported snoring (OR=6.75, p<0.001), and if they had elevated depressive symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy (OR=1.09, p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Snoring in the first trimester is involved in both the persistence and new-onset of daytime sleepiness with elevated depressive symptoms related to new-onset daytime sleepiness in pregnant women. Findings suggest that intervention strategies for alleviating daytime sleepiness in pregnant women should focus on managing snoring and symptoms of depression in early trimesters with special attention to nulliparous and employed women.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common during pregnancy. Self-reported snoring has been observed in up to 46% of pregnant women. Studies from recent years suggest that SDB during pregnancy may be associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Objectives: To examine the effect of maternal SDB on perinatal outcomes and to compare between chronic snorers to pregnancy-onset snorers. Methods: Women of singleton pregnancy on their third trimester were recruited prospectively and completed a designated questionnaire. The questionnaire included information regarding medical history, snoring during and before the current pregnancy, the Berlin questionnaire and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS). Cord blood pH measurements were performed. Data on delivery, gestational age, offspring's gender, birth weight and Apgar scores was retrieved from the medical records. Results: Three hundred and forty women were recruited. The mean age was 31.7 ± 4.4 years, the mean pre-pregnancy BMI was 21.9 ± 3.4 kg/m2 and the mean BMI at time of questionnaire was 26.8 ± 3.7 kg/m2. Thirtyseven percent (124/340) reported of snoring but only 10% had positive Berlin score. Twelve percent of women were chronic snorers and 25% were pregnancy-onset snorers. The mean ESS score was 8.0 ± 4.2. No differences in ESS scores were found between snorers and non-snorers. No differences were found in gestational age, birth weight percentile, apgar scores and cord blood pH between snorers and non-snorers. Snorers had significantly more instrumental deliveries compared to non-snorers (9% vs. 1.5%; p=0.003). Pregnancy-onset snorers had significantly more instrumental deliveries compared to both chronic-snorers and controls (12%, 2.6% and 1.3% respectively; p=0.006). Conclusion: Instrumental deliveries are more common among women with SDB particularly among pregnancy-onset snoring.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered-breathing (SDB) is associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly maternal hypertension and diabetes and possibly fetal growth restriction. However, little is known about SDB association with time-to-delivery, a clinically important outcomes, as earlier deliveries contributes to maternal-infant morbidity and mortality. We examined the association of snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery among a cohort of pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women in their third trimester, without hypertension or diabetes, recruited from prenatal clinics of a large medical center, completed a questionnaire about their sleep characteristics. Demographic, risk factor, and delivery information was abstracted from medical charts. Women were classified into four groups based on their snoring status: non-snorers, infrequent-quiet, frequent-quiet, or frequent-loud snorers. Cox Proportional Hazard Regression Models were used to investigate the association between snoring frequency and intensity and time-to-delivery, adjusting for education, race, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking, parity, weight gain rate and induction. Results: Of 904 non-hypertensive, non-diabetic women, half were non-snorers. Among snorers, 42% and 52% were infrequent or frequent- quiet snorers, respectively. Frequent-loud snoring was reported by 6% of women. Earlier deliveries were more common in the frequent- loud group than all other groups; the median time-to-delivery was 38.8 and 39.4 weeks' gestation for frequent-loud snorers and controls respectively; while the first quartile time-to-delivery was 37.1 and 38.6 for frequent-loud snorers and controls respectively. We observed an increased hazard ratio for delivery among frequent-loud snorers, compared with controls and adjusted for pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and delivery characteristics; [HR=1.81,(95% CI 1.18,2.78)]. Similar time-to-delivery was observed among non-snorers and infrequent- or frequent-quiet snorers. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that healthy pregnant women, absent of key comorbidities, with loud-frequent snoring are at-risk for earlier deliveries. The combination of snoring frequency and intensity may be a clinically useful marker to identify otherwise low-risk women who are likely to deliver earlier.

N2  - The present observational study aimed to clarify the effects of sleep disorders on threatened premature delivery, especially preterm uterine contraction. The participants included 122 healthy singleton pregnant women. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index was used to evaluate the quality of sleep during the previous month at the initial examination and at 16, 24, and 32 weeks of gestation; scores >5 indicate poor sleep. Threatened premature delivery was defined as preterm uterine contraction >6 times/h and requiring tocolytic therapy before 37 weeks of gestation. We analyzed the relationship between poor sleep and threatened premature delivery. Poor sleep affected 27% (n=33) at the initial examination, 34% (n=41) at 16 weeks, 37% (n=45) at 24 weeks, and 41% (n=50) at 32 weeks of gestation. There were 23 patients (19%) with threatened premature delivery. Poor sleep affected 35% and 25% of patients with threatened and non-threatened premature delivery at the initial examination, respectively, 52% and 29% at 16 weeks, 48% and 34% at 24 weeks, and 43% and 40% at 32 weeks of gestation. Sleep disorders at 16 weeks of gestation were the most significantly associated with threatened premature delivery.

N2  - Rationale: In the general population, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be predicted by clinical and questionnaire based criteria. Data about predictors of OSA in pregnancy are sparse. Cross-sectional data has shown that sleep disordered breathing in the third trimester correlates with pre-pregnancy BMI. The objective of this study was to assess whether conventional anthropometric measures can be utilized to predict OSA in early pregnancy. We hypothesize that some individual conventional anthropometric measures will correlate with the presence of OSA in early pregnancy. Methods: Data were collected from the first trimester screening visit of a prospective intervention trial. Pregnant overweight women (BMI >25), who reported snoring were recruited. Demographics, medical history, and physical exam findings were reviewed. Subjects underwent basic anthropometric measurements including height, weight, neck circumference at hyoid bone, mallampati grade in resting, seated position and extended neck position, waist and hip circumference per the International Standards for Anthropometric Assessment. All subjects underwent home sleep apnea test using a level III device; hypopnea was defined using the 3% desaturation rule and OSA was defined as an apnea hypopnea index > 5 events per hour. Descriptive statistics, two-tailed t-test, and Pearson correlation were used. Results: We evaluated data from 78 participants. Demographic and anthropometric data are shown in Table 1 in whole sample as well as in women with and without OSA. Women with OSA had a higher BMI (37.7 + 7.1 vs. 33.0 + 7.1 Kg/m2, p=0.05), had a larger upright and supine neck circumference (38.3 + 2.1 vs 35.6 +2.9 cm, p=0.0006, and 39.8 +2.3 vs. 36.7 + 3.6, p=0.0009). The increase in neck circumference between upright and supine position was not predictive of OSA status. Larger waist to hip ratio was marginally associated with OSA status (p=0.06). Mallampati grades in resting, upright position correlated almost perfectly with the extended Mallampati position (r=0.94, p<0.05), however, neither grade was predictive of OSA status. Though breast circumference was 5 cm larger on average in women with OSA, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: This study shows that some limited conventional anthropometric measures may help in predicting OSA in patients in early pregnancy. Given the potential adverse maternal and fetal outcomes of sleep disordered breathing in this population, further studies are needed to devise innovative models for the prediction of OSA in pregnancy and may need to include novel markers that reflect pregnancy physiology that is relevant to sleep disordered breathing.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disturbances are among the most frequent complaint and a major health problem among pregnant women. Although previous studies have drawn increasing attention to the association between sleep and blood pressure in pregnant women, none of them have included daytime sleep and have modeled snoring and objective sleep quantity as well as sleep quality simultaneously. The purpose of our study was to examine the association between snoring, sleep quality and quantity, and blood pressure in third-trimester pregnant women. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of two cohorts of healthy pregnant women recruited from a prenatal clinic in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. A total of 322 women reported sociodemographic and health characteristics in a structured interview and wore a wrist actigraph for 7 consecutive days to assess objective sleep patterns. Women's blood pressure was measured by trained personnel while they were rested and were seated using an electronic sphygmomanometer in the clinic. Results: One hundred and thirty three (41.3%) women reported snoring. Ninety-three women (28.9%) had nighttime sleep < 6 hours, with only 95 (29.5%) women averaging 7 or more hours of nighttime sleep. In the multivariate analyses, snoring remained as a significant predictor of higher diastolic blood pressure (β = 2.07, p < 0.05) and mean arterial pressure levels (β = 2.00, p < 0.05), after adjustment for age, parity, gestational age, body mass index before pregnancy, and sleep quantity and quality by actigraphy. Conclusion: Snoring is a highly prevalent condition experienced by healthy third-trimester pregnant women. Clinical assessment and screening of snoring are of utmost importance in obstetric practice to potentially prevent or reduce the associated adverse cardiovascular consequences in women during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common occurrence in pregnancy but data assessing the performance of screening tools are scarce in this population. The performance of screening questionnaires may also vary by the stage of pregnancy. The aim of this study was to examine progression of SDB and daytime sleepiness around conception and assess the ability of the STOPBANG and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaires to detect obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the first trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Women with obesity in the first trimester of a singleton pregnancy were recruited. Participants answered sleep questionnaires (STOPBANG and ESS) regarding current symptoms that occurred since conception (c-) and symptoms that were present prior to pregnancy (pre-). Participants also underwent a level III home sleep apnea test. Sleep apnea was defined as apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5 events per hour and hypopnea defined based on 3% oxygen desaturation. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, non-paired t-test, and sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed. Results: A total of 105 women were recruited. Mean age was 29 ± 6; mean BMI was 34.3 ± 8. Thirty percent of women were nulliparous, 10% had pre-gestational hypertension and 2% had pre-gestational diabetes. Mean gestational age at enrollment was 10.5 ± 2 weeks. Eighteen percent of women had OSA. Pre- and c-STOPBANG, correlated strongly (r=0.86, p<0.05), and so did pre-ESS and c-ESS (r=0.80, p<0.05). However, average scores were significantly higher in the 1st trimester (STOPBANG 2.32 ± 1.1 vs. 2.14 ± 1.1, p=0.009, ESS 11 ± 5.3 vs. 8 ± 5.1, p<0.0001) compared to pre-conception. C-STOPBANG and pre-ESS scores were significantly associated with OSA diagnosis (p=0.003 and p=0.03, respectively). Specificity of both pre and c-STOPBANG was 97.5% whereas sensitivity was <17%. Sensitivity of pre-ESS scores was 61% but specificity was poor for both pre- and c-ESS scores. Conclusion: The STOPBANG questionnaire demonstrated good ability to correctly detect patients without a diagnosis of OSA but limited ability to identify patients with OSA. Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime sleepiness worsen as early as the first trimester of pregnancy compared to preconception.

N2  - The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is unknown during pregnancy, but the syndrome is likely underdiagnosed and rising in frequency along with the obesity epidemic. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse outcomes, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm, and cesarean delivery. Obese pregnant women should be screened and referred to a sleep medicine specialist for evaluation. Continuous positive airway pressure is the treatment of choice with demonstrated safety and compliance in pregnancy. Early anesthesia consultation allows for preparation and implementation of a peripartum plan that includes early labor analgesia, avoidance of respiratory depressants, and closer monitoring of oxygenation.

N2  - Depression affects up to 23% of pregnant women and is associated with adverse physical/mental health outcomes for both the mother and baby. Depressed pregnant women may be more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to an increased risk for chronic disease. Little is known regarding depressed pregnant women's perceptions, uses of, and interests in complementary health approaches. Study participants (mean age 28.7 ± 6.8; n = 1032) included pregnant women ≥8 weeks gestation who responded to a survey assessing physical and mental health and wellness practices. Of those completing the survey, depressed pregnant women (n = 272) had significantly higher levels of anxiety (P < .001) and stress (P < .001) and had poorer sleep quality (P < .001), mindfulness (P < .001), and social support (P < .001) compared to nondepressed pregnant women (n = 760). A majority (84%) of depressed pregnant women would consider using a complementary health approach for weight and/or stress management during pregnancy, and more than 50% were interested in yoga.

N2  - Rationale: Anatomic and physiologic changes during pregnancy can predispose women to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is recognized as a risk factor for maternal and fetal morbidity. There remains a knowledge gap in characterizing OSA in pregnant women and the full spectrum of fetal outcomes of mothers with OSA. Methods: We performed a prospective interventional study among pregnant women in multiple community and hospital-based practices in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts. In order to ensure an adequate cohort of women with sleep disordered breathing, we recruited habitual snorers and women with obesity in their first trimester of pregnancy. Women were tested using home sleep apnea testing using a level III device; hypopnea was defined using the 3% desaturation criterion. Women who met traditional polysomnographic criteria (apnea hypopnea index greater than five) were considered positive for OSA. At the time of screening for OSA, we collected prior obstetric history data. We collected data on fetal outcomes at the time of delivery or fetal demise. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized linear models. Results: Ninety eight pregnant women with obesity have been recruited and 18.4% were determined to have OSA. The average age of the sample was 29 + 6 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 34.3 + 8.0 and a total of 28% of women were primigravida. Women with OSA had a significantly higher BMI and age as compared with controls (p=0.01 and p=0.02 respectively). Among women with OSA, mean apnea hypopnea index was 12 + 11 events per hour; the majority of women had mild OSA (83.3%). Women with OSA had significantly longer time spent in oxygen saturations below 90% than those without OSA (p=0.03). After excluding primigravidas, there were no significant differences in covariates such as age or BMI in women with and without OSA. There was no difference in miscarriage among the two groups (p=0.58). There was a higher prevalence of history of stillbirths in women with OSA as compared with women who snored (30.8% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.06). Conclusions: While prior studies have demonstrated poor fetal outcomes in OSA, to our knowledge none have investigated fetal death as an endpoint in mothers with OSA. Our findings suggest that maternal OSA confers a very serious fetal prognosis and may potentially be incorporated in risk stratification and prevention strategies. The molecular mechanism underlying this observation is yet to be determined.

N2  - The Auckland Stillbirth Study (TASS) identified the importance of sleep position in late stillbirth, but relied on mothers' self-reports, lacking objective physiological explanations for the increased risk. Non-clinically conventional measures of sleep physiology may be required to detect subtle changes associated with maternal position change. Descriptions of maternal sleep behaviour in late pregnancy, such as duration of each sleep position and frequency of position change, are also important in the context of TASS. 30 healthy women with a singleton pregnancy (35-38 weeks) underwent an overnight respiratory sleep study with infrared video. Sleep position was synchronised with the flattening index, an estimate of inspiratory flow limitation. The physiological effects of position were assessed by repeated measures in continuous five minute epochs. Conventional measures of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) severity, the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI), were also assessed by sleep position. Data are presented as median (IQR). The AHI and ODI were clinically insignificant in all positions. The supine position demonstrated a substantially greater proportion of flowlimited breaths (24%, 5-55%) than left-lateral (6%, 0-29%) and rightlateral (5%, 0-27%). 20/30 women initiated sleep in the left-lateral position, compared with 8/30 in right-lateral and 2/30 in supine. The women spent a significantly greater overall proportion of the night leftlateral (49%, 37-60%) than supine (19%, 1-29%), and the average duration of each left-lateral before changing position, 35 (26-48) minutes, was significantly longer than supine, 15 (4-32) minutes. These healthy women in late pregnancy had no clinically-defined OSA in any position, but instead demonstrated marked inspiratory flow limitation when sleeping supine. This flow limitation may contribute to the observed reduction in the time spent supine by increasing arousals from sleep, and thus may have a protective function.

N2  - Introduction: While postpartum depression has been linked to poorer maternal sleep quality, the pathways underlining this relationship are not well known. This study aimed to investigate the links between maternal postpartum depression, cognitions regarding infant sleep, nighttime behaviours and reported sleep quality. We propose a model linking postpartum depression and maternal sleep quality through maternal cognitions and ensuing maternal behaviours. Methods: Using a prospective cohort study design, nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy completed questionnaires at 18, 28, 36 weeks gestation and 5 weeks postpartum. A sample of 452 women participated in this study. Measures included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, three subscales from the Maternal Cognitions about Infant Sleep Questionnaire (Anger, Limits and Doubt) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Maternal nighttime behaviours, including infant settling methods, checking, and sleep location, were assessed by a questionnaire. Path analysis was undertaken using Mplus version 7 and mediators were tested using the Indirect approach. Model fit was assessed using a variety of standard fit indices. Results: Depression is associated with maternal cognitions (Limits b=.20; p=.001; Anger b=.40, p<.001; Doubt b=.40; p<.001) and poorer sleep quality (b=.34; p<.001). Anger and doubt are associated with infant checking. Doubt is associated with sleep location (bed sharing coefficient =.03; p=.007; separate room coefficient = -.05; p<.001) and was found to mediate the relationship between depression and problematic nighttime behaviours. Both doubt and checking were found to mediate the relationship between depression and sleep quality (indirect effect = 0.01; p=.031). Conclusion: Some evidence substantiating the proposed maternal sleep model was found, especially pathways linking depression and sleep quality through doubt and checking behaviours. Further investigation of this model is warranted, especially in the context of developing interventions to improve maternal sleep quality during the postpartum period.

N2  - Objective Pregnant women often suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD symptoms are known to influence the quality of life; however, there is a lack of data in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to establish the impact of GERD symptoms on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during pregnancy. Participants and methods A prospective longitudinal cohort study to investigate the impact of GERD symptoms on the HRQOL was carried out in 510 pregnant women and 330 nonpregnant women as controls. Two validated questionnaires, the Reflux Disease Questionnaire and the Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire, were used. Results The study showed a significant negative impact on HRQOL in pregnant women with GERD symptoms. All five areas, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, vitality, food/drink problems, and physical/social functioning, were significantly reduced, but the most significant impact was on sleep (Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia Questionnaire score-35%). Overall, quality of life in women with GERD worsened throughout pregnancy. Conclusion GERD is frequently seen in pregnant women and has a negative impact on HRQOL, especially in late pregnancy. Therefore, there is a need for adequate therapy of GERD in pregnant women and HRQOL could be an adequate monitoring tool in this population.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep patterns and brain maturation in childhood are closely intertwined. Cross-sectional studies in children have shown that adverse sleep patterns are related to altered brain structures, but the direction of this association has not been explored. This study aims to determine whether structural properties of the fetal and early infant brain are predictive of repeatedly measured sleep patterns until school age. Methods: Within the Generation R Study, fetal brain growth was measured at 21 (19-23) and 30 (28-33) weeks of gestation. In a subsample of 775 infants, head circumference and volume of lateral ventricles were also measured using cranial ultrasound at 6 weeks postnatal age. Mothers reported sleep duration and sleep problems for 4341 children at 2, 6 months, 1.5, 2, 3 and 6 years. Brain measures were tested as determinants for sleep patterns using general estimating equations (GEE), to account for the correlation between repeatedly measured outcomes. Results: Larger lateral ventricles in late pregnancy {β=0.05, (0.02;0.1), p-value=0.013} and early infancy {β=0.10, (0.01;0.2), p-value=0.027} were associated with longer sleep duration in toddlerhood. In utero measures of larger head circumference and lateral ventricles were related to less sleep problems between 2 months and 6 years. These associations were partly explained by prenatal smoking exposure and maternal psychopathology. Conclusion: Variations in ventricular size before and shorty after birth are related to childhood sleep patterns. Larger ventricles, indicating advanced development, are related to longer sleep duration. This study provides evidence for neurodevelopmental origins of childhood sleep problems, which can be observed already prenatally. Future studies should explore the directionality of the associations between early neurodevelopment and sleep patterns using different imaging modalities.

N2  - Background Intermittent hypoxia associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was shown to promote IL-6 and TNF-alpha release in the general population; this association likely mediates certain cardiovascular outcomes. OSA has been linked to adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes in pregnancy including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Increased circulating concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha have been linked to pre-eclampsia and insulin resistance. Mechanisms by which the association of OSA with adverse pregnancy outcomes takes place and the role of OSA in promoting pro-inflammatory cytokines in complicated pregnancies remain to be elucidated. Objective This study aims to evaluate pro-inflammatory cytokines among women with gestational diabetes with and without OSA. Methods 23 pregnant participants with abnormal glucose tolerance tests without a history of diabetes predating pregnancy were recruited. All participants underwent home sleep apnea testing using a level III monitoring device (MediByte® Breabon, Ontario, Ca) between 24 and 32 weeks of gestation. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5 events per hour using the 4% desaturation rule. Medical records were examined for demographic data and medical history. Fasting morning blood samples were obtained for IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and IL-15 after participants were instructed to refrain from exercise. Plasma was separated from blood and stored at -80C. Cytokine levels were measured using an xMAP multiplexed bead array immunoassay. Results Mean age and BMI of participants was 31 + 4.4 years, and 35.7 + 7.4 kg/m2 respectively, and 43% were nulliparous. Participants were 52% Caucasian, 18% Black, 8% Hispanic and 30% Asian, American Indian or multi-racial. Three patients had mild OSA (AHI 5-15), and one patient had moderate OSA (AHI 15-30). There was a significant positive association between the AHI score and IL-6 (r=0.702, p<0.001), IL-15 (r=0.673, p<0.001) and IL-8 (r=0.682, p<0.001) concentrations. Interestingly, TNF-alpha showed a positive correlation with AHI but it did not reach statistical significance (r=0.321, p=0.136). Maternal BMI did not show correlation with inflammatory markers: IL-6 (β=-.04, p=.86), IL-8 (β=-.14, p=.61), IL-15 (β=-.25, p=.35). Conclusion These results confirm that patients with gestational diabetes and OSA have a more profound inflammatory profile than patients with gestational diabetes who do not meet criteria for OSA illustrated in Figure 1. OSA may lead to an enhanced pro-inflammatory state that may explain associations with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and preeclampsia. However, a reverse directionality is also possible where a pronounced inflammatory state leads to OSA by impacting upper airway physiology. (Figure Presnted).

N2  - Study Objectives: To evaluate feasibility and efficacy of a hospital-based protocol for improving sleep in high- risk antepartum patients. Methods: Sleep measures were compared during 1 week of hospitalization before and after implementing a Sleep Improvement Protocol for Antepartum Patients (SIP-AP). A non-randomized convenience sample of usual care controls was compared to a subsequent intervention sample after the protocol was implemented. Women were eligible if they spoke English, were medically stable, pregnant for at least 20 weeks, and hospitalized at least 24 hours; 25 pregnant women had sufficient data for analyses (11 controls, 14 intervention). Sleep was assessed in 3 ways: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was completed after obtaining consent to estimate sleep quality prior to hospital admission; sleep diary completed each hospital day; and General Sleep Disturbance Scale completed at 7 days or prior to hospital discharge. Symptoms that could affect sleep were assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Results: Both groups recorded similar sleep duration (7 hours) but the intervention group had fewer symptoms and significantly (P = .015) lower sleep disturbance scores (53.1 ± 14.5) than controls (71.9 ± 18.8). Participant feedback about the intervention was positive, although adherence to components of the intervention protocol was variable. Conclusions: This pilot study provides evidence of the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the SIP-AP intervention for reducing symptoms and improving sleep of antepartum patients during hospitalization. Further detailed evaluation of specific components of this protocol is warranted, and other types of hospitalized patients may benefit from unit-based modifications to this SIP-AP protocol.

N2  - Circadian rhythms align physiology and behaviour with environmental time-of-day cues (e.g. light/dark cycle) and are vital for normal functioning of organisms. Cells receive circadian inputs via daily fluctuations in hormones (e.g. melatonin and cortisol) and expression of cellular clock genes (e.g. Clock, Bmal1, Per1-3 and Cry1-2). Circadian variation is an intrinsic component of human physiology, developing during late fetal life. Fetal circadian rhythms result predominantly from placentally transmitted maternal circadian cues (e.g. melatonin and cortisol), as the fetus is unable to synthesise these hormones until near term or early postnatal life. Melatonin and cortisol exhibit circadian rhythms in cord blood of newborn babies, hence the maternally derived time-of-day signals in the fetus persist until term. Furthermore, the placenta expresses clock genes and aspects of placental function exhibit circadian rhythmicity Disruption of maternal circadian rhythmicity can occur through multiple mechanisms e.g shift work during pregnancy and maternal obesity. Importantly, both insults can potentially impact on placental function to decrease fetal growth, which in turn programmes offspring for adult onset diseases including type II diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Like offspring from mothers with disrupted circadian rhythms, preterm babies are programmed for adult onset diseases. Circadian inputs to the developing fetus are abruptly disrupted by preterm birth due to removal of crucial time-of-day maternal hormonal signals (melatonin/ cortisol) and extended admission to the continuously highly illuminated and noisy environment of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU): continuous light and noise exposure disrupts the development of co-ordinated circadian rhythms. Importantly, reintroduction of light/dark cycles to preterm neonates improves immediate growth trajectories and health, but the long-term benefits are unknown.

N2  - The placenta is important in providing a healthy environment for the fetus and plays a central role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Fetal and placental developments are influenced by epigenetic programming. There is some evidence that PE is controlled to an altered circadian homeostasis. In a nested case-control study embedded in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, we obtained placental tissue, umbilical cord leukocytes (UCL), and human umbilical venous endothelial cells of 13 early-onset PE, 16 late-onset PE and 83 controls comprising 36 uncomplicated and 47 complicated pregnancies, i.e. 27 fetal growth restricted and 20 spontaneous preterm birth. To investigate the associations between PE and the epigenetics of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes in placental and newborn tissues, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip and a candidate-gene approach using ANCOVA was applied on 939 CpGs of 39 circadian clock and clock-controlled genes. DNA methylation significantly differed in early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (3.73E-5 ≤ p ≤ 0.016) and at 21 CpGs in UCL (1.09E-5≤ p ≤ 0.024). In early-onset PE compared with fetal growth restriction 2 CpGs in placental tissue (p < 0.05) and 8 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (4.78E-5≤ p ≤ 0.049) were significantly different. Moreover, significantly different DNA methylation in early-onset PE compared with uncomplicated controls was shown at 6 CpGs in placental tissue (1.36E-4≤ p ≤ 0.045) and 11 CpGs in uncomplicated controls (2.52E-6≤ p ≤ 0.009). No significant associations were shown with late-onset PE between study groups or tissues. The most differentially methylated CpGs showed hypomethylation in placental tissue and hypermethylation in uncomplicated controls. In conclusion, DNA methylation of circadian clock and clock-controlled genes demonstrated most differences in UCL of early-onset PE compared with spontaneous preterm birth. Implications of the tissue-specific variations in epigenetic programming for circadian performance and long-term health need further investigation.

N2  - Circadian preference toward eveningness has been associated with increased risk for mental health problems both in early adolescence and in adulthood. However, in late adolescence, when circadian rhythm naturally shifts to later, its significance for mental health is not clear. Accordingly, we studied how circadian rhythm estimated both by self-reported chronotype and by actigraph-defined midpoint of sleep was associated with self-reported psychiatric problems based on Youth Self Report (YSR). The study builds on a community cohort born in 1998, Helsinki, Finland. At age 17 years (mean age = 16.9, SD = 0.1 years), 183 adolescents (65.6% of the invited) participated in the study. We used the shortened version of the Horne-Östberg morningness-eveningness Questionnaire to define the chronotype, and actigraphs to define the naturally occur circadian rhythm over a 4 to 17 days' period (mean nights N = 8.3, SD = 1.8). The Achenbach software was used to obtain T-score values for YSR psychiatric problem scales. The analyses were adjusted for important covariates including gender, socioeconomic status, body mass index, pubertal maturation, mother's licorice consumption during pregnancy, and actigraph-defined sleep duration and quality. Eveningness was associated with higher scores in rule-breaking behavior and conduct problems (as assessed either by midpoint of sleep or by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), with affective problems (by midpoint of sleep and by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05) and somatic complaints (by self-reported chronotype, p-values <0.05), as compared to circadian tendency toward morningness. Our results suggest that the association between eveningness and externalizing problem behavior, present in children and younger adolescents, is also present in late adolescence when circadian rhythms shift toward evening.

N2  - Background: Synchronizing eating schedules to daily circadian rhythms may improve metabolic health, but its association with gestational glycemia is unknown. Objective: This study examined the association of maternal night-fasting intervals and eating episodes with blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study within a prospective cohort in Singapore. Maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose, and 2-h glucose concentrations were ascertained at 26-28 wk gestation for 1061 women (aged 30.7 6 5.1 y). Night-fasting intervals were based on the longest fasting duration during the night (1900-0659). Eating episodes were defined as events that provided > 50 kcal, with a time interval between eating episodes of ≥15 min. Multiple linear regressions with adjustment for confounders were conducted. Results: Mean 6 SD night-fasting intervals and eating episodes per day were 9.9 6 1.6 h and 4.2 6 1.3 times/d, respectively; fasting and 2-h glucose concentrations were 4.4 6 0.5 and 6.6 6 1.5 mmol/L, respectively. In adjusted models, each hourly increase in night-fasting intervals was associated with a 0.03 mmol/L decrease in fasting glucose (95% CI: 20.06, 20.01 mmol/L), whereas each additional daily eating episode was associated with a 0.15 mmol/L increase in 2-h glucose (95% CI: 0.03, 0.28 mmol/L). Conversely, night-fasting intervals and daily eating episodes were not associated with 2-h and fasting glucose, respectively. Conclusions: Increased maternal night-fasting intervals and reduced eating episodes per day were associated with decreased fasting glucose and 2-h glucose, respectively, in the late-second trimester of pregnancy. This points to potential alternative strategies to improve glycemic control in pregnant women. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

N2  - Background: Malaria is a major public health problem and life-threatening disease. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 400 children die every day and almost half of these deaths are attributable to malaria. Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under-5 in the DRC, accounting for an estimated 40% of outpatient visits and 40% of childhood mortality. Methods: The purpose of this study was to examine whether malarial control methods (i.e., insecticide bed net use and taking SP/fansidar or chloroquine) differed based on perceived problems preventing pregnant women from seeking medical advice or treatment (big problem, not a big problem), receipt of prenatal care (no, yes) and Source of prenatal care (e.g., doctor), and sociodemo-graphic characteristics. A secondary data analysis of pregnant women (n = 2, 404) who completed the Demographic and Health Survey in the DRC (DHS-DRC7) was conducted. Findings: Results indicated that use of a bed net, SP/fansidar, and chloroquine significantly differed among pregnant women based on educational attainment, ethnicity, and wealth index. Pregnant women who slept under a bed net were more likely to receive prenatal care (p =.002), including 1.95 times more likely (p =.002) to receive care from a doctor, than pregnant women who did not sleep under a mosquito net. Pregnant women who took SP/fansidar were more likely to perceive that distance to a health facility (p <.001) and not wanting to go alone (p =.009) were not big problems for getting medical help for themselves. Pregnant women who took SP/fansidar were more likely to receive care from a doctor (p =.01), nurse (p =.002) or birth attendant (p <.001). Pregnant women who took chloroquine while pregnant were 3.6 times more likely (p =.04) to receive care from a doctor. Interpretation: Awareness of malarial control methods is critical in shaping the necessary interventions and policies to control diseases and addressing this global health disparity. The study found several healthcare utilization factors related to malarial control methods among pregnant women in the DRC. Next steps include enhancement of education among pregnant women about malarial control methods and access to care.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare disease whose low incidence complicates the elucidation of clinical risk factors. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a well-described risk factor for heart failure, but has not previously been described in relation to PPCM. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for PPCM, including OSA, using a large, multi-institutional cohort. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis using a deidentified multi-institutional electronic health record database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, Ohio). Explorys collects standardized data from 360 hospitals in 26 healthcare systems. We excluded patients with any diagnostic codes for cardiac disease prior to the occurrence of pregnancy. Pregnant subjects from 1999 to 2016 with or without a subsequent diagnosis of PPCM within 180 days of delivery were identified. The association between clinical variables, including OSA, and the incidence of PPCM was evaluated via multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: 1,169,211 women met the study criteria. The incidence of PPCM in the total cohort was 0.14%. OSA and obesity were closely associated with one another, and thus only OSA was included in the final model to avoid multicolinearity. The results of the Poisson regression are presented in Table 1. OSA was associated with an increased risk of PPCM (IRR = 9.05, p <0.001). The association persisted in a subgroup that excluded patients with pre-eclampsia. CONCLUSION: Obstructive sleep apnea has a statistically significant and potentially clinically meaningful association with peripartum cardiomyopathy. The association has biologic plausibility and is also consistent with the association between OSA and cardiac disease in other contexts. (Table presented).

N2  - Introduction: Prenatal maternal depression has been linked with less optimal sleep development in children. In-utero exposure to selective reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) has also been found to alter sleep state, but no published studies have investigated this relationship past the newborn period. The study examined the differential effects of prenatal maternal depression and SRIs on sleep state development in children 18 to 36 months post-birth. Methods: 47 mothers and their children were categorized into three groups based on their psychiatric diagnoses and treatment during pregnancy: 1) No depression or SRI treatment (NoEXP, N=21); 2) Depression without SRI treatment (DEP, N=15); 3) SRI treatment for depression (SRI, N=11). Videosomnography and respiration recordings were collected on the children for two consecutive nights at 18 and 36-months post-birth. Recordings were manually scored by a trained rater who was blinded to group status for percentage of time in bed in wake, Non-REM, REM, and sleep-wake transitional states as well as sleep onset latency and number of behavioral arousals. Variables were calculated in the early (before midnight) and late (after midnight) sleep phases. Linear mixed models were used to examine the effects of prenatal group and assessment age on sleep variables. Results: Children in the DEP group had a lower percentage of non- REM sleep than those in the NoEXP group during the early phase (48% v. 59%, p<.04). The DEP group also had a higher percentage of REM sleep throughout both sleep phases (48%) compared to those in the SRI (40%, p<.006) and NoEXP (39%, p<.005) groups across assessment age. There were no significant group differences in the number of behavioral arousals, wake after sleep onset, or sleep onset latency. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that prenatal exposure to maternal depression rather than SRIs may alter sleep state development in young children by increasing REM and decreasing Non-REM, particularly in the early phase when Non-REM sleep is typically highest. These results will be discussed in the context of concurrent maternal depression severity, sleep quality, and reported child sleep behaviors.

N2  - Background and objectives: The literature shows that chronotype can influence food consumption and individuals with an evening chronotype may consume a lower quality of diet. However, this issue is an unexplored among pregnant women. In this sense, the focus of this study was to correlate chronotype with the quality of diet in pregnant women in the first trimester. Methods: We evaluated 100 pregnant women, with up to 12 gestational weeks, aged 18 to 40 years, attended at the public health service in Uberlandia city, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Properly trained nutritionists collected information about food consumption by means of three 24HR on non-consecutive days, including one day of the weekend, in order to better reflect the eating habits of the participants. The qualitative dietary assessment was performed using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index Revised (BHEI-R), from the following components and, or food groups: Total Fruits; Whole Fruits; Total Vegetables; Vegetables Dark Green and Orange Vegetables and Legume; Total Grains; Whole Grains; Milk and Dairy Products; Meat, Eggs and Beans; Oils; Saturated Fat; Sodium; and SoFAAS. Chronotype was derived from the time of mid sleep time on free days at the weekend (MSF), with a further correction for calculated sleep debt - calculated as the difference between average sleep duration at the weekends and weekdays correlation was used and p <0.05 with significant statistic. The data were analyzed using the SPSS.21.0. To evaluate correlations between variables, Spearman's correlation coefficients, adjusted for confounders were used. Correlations were considered weak if r <0.30, moderate if r was 0.30-0.70 and strong if r >0.70. Statistical tests with p < 0.05 were accepted as significant. Results: We found a significant correlation between the BHEI-R score for the total Fruit components (r=-0.239; p=0.017), Whole Fruits (r=-0.214; p=0.032) and Saturated Fat (r=-0.211; p=0.035) with chronotype. Conclusions: Our data suggest that pregnant women with an evening chronotype may be more likely to a diet with less fruit and higher saturated fat. Longitudinal studies should be developed to better understand this issue.

N2  - This study is done to evaluate the awareness of consuming caffeine among pregnant women.Caffeine crosses the placenta and reaches to the baby. Although the mother can be able to handle the amounts of caffeine taken but the baby cannot. The baby's metabolism is still maturing and cannot fully metabolize the caffeine. Any small amount of caffeine can also cause changes in baby's sleep pattern or normal movement pattern in the later stages of pregnancy. Remember, caffeine is a stimulant and can keep both mother and baby awake. This study is done with the help of questionnaire based survey.300 pregnant women participated in this survey and the questionnaire was circulated manually and through online. The data was clubbed and the final results were obtained by using the spss software version 9.0.Caffeine is a stimulant and a diuretic. Because caffeine is a stimulant, it increases the mother's blood pressure and heart rate, both of which are not recommended during pregnancy. Thus study aims to create awareness among pregnant women about consuming caffeine.Pregnant women were unaware about the side effects of consuming caffeine during pregnancy and so an awareness and full knowledge was provided to the women through this survey.

N2  - Introduction: Sleep difficulties are common among student-athletes. The availability of healthy sleep information on campuses is unknown, as is the level of interest for more information about sleep. Further, it is possible that personal sleep difficulties motivate interest in sleep. Methods: Data were collected as part of the 2011-2014 National College Health Assessment, conducted by the American College Health Association (N=8,618 student athletes). Participants were asked if they received information from on-campus sources about: sleep, alcohol/drugs, cold/flu, depression/anxiety, eating disorders, grief/loss, helping others, injury prevention, nutrition, exercise, birth control, excessive computer/internet use, relationships, sexual assault, sexually-transmitted disease/infection, stress, suicide, tobacco, and violence. They were also asked if they were interested in receiving more information on these topics. Prevalence of “sleep difficulties” that were “traumatic or difficult to handle” over the past 12 months was recorded. Results: Only 32.6% of respondents reported getting information about sleep. This was less frequent than all other domains except excessive computer/internet use (all p<0.0001). Yet, 52.0% of respondents reported that they were interested in more information about sleep. This was higher (p<0.0001) than the level of interest expressed for alcohol/drugs, cold/flu, depression/anxiety, eating disorders, grief/ loss, injury prevention, exercise, pregnancy, computer/internet use, relationships, sexual assault, sexually-transmitted disease/infection, suicide, tobacco, and violence. Access to information about sleep was not associated with difficulty sleeping. However, those who were interested in more information about sleep were more likely to have sleep difficulties (OR=2.63,95%CI[2.34,2.95], p<0.0001). Those that expressed interest but did not have access to information had a greater likelihood of sleep difficulties (OR=3.20,95%CI[2.76,3.70], p<0.0001) compared to those who had access to information (OR=1.7 6,95%CI[1.44,2.15],p<0.0001). Conclusion: Information about healthy sleep is accessible to <1/3 of student-athletes, less than nearly all other health concerns. However, the majority are interested in receiving more information about sleep (more than most other domains). Those who are interested are more likely to experience poor sleep themselves, especially if they also lack access to information. These findings highlight the need for more sleep health programs on campus.

N2  - Still birth is associated with profound adverse psychosocial outcome for families and care providers. Global burden of stillbirth is very high with an estimated 2.6 million still births at 28 weeks or more occurring every year with the rate of >1/200 births in high income areas. Studies have examined risk factors for still birth but they have been unable to explore a broad range of potential risk factors in particular those relating to maternal life style and personal habits e.g obesity is highly linked to sleep related disorders.Around 1/3 of a person's life is spent asleep but there has been little research on potential impact of sleep practices on developing foetus. We searched the English literature from January 2006 till February 2017 for all articles related to the title of review. Data sources were Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, PubMed, BMJ and WHO and UNICEF publications. Studies have concluded that foetal heart rate variability is affected by maternal position.These effects are most likely foetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic foetal stress. Literature shows no association between risk of still birth with snoring either before or during pregnancy. A high twofold rise in still birth risk has been shown with non-left sided sleeping position on the last night of pregnancy with sleeping on back shown the greatest risk.-Moreover a significant relationship has been found between sleeping regularly in daytime and late still birth risk. Getting up for toilet infrequently (once or less) has also been found significantly associated with late still birth risk. Given the results observed in these studies, it may be required from all health care providers to emphasize optimal sleeping practices especially in late pregnancy. Further Studies with prospectively collected data are required to confirm or refute these findings.

N2  - Objective: This research aimed to explore the curative effect of noninvasive ventilation in the treatment of children Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). Methods: From Nov 2015-2016, 70 children OSAS patients in Binzhou People’s Hospital were selected as the study subjects and were randomly divided into surgery group (n=35) and ventilation group (n=35). Patients in the surgery group were treated with routine operation while ventilation group were received non-invasive ventilation followed by the routine operation. The curative effects in the two groups were analyzed with statistical comparison method. Results: Total effective rate of the ventilation group was significantly higher than that of the surgery group, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of the ventilation group was lower than that of the surgery group and the longest time of apnea, apnea hypopnea index as well as Epworth Sleepiness Score(ESS) of the ventilation group was obviously lower than that of the surgery group (P<0.05), while abortion and ectopic pregnancy rate of the intervention group was strikingly lower than that of the control group significantly. Conclusion: Non-invasive ventilation has good effects in the treatment of children Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSHS).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Emerging data suggest that sleep is an important factor in pregnancy health. Certain conditions in pregnancy necessitate prolonged hospitalization, and little is known about how this practice affects sleep patterns. The objective of this prospective observational cohort study was to characterize sleep patterns in pregnant women subjected to prolonged hospitalization. STUDY DESIGN: Women hospitalized on our antepartum unit were recruited to wear an actigraph and complete a sleep log for 7 consecutive days. They also completed a sleep survey at the end of the study period. Actigraphy studies were scored to determine the rest and sleep intervals, sleep onset latency, and wake time after sleep onset. Only participants with 5 or more nights of recorded antepartum sleep were included in the analysis. All nights that involved a transfer out of the unit for clinical care were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: Of 33 recruited participants, 22 had ≥ 5 nights of data for a total of 139 nights of antepartum sleep data. The mean gestational age was 30 weeks (range 25-34). The most common reason for hospitalization was PPROM (40.1%), followed by preeclampsia (27.3%), placental abnormalities (18.2%), and preterm labor (13.6%). The median sleep duration was 7.0 hours (IQR 2.1 hours). 54.5% of women had an average sleep duration of less than 7 hours/ night. 29.5% of study nights had a bedtime between midnight and 5 am. 8.6% of study nights had a sleep onset latency of over 1 hour, and 23% had wake times after sleep onset of over 1 hour. Going to bed between midnight and 5 am was significantly associated with sleep durations of less than 7 hours (73.2% vs. 37.8%, p <.001). Subjective sleep data are presented (Table). Participants reported awakening, on average, 2.4 times per night as a result of hospitalrelated events. Only 14% of participants were satisfied with their hospital sleep overall and 52% of participants said that their sleep was much worse than their sleep at home. CONCLUSION: Prolonged hospitalization on an antepartum unit has a negative impact on sleep duration and quality. Sleep is an important factor for overall physical, mental and emotional health, and future work should try to address how to improve sleep for this vulnerable population of pregnant women. (Table Presented).

N2  - The authors have discovered an error which impacts on the results of the above published study. The study used linked population data in the form of hospital and birth records to compare birth outcomes for pregnant women with and without sleep apnea. The authors discovered a typographical error in the programming code used to select the relevant hospital records for analysis. This had the impact of including excess records and inflating the number of pregnant women with sleep apnea. On correcting the error, the authors found that although the absolute numbers have changed, the main findings and interpretation remain the same. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused. A PDF of the original paper marked up with the corrections is available from the What follows are the corrected portions of the manuscript.

N2  - Introduction: Hysterectomy is the most frequent non-pregnancy-related major surgery in reproductive-aged women. Proper pain management represents a critical peri-operative goal. Although the association of chronic pain and sleep disorders is well known, the relation between perioperative pain and sleep is less studied. This study tested the hypothesis pre-operative sleep patterns would predict post-hysterectomy pain perception. Methods: A prospective cohort study of women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions. Measures included: PROMIS-PI 3a (pain intensity), total sleep time measured by wrist actigraphy and daily sleep diary, and time awake after sleep onset measured by actigraphy and sleep diary. Sleep diary and actigraphy sleep variables were averaged over 7 nights preceding and 7 nights following hysterectomy. Results: Sixteen women (41 ± 7.3 years old) participated in the study. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant increases from pre- to post-hysterectomy in actigraphy total sleep time (402 ± 43.7 vs. 481 ± 85.8 min, p=.023), and diary time awake after sleep onset (28 ± 11.4 vs. 58 ± 17.7 min, p=.014). Pre-hysterectomy diary total sleep time was negatively correlated with post-hysterectomy pain intensity (r= -.92, p=.01). Pre-hysterectomy actigraphy time awake after sleep onset was positively correlated with post-hysterectomy pain intensity (r=.86, p=.008). Conclusion: Findings indicated that sleep duration and disturbance increased following hysterectomy. Shorter sleep duration and more disturbed sleep before hysterectomy were associated with greater perceived pain intensity following hysterectomy. These findings suggest that pre-operative sleep interventions could improve pain perception and recovery following hysterectomy.

N2  - Executive function deficits are among the most frequent sequela of very preterm birth but the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. We used high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during sleep to assess alterations in the functional neuroanatomy of executive processes in adolescents born very preterm. The topographical distribution of sleep slow wave activity (SWA; 1–4.5 Hz EEG power) has previously been used to map cognitive abilities and is known to reflect the intensity of the prior use of the respective neuronal networks. We assessed 38 adolescents born before 32 weeks of gestation [age at assessment: 12.9 (SD: 1.7), range: 10.6–16.7 years] and 43 term-born peers [13.1 (2.0), 10.0–16.9]. Executive function abilities were quantified with a composite score derived from a comprehensive task battery. All-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) was recorded and SWA of the first hour of sleep was calculated. Abilities were significantly poorer in the very preterm compared to the term-group, particularly, if the tasks demands were high (p < .01). The score was positively correlated with sleep SWA in a cluster of 15 electrodes over frontal and negatively in a cluster of 14 electrodes over central brain regions after controlling for age at assessment and correcting for multiple comparisons. Within the frontal cluster, sleep SWA was higher in very preterm compared to term-born participants when controlling for executive function performance and age at assessment (p = .02). No difference in SWA between very preterm and term-born participants was found for the central cluster (p = .29). Our results demonstrate a local increase of sleep SWA over brain regions associated with executive processes in adolescents born very preterm compared to similarly performing term-born peers. Thus, sleep SWA seems to map the higher effort needed for executive function tasks in adolescents born very preterm.
