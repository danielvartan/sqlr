N2  - The health of future generations, both physical and psychological, depends upon good parental and early environment, free particularly from malnutrition, toxins and undue stress. Education about these negative influences is urgent, especially to encourage childbearing women in a healthy diet and lifestyle. The detrimental effects of cigarette smoking in pregnancy have been known since the 1970s, yet in Germany, for example, 60% of all children are conceived, carried, born into a household where at least one adult smokes. Even if the father desists from smoking at home, the nicotine in his body tissues is transmitted to anyone near him, for example his wife when they sleep near each other. More than one glass of beer, wine or spirits per week during the pregnancy can be detected at birth. Alcohol in early in the pregnancy - just when many mothers are unaware they are pregnant - can produce significant physical malformation, especially in the face. Prenatal exposure to alcohol has significant effects on the intelligence and behaviour of the child. Many of these children are very restless. Even slight amounts of poisoning during the pregnancy are related to the development of a negative self-image and the compensatory behaviour of the Narcissistic Personality Disorder in later life. The Prenatal Deprivation and Poisoning Syndromes have not only been related to heart disease and eating disorders in the area of general health but also in the area of psychological health to the Borderline Personality Disorder. Undue stress of any kind during the pregnancy leads to problems for the developing child. © 2007 A B Academic Publishers.

N2  - Objective: To examine the extent to which maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits are associated with obesity and overweight in 5-year-old Japanese children. Research Method and Procedures: We studied 1417 mother-child pairs enrolled in Project Enzan - a prospective cohort study. The dependent variables, childhood overweight and obesity, were defined with an international cut-off value. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits were used as independent variables. Results: Maternal smoking habits were associated with overweight in the 5-year-old children [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 4.11]. Maternal sleep duration of ≥8 h/d negatively affected childhood overweight (adjusted OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.04). Children whose mothers skipped breakfast were likely to become overweight (adjusted OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.77). The results of childhood obesity analysis were similar to those of childhood overweight analysis. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that there are effects of smoking during early pregnancy and other maternal lifestyle habits on the onset of childhood obesity in Japan. Therefore, interventions in maternal lifestyle habits are required to prevent childhood obesity, and these interventions should be initiated before pregnancy. Copyright © 2007 NAASO.

N2  - The European Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group (EURLSSG) is an association of European RLS experts who are actively involved in RLS research. A major aim of the Study Group is the development and continuous improvement of standards for diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Several members developed study designs and evaluation methods in investigator-initiated trials early in the 1990s, and all members have since contributed to many pivotal and nonpivotal drug trials for the treatment of RLS. The recommendations on clinical investigations of pharmacological treatment of RLS patients summarize the group's expertise and knowledge acquired through clinical trials. The recommendations primarily address how to plan and conduct confirmatory, randomized clinical studies in patients with idiopathic RLS. Advice is presented for the diagnosis of RLS and clinical and polysomnographic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary and secondary endpoints for an evaluation of efficacy are based on a critical description of validated methods for both short- and long-term trials, also in special populations (children, pregnant women, elderly patients). The recommendations include the assessment of augmentation. Finally, general issues including the evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as specific neurological and cardiovascular risks and sleep attacks/daytime somnolence, are discussed. The aim of these recommendations is to support research groups or pharmaceutical companies in the design of optimized study protocols. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

N2  - The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, including drug- and electroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major chronotherapeutic inventions-light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain long-term improvement. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are still widely practiced. However, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use. Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in people with insomnia. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED (the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), TCMLARS (Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database, the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, from inception to 2006, and the sleep bibliography, which is available at www.websciences.org/ bibliosleep. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving participants of any age with any type of insomnia were included. Included trials compared acupuncture with placebo or sham or no treatment, or acupuncture plus other treatments compared with the same other treatments. Trials that compared only acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone against other treatments alone were excluded, since they did not yield the net effect of acupuncture. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality according to a set of criteria for risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Relative risk (RR) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were used for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Data were combined in meta-analyses (on an intention-to-treat basis), where more than one trial without significant clinical heterogeneity presented the same outcome. Main results: Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 590 participants with insomnia, of whom 56 dropped out. Participant age ranged from 15 to 98 years, and the duration of insomnia varied from 6 months to 19 years. Co-existing medical conditions contributing to insomnia included stroke, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Apart from conventional needle acupuncture, different variants of acupuncture such as acupressure, auricular magnetic and seed therapy, and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) were evaluated. Meta-analysis was limited because of considerable heterogeneity between comparison groups and between outcome measures. Based on the findings from individual trials, the review suggested that acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve sleep quality scores when compared to placebo (SMD = -1.08, 95% CI = -1.86 to -0.31, p=0.006) or no treatment (SMD-0.55, 95%CI = -0.89 to - 0.21, p=0.002). TEAS also resulted in better sleep quality score in one trial (SMD= -0.74, 95%CI = -1.22 to -0.26, p=0.003). However, the efficacy of acupuncture or its variants was inconsistent between studies for many sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency, total sleep duration and wake after sleep onset. The combined result from three studies reporting subjective insomnia improvement showed that acupuncture or its variants was not more significantly effective than control (RR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.68 to -4.03) and significant statistical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study reported an adverse event, with one out of 16 patients (6.3%) withdrawing from acupuncture because of pain. Authors' conclusions: The small number of randomised controlled trials, together with the poor methodological quality and significant clinical heterogeneity, means that the current evidence is not sufficiently extensive or rigorous to support the use of any form of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. Larger high quality clinical trials employing appropriate randomisation concealment and blinding with longer follow-up are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.

N2  - Patients who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) present with infertility, recurrent miscarriages, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and acne. Many also have metabolic and hormonal abnormalities that can significantly increase risk for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and endometrial carcinoma. PCOS patients should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea. Early recognition may reverse physical signs of the disease, while correcting the metabolic abnormalities that can pose significant health risk if untreated. Although lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy are used to treat PCOS, there are few long-term outcome data regarding benefits of metabolic interventional strategies. Insulin sensitizers can improve ovulatory function, lower insulin resistance, lower androgen levels, and increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Further studies should yield other treatment options. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Any plans for pregnancy must be discussed in detail with women with bipolar disorders. They must be informed about the risks related to it and the need for some precautions. Because of the risk of relapse during pregnancy, the risk/benefit ratio of maintaining or starting prophylactic treatment should be assessed, taking into account family history and frequency of recurrences. Lithium may be used during pregnancy under close monitoring. Most anticonvulsants are contraindicated because of their teratogenicity. During the post-partum period, prophylaxis is required in most cases because of the high risk of relapse. If no prophylaxis was given during pregnancy, it must be started quickly after delivery to be effective when the risk is at its highest, i.e., during the first two weeks after delivery. Women with bipolar disorders should be advised against breast-feeding to avoid exposure of the infant to psychotropic medication. Because breast-feeding can be stressful and causes sleep deprivation, it may increase the risk of relapse. Second-generation antipsychotic agents should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding because inadequate information is currently available about their safety. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2007.

N2  - About 7% of the population are affected by the restless legs syndrome (RLS). The most invalidating subjective complaints are dysesthesia / pain / an urge to move the legs (46%), an alteration of sleep (38%), and difficulties in performing activities of daily life (7%). The onset of the disease is variable, ranging from childhood (often unrecognised) to old age. The clinical course is generally chronic with phases of spontaneous remission. The cause of RLS is probably mainly genetic with a dysfunction of iron and dopamine metabolism accentuated by peripheral factors (neuropathy, radiculopathy, and temperature). There are secondary forms of RLS, such as iron deficiency (under debate), side effects of drugs (that can be stopped), renal insufficiency, radiculopathy, and neuropathy. RLS can come up during pregnancy, in particular in the last trimenon. Treatment of aggravating factors and sleep hygiene are general measures. Drug treatment of the RLS comprises levodopa, dopaminergic drugs, opioids, and antiepileptic drugs; however, drug treatment is only necessary in about a third of the affected.

N2  - Objectives: To monitor preterm infants in a cot and a car seat and compare an observed car seat trial with polysomnography (PSG). Design: Non-randomised controlled trial. Setting: Regional neonatal unit. Patients: Preterm infants before discharge. Interventions: Nap PSG respiratory ana sleep variables were measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate. Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of the PSG and observed tests were predefined. Main outcome measures: Difference in respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG. Results: 20 infants (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and arousals in the cot than the car seat (p = 0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively). Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG. Conclusions: Immature infants exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.

N2  - Background: The medical students' knowledge about basic medical neuroscience in the preclinical level may be fragmented and incomplete. Objective: Evaluate the knowledge of students prior to a lecture on epilepsy in clinical level. Material and Method: One hundred ten fourth-year medical students' knowledge was accessed by a self-administered questionnaire. Results: The presented results revealed that 91.8% of respondents knew that epilepsy arose from a transient dysfunction in the brain. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs) were the most common type (91.5%) they knew and absence seizures were the least common type (33.6%) they knew. All of them knew that eating pork and punishment of gods did not cause epilepsy. However, 50% thought that genetics was a cause and 80.3% did not know that stroke and sleep deprivation (92.7%) cause epilepsy. About treatment and prognosis, only 28.2% of respondents thought epilepsy can be cured and patients should take antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure free 2-5 years (48.2%), life long (33.6%). They knew that the patients should be prohibited from driving (80%), working on machinery (74.5%), and (27.3%) avoid drinking. However, they knew that the patients could marry (100%), get pregnant (98.2%), and lactate (91.9%). Regarding the first aid management, 50.9% of them recommended that placing a piece of wood between the teeth during a seizure and perform chest compressions (20.0%). Means knowledge scores is about 60%, the highest score is the definition of epilepsy (90.2%) and the lowest is type of seizure (43%). Conclusion: The findings indicated that lecturers should review aspects of pathophysiology and emphasize on type of seizure, cause, consequences, and prognosis including first-aid management.

N2  - Mosquito net ownership is rising in sub-Saharan Africa but will substantially reduce malaria only if nets are used and the most vulnerable household members sleep under them. We used data from 9 large-scale household surveys conducted in 6 African countries from 2000 to 2004 that enumerated all household members and nets owned, analyzing only net-owning households. Across countries, women of reproductive age and children under 5 (without gender bias) were most likely to use the net; least likely were children of age 5-14 and adult males. Nets commonly covered 2-3 people. If a baby net was used, fewer people used the family net. Pregnant women were more likely to use a net in 2004 than in 2000. In several countries, a sizable minority of nets owned were not used. Understanding intra-household net-use patterns helps malaria control programs more effectively direct their efforts to increase their public health impact.

N2  - OBJECTIVE. We investigated whether very low birth weight (<1500 g) is associated with the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in young adulthood. METHODS. The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5-27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring. RESULTS. The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing. CONCLUSIONS. Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold. Copyright © 2007 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

N2  - Introduction: We studied whether maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy adversely influence lung growth and development of the offspring, resulting in poor early life lung function. Methods: Infants were participants of the Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER). Lung function measurements (single occlusion technique) were performed during natural sleep. Questionnaire data were used to obtain information on maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy. Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and resistance and compliance of the respiratory system, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results: Lower values of compliance (Crs) were found in infants of mothers with respiratory infections during pregnancy; Crs fell by 5.5% (P = 0.031). The difference in Crs between infants of mothers with and without respiratory infections during pregnancy remained unchanged and statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables. The more respiratory infections the mother experienced during pregnancy, the lower the value of Crs was in her offspring (P for trend = 0.016). Using Crs corrected for body weight the relationship with maternal infections was non-significant, however still showing a trend. Conclusions: The results of this study may indicate that mothers who experience respiratory infections during pregnancy have newborns with lower compliance of the respiratory system. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Pregnant women experience disturbed sleep that varies throughout the gestational period. In clinical studies of nonpregnant cohorts, data link disturbed sleep with increases in inflammatory markers. Emerging evidence has also found associations between increased inflammation and medical morbidity, including various pregnancy complications. The authors have previously shown a correlation between sleep disturbances and serum cytokine levels. They extend this initial observation by evaluating the relationship between sleep during mid and late pregnancy and inflammatory cytokines in both serum and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subjective sleep during pregnancy, described by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and sleep diaries, and circulating and stimulated measures of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were evaluated in 19 pregnant women. The authors found that greater sleep complaints in late pregnancy were associated with both increased circulating and stimulated IL-6 levels. Short sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency in both mid and late pregnancy were associated with higher stimulated levels of IL-6. No relationships were observed for TNF-α. These preliminary findings indicate that women who experience sleep disturbances as early as mid gestation are likely to have an increase in inflammation. © 2007 by the Society for Gynecologic Investigation.

N2  - Study Objective: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by passive smoking. In this study we investigated the effects of passive smoking on sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Design: Two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys conducted in 2002 and 2006. Setting: Clinical institutions specializing in obstetrics and gynecology that participated in the nationwide surveys: 260 in the 2002 survey and 344 in the 2006 survey. Participants: 16,396 and 19,386 pregnant women in Japan surveyed in 2002 and 2006, respectively. Intervention: N/A. Measurements and Results: Pregnant women exposed to passive smoking were likely to have sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably. Smoking pregnant women had the same sleep disturbances and also experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and early morning awakening. The prevalence of 5 types of sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably) among nonsmokers with environmental tobacco smoke showed a mean value intermediate between that of active smokers and that of non-smokers without environmental tobacco smoke. Conclusion: Passive smoking is independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy.

N2  - Study objectives: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion). Design: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures. Setting: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone. Participants: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 ± 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 ± 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 ± 6.34 years). Interventions: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors. Measurements and Results: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors. Conclusion: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

N2  - Circadian rhythmicity is a fundamental characteristic of organisms, which helps ensure that vital functions occur in an appropriate and precise temporal sequence and in accordance with cyclic environmental changes. Living beings are endowed with a system of biological clocks that measure time on a 24-hr basis, termed the circadian timing system. In mammals, the system is organized as a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, commanding peripheral clocks located in almost every tissue of the body. At the cell level, interlocking transcription/translation feedback loops of the genes Bmal-1, Clock, Per1-2, and Cry1-2, named clock genes, and their protein products results in circadian oscillation of clock genes and of genes involved in almost every cellular function. During gestation, the conceptus follows a complex and dynamic program by which it is simultaneously fit to develop and live in a circadian environment provided by its mother and to prepare for the very different environment that it will experience after birth. It has been known for a number of years that the mother tells the fetus the time of day and season of the year, and that the fetus uses this information to set the phase of fetal and neonatal circadian rhythms. There is evidence that the maternal rhythm of melatonin is one of the time signals to the fetus. In the last few years, the study of the development of the circadian system has turned to the investigation of the oscillatory expression of clock genes and their possible role in development, and to answering questions on the organization of the fetal circadian system. Emerging evidence shows that clock genes are expressed in the oocyte and during early and late development in embryo/fetal organs in the rat and in a fetal primate. The data available raise the intriguing possibility that the fetal SCN and fetal tissues may be peripheral clocks commanded by separate maternal signals. The rapid methodological and conceptual advances on chronobiology may help to unravel how the developing embryo and fetus faces time in this plastic period of life. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and REM sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, with the greatest decrease occurring at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 150 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, three times per day, from day E14 until parturition, and the pups allowed to mature. We analyzed (a) intrinsic membrane properties of PPN neurons in slices from pups aged 12-21 days, and (b) the sleep state-dependent P13 auditory evoked potential, which is generated by PPN outputs, in animals allowed to age to adolescence. We found significant changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of PPN cells in prenatally exposed animals compared to intact ones, rendering these cells more excitable. In addition, we found disturbances in the habituation to repetitive stimulation in adolescent, freely moving animals, suggestive of a deficit in the process of sensory gating. These findings could explain some of the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to describe the effects of acupuncture under real life conditions, in the treatment of emotional complaints during pregnancy. Methods: A group of 51 conventionally treated pregnant women (with counselling by their physicians and nurses) was allocated by chance into two groups to be either treated or not by acupuncture. Both groups (28 in the study group and 23 in the control group) presented emotional complaints such as anxiety, depression and irritability. They reported the severity of symptoms using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10; and they rated how much the symptoms disturbed five aspects of their lives: mood, sleep, relationships, social activities, sexual life and joy of living. Traditional acupuncture was used. In order to facilitate protocols we used pre-programmed points. Up to four points were permitted as optional points. Results: Three women from the acupuncture group and four from the control group dropped out of the study. Over the study period, the NRS scores of intensity of emotional distress decreased by at least half in 15/25 (60%) of patients in the study group and in 5/19 (26%) of those in the control group (P=0.013). The impact of the distress on three out of the five aspects of life was significantly less in the acupuncture group when compared with the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Emotional complaints are very common in pregnancy and medication is always a risk. In this study, acupuncture seems to be an efficacious means of reducing symptoms and improving the quality of life of women with emotional complaints during pregnancy. Large randomised studies are recommended to confirm these results.

N2  - Polycystic ovaries syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common female hormonal disorders. Its multiple components - reproductive, metabolic, neoplasic and cardiovascular - have a major impact on the public health. Androgen excess and resistance to insulin, probably from genetic origin, are responsible for most of the clinical symptomatology. Resistance to insulin seems to be accompanied by a greater risk of glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes, lipidic anomalies and can involve the development of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, sleep apnea syndrome is more progressively described in PCOS. Infertility, menses disorders and hirsutism often push these patients to consult their physician. A better understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms led to the emergence of new therapeutic options increasing the sensitivity to insulin. Besides the pregnancy wishes, cares aim to attenuate the marks of the hyper-androgenism (hormonal treatment and cosmetic) and to correct cardiovascular, respiratory and gynaecological risk factors. In case of infertility by anovulation, cares must be performed by trained experts to minimize the risk of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome and multiple pregnancies. A gradation from loose weight to clomiphene citrate ovulation induction, ovarian drilling, low dose gonadotropin, in vitro fertilisation, or in vitro maturation of oocytes should bring back good reproduction potential. © 2007.

N2  - Richter fully appreciated the fundamental biological importance of sex differences, in particular the challenges of female reproductive function to the two classes of behavior that most engaged him, endogenous rhythms and "self-regulatory" behaviors. Indeed, his contributions in these areas justify honoring him as one of the founders of behavioral neuroendocrinology. During the 1920s Richter, together with Wang, Kinder and other students, performed elegant phenomenological and mechanistic studies of sex differences in rats' spontaneous locomotor activity, nest building, and food intake. All of these behaviors display rhythms entrained to the ovarian cycle in female rats, and Richter's analyses of them formed the bases of many current areas of behavioral neuroscience. Slightly later, Richter made fundamentally important discoveries related to nutrient self-selection in pregnant and lactating rats, including changes in micronutrient and macronutrient selection. These data played a major role in the development of his concept of behavioral regulation of homeostasis. Unfortunately, some of these discoveries are rarely recalled. This is both historically regrettable and potentially an impediment to contemporary research progress. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a distressing urge to move the legs and sometimes other parts of the body. Diagnosis is based on clinical features that may be easily remembered with the mnemonic URGE: Urge to move, Rest induced, Gets better with activity, and Evening and night accentuation. RLS is common, Its prevalence increases with age, and women are more frequently affected. The course is chronic with often severe sleep disruption, including periodic leg movements. Differential diagnosis Includes disorders of restlessness and leg discomfort. Primary RLS is familial and likely to be genetic. Important causes of secondary RLS are end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. Every patient should be checked for iron status with a serum ferritin measurement.

N2  - Background: Fetal behavioral states are important indicators of fetal physiology and pathology associated to typical fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. Aim: To provide linear and nonlinear analysis of FHR patterns associated with fetal behavioral states regarding a better understanding of these states and patterns. Study design and subjects: Fifty FHR tracings from normal term pregnancies with a median duration of 40.3 min were acquired with the SisPorto® 2.01 system for computerized analysis of cardiotocograms. Each tracing was divided into consecutive 10-minute segments and each segment was classified by two experts as pattern A, B, C or D. Outcome measures: Linear and nonlinear indices were computed in each segment, namely mean FHR, long-term irregularity index (LTI), very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency spectral indices, approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). Kappa statistic (κ) and proportions of agreement (Pa) were used for assessment of inter-observer agreement. Bootstrap percentile confidence intervals and nonparametric statistical tests were calculated for statistical inference. Results: Overall agreement between experts in pattern classification was good to excellent with values for κ and Pa of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.64-0.94) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96), respectively. Most linear domain indices increased significantly with rising fetal activity whereas the opposite occurred with nonlinear indices, except for SampEn(2, 0.1). LF/(MF + HF) ratio also significantly increased with fetal activity, denoting an increased sympatho-vagal balance. Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that entropy and linear variability indices measure different FHR features. FHR patterns associated with active sleep (B) and active wakefulness (D) evidenced more signs of autonomous nervous system activity, with sympatho-vagal imbalance, and less signs related to complexity or irregularity control systems than patterns associated with calm sleep (A) and calm wakefulness (C). © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Activity during pregnancy has health implications for mother and child. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to examine changes in activity levels during pregnancy; the influence of socioeconomic factors and well-being on activity, and the influence of activity on maternal anthropometric measures and birth outcome. Twenty-four hour activity diaries were collected for 3 d in months 4 and 7 of pregnancy in 197 volunteers. Anthropometric measures and questionnaires to determine personal details were collected at these times and 2 months post-partum. Health records were used to supply infant measures. The time spent on each activity category was calculated, and used to calculate overall daily metabolic equivalents (METs). Low socioeconomic (SES) group 24 h activity levels were significantly higher than for high SES or welfare groups (p = 0.013). Activity declined throughout pregnancy in all groups (p = 0.002). Women with children had higher 24 h activity, spending 41% more time walking and (or) on housework than nulliparous women (p = 0.013). Reduced well-being was associated with lower levels of activity. Sleep and lying down time influenced 2 month post-partum body mass (upper quartile gained 2.54 kg, lower quartile lost 0.24 kg, p ≤ 0.001). Mean infant gestational age increased with increasing 24 h activity (p = 0.047). No infants were born prematurely to mothers who spent more than 190 min/d walking or doing housework activities in month 4. Probability of infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) declined with time spent walking or doing housework in month 4 (p = 0.007). Mean (SE) birth weight was 3883 (±165) g in the 10% of women spending less than 530 min sleeping or lying down per day, compared with 3413 (±104) g in the 10% of women spending 725 min or more sleeping or lying down. Socioeconomic factors were therefore important influences on activity levels during pregnancy. Inactivity, especially in early pregnancy, was associated with more maternal weight retention at 2 months post-partum and a greater probability of admission to NICU and premature delivery. © 2007 NRC.

N2  - Insomnia is a common sleep disorder with devastating socioeconomic consequences. Even though there are pharmacological and behavioral treatments for insomnia, most of the patients are treated with medications. However, the long-term use of medications to treat insomnia is questioned and has potential side effects. More and more Americans are seeking complementary/alternative treatments for many conditions including insomnia and there are anecdotal reports/case series of use of acupuncture in treating insomnia. To examine critically the role of acupuncture in treatment of insomnia, we performed a systematic review of published literature. Among the selected studies for review many were clinical case series and few open or randomized clinical trails. Even though several of these studies did not clarify the nature of insomnia (primary vs. secondary), it seemed that many of the subjects enrolled in these studies had co-morbid other psychiatric (depression or anxiety disorders) and/or medical conditions (Hemodialysis, Stroke, Pregnancy). Except for few, several of these studies had methodological limitations. Despite the limitations of the reviewed studies, all of them consistently indicate significant improvement in insomnia with acupuncture. Further methodologically strong, randomized controlled studies with large sample size are needed to assess the usefulness of acupuncture in treatment of insomnia and explore the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of acupuncture on sleep and sleep disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background. Snoring is common in pregnancy, but there are only a few studies that have investigated the relationship of snoring and pregnancy complications. We aimed to investigate the relationship of snoring and witnessed sleep apnoeas with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Methods. A questionnaire was administered on the day of delivery to 456 women at the Department of Obstetrics, Hospital Donación F. Santojanni, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pregnancy complications and blood pressure measurements were recorded from each woman's medical chart. Results. Some 156 (35%) of 447 women with singleton pregnancies who answered the questionnaire, snored at some time during their pregnancy. Snoring was related to pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia combined, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.16-2.84; p <0.01), independent of body mass index before pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy, neck circumference, smoking, alcohol and age. Witnessed sleep apnoeas were also related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease, with an adjusted odds ratio of 8.00 (95% CI: 2.71-23.55; p <0.001). Daytime sleepiness was more prevalent in snoring women. Conclusions. Snoring and witnessed sleep apnoeas are independently related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to describe the association between the regularity of sleep patterns for first-time Japanese mothers in the early postpartum period and the sleep and wake activity of their infants and partners. Longitudinal time-series studies of 101 healthy Japanese childbearing couples were conducted between May 2002 and January 2003. Data were obtained from couples at 32-6weeks pregnancy and 4-5weeks after birth. The questionnaire packet for each father and mother included a demographic questionnaire, a sleep-wake log for 7 days, a social rhythm metric for 7 days and a morningness-eveningness questionnaire. A four-stage hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed in which the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength was the dependent variable. The variance in postpartum sleep-wake rhythm strength for first-time mothers was explained by three predictor variables. Household income, the mother's chronotype during pregnancy and the father's daily social rhythm at 4-5weeks after birth made unique contributions to the variance (24.7%) in the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5weeks postpartum. A mother's own tendency to be a morning or evening chronotype and the regularity of the father's daily schedule of activities appear to influence first-time mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength during early postpartum recovery more than disruptions from the infant's sleep-wake activity itself. Health-care providers should counsel couples on how factors associated with the parents themselves may impact on the regularity of a mother's sleep patterns. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

N2  - Background: Experimental animal data link prenatal stress with sleep disturbance in offspring, but the link in humans is unclear. Aims: To investigate the link between prenatal maternal anxiety and depression and infant sleep disturbance from 6 to 30 months of age. Study design: Longitudinal prospective study of a large birth cohort from pregnancy to 30 months. Questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression were completed by mothers at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks and 8 months postpartum. Subjects: The ALSPAC cohort, a prospective community study of women in the UK who have been followed since pregnancy. Outcome measures: Measures of total sleep time, number of awakenings, and broadly defined sleep problems were available on children at ages 6, 18, and 30 months. Results: Reliable measures of total sleep time, nighttime awakenings, and sleep problems were identified at 6, 18, and 30 months. Higher levels of prenatal maternal anxiety and depression predicted more sleep problems at 18 and 30 months, after controlling for postnatal mood and obstetric and psychosocial covariates; the association was not restricted to clinical extremes. No link with total sleep time was observed. Conclusions: Mood disturbance in pregnancy has persisting effects on sleep problems in the child, a finding that is consistent with experimental animal research. The findings add to a growing literature showing that maternal prenatal stress, anxiety, and depression may have lasting effects on child development. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective.: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Method.: Five hundred institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior. Results.: Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% CI 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank. Conclusion.: Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The presence of underlying respiratory disease in the pregnant woman may implicate complications for the mother and the foetus which are potentially fatal. Pregnancy may also alter the course of the disease, making it fundamental to recognise and prevent its progression. It is important to know the respiratory physiology during pregnancy, in order to better preview the behaviour of these illnesses. In this article, a review of the current literature was performed on some the respiratory diseases that affect the pregnant woman, but are not specifically caused by it. Among these, asthma is one of the most important, given its frequency and the possibility to obtain good control and prevent complications. The frequent undermedication of these patients is one of the main causes of exacerbation and complications; it is therefore necessary to know the safety profile and current indications for the medications used in its treatment. Thromboembolic disease is another very frequent cause of morbidity and mortality, and its diagnosis implicates a major challenge, needing a very high suspicion. Diagnostic exams, namely radiological, are not to be postponed, and the radiation dose used is safe for the foetus. Other less frequent problems are also reviewed, which also have a great impact on the pregnancy: pneumothorax, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and sleep disturbances. Finally, pregnancy in the transplant recipient is also reviewed. In conclusion, the multidisciplinary approach of these patients must be emphasized. The accurate diagnosis and control of the underlying respiratory disease may avoid most of the complications affecting mother and foetus.

N2  - In the present study, we administered two low protein diets (LPDs) to rats during pregnancy and lactation and determined their effect on the ontogeny of select hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in their offspring. The L93 and LM76 LPDs were derived from the American Society of Nutrition recommended AIN93G and a modified version of the AIN76A purified control diets, respectively. The LPDs contained 8% crude protein in the form of casein, whereas the purified control diets contained 19% casein. A regular cereal-based diet (NP) was also included, and, therefore, a total of five groups were tested. Pups in all five groups were weaned onto a regular NP diet on postnatal day 28. Perinatal LPD altered the activities of a number of P450 isoforms in 28-day-old male and female offspring. However, nutritional rehabilitation abolished most of these changes as evidenced by lack of differences between the five groups in the activities of P450 isoforms in either 65- or 150-day-old offspring. Interestingly, 58-day-old female offspring in the LM76 group but not those in the L93 group exhibited shorter hexobarbital sleep time than the purified control group. However, hexobarbital hydroxylase activity and the amount of CYP2C12 protein, an important P450 isoform involved in hexobarbital metabolism in females, were unchanged. This suggests that the decrease in hexobarbital sleep time in this group is not due to an increase in the activity of hexobarbital-metabolizing enzymes. In summary, perinatal LPDs produced transient alterations in activities of select hepatic P450s and resulted in a gender- and diet-dependent long-term alteration in hexobarbital pharmacodynamics.

N2  - Objective - The scope of this study is to detect whether or not the entropy (E) circadian rhythm (CR) is maintained preserved in sinusal R-R intervals (SRRI), its loss being the expression of a transition to an indeterministic chaos in heart rate variability (HRV). Methods - The E of SRRI was estimated in 14 type I diabetic pregnant women (DPW) in the first trimester of an apparently uncomplicated gestation (7 patients - mean age = 30.3 ± 4.1 y - without clinical and laboratory evidence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy, and 7 patients - mean age = 30.7 ± 3.6 y - with positive tests for a cardiac dysautonomia). The E CR was studied via the single cosinor method, and summarized via the population-mean cosinor method. Results - The E CR was found not to be preserved in both the investigated type I DPW, despite the occurrence of the SRRI CR. Conclusions - The loss of the E CR confirms that in type I DPW there is a transition to an indeterministic disorder in HRV due to the lack of an autocorrelated periodic chaos in cardiac pacing. Such an unphysiological neurovegetative regulation suggests a new silent cardiac dysautonomic syndrome, that we intend to call "minimum delirium cordis syndrome" (MDCS). Can the MDCS be regarded as a condition of cardiovascular risk? To answer this question, it seems justified to suggest that the study of the E CR should be added to the routine tests that are presently applied to clinical analysis of the Hotter ECG, being the classic tests of linear analysis not methodologically suitable for detecting the indeterministic chaos of the MDCS.

N2  - Objective: Routinely antepartal cardiotocogram (CTG) is recorded for 30 min in order to obtain normal resting phases (<30 min) or a decrease of irregulatory due to hypoxia (>30 min) or to differentiate these from each other. In case of early onset of hypoxia first pathological findings might only be seen by chance in incidentally recorded CTG. The goal of this study was, if a continuous 24-h CTG allows an earlier detection of beginning hypoxia in case of normal pregnancies of 36-42 weeks compared to pregnancies of 25-30 weeks of gestation, and if there are any differences between both groups concerning the qualitative and quantitative description or the detection of a circadian rhythm. Methods: 21 patients in each group had 24-h CTGs by means of telemetry (Hewlett-Packard type 78101A, 80110A). In both study groups, fetal heart-rate tracing included a full qualitative and quantitative description. Comparison of the results of both groups was done to look for early signs of pathological findings concerning reduced fetal well-being and a potential day and night rhythm. Results: In comparison to 36-42 weeks of pregnancies 25-30 weeks had significantly more physiological undulatory oscillation and less narrowed undulatory oscillation (P < 0.001), as well as less resting phases (P < 0.001). Baseline tachycardia and bradycardia showed significantly increasing quantity (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Twenty-four-hour CTG is a good screening method to detect early onset of hypoxia in case of second and third trimester pregnancies and a big help to detect a fetus at risk earlier. In future computerized CTG-systems should be proved in this connection and should be compared with our study. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) consists of four obligatory features: (1) an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; (2) the urge to move, or unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting; (3) the urge to move, or unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues; and (4) the urge to move, or unpleasant sensations are worse in the evening or night than during the day or only occur in the evening or night. The cause of idiopathic and familial RLS is unknown, although the most important pathophysiologic clues come from autopsy material showing that iron is decreased in the substantia nigra of patients with RLS. There is also some evidence that underactivity of the endogenous dopaminergic and the endogenous opioid system with its enkephalins and endorphins may be pathogenetic as well. Secondary forms of RLS may be associated with peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathy, low ferritin levels, renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis. Pregnancy can be an exacerbating factor for RLS. Dopaminergic agonists are the first line of treatment, but opioids, gabapentin (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines are effective as well. Periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are present in many but not all adult patients with RLS (80%), and PLMS also occurs with high prevalence in normal older adults even if RLS is not present. PLMS is therefore neither a sensitive nor specific-enough index of RLS to be diagnostic of RLS. PLMS without RLS rarely results in symptomatic sleep disruption, but in cases where symptomatic sleep disruption in the absence of RLS can definitely be attributed to the PLMS, the diagnosis of periodic limb movement disorder is made. However, it is not uncommon for a patient's PLMS to disrupt the sleep of the bed partner. © 2007 American Academy of Neurology.

N2  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-7% of reproductive-aged women. Although the diagnostic criteria for PCOS have been debated, it is frequently characterized by hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss), oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The reproductive and metabolic complications associated with the syndrome can be serious, so a comprehensive approach to the evaluation and treatment of affected women is important. Menstrual cycle control is necessary to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, and this can be accomplished with hormonal contraception, progesterone therapy, and weight loss (if overweight). In women desiring pregnancy, commonly used ovulation induction therapies include weight loss, clomiphene citrate, and/or metformin. Cosmetic issues such as hirsutism, acne and male-pattern hair loss can be challenging to cope with. Treatment options include estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptive agents, antiandrogens, and topical agents. More permanent hair reduction can be achieved with electrolysis and laser therapy. Evaluation of metabolic complications includes risk assessment for diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Women with PCOS should also be screened for sleep apnea, as this has been reported to occur more commonly in women with PCOS. Finally, mental health issues such as depression and eating disorders may be present. Many of the complications associated with PCOS can be managed with therapeutic lifestyle change, including a healthy diet, exercise, weight loss (if overweight), and psychological support. Pharmacological therapies are also available to effectively regulate menstrual cycles and manage cosmetic complications. This article will review the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in PCOS.

N2  - Aim: Approximately two-thirds of term vertex fetuses are in the left occiput position in utero. However, little is understood about the physiology of maternal-fetal positioning during pregnancy. It was hypothesized that fetal left occiput positioning is affected by maternal positioning. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between maternal positioning in late pregnancy and fetal positioning in utero. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Ueda Hospital, Kobe, Japan. Eligible women were limited to low-risk pregnancies ending in spontaneous vaginal delivery with singleton vertex fetuses. Information obtained from the mother included the preference of positioning during sleep in the second half of pregnancy. Fetal information recorded after delivery included fetal positioning. Results: Eighty-one (50.6%) of 160 evaluated women preferred left lateral positioning while 70 (43.8%) women preferred right lateral positioning in the second half of pregnancy. Seventy-seven (51.7%) of 149 evaluated fetuses were in the left occiput position while 72 (48.3%) fetuses were in the right occiput position in utero. Maternal left lateral positioning with fetal left occiput position in utero was the predominant positioning (41 of 149, 27.5%). However, there was no statistical relationship between maternal positioning and fetal occiput positioning in utero. Conclusion: More women prefer the left lateral position during the second half of pregnancy. More fetuses are in the left occiput in utero during the late stage of pregnancy. However, no statistical relationship was observed between maternal and fetal positioning. © 2007 The Authors.

N2  - Objective: To identify and quantify frontal sharp transients found in neonatal polysomnography of healthy full term newborns in each stage of the sleep-wake cycle within the first 48 hours of life. Method: The EEG from healthy term 32 newborns, legal age of two days and with adequate monitoring during pregnancy. Frontal sharp transients (FST) were quantified, according to synchronous or asynchronous, in each stage of the sleep-wake cycle. The results were compared by Kruskal-Wallis-test . Results: FST were counted individually in each sleep phase, being present during quiet sleep (QS) in all tracings. FST bilateral and synchronous and lateralized FST were more frequent during QS (p<0.05). Conclusion: Lateralized FST were found mostly during quiet sleep. FST asynchronous in healthy full term newborns were normal and depended of FST density. FST unilateral appearance should not necessarily be considered abnormal as well.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the costs associated with obesity in France. Methods: We used data from the 2002 survey on health and social protection as well as health care consumption data from the EPAS sample of the national health insurance funds. After excluding those younger than 18 years, pregnant women and people diagnosed with cancer, we classified subjects as underweight, normal weight, or obese and then studied two subpopulations: (P1) obese patients (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2) and (P2) patients who were obese or overweight (BMI ≥ 27kg/m2) and had additional cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, myocardial infarction (present or history), transient ischemic attack, intermittent claudication or sleep apnea. The Heckman approach was used to adjust for several factors. Results: The study included 4651 individuals, with a mean age was 47 years. The obesity prevalence rate was estimated at 10.7% for P1; the P2 prevalence was 16.0%. Average healthcare costs for the entire study group were 1534€, 1105€ for ambulatory care (72%) and 429€ (28%) for inpatient care. Costs for obese subjects (P1 and P2) averaged 2500€, twice the costs for normal-weight people (1263€). After taking into account age, sex, socioeconomic status, alcohol consumption and smoking, the 100% reimbursement rate for chronic diseases (all else being equal), the extra cost of obesity, compared with normal weight, was estimated between 506€ (P1) and 648€ (P2). Conclusion: The annual total cost of obesity was estimated to range from 2.1 to 6.2 billion euros in 2002 and account for 1.5 to 4.6% of total health expenditures in France. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - The circadian clock, regulating hormonal secretion and metabolisms in accordance with the environmental light-dark cycle, resides in almost all peripheral tissues as well as in the superchiasmatic nucleus. Clock gene expression has been found to be noncyclic during spermatogenesis and the differentiation of thymocytes. However, currently little is known about how cell differentiation could affect circadian clockwork. We performed this study using the in vitro real-time oscillation monitoring system to examine the clockwork in several types of diferentiating cells originated from reproductive tissues of transgenic rats (constructed with Period gene 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase reporter gene). After treatment with dexamethasone (DXM), persistent oscillation of Per2 expression was observed in both gonadotropin-induced and pregnant ovarian luteal cells, proliferative uterine stromal cells (USCs), and nondifferentiating testicular interstitial cells, with a cyclic period of ∼24 h. In contrast to these cell types, only one cycle of oscillation was sustained in granulosa cells undergoing differentiation. Additionally, Per2 oscillation was irregular in USCs undergoing decidualization induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate plus N6, 2-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate. Furthermore, no oscillation of Per2 expression was evoked by DXM in Leydig cells and thymocytes. In conclusion, the present study characterized the oscillation of Per2 gene expression in several types of ovarian, uterine, and testicular cells, and it is strongly suggested that circadian clockwork is affected during cellular differentiation. © 2007 Society for Endocrinology.

N2  - Metastin, a 54-residue peptide, was identified as the cognate ligand of human G-protein-coupled receptor GPR54. Since metastin is a gene product of the human metastasis suppressor gene 'KiSS-1', early studies on metastin were focused on its activity as a tumor metastasis suppressor. Recently, there have been some reports that metastin is found in human plasma and is particularly abundant in the plasma of pregnant women. Dysfunction of the GPR54 receptor causes diseases that are characterized by an insufficient release of gonadotropin and lack or delay of pubertal maturation. This information strongly suggests that metastin is involved in the regulation of reproductive endocrine functions. In order to determine the plasma levels of metastin and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) in an isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) patient, who received intermittent administrations of LHRH, we tried to establish a sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassay. The plasma LHRH levels of the patient were very high, while plasma metastin levels were at almost the same levels as circadian rhythms of healthy male humans. In the central nervous system, metastin stimulates the neuroendocrine reproductive axis. However, the effects of peripheral metastin are not known. Our result suggested that peripheral metastin had a genesis and activity different from central metastin. Copyright © 2007 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common severe neuromotor disability in childhood affecting 2-3.5/1000 live born neonates worldwide. Etiological factors are mostly related to perinatal non-progressive brain damage i.e. hypoxic-ischemic, haemorrhagic, vascular lesions, hyperbilirubinaemia and perinatal infection. Periventricular hypoxic-ischemic white matter lesions in prematures (PVL), are the most common cause of neurological impairments in childhood mostly presenting as cerebral palsy and visual disorder. Cognitive/behavioural problems and epilepsy are also common comorbidity. Incidence and severity of white matter lesions as well as cerebral palsy are related to gestatonal age. Gestational-age specific prevalence of CP varies from 77/1000 below 28 weeks, 40/1000 between 28 and 31 weeks, and 1.1/1000 in term neonates. Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE) is a multicentric project of CP registration comprising 8 countries by now. SCPE proposed simplified classification of the subtypes of CP according to neurological findings i.e. spastic CP (bilateral, unilateral spastic-hemiplegia), dyskinetic CP (dystonic, choreoathetotic) and ataxic CP. More detailed subdivision of CP uses functional grading i.e. Gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) for lower and Bimanual Fine Motor Function (BFMF) for upper limbs. Etiological factors for CP could be determined in 70% of children with CP respectively, 66% in preterms and 73% in term neonates. In 17% of preterms prenatal and in 49% postnatal risk factors are supposed. In 38% of term neonates pre- and in 36% peri/neonatal risk factors are present. Postnatal neuroimaging, intracranial ultrasonography and in particular MRI enables insight in timing and brain lesions/abnormalities related to CP. In first and secound trimestar developmental abnormalities occurred, between 24 and 34 weeks gestation white matter lesions, whereas basal ganglia and cortex are damaged after 34 weeks gestation respectively. Over 75% of lesions causing CP occur in third trimestar with pre/perinatal onset. Early diagnosis of CP implies better prognosis of neuromotor outcome. Therefore many clinical and paraclinical procedures are used to identify neonates/young infants at risk for CP. Neurological examination combined with assessment of general movements in preterm and term neonates, neonatal primitive reflexes, antigravitation tests are the most commonly used method of clinical evaluation along with impaired regulatory mechanisms i.e. excessive crying, sleep disturbances, eating problems etc. After first months, deviant simptoms are more predictive of spastic or dystonic syndrome, with abnormalities of the muscle tone, prolonged persistance of primitive reflexes, abnormal antigravitation tests and retarded motoric development. Paraclinical diagnostic methods i.e. neuroimaging and evoked potentials enable early detection of perinatal brain damage which correlate with unfavourable neuromotor outcome. Intracranial ultrasonography is the modality of choice in visualisation of peri-intraventricular haemorrhage/postventricular dilatation and focal cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Diffuse periventricular white matter lesions in terms of hypomyelinisation need to be diagnosed by high resolution MRI. Neurophysiology in particularly SSEP of n. tibialis ant. is highly sensitive in functional assessment of neonates at risk for CP.

N2  - The human foetus begins preparation for extrauterine life in the 26th week of gestation. Victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) were described as having less-intensive reactions to environmental stimuli than their siblings. They were described as less-active physically and more breathless and exhausted during feeding. These foetal-like qualities are similar to the microgravity deconditioning of the space traveller and the autonomic dysfunction of hypokinetic humans. During quiet sleep, a group of near-miss SIDS victims displayed a faster heart-rate and a decreased movement-time, compared to controls. Another group of SIDS victims linked delayed repolarisation and sympathetic overactivity of the nervous system. The excessive Q-T wave intervals, cardiac instability and autonomic dysfunction tended to coincide with the peak incidence of SIDS which is the normal period of autonomic transformation at 2-3 months of age. Sympathetic hyperactivity transforms the subject into an energy-intensive species with an accelerated heartbeat, intensive vasoconstriction and general reactions to a hostile environment. Energy-intensive species (flight-oriented species) were sensitive to selenium (Se) deficiency. Altered mitochondrial structure and defective electron transport of heart mitochondria were features of this syndrome. Runaway excessive sympathetic autonomic activity transforms the subject into an energy-intensive species responsive to selenium. Groups of Se-deficient lambs confined for eight weeks developed abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs). Groups exercised daily on a treadmill or Se-supplemented groups retained virtually normal ECGs. Foetuses and subjects unreactive to the environment are space travellers lacking parasympathetic stimuli to the brain. Decreased movement-time deprives the brain receptors of the stimulus induced by gravity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are often equivalent, hence selection of an AED is often determined by the adverse effects (AEs). The development of neurocognitive AEs is almost inevitable with use of AEDs, especially in high-risk groups. Teratogenesis with major or minor malformations is of great concern during the first trimester of pregnancy, but an increasing body of information suggests that potential neurocognitive developmental delay may also occur with use of AEDs in the latter part of pregnancy. Decreased bone mineral density has been found in adults and children receiving both enzyme-inducing AEDs and valproate, an enzyme-inhibiting drug. AEDs may influence the lipid profile, body weight, reproductive, hormonal and other endocrine functions, and sleep architecture. There are age-specific AEs related to pharmacokinetic differences that have been highlighted in this review with emphasis on the pediatric population. A classification of AEs using different parameters is also included. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly remains a diagnosis of concern in infancy. This study evaluates factors affecting the onset, treatment, and outcomes of nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly. METHODS: A retrospective chart review and telephone survey were performed. A posterior occipital deformation severity score was used. Factors such as demographics, behavioral and helmet therapy, feeding patterns, torticollis, multiple gestation pregnancies, prematurity, and congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly were evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred five infants were identified. Of these, 95 percent were Caucasian, 93 percent were from two-parent households, and 70 percent were from households earning more than $50,000. Repositioning was attempted in 95 percent, and 45 percent progressed to helmet therapy. When comparing change in posterior occipital deformation severity score with helmet therapy to repositioning, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Forty-nine percent of patients were breast-fed, and when compared with the general population, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Twenty percent of infants had torticollis, and when compared with population norms, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Twelve percent of patients were twins, and when compared with population norms, more twinning occurred (p < 0.05). Congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly was found in 10 percent of patients and did not result in an increased risk of progression to helmet therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates trends that may predict additional risks for developing nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly, including torticollis, plural births, and increased socioeconomic affluence. In addition, the nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly cohort was breast-fed less than the general population, demonstrating that breast-feeding may be preventative, as breast-fed infants are repositioned more frequently and sleep for shorter periods. As in other studies, cranial molding helmet therapy was more effective in correcting nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly than repositioning alone. ©2007American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

N2  - Vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control in hazardous situations is important. Our hypothesis is that the prerequisite for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is impaired vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control. Prematurity is a risk factor for SIDS, and postnatal intermittent hypoxia may contribute to this risk. We studied heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses in 10 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who were born at 27 ± 2.4 (23-30) wk of gestation. Twenty healthy term infants served as controls. Cardiovascular tests were performed under polysomnographic control during slow-wave sleep (SWS) at a corrected age of 12 ± 3.5 (7-19) wk. Control infants showed biphasic HR and BP responses to side motion with an immediate increase followed by a modest decrease and return to baseline. Compared with the controls, half of the BPD infants had altered BP responses (p < 0.005) without an early increase, followed by a more prominent decrease in BP. BPD infants also presented with a greater variability in BP responses to head-up tilts than did the controls (p < 0.001). In conclusion, these findings suggest that some BPD infants have impaired vestibular sympathoreflex-mediated cardiovascular control. This dysfunction may become critical in life-threatening situations. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007. All Rights Reserved.

N2  - The occurrence of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy is well known. However, the mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors that predispose women to have restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. A total of 146 pregnant women were included in the study. Patients were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics, complications of pregnancy, medical therapy (vitamin and iron intake), sleep disorders, muscle cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Electroneurography, routine blood biochemistry tests, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests were performed and vitamin B12, folic acid, serum iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, iron saturation, prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were measured. Of the participants, 38 were diagnosed as having restless legs syndrome. In women with restless legs syndrome, additional medical problems, night cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness were more frequent. In women without restless legs syndrome, serum hemoglobin levels were significantly higher and the use of supplemental iron or vitamins was greater. Among the women with restless legs syndrome, progesterone levels were slightly higher but this difference was not statistically significant. In summary, in this study, lower hemoglobin levels and supplementation deficits of iron and vitamins were found be the risk factors for restless legs syndrome in pregnancy. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

N2  - Study Objectives: To demonstrate that fetal heart rate measured by ultrasound can be successfully captured and monitored throughout the nocturnal polysomnogram. Methods: Fetal heart rate by ultrasound using an abdominal belt (Hewlett Packard Fetal Monitor 8040A) was measured during 1 overnight polysomnogram in volunteers in late pregnancy and added to a digitized polysomnography system (Alice 4, Respironics) Results: In 6 women with a single fetus in their third trimester, the fetal heart rate monitor band only infrequently needed to be readjusted. Fetal kicks and movements resulted in signal loss, usually with subsequent recapture without having to awaken the mother. Conclusions: Fetal heart rate, 1 of the classic signals of fetal distress, can be added to the nocturnal polysomnogram with minimal disruption of maternal sleep and with signal capture throughout the night.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy, associated with arterial hypertension, pre-eclampsia and adverse outcome of the newborn, has been described. Usually it can successfully be treated with non-invasive ventilation. A 36-year-old, twin-pregnant woman at 28 + 6 weeks of gestation presented with the complaints of snoring and nocturnal oxygen desaturations. Polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea (respiratory disturbance index [RDI] 104/h, minimal oxygen saturation in pulse oximetry [SpO2/min] 75%). First therapeutic approaches including oxygen supplementation, non-invasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure - spontaneous (BiPAP-S) remained without success. Only after ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure in spontaneous/timed modus (BiPAP-ST) combined with additional oxygen supplementation a satisfactory treatment result could be achieved (RDI 32/h, SpO2/min 85%). Because of progressive pre-eclampsia despite therapy at 31+0 weeks of gestation cesarean section was performed and 2 healthy children were delivered. After surgery non-invasive ventilation had to be continued for another six weeks before the condition improved. In contrast to the documented benefits of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in pregnant women the literature, in our case even with sufficient therapy of sleep apnea progressive pre-eclampsia and premature delivery could not be prevented. Possible explanations include the short treatment duration and existence of twin pregnancy. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

N2  - Women report their sleep to be disrupted during pregnancy. Sleep deprivation has been linked to elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. No information currently addresses the sleep-immune relationship during pregnancy. This study explores the relationship between subjectively reported sleep variables and circulating serum cytokine levels. Pregnant women (n = 35; mean age = 31.0 ± 3.7 years) seen once a trimester completed sleep questionnaires, gave blood and recorded their sleep on a sleep diary at home for 2 weeks. Nonpregnant women (n = 43; mean age = 28.2 ± 5.2 years) underwent the same protocol once. Subjective sleep variables were compared to serum cytokine levels for IL-4, -6, -10 and TNF-α as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) determined by ELISA. Nonparametric analyses and linear regression were performed to explore relationships between the sleep and immune variables. Pregnant women subjectively reported their sleep to be worse than in the nonpregnant group. Serum cytokine levels differed between the two groups and varied by trimester. As anticipated, IL-10 was significantly higher in all trimesters; however CRP, an indicator of systemic inflammation, was higher in all trimesters compared to the nonpregnant sample. Subjectively reported sleep disruption was associated with increases in TNF-α in the pregnant sample and CRP in the nonpregnant sample. These data confirm that disrupted sleep experienced during pregnancy, as well as during the nonpregnant state, is related to increases in inflammatory markers. Future exploration of these relationships should include functional assessments of immunity as well as polysomnographically recorded sleep. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Ethanol exposure during gestation can have devastating consequences on the developing organism. Children who have a history of prenatally exposure to ethanol may show morphological and functional alterations, referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, specific cranial/facial features, and dysfunction of central nervous system, is the most severe end of FASD. FAS or FASD children are known to suffer from disturbance of sleep and/or food intake behaviors. These neuropsychiatric symptoms may be due to impairment of the system regulating circadian rhythms. Recently, animal studies revealed that ethanol exposure during brain development can cause alterations in the circadian rhythm and its regulating system. We examined the effects of pre- or postnatal exposure to ethanol on the circadian rhythm in adulthood by measuring deep body temperature and wheel running activity in rats. After a phase delay in the light/dark cycle, ethanol-exposed rats took longer than control rats to resynchronize to the new light/dark cycle. These results suggest that both pre- and postnatal ethanol exposure impair the development of the circadian clock response to light cue. Because abnormal development of the circadian clock system might contribute to the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in FASD, it is believed that normalizing the disturbed rhythm improves the symptoms. However, the mechanisms of dysfunction and potential interventions for disturbance of circadian clock system still remain to be elucidated. Further investigations are required to fully understand long-term effects of ethanol on the development of circadian rhythms.

N2  - Sleep disturbance is a typical complaint during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies of this phenomenon have not measured sleep in the last days of pregnancy as women transition into labor. Poor sleep can have potentially adverse effects on labor and delivery. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep obtained in the 5 days preceding childbirth, and the relationship between sleep in this time frame and both pain and fatigue during early labor. METHODS: Thirty-five nulliparous women were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to hospital admission. RESULT AND DISCUSSION: Most women experienced spontaneous labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). CONCLUSION: There was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset. Results from this study can be used to advise women in late pregnancy about expected sleep patterns and measures to optimize sleep and rest.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. METHODS: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a sleep consciousness, and bed-sharing. Mercer's 1/4s stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives. Copyright © 2007 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study describes the patterns of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in a sample of childbearing women from the third trimester through the postpartum period. The relationship between sleep and depressive symptoms is also examined. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. METHODS: This longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time 1 and Time 4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

N2  - Laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are triggered by the contact of liquids with the laryngeal mucosa. In the mature organism, LCR trigger lower airway protective responses (coughing, effective swallowing, and arousal) to prevent aspiration. General belief holds that LCR are responsible for apnea and bradycardia in the newborn mammal, including humans. Our laboratory has recently shown that LCR in full-term lambs are consistently analogous to the mature LCR reported in adult mammals, without significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire M, Nsegbe E, Gagnon-Gervais K, Samson N, Moreau-Bussiere F, Fortier PH, and Praud J-P. J Appl Physiol 98: 2197-2203, 2005). The aim of the present study was to assess LCR in nonsedated, newborn preterm lambs born at 132 days of gestation (term = 147 days). The preterm lambs were instrumented for recording glottal adductor electromyogram, electroencephalogram, eye movements, heart rate, respiration, and oximetry. A chronic supraglottal catheter was used for injecting 0.5 ml of saline, distilled water, and HCl (pH 2) during quiet sleep, active sleep, and wakefulness on postnatal days 7 (D7) and 14 (D14). Laryngeal stimulation by water or HCl on D7 induced significant apneas, bradycardia, and desaturation, which, at times, appeared potentially life-threatening. No significant apneas, bradycardias, or desaturation were observed on D14. No consistent effects of sleep state could be shown in the present study. In conclusion, laryngeal stimulation by liquids triggers potentially dangerous LCR in preterm lambs on D7, but not on D14. It is proposed that maturation of the LCR between D7 and D14 is partly involved in the disappearance of apneas/bradycardias of prematurity with postnatal age.

N2  - The neuroanatomical and neurophysiological development of the embryo and fetus and unique features of the physiological environment of the fetal brain, features which are lost at birth, support recent conclusions that under normal circumstances awareness (or consciousness) is probably not exhibited by the ovine embryo-fetus before birth and that it appears for the first time only after birth. However, there has apparently been no evaluation of whether or not similar mechanisms modulate awareness-related functions in domestic chicks before and after hatching. This comparative review, in seeking to rectify this, arrived at the following conclusions. First, the neural apparatus of both lambs and chicks appears to be too immature to support any states resembling awareness during at least the first half of pregnancy or incubation. Second, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, which evolves subsequently, shows that states of sleep-like unconsciousness are likely to be continuously present in lambs until after birth, and that such states at least predominate in chicks until after hatching. Third, as in fetal lambs, epochs of so-called 'wakefulness' previously reported in chick embryos do not seem likely to represent short periods of awareness in ovo. Fourth, several neurosuppressive mechanisms, with some unique features, also operate or have the potential to operate in chicks before hatching, but a dearth of published information currently hinders a full comparison with those demonstrated to operate in fetal lambs. Fifth, contradicting the intuitive perception that vocalisation pre-hatching by the chick indicates the presence of awareness, published evidence suggests that vocalisation before and during hatching occurs mostly during EEG states indicating sleep-like unconsciousness. Sixth, as seems to be the case for newborn lambs after birth, it is possible that demonstrable awareness may appear for the first time only after hatching in chicks, presumably through waning neurosuppression and burgeoning neuroactivation, but such awareness seems to take longer to manifest itself. However, additional research in chicks is recommended to further assess this suggestion. Particular attention should be given to the status of vocal interactions between hen and chick which begin several days before hatching, and to the operation of neurosuppressive and neuroactivating mechanisms throughout the last 40% of incubation and during and after hatching.

N2  - Background: Mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment might lessen both patients' discomfort and multiple births, with their associated risks. We aimed to test the hypothesis that mild IVF treatment can achieve the same chance of a pregnancy resulting in term livebirth within 1 year compared with standard treatment, and can also reduce patients' discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs. Methods: We did a randomised, non-inferiority effectiveness trial. 404 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonist co-treatment combined with single embryo transfer) or a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos). Primary endpoints were proportion of cumulative pregnancies leading to term livebirth within 1 year after randomisation (with a non-inferiority threshold of -12·5%), total costs per couple up to 6 weeks after expected date of delivery, and overall discomfort for patients. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN35766970. Findings: The proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term livebirth after 1 year were 43·4% with mild treatment and 44·7% with standard treatment (absolute number of patients=86 for both groups). The lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI was -9·8%. The proportion of couples with multiple pregnancy outcomes was 0·5% with mild IVF treatment versus 13·1% (p<0·0001) with standard treatment, and mean total costs were €8333 and €10745, respectively (difference €2412, 95% CI 703-4131). There were no significant differences between the groups in the anxiety, depression, physical discomfort, or sleep quality of the mother. Interpretation: Over 1 year of treatment, cumulative rates of term livebirths and patients' discomfort are much the same for mild ovarian stimulation with single embryos transferred and for standard stimulation with two embryos transferred. However, a mild IVF treatment protocol can substantially reduce multiple pregnancy rates and overall costs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 births in the United States and results in craniofacial dysmorphologic condition and learning disabilities. In a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, neuroprotective peptides prevented fetal death and learning deficits. The γ-aminobutyric acid A (GABA) receptor subunit GABAβ3 plays a critical role for nervous system and palate development. Our objective was to determine whether the neuropeptides prevented alcohol-induced damage through GABAβ3. Study design: With a model for fetal alcohol syndrome, timed pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with alcohol (25% alcohol) or control (saline solution) or alcohol plus peptides NAPVSIPQ + SALLRSIPA (NAP + SAL; 20 μg). Embryos were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days after treatment. Adult males were tested for learning on the Morris water maze, and their brains were dissected. With samples from at least 3 litters per time point, calibrator-normalized relative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for GABAβ3 with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase standardization. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance and Fisher protected least significant difference. Results: Twenty-four hours and 10 days after treatment, alcohol decreased GABAβ3 in the embryos (P ≤ .01); this decrease was prevented by the peptides (P = .01). GABAβ3 was higher in alcohol treated adult brains respect to the controls (P = .002); this rise was not prevented by the peptides. Conclusion: Treatment with the neuropeptides NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA prevented the alcohol-induced decline in GABAβ3 expression 10 days after alcohol exposure. Because palate formation continues through E18, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA may be beneficial for the prevention of cleft lip and palate. © 2007 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Spontaneous coronary dissection is a rare cause of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Idiopathic spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) occurs in patient without risk factors for coronary artery disease and without underlying pregnancy. We describe a case of idiopathic spontaneous coronary dissection after sleep deprivation presenting with acute myocardial infarction. A 40 year old woman presented to an emergency department with squeezing substernal chest pain lasting 1 hour following 72 h sleep deprivation due to overtime work. On admission, ECG showed no significant ST change. But the level of CK-MB and Troponin T were increased up to 77.54 ng/ml and 1.62 ng/ml, respectively. Emergent coronary angiography demonstrated a longitudinal dissection of the middle portion in the diagonal artery with TIMI III flow to the distal part of the vessel. Because the dissected vessel was too small to pass the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and deploy the stent, angioplasty was not performed. Under medical treatment with aspirin, clopidogrel and unfractionated heparin, conservative management was proposed; she remained free of symptom and discharged free of chest pain and in good condition. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Pregnant women (N = 253) were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 22.3 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 83) and non-depressed groups based on a SCID diagnosis of depression. They were then given self-report measures on sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety and anger, and their urine was assayed for norepinephrine and cortisol. These measures were repeated during their third trimester (M = 32.4 weeks). Their newborns were then observed during sleep. During both the second and third trimesters, the depressed women had more sleep disturbances and higher depression, anxiety and anger scores. They also had higher norepinephrine and cortisol levels. The newborns of the depressed mothers also had more sleep disturbances including less time in deep sleep and more time in indeterminate (disorganized) sleep, and they were more active and cried/fussed more. © 2006.

N2  - Background: Longitudinal studies of sleep during normal pregnancy and post-partum are rare, and interpretation of the findings is often hampered by methodological issues. Consequentially, there is still limited information on what constitutes normal sleep quality and quantity across pregnancy and early post-partum, for both nulliparous and multiparous women. Aims: To quantify the change and variability in sleep duration and quality across pregnancy and post-partum for healthy nulliparous and multiparous women. Methods: Nineteen women (eight nulliparous and 11 multiparous) wore an actigraph and completed a sleep diary to objectively measure sleep for seven nights during the second trimester, one week prior to delivery, and at one and six weeks post-partum. Mixed model analysis of variance and logistic regression were used to investigate changes in sleep across this timeframe. Results: The largest changes in sleep occurred in the first week post-partum (1.5 h less sleep than during pregnancy, three times more sleep episodes in 24 h, 70% of women regularly napping during the day, and greatest day-to-day variability in sleep). Compared to multiparas, nulliparas generally had less efficient sleep, spent more time in bed and had greater wake after sleep onset in the second trimester, and spent less time in bed and had fewer sleep episodes a day at one week post-partum. Conclusions: These changes should be used to inform women about the extent of change in sleep, particularly early post-partum, and to help health-care providers identify women experiencing severe sleep loss and disruption and discuss possible coping strategies with them. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

N2  - Sleep quality is integral to optimal physical functioning and mental health during pregnancy. There has, however, been little work conducted to determine the most appropriate measure of sleep quality in this clinical group, a surprising observation given the complex and dynamic psychobiology of pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.

N2  - Maternal pregravid obesity is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes during pregnancy. In early pregnancy there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. In later gestation maternal metabolic manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, become clinically recognized because of the increased insulin resistance in obese compared with nonobese women. In women with pregestational glucose intolerance, hypertension, central obesity, and lipid disorders, the physiologic changes in pregnancy increase the risk of problems previously not routinely encountered during pregnancy. These include chronic cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. At parturition the obese patient is at an increased risk of cesarean delivery and associated complications of anesthesia, wound disruption, infection, and deep venous thrombophlebitis. For the fetus there are short-term risks of fetal macrosomia, more specifically obesity, and long-term risks of adolescent components of the metabolic syndrome. Although preliminary results of bariatric surgery are encouraging, the procedure is expensive and not for all obese women, and we recognize that long-term follow-up data on offspring of obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery before pregnancy are lacking. In the interim, we need to encourage obese women to lose weight before conception, using lifestyle changes if possible. During pregnancy, weight gain should be limited to Institute of Medicine guidelines (currently under review) and encouragement given for physical activity. © 2007 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of back pain and treatment satisfaction in a population of low-socioeconomic pregnant women. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design to determine the prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy for 599 women. Women completed an author-generated musculoskeletal survey in the second trimester of their pregnancy that addressed pain history, duration, location, and intensity, as well as activities of daily living, treatment frequency, and satisfaction with treatment. Results: Sixty-seven percent of the total population reported musculoskeletal pain, and nearly half presented with a multi-focal pattern of pain that involved 2 or more sites. Twenty-one percent reported severe pain intensity rated on a numerical rating scale. Eighty percent of women experiencing pain slept less than 4 hours per night and 75% of these women took pain medications. Importantly, 85% of the women surveyed perceived that they had not been offered treatment for their musculoskeletal disorders. Conclusion: Multi-focal musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy was prevalent in this underserved patient population. The pain in this population negatively affected sleep and treatment appeared inadequate. © 2007.

N2  - The premature infant is at increased risk of cerebral white matter injury. Melatonin is neuroprotective in adult models of focal cerebral ischemia and attenuates ibotenate-induced white matter cysts in neonatal mice. Clinically, melatonin has been used to treat sleep disorders in children without major side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin in the immature brain following intrauterine asphyxia. Fetal sheep at 90 d of gestation were subjected to umbilical cord occlusion. Melatonin (20 mg/kg, n = 9) or vehicle (n = 10) was administered IV to the fetus, starting 10 min after the start of reperfusion and continued for 6 h. Melatonin treatment resulted in a slower recovery of fetal blood pressure following umbilical cord occlusion, but without changes in fetal heart rate, acid base status or mortality. The production of 8-isoprostanes following umbilical cord occlusion was attenuated and there was a reduction in the number of activated microglia cells and TUNEL-positive cells in melatonin treated fetuses, suggesting a protective effect of melatonin. In conclusion, this study shows that melatonin attenuates cell death in the fetal brain in association with a reduced inflammatory response in the blood and the brain following intrauterine asphyxia in mid-gestation fetal sheep. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2007.

N2  - Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone are potent agonists at the GABA A receptor and suppress the fetal CNS activity. These steroids are synthesized in the fetal brain either from cholesterol or from circulating precursors derived from the placenta. The concentrations of allopregnanolone are remarkably high in the fetal brain and rise further in response to acute hypoxic stress, induced by constriction of the umbilical cord. This response may result from the increased 5α-reductase and cytochrome P-450SCC expression in the brain. These observations suggest that the rise in neurosteroid concentrations in response to acute hypoxia may represent an endogenous protective mechanism that reduces excitotoxicity following hypoxic stress in the developing brain. In contrast to acute stress, chronic hypoxemia induces neurosteroidogenic enzyme expression without an increase in neurosteroid concentrations and, therefore, may pose a greater risk to the fetus. At birth, the allopregnanolone concentrations in the brain fall markedly, probably due to the loss of placental precursors; however, stressors, including hypoxia and endotoxin-induced inflammation, raise allopregnanolone concentrations in the newborn brain. This may protect the newborn brain from hypoxia-induced damage. However, the rise in allopregnanolone concentrations was also associated with increased sleep. This rise in sedative steroid levels may depress arousal and contribute to the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Our recent findings indicate that acute hypoxic stress in pregnancy initiates a neurosteroid response that may protect the fetal brain from hypoxia-induced cell death, whereas the decline in allopregnanolone levels after birth may result in greater vulnerability to brain injury in neonates.

N2  - It is important to consider the potential contribution of seasonality to postpartum depression (PPD; Hiltunen et al, 2004). A possible link between seasonality and PPD may have implications for not only choice of treatment, but also in considering pregnancy planning. The objectives of this pilot study were to examine whether women with seasonal mood changes demonstrated greater incidence of PPD, and to determine if seasonality scores were predictive of PPD. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ; Rosenthal et al, 1987) was used to assess seasonality of mood. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between clinical factors, SAD diagnosis, SPAQ global seasonality score (GSS) and season of SPAQ administration and PPD. In our sample, twice as many women in the PPD group were found to have SAD compared to the control group. The PPD group also had a higher group GSS mean (10.44) than did the control group (8.84). However, logistic regression analysis showed that higher seasonality scores in women with PPD were not necessarily predictive of PPD. While more women in the PPD group reported increased seasonal weight fluctuation and less sleep in the spring and summer, these items alone did not predict depression after childbirth. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Pineal melatonin regulates circadian rhythms and influences sleep. Melatonin also has protective actions against tissue damage from free-radicals and other toxins. Evidence is presented that this indoleamine is involved in pre- and postnatal brain (and ocular) development and intrauterine growth. In the absence of maternal melatonin, short gestation infants have a prolonged period of melatonin deficiency. Melatonin supplementation, which has a benign safety profile, may help reduce complications in the neonatal period that are associated with short gestation. We believe that this treatment might result in a wide range of health benefits, improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs. © 2007 The Authors.

N2  - Objective: To assess the profile of metabolic abnormalities in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients and methods: In a case-control study conducted in two years, from April 2003 to March 2005, data obtained from polysomnography study, lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, serum insulin, insulin resistance, leptin and adiponectin levels, were compared between the various groups. Included in the study were OSA subjects from a sleep laboratory and matched controls from the community. Those with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV heart failure, pregnancy, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, or who were on treatment for hyperthyroidism, on systemic steroid treatment, or on hormonal replacement therapy, were excluded from the study. Results: Forty apneic obese subjects (AHI = 32.19, range 13-52.75) were compared with 40 non-apneic obese controls (AHI = 1.3, range 0-2.45) and 40 normal weight control subjects (AHI = 0.7, range 0-1). No significant difference was noted in levels of fasting blood sugar, insulin resistance (obese apneics 61.9, obese controls 47.8, non-obese controls 19.1), leptin (obese apneics 10.65 μg/L, obese controls 8.52 μg/L, non-obese controls 2.83 μg/L) or adiponectin (obese apneics 4959.3 ng/ml, obese controls 5706 ng/ml, non-obese controls 7412 ng/ml) in the OSA group compared to obese controls. Conclusions: OSA has no independent association with lipid abnormalities, insulin resistance, serum leptin and adiponectin levels. In multivariate analysis, obesity was the major determinant of metabolic abnormalities in this cohort. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterised by a complaint of an almost irresistible urge to move the legs. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. In doubtful cases, neurophysiological examinations, such as polysomnography and/or a suggested immobilisation test, can be performed to confirm a clinical suspicion of RLS. Several other conditions may present sensorimotor complaints with features similar to RLS; a careful sleep history is required to avoid a misdiagnosis. Three different scales have been validated to assess the severity of RLS. In the general population, RLS prevalence ranges from 0.1% to 11.5%, with a high number of patients affected by a primary form of the sleep disturbance (70%-80%). However, several clinical conditions have been associated with RLS, such as iron deficiency, uraemia, pregnancy and polyneuropathy. Furthermore, recent studies show that RLS may be associated also to type 2 diabetes mellitus and to multiple sclerosis. RLS has a negative impact on sleep, cognitive functions, quality of life and mental status. Higher awareness of RLS among physicians is required; it remains an underdiagnosed clinical condition. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2007.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a chronic sleep motor disorder that affects up to 10% of the general population. Except for periodic leg movements (PLM), which can be found in the great majority of RLS patients, no objective hematochimic or neurophysiological markers are available to prove the diagnosis, which is based on clinical standard criteria. Nowadays, the aetiopathogenesis of the syndrome is unknown. In a consistent sample of patients affected by the idiopathic form, the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait related to an unidentified locus, while each symptomatic form is probably linked to a specific cause. Although of possible different origins, both the primary and secondary forms may share the same pathogenetic mechanism, which, even if unclear, could be characterised by a neurological dysfunction of the dopaminergic system. Several issues, including strong efficacy of dopamine-agonist treatments, support this theory, which is currently considered the main pathogenetic hypothesis. Most of the past studies tried to clarify the RLS mechanism using the neurophysiological, biochemical and neuroimaging techniques applied to the field of human research. Now the time has come to accept the challenge in creating an animal model of RLS, which may emerge as a decisive step in understanding RLS pathogenesis, and to develop and test new therapies. Even though there have been a few significant efforts, a valid animal model of RLS still does not exist. In past pioneering studies, the authors attempted to induce restless motor behaviour in animals by different strategies: antidopaminergic pharmacological interventions, spinal or cerebral lesions of specific regions involved in the motor control and in dopamine regulation, and selective deletion of genes coding for dopamine receptors. Rodents (mice and rats) were always chosen by the authors as the animals for their experiments. The current tendency in achieving an RLS model is generally represented by simulation of a symptomatic condition of RLS or by a direct interference of the dopaminergic system. In this regard, the pharmacological method had the intention to reproduce the neuroleptic-induced acathisia, the spinal lesional model was based on the hypothesis of myelopathic- related PLM, and the hypothalamic lesion tested the motor consequence of A11 dopaminergic neurons. Preliminary studies are underway to replicate the pregnancy-related form of RLS by using a hormonal intervention, and the iron-deficiency secondary form by using specific iron-free diets. Today, modern technologies are available to easily replicate in animals most of the symptomatic RLS conditions. In addition, more than a few well validated animal models of different diseases known to be related to RLS or PLM, for instance, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and renal failure, could also be exploited in addressing this topic. The real obstacle in achieving an RLS model is the absence of a certain diagnostic marker to recognise if the animal that underwent the different experimental procedures has developed the RLS condition or not. Concerning this issue, possible specific endpoints are represented by the increase in locomotor activity, which are ascertainable by different techniques, such as openfield or run-wheel activity, or by sleep fragmentation, in which the circadian shift can be verified by applying polysomnography on the animal. PLM are probably the only specific and reliable markers available to recognise and quantify experimentally induced RLS. Despite a few authors who reported the presence of limb-phasic, pseudoperiodic activity during sleep in old or in lesioned rats, the existence of spontaneous or provoked PLM in animals is still debated. Eventually, the PLM features in an animal could be markedly different compared to human ones. To recognise and characterise PLM in animals, three more essential steps are required: a method to record directly, as in humans, the activity of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, a consistent amount of normative control data on the TA activity in healthy animals, and reliable analysis to distinguish the generic phasic muscular activity to a possible unambiguous PLM pattern. This review includes a summary and a critical discussion of the previous tentative RLS models, proposals for other possible animal models, and firstly the preliminary normative data on TA activity during sleep in normal rodents. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2007.

N2  - Aim: To survey the knowledge and implementation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)-protective infant care practices in mothers of infants aged less than 4 months. Methods: A postal survey was carried out of knowledge of SIDS risk factors and infant care practices of 200 mothers with infants aged 6-8 weeks and 3-4 months. Results: Mothers who could cite supine sleeping as protective comprised 84%, while 73% knew that smoking was a risk factor. Fewer knew that room sharing, keeping the face clear of bedding, and avoiding bed sharing and overheating are also protective. Fifty-four percent of the infants usually room-share with a parent, while 39% both room-share and sleep in their own bed. Sixteen percent usually co-slept for part or all of the night. Nearly one-third used pacifiers. Mothers who smoked during pregnancy comprised 8%, while 7% had smoked in the last 24 hours. Most infants (97%) had been breastfed at some time. Conclusions: Maternal education of the benefits of supine sleeping, not smoking, and breastfeeding appear well understood by these mothers. However, more education is needed about other SIDS-protective behaviours such as keeping the face clear and sleeping the infant in their own bed in the parents' room. © NZMA.

N2  - Women commonly report sleep disorders that may predispose or contribute to the occurrence of other psychiatric problems. Many phases of the life cycle are associated with unique features of sleep disruption that are modulated at least partially by hormonal factors. Pregnancy and peripartum and perimenopausal states are associated particularly with sleep disruption and have the clearest published evidence base. Many factors contribute to a heightened incidence of insomnia in women, including the occurrence or severity of somatic symptoms (eg, hot flashes and dysmenorrhea); psychiatric symptoms, such as depression or anxiety; and intrinsic sleep disorders. The presence of insomnia is associated with poorer quality of life and impaired daytime functioning; its management, therefore, is imperative. Significant physiologic changes in pregnancy lead to several sleep disorders. Sleep-disordered breathing and RLS are common in women but even more in this subpopulation. Given the strong possibility that sleep disorders are contributing to mood changes in pregnant women, careful attention must be paid to the development of treatment strategies that address medical and psychologic factors to assist this vulnerable population fully. For symptomatic menopausal women, HT still is the treatment of choice for short-term management of menopause-related symptoms, in particular hot flashes; however, its safety as a long-term treatment option is questioned, and many physicians and their patients are seeking nonhormonal alternatives. An accurate diagnosis must be made in this population, and treatment of underlying sleep disorders is crucial. Most nonpharmacologic symptomatic treatments for insomnia (eg, stimulus control and sleep restriction) have not been studied systematically in patients who are menopausal, despite their proved efficacy for insomnia in general. The use of antidepressants and herbal preparations seem more helpful when sleep complaints result from the emergence of menopause-related symptoms, depression, or anxiety. Women who suffer insomnia during the menopausal transition or post menopause may benefit from the therapeutic effects of newer agents, such as the non-BZRAs (zolpidem and eszopiclone) and melatonin receptor antagonists; more studies are needed to determine the extent to which these agents can offer a safe and efficacious long-term management of insomnia with a positive impact on daytime function and improvement of quality of life. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Mouse mammary epithelial cells (HC-11) and mammary tissues were analyzed for developmental changes in circadian clock, cellular proliferation, and differentiation marker genes. Expression of the clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 were elevated in differentiated HC-11 cells, whereas Per2 mRNA levels were higher in undifferentiated cells. This differentiation-dependent profile of clock gene expression was consistent with that observed in mouse mammary glands, as Per1 and Bmal1 mRNA levels were elevated in late pregnant and lactating mammary tissues, whereas Per2 expression was higher in proliferating virgin and early pregnant glands. In both HC-11 cells and mammary glands, elevated Per2 expression was positively correlated with c-Myc and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels, whereas Per1 and Bmal1 expression changed in conjunction with β-casein mRNA levels. Interestingly, developmental stage had differential effects on rhythms of clock gene expression in the mammary gland. These data suggest that circadian clock genes may play a role in mouse mammary gland development and differentiation. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - A combined time-variant analysis of nonlinear stability and parametric bispectral measures was applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep between 0.7 and 0.9 gestation to examine the maturation of sleep states and synchronization patterns of the ECoG. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already at 0.7 gestation and suggests the presence of premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature NREM sleep. Maturation of NREM sleep begun at 0.78 gestation and preceded that of REM sleep that begun at 0.85 gestation. Our results suggest that maturation of brain stem and thalamic function precedes that of cortical function.

N2  - The brainstem development of infants born between 33 and 38 weeks' gestation is less mature than that of a full-term infant. During late gestation, there are dramatic and nonlinear developmental changes in the brainstem with respect to neuronal origin and proliferation, migration pathways, morphologic and neurochemical differentiation, neurotransmitter receptors, transporters, and enzymes, dendritic arborization, spine formation, synaptogenesis, axonal outgrowth, and myelination. This translates into immaturity of upper airway and lung volume control, laryngeal reflexes, chemical control of breathing, and sleep mechanisms. Ten percent of late preterm infants have significant apnea of prematurity and they frequently have delays in establishing coordination of feeding and breathing. Eighty six percent of the 45 preterm infants who were enrolled in the CHIME study after experiencing an ALTE were between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation. Clearly these infants are at risk for respiratory-related problems compared with infants born at term. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of clinical, physiologic, neuroanatomic, and neurochemical data in this specific group of infants. Research focused on this group of infants will not only further our understanding of brainstem maturation during this high-risk period, but will help develop focused plans for their management. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in the population of pregnant women. Material and methods. We have used a diagnostic questionnaire based upon diagnostic criteria of RLS formulated by International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. Pregnant women attending to routine control visits at obstetrics outpatient department participated in the study. Results. We have examined 128 pregnant women. Mean age of the examined group was 27.7 years. Restless legs syndrome was found in 20 of them (15.69%). There was no age difference between RLS-positive and RLS-negative groups. There was no difference in iron and folic acid supplementation intake between the groups. Restless legs syndrome was more frequent among multiparae than among primigravidae. RLS-positive subjects had problems with sleep initiation more frequently. For 25% of RLS-positive subjects the syndrome was the most problematic health complaint. Conclusions. Restless legs syndrome is a frequent problem in the population of pregnant women, leading to sleep disorders. The disease is underdiagnosed in the general practice. Copyright © 2006 Via Medica.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review the clinical challenges of obesity in obstetrics from the anaesthetist's viewpoint. RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence of obesity continues to increase both in the community and on the labour ward. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery are also on rise. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with hypertensive disease (chronic hypertension and preeclampsia), diabetes mellitus (pregestational and gestational), respiratory disorders (asthma and sleep apnoea), thromboembolic disease, caesarean section and infections (primarily urinary tract infections, wound infections and endometritis). Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Obese women are not only at high-risk of airway complications, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, perioperative morbidity and mortality but also pose technical challenges. Obesity also influences the fetal outcomes. Increasing use of regional techniques contributes to the reduced anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Preconception counselling, antenatal screening and anaesthetic assessment are strongly encouraged. SUMMARY: Effective communication and good teamwork between an anaesthetist and an obstetrician are essential for the care of obese parturients. A more liberalized use of regional techniques may be a means of further reducing the anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - A survey of the nutritional status of women in 6 villages of the Pune district of Maharashtra, India, found young women to have a significantly lower BMI than their male peers. The purpose of this study was to identify social and economic factors associated with this difference in thinness and to explore the behavior in men and women that might underlie these associations. We compared men and women in 90 families in this part of Maharashtra by taking measurements of the height and weight of the married couple of child-bearing age in each family and assessing their social and economic details, fasting practices, and oil consumption. In this agricultural community, women were thinner in joint land-owning families, where the main occupation was farming, than those in nonfarming families. This was not true of men in this type of family. Men in ''cash-rich'' families had higher BMI than men in families without this characteristic. There was no corresponding difference in women's BMI. We then examined the lifestyles of men and women in a subset of 45 of these families. Women were more likely to work full time in farming than men, to carry the burden of all household chores, to have less sleep, and to eat less food away from home than men. Women fasted more frequently and more strictly than men. Despite identifying significant differences in behavior between men and women in the same household, we did not find a direct link between behavior and BMI. We conclude that being married into a farming family is an important factor in determining the thinness of a woman in rural Maharashtra. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition that is frequently unrecognized, misdiagnosed and poorly managed. It is characterized by uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs developing at rest that compel the person to move; symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS occurs in 7%-11% of the population in Western countries, and many such people experience troublesome symptoms. Primary RLS is familial in up to two thirds of patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. RLS is very responsive to dopaminergic therapies. Rebound of RLS symptoms during the early morning and development of severe symptoms earlier in the day (augmentation) are problematic in those treated for a prolonged period with levodopa. Consequently, dopamine agonists have become first line treatment. Anti-convulsant medications and opioids are helpful in some patients. Correction of underlying problem wherever possible is important in the management of secondary RLS. © 2006 Dove Medical Press Limited. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The aim of the study was to validate the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20R) questionnaire for the assessment of prolonged fatigue in workers and to define its psychometric properties and fatigue standards for the population of Poland. The questionnaire contains 20 statements, scored on a seven-point scale (1-7), reflecting four aspects of fatigue: subjective feeling of fatigue, reduction of concentration, reduction of motivation, and reduction of physical activity. The outcome yielded by the questionnaire is expressed by the sum of all points scored in responding to all statements and mean values of its components. Material and Methods: The study was carried out in a group (325 men and 363 women) of workers employed in industrial plants, hypermarkets and municipal services; workers of research institutes (81 men and 205 women) and pregnant women (20 persons). Based on the calculated coefficients of correlation between responses to each statement and the total score, strong discriminative power of individual statements was observed. Crombach's alpha was used to assess the consistence of the questionnaire. The coefficient value for the total score was 0.912 and for the fatigue components it ranged from 0.611 to 0.879, which indicates satisfactory reliability of the method. In addition, norms were elaborated using a sten scale. The total value of 40 indicates the borderline between low and moderate and the value of 84 between medium and high level of fatigue. Results: The level of the risk for chronic fatigue was estimated on the basis of investigations among industrial, trade and municipal services workers. In the group of men, the necessity of prolonged standing during work, high physical effort during work, lack of fitting to physical effort during work, and stress connected with responsibility (component of occupational stress) were the risk-increasing factors. In the group of women, they were: lack of fitting to physical effort during work, noise disturbing reasoning of speech and stress connected with psychic load and lack of social support (components of occupational stress). In both groups, sleep disturbances proved to be responsible for increasing risk of the incidence of chronic fatigue. In the group of men - the diet, and in the group of women - exercise during leisure time were found to be protective factors. Conclusions: The study revealed that the CIS20R questionnaire is a good research tool to study chronic fatigue. It was also found that the level of fatigue in the population of Poland is much higher than that in the Netherlands, the country where the questionnaire has been developed. In the Dutch studies, the value of 76 was found to be a borderline between "normal fatigue" and fatigue occurring in people with impaired health. In our studies this value corresponds with six stens, which means that it is still within the range of moderate values. © Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof. J. Nofera w Łodzi.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of the focal epilepsy is possible even based on the clinical history. More precise identification of bioelectrical focus, type of epileptic attack and type of epilepsy requires EEG or videoEEG analysis. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of the study was to assess clinical value of electro-encephalography and videoelectro-encephalography in diagnostics of partial epilepsy in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 140 children with partial epilepsy hospitalized between 1998 and 2004 in Department of Pediatric Neurology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow. The group included 70 girls and 70 boys, aged from 2 months to 17 years. 38 of the children were older than 5 years, with mean age 8 years and 4 months. The mean time of the epilepsy course was 2 years and 4 months. Children with symptomatic partial epilepsy were the biggest group and children with idiopathic partial epilepsy were in minority. More than 50% of children suffered from complex partial seizures. Statistical correlation of the EEG results and pregnancy and birth period factors, results of neurological and psychological examination was performed. All children underwent MRI and 15 HMRS neuroimaging as well. All children underwent EEG examinations and 55 children videoEEG, recording time 60 minutes for each patient. Sleep recording in 40 children, awake EEG in 93 children and both type recordings in 8 children were performed. Stroboscope, hyperventilation and sleep deprivation stimulation tests were used. All EEG recordings were assessed by 2 physicians with the EEG license and final result was a mean of their assessment. T-student test, Mann-Whitney and bilateral Fisher test were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: EEG pattern was abnormal in 139/140 children, and videoEEG in all 55 children. In the vast majority of the patients with partial epilepsy focal EEG changes were recorded (in 111/140), with a significant prevalence of unilateral changes observed in 48/111 patients. 34 children had focal EEG changes with one-site prevalence and 27/140 children had focal EEG changes in both hemispheres without any prevalence. Generalized EEG changes were revealed in 16/140 children. Hyperventilation revealed in 8 children paroxysmal bioelectric activity and in 43 enhanced abnormal EEG pattern. In all children with normal MRI imaging EEG/videoEEG methods revealed changes significant for localization of seizures onset and origin. CONCLUSIONS: (1) EEG patterns in children with partial epilepsy were dominated by localized and lateralized changes. EEG was crucial for localization of bioelectric foci especially in children with normal MRI. (2) Focal EEG changes were significantly more often in children with hippocampal sclerosis. (3) In terms of localization HMRS were more compatible with EEG than with MRI findings. HMRS examination is strongly indicated especially in children with EEG localized discharges and with normal brain MRI.

N2  - Bed-sharing among Barbadian mothers and infants was studied in relationship to maternal and infant characteristics. This prospective study followed 226 healthy, well-nourished mother-infant dyads at birth, 7 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum. At each age, approximately half of the infants shared the same beds as their mothers. Bed-sharing was associated with demographic characteristics, especially fewer home conveniences, and also maternal characteristics, including less information seeking by the mother and younger maternal age at first pregnancy. Bed-sharing was also associated with lower infant birth weights. Maternal moods were significantly correlated with bed-sharing, such that mothers who reported having more despair and anxiety were also more likely to sleep with their infants. Bed-sharing was also significantly associated with increased breastfeeding at all infant ages, but this relationship was no longer significant once the effects of maternal moods were controlled. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing maternal moods in studies evaluating the risk and benefits of bed-sharing. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate recent evidence regarding gender differences in sleep. RECENT FINDINGS: Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns.Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine-Levin syndrome are more common in men. SUMMARY: Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - Obesity, generally defined as body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 and above, is a universal growing epidemic. From a public health perspective, it represents an important modifiable risk factor for adverse health and pregnancy outcome. There is a significant association between obesity and diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders, ischemic heart disease and sleep apnea. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with fertility treatments, recurrent abortions, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus and other complications such as labor dystocia, mal-presentations, fetal macrosomia, and higher rates of cesarean deliveries. Bariatric surgery is the only effective treatment for morbidly obese patients, and these operations are performed predominantly among women. Few studies have addressed pregnancy outcome after obesity surgery. Basically, pregnancy outcome is comparable to controls of normal BMI. This review aims to present updates on the relationship between obesity and pregnancy outcomes, and the outcome of patients following bariatric surgeries.

N2  - About 20 per cent of pregnant women experience antenatal depression (AD), which not only has deleterious effects on the woman and her baby but also increases the risk of developing postpartum depression. Nurses who understand the prevalence, signs and symptoms, and risk factors associated with AD can help to identify it and prevent the sequelae. The signs and symptoms of depression in pregnancy do not differ from depression at at any other time. However, AD may go undiagnosed because of a focus on maternal and fetal well-being and the attribution of complaints to the physical and hormonal changes associated with pregnancy. Risk factors include history of depression, lack of partner, marital difficulties, lack of social support, poverty, family violence, increased life stress, substance abuse, history of previous abortions, unplanned pregnancy, ambivalence toward the pregnancy and anxiety about the fetus. Most of the standard treatments for depression can be used in pregnant women, with the exception of some antidepressant medications. Supportive therapies--exercise, adequate nutrition, adequate sleep, and support from family and friends--are also indicated. Screening of women with known risk factors is crucial, but the authors suggest that the high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy indicates a need for universal screening.

N2  - In rodents, during late embryonic and early neonatal development, circadian rhythms develop in synchrony with those of their mothers, which in turn are synchronized with the environmental photoperiod. This paper examines the effect of maternal ganglionectomy (pineal gland sympathetic denervation) or extirpation of the pineal gland on pups' drinking rhythms, a behavior that is continuously monitored in individual animals starting after weaning and studied up to 3 weeks later. Maternal ganglionectomy or pinealectomy performed on the 7th day of gestation significantly disrupts rat pups' drinking behavior, within and among litters. In both treatments, circadian rhythm characteristics of the free-running period (tau), phase, amplitude and alpha were significantly altered compared to those of the control pups born from sham-operated mothers. With the exception of the alpha component, both maternal treatments have similar effects. When melatonin was given to the mothers instead of the endogenous pineal secretory activity for 5 days during the late period of gestation, this treatment reversed the effects of maternal ganglionectomy and pinealectomy. These observations, together with previous studies of our group, indicate that the maternal superior cervical ganglia and pineal gland are necessary components of the mechanism for maternal synchronization, and that maternal melatonin may, directly or indirectly, affect the performance of the pups' central oscillator during early pup rat development. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Aim: To explore the sleeping problems and related factors among children aged 1 to 24 months in Changsha. Methods: Totally 700 normal children aged 1 to 24 months without severe congenital or infectious disease were randomly selected from 3 neighborhoods of two districts of Changsha. Under strict quality control system, their parents were interviewed with the self-made questionnaire on children sleeping condition including the general condition, sleeping condition in recent 1 month, growth and development and disease of children, pregnant condition, family condition, living condition and sleeping condition of parents. Sleeping problems with children included regaining consciousness at night, falling asleep at evening, breathing with mouth in sleeping at night, snoring in sleeping, sleep lightly with stimulate, hyperkinesias ties in sleeping, sweatiness in sleeping and breath pausing in sleeping. Every item included five levels "never", "once in a while", "once or twice per week", "three to four times per week", and "high frequency". The children were considered having sleeping problems if "once to twice per week" appeared in any item. One person had only one sheet, and the questionnaires were retrieved after checking. Results: Totally 700 questionnaires were sent out, and 672 qualified were retrieved with the efficient rate of 96.0%. (1)The prevalence of sleeping problems in children aged 1 to 24 months in Changsha, was 17.7 %. The male was 14.8%, and female was 21.1%, which had significant differences (X2 =4.588, P < 0.05). (2)The prevalence of more sweatiness in female child was more higher than male child, which had significantly differences (66 21.1, 53/14.8, X2 =4.588, P < 0.05). (3)The children aged 1-24 months were divided into 5 age groups, and there were significant differences in the prevalence of sleeping problems in children among different ages (111/ 51.6, 6/2.8, 2/1.9, 0, 0, X2 =250.042, P < 0.01). The children aged younger than 6 months owed the highest prevalence (51.6%). (4)The single factor gradual regressive analysis was performed according to whether having sleeping problem to screen the related factors with children sleeping problems. The related factors were selected as variables including month age of child, education years of parents, profession of parents, sleeping conditions of child, born condition of children, pregnant condition of mothers, living condition of family, sleeping condition of parents to perform the logistic regression analysis. The 8 variables such as term born child, sleeping time at daytime of child, profession of father, ventilation of child bedroom, passive smoking at home in pregnant period, sleeping bed of child, asphyxiation in coming into the world, sonmiloquence in sleeping of father were involved in the logistic analysis. Conclusion: The prevalence of sleeping problems of children aged 1 to 24 months in Changsha is relatively higher. The younger the children are, the higher the prevalence is. Term born child, total sleeping time at daytime of child, profession of father, ventilation of child bedroom, passive smoking at home in pregnant period, sleeping bed of child, asphyxiation in coming into the world and somniloquence in sleeping of father may influence the occurrence of sleeping problems.

N2  - In the adult mammal the circadian system, which allows predictive adaptation to daily environmental changes, comprises peripheral oscillators in most tissues, commanded by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The external environment of the fetus is provided by its mother. In primates, maternal melatonin is a candidate to entrain fetal circadian rhythms, including the SCN rhythms of metabolic activity. We found in the 90% of gestation capuchin monkey fetus expression of the clock genes Bmal-1, Per-2, Cry-2, and Clock in the SCN, adrenal, pituitary, brown fat, and pineal. Bmal-1, Per-2, and the melatonin 1 receptor (MT1) showed a robust oscillatory expression in SCN and adrenal gland, whereas a circadian rhythm of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found in plasma. Maternal melatonin suppression changed the expression of Bmal-1, Per-2, and MT1 in the fetal SCN. These effects were reversed by maternal melatonin replacement. In contrast, neither maternal melatonin suppression nor its replacement had effects on the expression of Per-2 and Bmal-1 or MT1 in the fetal adrenal gland or the circadian rhythm of fetal plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Our data suggest that maternal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the fetal SCN but probably not for the adrenal gland. Copyright © 2006 by The Endocrine Society.

N2  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Certain modifiable maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy are associated with adverse health outcomes for the mother and her infant (e.g., physical abuse, insufficient folic acid consumption, smoking during pregnancy, and improper infant sleep position). Information about these behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends in maternal and infant health, enhance understanding of the relation between maternal behaviors and infant health outcomes, plan and evaluate maternal and infant health programs, direct policy decisions, and monitor progress toward achieving the national Healthy People 2010 [HP 2010] objectives (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy people 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services; 2000). REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2000-2003. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers; nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants. This report summarizes data for 2000-2003 from 19 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia) that measured progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives for eight perinatal indicators: 1) pregnancy intention, 2) multivitamin use, 3) physical abuse, 4) cigarette smoking during pregnancy, 5) cigarette smoking cessation, 6) drinking alcohol during pregnancy, 7) breastfeeding initiation, and 8) infant sleep position. RESULTS: In 2003, prevalence of intended pregnancy among women having a live birth ranged from 48.1% in Louisiana to 66.5% in Maine; during 2000-2003, no state experienced a statistically significant (p< or =0.05) increase in prevalence of intended pregnancy, and one state experienced a significant decrease. In 2003, prevalence of multivitamin use at least four times per week during the month before pregnancy ranged from 23.0% in Arkansas to 45.2% in Maine; during 2000-2003, multivitamin use increased significantly in three states (Illinois, North Carolina, and Utah). In 2003, prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during the 12 months before pregnancy ranged from 2.2% in Maine to 7.6% in New Mexico; during 2000-2003, significant decreases were recorded in three states (Alaska, Hawaii, and Nebraska). In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from cigarette smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 72.5% in West Virginia to 96.1% in Utah; during 2000-2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of smoking cessation during pregnancy ranged from 30.2% in West Virginia to 65.8% in Utah; during 2000-2003, a significant increase was recorded in Utah. In 2003, prevalence of abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 91.3% in Colorado to 98.0% in Utah; during 2000-2003, abstinence increased significantly in Louisiana and Utah but decreased significantly in Florida and Nebraska. In 2003, prevalence of mothers who breastfed their babies in the early postpartum period ranged from 51.2% in Louisiana to 90.3% in Alaska; during 2000-2003, significant increases were recorded in six states (Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, and South Carolina). In 2003, prevalence of healthy full-term infants who were placed to sleep on their backs ranged from 50.0% in Arkansas to 78.7% in Washington; during 2000-2003, significant increases were recorded in eight states (Alaska, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, North Carolina, and West Virginia). In 2003, all 19 states achieved or exceeded the HP 2010 objective for smoking cessation during pregnancy, and 16 states achieved the HP 2010 objective for abstinence from alcohol during the last 3 months of pregnancy. In addition, nearly half of the states achieved the objectives for breastfeeding in the early postpartum period and infant back sleep position. However, no state achieved the HP 2010 objectives for intended pregnancy, multivitamin use before pregnancy, absence of physical abuse before pregnancy, or abstinence from smoking during pregnancy. INTERPRETATION: PRAMS data indicate variability among states regarding progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives in the area of maternal and child health. More progress has been made in achieving objectives focused on the period during and after pregnancy (e.g., smoking cessation and proper infant sleep position); less progress has been made in achieving objectives related to behaviors and experiences in the preconception period (e.g., pregnancy intention and multivitamin use). PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: State maternal and child health programs can use these state- and population-based data to monitor progress toward achieving HP 2010 objectives, identify indicators to target for intervention, and plan and evaluate programs that promote positive maternal and infant health behaviors, experiences, and outcomes. These data also can be used to guide policy decisions that could affect the health of mothers and infants.

Methods: We followed 29 primiparous adolescents from the prenatal period through the 12th week of the puerperium, with a mean of sixteen years of age, served at the Outpatient Facility for Adolescents of Maternidade Escola Assis Chateaubriand (MEAC) of Universidade Federal do Ceará (Fortaleza, Brazil). The pregnant adolescents were divided into two groups, that is, those who remained normotensive (Group I) and those who developed PH (Group II). The variables investigated in the assessment of the value of predictability for the development of PH were anthropometric measures, socioeconomic aspects, smoking habit, inheritance for SAH (father/mother), prenatal tests requested in the first prenatal care visit in addition to microalbuminuria and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in the 28th week of gestation. The pregnant adolescents were followed up at delivery and late puerperium (12th week after the puerperium). The newborns to the mothers included in our study were assessed at birth according to the Apgar score and the Capurro method, for weight, height and perinatal hypoxia. Results: The prevalence of PH was 51.7%. Inheritance for SAH presented the highest predictive value for PH with an odds ratio of 10.99. Diastolic arterial pressure equal to or above 70 mmHg at the gestational age of 35 weeks was statistically significant as a predictive value for PH. At ABPM we found a predictive value for PH: diastolic pressure load during alertness, diastolic and systolic pressure load during night sleep, pressure variability and maximum diastolic pressure during sleep. Specifically a maximum diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) at ABPM during the period of night sleep 364 mmHg presented an odds ratio of 6 for PH with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 60% for the development of PH. Conclusion: The research for PH predictive factors in primiparous adolescents showed to be easy to apply and useful to stratify high-risk pregnant women as regards the development of PH.

N2  - Study Objectives: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Design: Cross-sectional, population-based study. Setting: Passo Fundo, Brazil. Participants: 2,285 newborns. Interventions: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed. Measurements and Results: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age ≤ 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices. Conclusions: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of this study lies in the future application of this information via public health measures targeted at high-risk populations.

N2  - The paper summarizes research linking long work hours to a wide range of risks to workers, families, employers, and the community. The risks are theorized to stem from less time to recover from work, longer exposure to workplace hazards, and less time to attend to non-work responsibilities. Risks to workers include sleep deprivation, poor recovery from work, decrements in neuro-cognitive and physiological functioning, illnesses, adverse reproductive outcomes, and injuries. Risks to families include delayed marriages and child bearing, and obesity in children. Risks to employers include reduced productivity and increases in workers errors. Mistakes by fatigued workers have broad reaching impacts to the community: medical errors, automobile crashes with other drivers on the road, and industrial disasters that damage the environment.

N2  - Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved by movement, and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day. All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features to confirm the diagnosis. Whilst many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, or in those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients' quality of life. © 2006 EFNS.

N2  - In 2003, the EFNS Task Force was set up for putting forth guidelines for the management of the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and the Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD). After determining the objectives for management and the search strategy for primary and secondary RLS and for PLMD, a review of the scientific literature up to 2004 was performed for the drug classes and interventions employed in treatment (drugs acting on the adrenoreceptor, antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines/hypnotics, dopaminergic agents, opioids, other treatments). Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations formed according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating. Dopaminergic agents came out as having the best evidence for efficacy in primary RLS. Reported adverse events were usually mild and reversible; augmentation was a feature with dopaminergic agents. No controlled trials were available for RLS in children and for RLS during pregnancy. The following level A recommendations can be offered: for primary RLS, cabergoline, gabapentin, pergolide, ropinirole, levodopa and rotigotine by transdermal delivery (the latter two for short-term use) are effective in relieving the symptoms. Transdermal oestradiol is ineffective for PLMD. © 2006 EFNS.

N2  - Background: Facts and hypotheses on the relationship between some children's diseases or disorders and external stressors during the developmental stage of a child, both prenatally and postnatally are described in literature. In this paper the following changes in patterns and causes of the main childhood illnesses are summarized and recommendations for actions are made. • Prematurity • Intra-uterine growth restriction • Testicular dysgenesis syndrome • Type I and Type II diabetes • Asthma, atopy and hay fever • Autism • Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) • Learning disabilities • Cancer • Obesity • Hearing problems Results: Literature provides a growing amount of information on changing patterns in childhood diseases. Conclusions: The following recommendations for action are formulated: • Immediate research on endocrine disrupters in relation to prematurity • Diabetes: avoid Maillard Compounds in liquid baby food and in food in general: promote breastfeeding • Asthma: avoid exposure to smoking, the use of chemical household products, dioxin and dioxin-like chemicals, and avoid air pollution with high levels of particulate matter, especially around conception, during pregnancy and in the first years of life • Autism: more research on incidence and causes • ADHD and learning disabilities: more research on prevalence and causes. Preventions: 1) preconception counselling to avoid potentially harmful substances; 2) controlling and further lowering levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, lead and methyl mercury • Cancer: promote breastfeeding, carry out research into effects of foetal exposure to internal fission-product radionuclides • Obesity: stop smoking in pregnancy, avoid parental obesity, longer night sleep • Hearing problems: lower noise levels in discothèques, promote the day-evening-night level to avoid noise (longer night sleep). © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine first-time mothers' postpartum stress and its correlates following discharge from the hospital or clinic after vaginal delivery. One hundred and eighty-three first-time mothers were enrolled from hospitals and clinics in Kaohsiung City. All first-time mothers reported normal pregnancies and vaginal deliveries, delivered healthy infants at term, and were surveyed during their postpartum periods after discharge from hospitals or clinics. The Hung Postpartum Stress Scale was used to examine first-time mothers' postpartum stress and stressors during their postpartum periods. The top ten postpartum stressors perceived by the women were: "the baby getting sick suddenly", "the flabby flesh of my belly", "the unpredictability of the baby's schedule", "interrupted sleep", "the shape of the baby's head due to the sleeping position", "not sleeping enough", "lack of information regarding infant's growth and development", "the baby's crying", "my life is restricted", and "the baby choking during feeding". There were no significant differences between the first-time mothers' demographic characteristics and their postpartum stress and its three components (negative body changes, maternal role attainment, lack of social support), respectively. Insight into the study results of first-time mothers' postpartum stress and stressors provides a reference for health professionals that the development of programs and resources addressing primiparous women's unique needs are required. © 2006 Elsevier.

N2  - Independently, prenatal malnutrition and psychological/physical stress have been shown to affect sleep architecture in adult rats. As malnutrition and stress commonly co-exist in malnourished human populations, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the combined effects of these two insults by examining sleep-wake parameters following a brief restraint stress in prenatally protein malnourished rats. The male offspring of rats provided with a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were implanted with recording electrodes beginning at postnatal day 90. Polygraph recordings were obtained to quantify sleep states during the first 4 h of the dark phase of the cycle on 2 consecutive days. The first followed a 24-h habituation session to the recording chamber (baseline). The second occurred at the same time of day but followed 20 min of restraint stress in a Plexiglas tube. During baseline, prenatally malnourished rats spent more time in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in the first 2 h after "lights off" (block 1), and greater amounts of wakefulness (W) with a corresponding reduction in slow wave sleep (SWS) in the second two hours (block 2), as compared with controls. Following stress, the sleep architecture of both groups of rats remained unaltered in block 1 relative to their baseline day. In block 2, both groups exhibited significant reductions in SWS and REMS with significantly greater reductions being expressed in the prenatally malnourished group (most dramatically, REMS was completely eliminated). These findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be more severe in those malnourished human populations subjected to acutely stressful experiences. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Sleep disturbances and insomnia are more commonly observed in adult females than in adult males. It has been speculated that comorbid depression and anxiety among females may contribute to a higher incidence of insomnia. In addition, periods of intense hormonal variability (e.g.; pregnancy/postpartum, menopause transition) appear to be associated with higher incidence of sleep disturbances in females. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the menopausal transition constitutes a period of heightened risk for the occurrence of depressive symptoms and vasomotor complaints, as well as insomnia. This article reviews the clinical and hormone factors that may play a role for the development of insomnia during the menopausal transition and postmenopause. Treatment options are critically reviewed, including cognitive-behavioral techniques, hormonal treatments, hypnotics, antidepressants, and complimentary/alternative medicine.

N2  - Investigation of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) circadian chronological structure changes by means of blood pressure monitoring in healthy pregnant women during development of gestational hypertension (GH) and pre-eclampsia (PE) was carried out. 72 hours blood pressure monitoring (TM-2421 device, Tokyo, Japan) was carried out in 34 healthy pregnant women. Parametric and non-parametric indices of circadian rhythms were determined, which allowed us to include in group A 17 women who had normal BP until delivery. Group B consisted of 17 women with hypertension in II and III trimesters. Increase of hyperbaric index (HBI) of SBP was revealed in the I trimester in women in whom hypertension was developed later in pregnancy. HBI was used as a prognostic criterion of developing MESOR-hypertension long before its clinical manifestation. In the II and III trimesters HBI, per cent time of elevation (PTE%) and MESORs of SBP and DBP circadian rhythms progressively augmented. Pregnant women with hypertension belonged to type non-dipper according to D/N% changes (less then 10%). This may be the result of insufficient decrease of night values of SBP in group B pregnant women, which is characteristic of GH and PE.

N2  - Over the past generation, aging and female reproduction have been lodged within the gendered and gendering debates regarding women's involvement in the workforce and demographic shifts toward delayed parenting that culminate in discourses on the "biological clock". Technological solutions to the biological clock, specifically in vitro fertilization, have led to clinical attempts to assess "ovarian reserve", or qualitative and quantitative changes in the ovary that correlate with aging and with successful infertility treatment. Rupturing the longstanding historical connections between menstruation and female reproductive capacity by specifically focusing on the aging of a woman's eggs, the clinical designation of "diminished ovarian reserve" has come to imply that a woman has "old eggs". This is associated in practitioners' and patients' minds with the eclipse of a woman's reproductive potential and with hidden harbingers of menopause. In an ethnographic interview study of 79 couples in the US who conceived after using donor oocytes, we found that women voiced two different narratives that described their experience and attitudes when confronted with an apparent age-related decline in their fertility. The "eleventh-hour mom" narrative was voiced by women who initially tried to become pregnant with their own eggs and turned to donated oocytes as a second-choice option, whereas the "miracle mom" narrative was expressed by women who were generally older, some of whom had entered infertility treatment hoping to conceive with their own eggs, but some who knew from the outset that it was not going to be possible. Through their narratives women not only embodied and made meaningful "diminished ovarian reserve" in varying ways that connect with cultural, social, structural/organizational, symbolic and physical aspects of aging, they reproduced the socio-biological project of the biological clock, but rooted this social project in the metaphor of "old eggs" rather than menopause. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Women generally have more complaints about sleep, compared with men of the same age. At various stages of reproduction, the reasons for these complaints become rather obvious - menstrual cramps and discomfort, pregnancy and postpartum factors, and menopausal hot flashes can fragment sleep. In addition, there are lifestyle factors, such as going to bed late and getting up early in order to attend to various family responsibilities, restricting the time allowed for sleep. Factors outside a woman's control, such as caregiving for sick family members during the night, can also result in disrupted sleep patterns, with little opportunity to make up for the lost sleep on weekends or days off. This article discusses the types of insomnia commonly experienced by women during key reproductive stages of life and proposes gender-specific assessment and management strategies. Pharmacologic management of sleep problems is useful for brief episodes of insomnia, but not usually desirable during pregnancy and lactation, or for management of chronic insomnia. For most women, regardless of reproductive stage, nonpharmacologic strategies that involve behavioral therapies, or short-term focused use of hypnotics at key time points, are more effective for quality of life than is long-term use of pharmacologic interventions.

N2  - For more than two decades, prenatal care has been a cornerstone of our nation's strategy for improving pregnancy outcomes. In recent years, however, a growing recognition of the limits of prenatal care and the importance of maternal health before pregnancy has drawn increasing attention to preconception and internatal care. Internatal care refers to a package of healthcare and ancillary services provided to a woman and her family from the birth of one child to the birth of her next child. For healthy mothers, internatal care offers an opportunity for wellness promotion between pregnancies. For high-risk mothers, internatal care provides strategies for risk reduction before their next pregnancy. In this paper we begin to define the contents of internatal care. The core components of internatal care consist of risk assessment, health promotion, clinical and psychosocial interventions. We identified several priority areas, such as FINDS (family violence, infections, nutrition, depression, and stress) for risk assessment or BBEEFF (breastfeeding, back-to-sleep, exercise, exposures, family planning and folate) for health promotion. Women with chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or weight problems should receive on-going care per clinical guidelines for their evaluation, treatment, and follow-up during the internatal period. For women with prior adverse outcomes such as preterm delivery, we propose an internatal care model based on known etiologic pathways, with the goal of preventing recurrence by addressing these biobehavioral pathways prior to the next pregnancy. We suggest enhancing service integration for women and families, including possibly care coordination and home visitation for selected high-risk women. The primary aim of this paper is to start a dialogue on the content of internatal care. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.

N2  - Diurnal rhythms of cardiac activity and motion activity of expectant mother fetus with physiological course of pregnancy have been studied at pregnancy terms of 16-28 weeks. A new, original method of analysis of fetus has been proposed. It has been established, that healthy fetus exhibits sharply defined day-and-night variations of physiological functions. Biological rhythms of human fetus are in coordination with the condition of maternal body, but it is in counter phase with it. Dynamic curve of the changing of functioning level of its physiological systems carries biphasic character. "Active" (from 9 am till 2 pm and from 7 pm till 4 am) and "calm" (from 4 am till 9 am and from 2 pm till 7 pm) periods of human fetus have been chosen. The absence of sharply defined biorhythms in terms of 20-24 weeks gestation, shows its developmental retardation and needs timely correction. The results of investigations lay fundamentals of chronobiology and chronotheraphy of human fetus.

N2  - Purpose. The signs and symptoms, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, and options and guidelines for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are reviewed. Summary. RLS was first described in the 17th century and further characterized in 1945. RLS is a common disorder, occurring in about 10% of the population. Patients with RLS often describe the urge to move, uncomfortable sensations, and pain, which begin or worsen during rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting. Symptoms of RLS make sleeping difficult for many patients, and significant daytime difficulties result from the condition. RLS can either be primary or arise from secondary causes that lead to iron deficiency. There is a familial component in primary RLS, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Of individuals with conditions associated with iron-deficiency states, including pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia, 25-30% may develop RLS. The goals of RLS treatment include improving its symptoms and the patient's quality of life. There are limited data on the treatment of RLS. Pharmacologic therapies include iron replacement, dopaminergic agents (e.g., levodopa), dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opi-oids, and benzodiazepines. There have been no systematic trials of nonpharmacologic therapies for RLS, but good sleep hygiene and avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may improve symptoms. Conclusion. RLS is a common disorder thought to involve abnormal iron metabolism and dopaminergic systems. Nonpharmacologic therapy should be suggested for all patients with RLS, but pharmacologic therapy may be required, and evidence is strongest for levodopa and dopamine agonists.

N2  - This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain formation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA = SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ = NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Aim: To understand the sleep problems in children of 2-6 years old in Changsha as well as its influencing factors. Methods: 650 normal children aged 2-6 years between February and May 2005 were randomly selected from 6 streets, which were randomly selected from 2 administrative areas out of 5 ones. All enrolled subjects were proved to have no preexistent and infection illnesses. Parents were interviewed by self-designed questionnaires about sleep quality of children under strict quality control. The contents of questionnaires included general status, the sleep quality of children in the past month, regain consciousness at night, fall asleep at evening, bed-wetting at night, molar at night, sweatiness in sleeping, the developmental and sickness histories of children since born, condition in pregnant period, basis conditions of family, inhabited environment as well as sleep quality of parents etc. The sleep quality of children included being conscious at night, falling asleep at dusk, bed-wetting at night, night-grinding, sweating in sleeping, somniloquy at night, snoring in sleeping, sleepng lightly with stimulate and crying in sleeping. Each item included 5 levels: never, once in a while, 1-2 times/ week, 3-4 times/week and high frequency. Children were considered to have sleep problems if any item represented as 1-2 times/week or more. Results: A total of 650 questionnaires were sent out and 605 ones were retrieved with the effective rate of 93.1%. 1 The prevalence of sleep problems in Changsha children aged between 2 and 6 years was 34.2% (2.7/ 605), which was 32.0% in male children and was 36.8% in female children. The differences were not significant (χ2=1.531,P > 0.05). 2 There were no remarkable differences in sleep problems between male and female children (χ2=0.105-1.808,P > 0.05). 3 The detection rate of sleep problems was the highest (40.6%) in children of 2 years old (F =115.128,P < 0.01). 4 In all sleep problems, the detection rate of sweating much in sleeping at night was higher than other problems in children at different age, and there was no significantly difference in each sleep problem in children among different age group (F=0.074-0.656,P > 0.05).5 The influencing factors of children sleep problems included: attitude of teaching in family, age of child calculated in month, educational years of mother, month-income of family, profession of mother, grinding history in sleeping of mother, methods of childbearing, asphyxiation in coming into the world as well as time of going to sleep at evening of mother. Conclusion: The incidence rate of sleep problems is the highest in Changsha children aged 2 to 6 years. Factors of attitude of teaching in family, age of child, educational years of mother, month income in family, profession of mother, molar in sleeping of mother, methods of childbearing, asphyxiation in coming into the world as well as going to sleep at evening of mother all influencing factors in sleep problems of children. We must pay attention to the prevention and treatment of sleep problems in children.

N2  - This article examines the question as to what is the right age to reproduce from the biological point of view of its purpose; that of achieving a healthy mother and baby. We start with an assumption that issues surrounding sex, fertility, pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion and childbearing are private and emotionally laden. We are not looking at, nor judging, individual reproductive choices; what might be "right" for one person, or couple, in one context will be unsuitable for another. It is traditional obstetric and gynaecological teaching that human reproductive outcomes are worse at the extremes of maternal age. Yet the advice given in a recent BMJ editorial entitled "Which career first? The securest age for childbearing remains 20-35" appeared to be controversial. The ensuing scientific and media interest raised such headlines as "Horns of the dilemma", "A sinister article", "Late mums face baby misery" and "Are we having children too late? IVF not the answer, say docs". Products have recently appeared on the market offering kits to women to indicate the time left on their 'biological clock' so they can choose whether to continue pursuing their career or try for a baby. Why is there so much interest in the right time to reproduce? Are women (and men) doing something differently compared to the past? If there has been a demographic shift in the age women reproduce (hitherto unexplained), there are important and specific risks older women may face as compared to younger women. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - The current study investigated the attentional mechanisms associated with goal engagement and disengagement in a lifespan context. Women approaching the end of their childbearing years (N = 29) were compared with women who had passed that deadline (N = 28). Participants' goal engagement was measured with a goal nomination task, an incidental recall task of goal-relevant sentences, visual attention to goal-relevant vs. goal-irrelevant images, and a memory task of goal-relevant images. The attention data indicated that women approaching the deadline had a longer first fixation on baby images than women who had passed the deadline. This novel finding was supported by a replication of the previous finding that women approaching the deadline were more engaged with the goal of childbearing than women who had passed the deadline. The connection between attention and memory of goal-relevant information is explored as evidence of cognition working in the service of motivation and developmental regulation.

N2  - During the estrous cycle and beginning in estrus, the mammary gland undergoes pregnancy-like development that depends on transcriptional regulation by the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR) and Pax-2 as well as the action of the growth factors Wnt-4 and RANKL. In this report, we first describe the decay and delayed expression of ERα, PR, and Pax-2 proteins as well as depression of Wnt-4 and RANKL mRNA coincident with the strong estrogen surge in proestrus. In time-course studies using ovariectomized mice, a single estrogen injection replicated these delays and caused an 18 h delay in Wnt-4 expression. Molecular time-delay systems are at the core of cellular cycles, most notably the circadian clock, and depend on proteasome degradation of transcriptional regulators that exhibit dedicated timing functions. The cytoplasmic dynamics of these regulators govern delay duration through negative transcription/translation feedback loops. A proteasome inhibitor, PS-341, blocked estrogen-stimulated ERα, PR, and Pax-2 decay and proteasome chymotryptic activity, assayed using a fluorogenic substrate, was elevated in proestrus correlating with the depletion of the transcription factors. The 18-h delay in Wnt-4 induction corresponded to the turnover time of Pax-2 protein in the cytoplasm and was eliminated in Pax-2 knockout mammary tissue, demonstrating that Pax-2 has a unique timing function. The patterns of estrogen-triggered ERα, PR, and Pax-2 turnover were consistent with a negative transcriptional feedback. Retarding the expression of ERα, PR, and Pax-2 may optimize preparations for pregnancy by coordinating expression of critical receptors and transcription factors with rising estrogen and progesterone levels in estrus. The estrogen surge in proestrus has no defined mammotropic function. This study provides the first evidence that it is a synchronizing signal triggering proteasome-dependent turnover of mammary gland ERα, PR, and Pax-2. We hypothesize that the delays reflect a previously unrecognized timing system, which is present in all ovarian target tissues. © 2006 Society for Endocrinology.

N2  - The primary goal of this study was to examine sleep problems in a sample of cocaine-exposed 7-month-old infants and to determine if maternal psychopathology mediated any existing association between substance exposure and sleep behaviors. We also examined the differences in sleep behaviors of cocaine-exposed infants in parental custody and cocaine-exposed infants in nonparental custody. Participants were 65 cocaine-exposed and 53 nonexposed infants and their primary caregivers who were recruited at delivery and assessed at 7 months of infant age. As expected, women who used cocaine during pregnancy had more psychiatric symptoms than nonusers. Prenatal exposure to heavier amounts of cocaine was significantly related to more severe sleep difficulties, and maternal anxiety mediated this association. Approximately 28% of cocaine mothers lost custody of their infants by 7 months of age. Nonmaternal caregivers had significantly fewer symptoms of psychopathology than the cocaine-using women who retained custody of their children. Infants who were in nonparental care at 7 months of age also had less severe sleep problems than did infants who remained in parental care. © 2006 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized in the Western world as a public health burden, but there has been no community-based study performed to assess the prevalence of the condition in India. The study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of OSA in a semi-urban Indian population. Design: A two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study. Setting: A semi-urban community in Delhi. Duration: Two years (2003 to 2005). Patients and participants: All citizens residing in the community who were 30 to 60 years of age. Exclusion criteria included those patients with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV congestive heart failure, pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, systemic steroid treatment, and hormone replacement therapy. Intervention: An OSA assessment was performed in 2,400 subjects who were screened in stage 1 of the study by means of a sleep questionnaire. Subjects were then divided into habitual and nonhabitual snorers. Eighty-three randomly selected habitual snorers and 80 nonhabitual snorers were invited to participate in stage 2 of the study, which consisted of in-hospital polysomnography studies. Observations and results: A total of 2,150 subjects returned questionnaires (response rate, 90%). Of 550 habitual snorers and 1,596 nonhabitual snorers, 77 habitual snorers and 73 nonhabitual snorers underwent polysomnography. A total of 36 habitual snorers (46.75%) and 2 nonhabitual snorers (2.73%) were found to have OSA, giving prevalence rates of 13.74% and 3.57%, respectively, for OSA and OSA syndrome (OSAS) on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age, obesity (defined by a high body mass index), and waist/hip ratio as significant risk factors for OSAS. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the risk factors and prevalence for OSA in India are similar to those in the West, which is contrary to the findings of some previous reports, which had a strong inclusion bias.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine patient treatment preferences and satisfaction with an office-based procedure for early pregnancy failure and to compare resource use and cost between office and operating room management of early pregnancy failure. METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study of 165 women presenting for surgical management of early pregnancy failure. Participants completed a preoperative questionnaire addressing treatment preferences and expectations and a postoperative questionnaire measuring level of pain experienced and satisfaction with care. Resource use was determined by measuring the time patients spent at the health care facility and the actual procedure time. Cost was estimated using an institutional database. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen women from the office and 50 from the operating room were enrolled. Patients selecting outpatient management scored "privacy," "avoiding going to sleep," and "previous experience" higher than the operating room group (P < .05). Patients who perceived that their physicians preferred one procedure over the other were more likely to select that procedure (P < .001). Satisfaction was high in both groups, and underestimating the procedure's discomfort was negatively associated with satisfaction (P < .002). Costs were greater than two-fold higher in the operating room group compared with the office group (P < .01). Complications were uncommon, but hemorrhage-related complications were four times more common in the operating room group than in the office group (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Office-based surgical management of early pregnancy failure is an acceptable option for many women and offers substantial resource and cost savings. © 2006 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

N2  - A child in his mother's womb is immersed in a bath of stimulations (the ones coming from heart beat, blood flow, breathing, sleep-awake cycle, his mother's voice) and he is able to perceive them through amniotic fluid vibrations. De Casper has shown how, soon after birth, newborns recognize their own mother's voice from other mothers and in respect to his father's voice and that newborns are able to differentiate two different stories and prefer the one they have listened to in the last three months of pregnancy. Another experiment by Hepper has shown that a musical piece in the last three months of pregnancy is recognized by newborns. It seem evident that there is between mother and child a prenatal bond made of sounds.

N2  - Several conditions are associated with insulin resistance (IR), and the mechanism behind this state is multifactorial. Pathological states (such as visceral obesity, low energy expenditure, high carbohydrate consumption, and sleep deprivation) and more physiological states (such as puberty and pregnancy) will lead to increased IR. During puberty, the high levels of sex steroids as well as the high levels of growth hormone (GH) are responsible for decreased insulin sensitivity. During pregnancy, the high levels of several diabetogenic hormones lead to a state of IR. A pronounced physiological decrease in peripheral insulin sensitivity occurs as pregnancy proceeds. In contrast, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pathological state of carbohydrate intolerance beginning or first recognized during pregnancy, which leads to increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Obese women, an increasing part of the fertile female population, develop a more pronounced IR during pregnancy, with a higher risk of developing GDM. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Depression is still underestimated, despite its high incidence, and its impact on subjective quality of life. To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc. ) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often "covered" by the presence of physical symp-toms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the "obvious consequence" of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing. The aim of our observation is to reconsider the importance of a complete psychopathological assessment of patients with physical/somatic complaints. This is important for two main reasons: 1) to consider physical complaints as a part of a more complicated syndrome; 2) to achieve as a treatment goal, a remission and not only a reduction of frequency or intensity of these symptoms. Findings from the literature show that physical symptoms may precede and follow major mood episodes, and may contribute, as residual manifestations, to increasing the risk or relapse or recurrence. Our aim is to consider as a new treatment option, these drugs that seem to be as equally effective on mood as on physical symptoms (SNRI). A new SNRI (duloxetine) seems to be useful in order to improve mood symptomatology during acute major depression episodes and to reduce distress due to the persistance of physical symptoms.

N2  - The effects of sleep deprivation in pregnancy on the development of hippocampal function of the offspring have been investigated. For this purpose we compared electrophysiological characteristics in the hippocampal slices of 15-20-old-day rats of the control and two experimental groups. In the first experimental group the pups were taken from mother for weighting three times during the first postnatal week and then weekly. Another experimental group was brought up without handling. We found that CA1 population spikes developed to significantly less amplitude in experimental groups of rat pups. This phenomenon was observed at higher intensity of monosynaptic activation, although near-threshold stimuli didn't reveal any differences among groups. However, under paired-pulse stimulation (70 ms inter-pulse interval) small amplitudes in the hippocampal slices of experimental animals could facilitate up to control value, and second in pair responses didn't differ from corresponding control. Our data doesn't confirm the hypothesis about decreased connectivity in the hippocampus of experimental rats, but the efficacy of CA3-CA1 inputs seems to be lower. Besides excitatory transmission, the effectiveness of inhibition of paired-pulse facilitation at 15 ms inter-pulse interval was also significantly decreased. The observed effects of prenatal influences seem to develop under postnatal experience. We observed significant trend to more pronounced modifications upon age especially in the case of early handling and testing.

N2  - Among women of reproductive age, having children and careers often collide. As many men and women pursue careers, many have doubts as to when and whether they want to have children. At issue is combining childrearing with educational-professional development and accepting the loss of personal freedom that comes with building a family. These men and women are falsely reassured by popular beliefs that steroid contraception delays reproductive aging and that advances in new reproductive technologies can compensate for the age-related decline in fertility. As a result, women and their partners postpone childbearing without fully understanding the possible consequences. Yet age is the single most important determinant of male and female fertility-natural or treated. © 2006 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

N2  - Many popular varieties of commercially sold fish, including tilefish, seabass, shark, and swordfish, contain enough mercury so that eating them once or twice a month can lead to high mercury body burdens. Wisconsin has issued mercury-based sport-fish consumption advice to people of all ages since 1985. Wisconsin's advisory was revised in 2000 to address all inland waters and again in 2004 to integrate information about sport-caught fish with advice for commercially sold fish. Because of the increased popularity of fish as a source of dietary protein, a significant percentage of the US population may be at risk of methylmercury-induced health problems. Although several studies have assessed mercury exposure among children and women of child-bearing age, very little is known about mercury body burdens among men or postmenopausal women. This article describes fish consumption and mercury exposure among 14 people who consumed fish twice a week or more and 1 person who ate no fish. Steady-state blood mercury levels available for 10 adults and 1 child ranged from <5 to 58 μg/L and correlated well with dietary mercury intake estimates. Three of these individuals reported vague, subclinical symptoms such as mental confusion, sleep difficulty, balance problems, or visual disturbances, which improved after their mercury levels returned to normal. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - A model of the development of L/M cone ratios in the Old World primate retina is presented. It is supposed that during gestation, the cone cycles randomly between states in which it transcribes either L or M opsin. The current state determines and increases the probability that it will transcribe the same opsin in future cycles. These assumptions are sufficient to formalize the process as a Markov chain that can be modeled as an urn containing two types of balls, L and M. Drawing one ball results in the increase of its species and the decrease of the other. Over the long run, the urn will become populated with a single type of ball. This state corresponds to the photoreceptor adopting a fixed identity for its lifetime. We investigate the effect of the number of states and the rule that regulates the advantage of transition toward one cone type or another on the relation between fetal and adult L/M cone ratios. In the range of 100 to 1000 states, small variations of the initial L/M ratio or the transition advantage can each generate large changes in the final L/M ratio, in qualitative accord with the variation seen in human adult retinas. The time course to attain stable L/M ratios also varies with these parameters. If it is believed that the cycling follows a circadian rhythm, then final L/M cone ratios would be expected to stabilize shortly after birth in the human being and the macaque.

N2  - This review summarizes studies of sleep and other biological rhythms during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the postpartum period, focusing, where feasible, on studies in women who met DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th edition) criteria for a depressive disorder compared with healthy controls. The aim was to review supporting evidence for the hypothesis that disruption of the normal temporal relationship between sleep and other biological rhythms such as melatonin, core body temperature, cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or prolactin occurring during times of reproductive hormonal change precipitates depressive disorders in predisposed women. Treatment strategies, designed to correct these altered phase (timing) or amplitude abnormalities, thereby improve mood. Although there may be some common features to premenstrual, pregnancy and postpartum depressive disorders (e.g. elevated prolactin levels), a specific profile of sleep and biological rhythms distinguishes healthy from depressed women during each reproductive epoch. Further work is needed to characterize more fully the particular abnormalities associated with each reproductive state to identify common versus distinctive features for each diagnostic group. This information could serve as the basis for developing more targeted treatment strategies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective. - To investigate the frequency of main symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrom (OSAS) and their relationship with Pregnancy Induced-Hypertension (PIH) as well as Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IGR) as suggested by recent studies. Methodology. - Four hundred (and) thirty-eight enquiry forms completed during post-partum period were analysed, after exclusion of multiple pregnancies. Collected data were demographic characteristics, obstetrical events, sleep disorders during last trimester, screening of snoring and vigilance troubles with an Epworth score. Results. - Forty-five percentages of the patients reported to have habitual snoring during pregnancy. Among these, 85% were non-snorers before pregnancy. Daytime somnolence concerned 84,5% of the population with an Epworth score significatively increased (P < 0,0001). The prevalence of PIH was found to be 4,5%, with two apparently independent risk factors: the body mass index (OR = 1,1) and an association between snoring and increased vigilance trouble (OR = 2,6). No statistical difference was found concerning IGR. Conclusions. - SAS symptoms are frequent during pregnancy and snoring appears to be linked with PIH. However, polysomnographic data are not yet sufficient to explain pathophysiological mechanisms and find relevant diagnostic markers during pregnancy. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 20 weeks). They were designated depressed (N = 172) or nondepressed (N = 258) on the Structured Clinical Interview of Depression (SCID) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). They were given a second assessment when they were approximately 32 weeks gestational age. At both assessments they were given self-report measures (CES-D, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the State Anger Inventory) and provided urine samples for assays of cortisol, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) and serotonin. They were also given the VITAS scale for lower back pain and leg pain and a sleep disturbance scale. The stability of mood states and biochemistry across pregnancy (20 and 32 weeks) were assessed inasmuch as mood states, and biochemistry have been noted to predict prematurity and low birthweight. Significant correlations were noted for all variables except serotonin. Relationships between mood states and biochemistry were also noted but only between cortisol and depression, cortisol and anxiety, and epinephrine and anxiety. Significant stability was noted between the 20-week measures and the 32-week measures including depression, anxiety, anger, and cortisol. These were, in turn, correlated with each other and with, low back pain, leg pain, and sleep disturbance. These data suggest the stability of mood states and cortisol across pregnancy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: It is unclear if it is safe for babies to bed share with adults. In Ireland 49% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases occur when the infant is bed-sharing with an adult. Objective: To evaluate the effect of bed-sharing during the last sleep period on risk factors for SIDS in Irish infants. Design: An 8 year (1994-2001) population based case control study of 287 SIDS cases and 831 controls matched for date, place of birth, and sleep period. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Results: The risk associated with bed-sharing was three times greater for infants with low birth weight for gestation (UOR 16.28 v 4.90) and increased fourfold if the combined tog value of clothing and bedding was ≥10 (UOR 9.68 v 2.34). The unadjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 13.87 (95% CI 9.58 to 20.09) for infants whose mothers smoked and 2.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 4.39) for non-smokers. Age of death for bed-sharing and sofa-sharing infants (12.8 and 8.3 weeks, respectively) was less than for infants not sharing a sleep surface (21.0 weeks, p<0.001) and fewer bed-sharing cases were found prone (5% v 32%; p = 0.001). Conclusion: Risk factors for SIDS vary according to the infant's sleeping environment. The increased risk associated with maternal smoking, high tog value of clothing and bedding, and low z scores of weight for gestation at birth is augmented further by bed-sharing. These factors should be taken into account when considering sleeping arrangements for young infants.

N2  - The aims of this review are (a) to critically examine the epidemiologic evidence for a possible association between smoking and the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), (b) to review the pathology and postulated physiological mechanism(s) by which smoking might be causally related to SIDS, and (c) to provide recommendations for SIDS prevention in relation to tobacco smoking. Over 60 studies have examined the relation between maternal smoking during pregnancy and risk of SIDS. With regard to prone-sleep-position intervention programs, the pooled relative risk associated with maternal smoking was RR = 2.86 (95% CI = 2.77, 2.95) before and RR = 3.93 (95% CI = 3.78, 4.08) after. Epidemiologically, to distinguish the effect of active maternal smoking during pregnancy from involuntary tobacco smoking by the infants of smoking mothers is difficult. Clear evidence for environmental tobacco smoke exposure can be obtained by examining the risk of SIDS from paternal smoking when the mother is a non-smoker. Seven such studies have been carried out. The pooled unadjusted RR was 1.49 (95% CI = 1.25, 1.77). Consideration of the pathological and physiological effects of tobacco suggests that the predominant effect from maternal smoking comes from the in utero exposure of the fetus to tobacco smoke. Assuming a causal association between smoking and SIDS, about one-third of SIDS deaths might have been prevented if all fetuses had not been exposed to maternal smoking in utero. © 2006 Freund Publishing House Limited.

N2  - The physiological stress of different dental procedures (dental examination, dental prophylaxise, endodontics, restoration and tooth extraction) were determined in 62 healthy, non-smoking, non-pregnant kermanian patients with normal sleep pattern, age between 18 and 55 years (mean 32) with a salivary cortisol assay using radioimmunoassay technique. Expectorated saliva was collected at 4 time points: 10 min before the start of the procedure (stage A), 10 min after the patient was seated (stage B), at the end of the procedure (stage C) and 15 min after the completion of the procedure (stage D). Mean cortisol value for 248 samples at four different time points ranged between 12.62 to 24.56 nmol. L-1. The differences among the mean cortisol levels within each treatment group, was not significant but they were apparent. Only in the restoration group, the mean cortisol level during treatment was increased in comparison to stage A (20.51±10.88 vs. 16.02±9.46 nmol L-1). [During stage B, in restorative group the mean cortisol level was significantly higher than that of the Endodontics (22.25±12.17 vs. 12.62±6.66 nmol L-1, p<0.006). After the completion of therapy the cortisol level in examination group was higher than the prophylaxis (21.76±6.32 vs. 13.86±8.81 nmol L-1 p<0.015). These data suggest that the adrenal response associated with restorative procedures was higher than the other dental procedures in Kerman.

N2  - Purpose. To determine the urinary Levels of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), 2-naphthol (2-NAP) and cotinine in pregnant women exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Methods. One-hundred twenty-four pregnant women from four hospitals were interviewed using a questionnaire. Data obtained included demographic information and life styles. The levels of 1-OHP and 2-NAP in urine specimens from all participants were analyzed by HPLC-Fluorescence; urinary cotinine levels were measured by HPLC-photodiol instrumentation. Results. Urinary levels of 1-OHP, 2-NAP and cotinine in the ETS exposure group were higher than the non-exposure group; only urinary cotinine levels differed significantly between the two groups. Urinary levels of 1-OHP were positively correlated with 2-NAP (r = 0.14) and cotinine (r = 0.09), and 2-NAP and cotinine (r = 0.12); however, no significant correlation was found. Conclusions. Urinary cotinine and 2-NAP levels can be used as biomarkers to measure the exposure to poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) emitted from burning cigarettes.

N2  - This longitudinal, year-long study compared sleep-wake state organization in two groups of infants-infants whose mothers abused substances during their pregnancies and nonexposed, typically developing, age-matched comparison infants-to determine whether differences in sleep-wake state organization existed between the two groups. Seventeen infants of mothers who were participating in a parent-infant residential treatment program for substance abuse were enrolled. Their sleep-wake state organization over the first year of life was compared to that of 17 age-matched comparison infants. The intent was to follow each infant on five occasions over the first year of life using established methods of time-lapse videosomnography to record sleep-wake state organization; however, attrition in the substance-abusing group was problematic. Some sleep-wake variables (i.e., Active Sleep%, Quiet Sleep%, Awake%, number of nighttime awakenings) were similar for both groups of infants at comparable ages across the first year. Total sleep time and the longest sustained sleep period (sleep continuity variables) differed significantly at some of the ages measured. Although overall sleep architecture appears highly resilient and well organized, some indications of sleep fragmentation and shortened nighttime sleep periods were observed in the substance-exposed infants. More research is needed to explain why sleep-continuity variables and not sleep-state proportion variables differed between the two groups. © 2006 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

N2  - Objective: To follow the development of MEG sleep patterns and auditory evoked responses (AERs) during the first six months of life. Methods: The subjects were 18 neonates, born at conceptional age (CA) 36-42 weeks, following uncomplicated pregnancies. During each session, several 10-min MEG recordings were acquired in the presence of auditory stimulation. The recordings were classified into three distinct MEG patterns - low amplitude irregular; high-amplitude slow; and mixed - based largely on MEG amplitude and frequency. Averaged AERs were computed for the entire recording and for each MEG pattern within the recording. The results were based on analysis of 61 recording sessions of the 10 subjects who yielded three or more sessions of usable data. Results: Developmental changes in the MEG sleep patterns were most pronounced at the earliest ages. By CA 48 weeks the patterns had progressed to a more mature form, characterized by the prevalence of delta wave sleep, absence of discontinuity, and development of spindling and higher amplitude delta rhythms. In contrast to the MEG patterns, the AERs did not change markedly during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) and showed a simple morphology, consisting of a prominent deflection at 250 ms (P250m) and a more diffuse one at around 750 ms (N750m). During the period CA 48-54 weeks, however, a relatively abrupt transition occurred to a more complex morphology, characterized by a double peak with peak latencies 150 ms (P150m) and 350 ms (P350m). Beyond this period the AERs continued to evolve, showing biphasic complexes and the emergence of late components arising from outside the auditory cortex. Conclusions: Over the age range of this study the MEG sleep patterns and AER developed in succession, rather than concurrently; i.e. development of the sleep patterns was most rapid during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) while major development of the AERs commenced after this time. Significance: This finding suggests that the brain must achieve a certain level of overall maturity, reflected in the character of the MEG sleep patterns at CA 48 weeks, before the cortex enters a phase of significant functional development, reflected in the more rapid evolution of the AER after CA 48 weeks. The results of this study affirm the efficacy of MEG for spatiotemporal characterization of neonatal brain activity. © 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

N2  - Organic anion and cation transporters (OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs) mediate the proximal tubular secretion of numerous clinically important compounds, including various commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. Here, we report determination of the ontogeny of these transporters and of NaPi2 and SGLT1, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to determine expression levels of transporter genes in rat embryonic kidneys on each day of gestation from embryonic day (ed) 13 to ed18, in cultures of induced and uninduced metanephric mesenchyme (MM), and on each day of 1 week of whole embryonic kidney (WEK) culture. We also examined ontogeny of Oat1 protein expression in rat embryonic kidney by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we used uptake of fluorescein (FL) as a novel in vitro functional assay of OAT expression in WEK and MM. Developmental induction of OAT and OCT genes does not occur uniformly: some genes are induced early (e.g., Oat1 and Oat3, potential early markers of proximal tubulogenesis), and others after kidney development is relatively advanced (e.g., Oct1, a potential marker of terminal differentiation). The ontogeny of transporter genes in WEK and MM is similar to that observed in vivo, indicating that these organ culture systems may represent convenient in vitro models to study the developmental induction of OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs. Functional transport was evidenced by accumulation of FL in the developing tubule in WEK and MM organ cultures. Our findings on the renal ontogeny of OATs and OCTs could carry implications both for the development of more rational therapeutics for premature infants, as well as for our understanding of proximal tubule differentiation. © 2006 International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL. Seventy-eight women scoring ≥10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form SF-36), sleep quality, life stress, and social support. All women underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains, as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality, life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

N2  - Objective: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for postnatal depressive symptoms in a cohort of mothers of Pacific Island infants in Auckland, New Zealand. Method: The data were gathered as part of the Pacific Island Families Study, in which 1376 mothers were interviewed when their babies were 6 weeks old. The interview included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results: 16.4% of mothers were assessed as probably experiencing depression. Prevalence rates varied from 7.6% for Samoans to 30.9% for Tongans. In addition to ethnicity, risk factors identified by stepwisemultiple logistic regression included low Pacific Island acculturation, first birth, stress due to insufficient food, household income less than $40 000, difficulty with transport, dissatisfaction with pregnancy, birth experience, baby's sleep patterns, partner relationship and home. A large prevalence difference between Tongans and other groups remained when the effects of other risk factors were controlled statistically. Conclusions: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Pacific mothers is at the upper end of the range typically reported. Focus on the overall rate, however, obscures substantial variation between groups. Risk factors are generally similar to those identified in previous research. Implications: The findings have implications for prevention and treatment and caution against assuming homogeneity within ethnic categories. Further research is required to explain differences in prevalence between Tongan and other Pacific Island groups. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

N2  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, especially at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 350 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, 3 times per day, from day E14 until birth, and the pups allowed to mature. Intracellularly recorded PPN neurons in 12-21 day rat brainstem slices were tested for intrinsic membrane properties, including the hyperpolarization- activated cation current Ih, which is known to drive oscillatory activity. Type II (A-current) PPN cells from 12-16 day old offspring of treated animals had a 1 / 2max Ih amplitude of (mean ± SE) 4.1 ± 0.9 mV, while 17-21 day cells had a higher 1 / 2max Ih of 9.9 ± 1.1 mV (p < 0.0001). Cells from 12-16 day old control brainstems had a 1 / 2max Ih of 1.3 ± 0.1 mV, which was lower (p < 0.05) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring; while 17-21 day old cells from controls had a 1 / 2max Ih of 3.3 ± 0.3 mV, which was also lower (p < 0.01) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring. In addition, changes in resting membrane potential [control - 65. ± 0.9 mV (n = 32); exposed - 55.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], and action potential (AP) threshold [control - 56.5 ± 0.7 mV (n = 32), exposed - 47.0 ± 1.4 mV (n = 27) (p < 0.0001)], suggest that prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke induced marked changes in cells in the cholinergic arm of the RAS, rendering them more excitable. Such data could partially explain the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - For the first 10 days of pregnancy and the first 12 days of pseudopregnancy, the secretion of prolactin (PRL) from pituitary lactotrophs is rhythmic, with two surges/day. This rhythm can also be triggered by bolus injection of oxytocin (OT). We describe a mathematical model for the initiation, maintenance, and termination of the OT-induced PRL rhythm. In our model, the mechanism for this circadian rhythm is mutual interaction between lactotrophs and neuroendocrine dopamine (DA) neurons. This rhythm is, under normal lighting conditions, entrained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but persists in the absence of input from the SCN. We postulate that OT injection triggers the rhythm by activating a population of bistable hypothalamic neurons that innervate and inhibit DA neurons. The bistable nature of these neurons allows them to act as a memory device, maintaining the rhythm long after OT has been cleared from the blood. The mechanism for this memory device and the arguments supporting it are detailed with computer simulations. Finally, we consider potential targets for a rhythm-terminating factor and make predictions that may be used to determine which mechanism is operational in terminating the OT- or mating-induced PRL rhythm.

N2  - Objective. - To evaluate the frequency of menorrhagia and endometriosis in female migraineurs compared to age-matched women without headache. Background. - Migraine predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of migraine and menstrual disorders. Methods. - Women diagnosed with migraine, using International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular event history, and vascular risk factors. Results. - Fifty female migraineurs between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P= .77) and hormone replacement therapy (12% vs. 8%, P= .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64 % vs. 80%, P= .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P= .84). Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P= .009), with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P= .003), and significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert scale) with work/school participation (P= .02), family activities (P < .0001), sleep (P= .003), life enjoyment (P= .001), mood (P= .02), and overall quality of life (P= .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P= .001). The migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P= .017) but not more serious bleeding problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine group (28% vs. 12%, P= .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia, endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4). There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P= .05), transient ischemic attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P= .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P= .08) in the migraineurs. Conclusion. - Women with migraine have a higher frequency of menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet function, in migraineurs. © 2006 by American Headache Society Published by Blackwell Publishing.

N2  - Background: Emerging evidence on faster growth in preterm infants with higher heart rate as opposed to the classical approach calls for further research. Aims: to test whether (1) high or low heart rate and (2) heart rate during the first days of life predict greater weight gain in preterm infants. Methods: A retrospective study analyzing two daily measures of heart rate obtained during restful sleep, total daily calorie intake and daily weight gain measured always in the morning before meal were collected from the medical files. Results: Analysis of 90 healthy preterm infants born at 32-36 weeks of gestation revealed that increased mean heart rate during hospitalization predicted greater weight gain even when controlling for calorie intake, birth weight, gestational age, appropriateness of birth weight for gestational age, and length of hospitalization. Mean heart rate during the first three days of life yielded the same pattern of results. Post-hoc analysis of variance between infants with mean daily heart rate ≤ 139 bpm vs. ≥ 140 bpm showed that infants with higher heart rate achieved a significantly higher weight gain. Conclusions: It is suggested that, contrary to adults, in neonates an anabolic activity is represented by increased sympathetic functioning within the normal range. The implications of a slower growth rate for additional developmental care and individual considerations of appropriate stimulation in preterm infants are discussed. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing and snoring are common in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to determine whether pregnancy was associated with upper airway narrowing. One-hundred females in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited and 50 agreed to be restudied 3 months after delivery. One-hundred nonpregnant females were also recruited. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Snoring was less common in nonpregnant (17%) than pregnant females (41%; odds ratio (OR) 3.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-6.74) and returned to nonpregnant levels after delivery (18%; OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40). Pregnant females had significantly smaller upper airways than nonpregnant females at the oropharyngeal junction when seated (mean difference 0.12; 95% CI 0.008-0.25), and smaller mean pharyngeal areas in the seated (mean difference 0.14; 95% CI 0.001-0.28), supine (mean difference 0.11; 95% CI 0.01-0.22) and lateral postures (mean difference 0.13; 95% CI 0.02-0.24) compared with the nonpregnant females. Pregnant females had smaller mean pharyngeal areas compared with post-partum in the seated (mean difference 0.18; 95% CI 0.02-0.32), supine (mean difference 0.20; 95% CI 0.06-0.35) and lateral postures (mean difference 0.26; 95% CI 0.12-0.39). In conclusion, this study confirmed increased snoring and showed narrower upper airways during the third trimester of pregnancy. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2006.

N2  - Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy is a rare and difficult to diagnose disorder. We describe the case of a 30-yr-old woman presenting with symptoms and signs of mild hypercortisolism, in which ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome was diagnosed. Urinary cortisol excretion was elevated and circadian rhythm of cortisol was absent. ACTH levels were low. In addition, plasma cortisol failed to suppress after a high dexamethasone dose. An abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed a left adrenal mass. While diagnosis work-up was still in progress, the patient became pregnant and wanted to carry her pregnancy to full-term. Hypercortisolism was successfully controlled with metyrapone, which was started at 8 weeks of gestation. At 16 weeks of gestation, a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the gland showed a benign adrenocortical adenoma. The patient developed secondary adrenal insufficiency and was discharged on 20 mg hydrocortisone daily dose. At 30 weeks of gestation, the patient had a pre-term rupture of membranes and underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery. The newborn was a normal virilized male who weighed 1280 g. No apparent metyrapone-induced teratogenic effects were observed and there was no clinical or biochemical suppression of adrenocortical function. In conclusion, in adrenal Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy, medical treatment with metyrapone as soon as the diagnosis is made, in combination with laparoscopic surgery during the second trimester, are useful in preventing complications secondary to hypercortisolism and safe both for the mother and infant. ©2006, Editrice Kurtis.

N2  - From earliest times, psychiatrists have described biological rhythm disturbances as characteristic of mood disorders. The present flourishing of circadian biology has revealed the molecular basis of 24-h rhythmicity driven by 'clock' genes, as well as the importance of zeitgebers (synchronisers). Winter depression was first modelled on regulation of animal behaviour by seasonal changes in daylength, and led to application of light as the first successful chronobiological treatment in psychiatry. Light therapy has great promise for many other disorders (e.g. sleep-wake cycle disturbances in Alzheimer's dementia, bulimia, premenstrual disorder, depression during pregnancy) and, importantly, as an adjuvant to antidepressant medication in major non-seasonal depression. The pineal hormone melatonin is also a zeitgeber for the human circadian system, in addition to possessing direct sleep-promoting effects. Chronobiology has provided efficacious non-pharmaceutical treatments for mood disorders (such as sleep deprivation or light therapy) as well as novel approaches to new drugs (e.g. agomelatine). © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) may be associated with both endothelial dysfunction (ED) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). It was hypothesised that females with PET would demonstrate both SDB and ED, and that a correlation between these two would suggest a potential causative association. A total of 17 females with PET and 25 matched females with uncomplicated pregnancy were studied. They underwent a nocturnal ambulatory sleep study (using Watch_PAT100) and noninvasive evaluation of endothelial function utilising the reactive hyperaemia test (using Endo_PAT 2000). A higher ratio of post- to pre-occlusion pulse-wave amplitude (endothelial function index (EFI)) indicated better endothelial function. Females with PET had a significantly higher respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and lower EFI than controls (18.4±8.4 versus 8.3±1.3·h-1, and 1.5±0.1 versus 1.8±0.1, respectively). Blood pressure significantly correlated with RDI and with EFI. EFI tended to correlate with RDI. In conclusion, these results suggest that both sleep-disordered breathing and endothelial dysfunction are more likely to occur in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia than in females with uncomplicated pregnancies. The current authors speculate that respiratory disturbances contribute to the functional abnormality of the blood vessels seen in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia, although causality cannot be determined based on this study.

N2  - We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self-reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipú Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p = 0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women. Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Inc.

N2  - Background: Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes. Methods: Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have been used for comparison. Findings: Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone - rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed. Interpretation: Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.

N2  - Links between neonatal biological rhythms and the emergence of interaction rhythms were examined in 3 groups (N = 71): high-risk preterms (HR; birth weight < 1,000 g), low-risk preterms (LR; birth weight = 1,700-1,850 g), and full-term (FT) infants. Once a week for premature infants and on the 2nd day for FT infants, sleep-wake cyclicity was extracted from 4-hr observations and cardiac vagal tone was measured. At term age, infant orientation was tested with the Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale. At 3 months, arousal modulation and emotion regulation were assessed, and mother-infant synchrony was computed from microanalysis of face-to-face interactions using time-series analysis. Sleep-wake amplitudes showed a developmental leap at 31 weeks gestation, followed by a shift in vagal tone at 34 weeks gestation. At term, differences among FT, LR, and HR infants were observed for biological rhythms in a linear-decline pattern. Sleep-wake cyclicity, vagal tone, newborn orientation, and arousal modulation were each uniquely predictive of mother-infant synchrony. The organization of physiological oscillators appears to lay the foundation for the infant's capacity to partake in a temporally matched social dialogue.

N2  - Background: Genes underlying circadian rhythm generation are expressed in many tissues. We explore a role for circadian rhythms in the timing and efficacy of mouse reproduction and development using a genetic approach. Methods: We compare fecundity in ClockΔ19 mutant mice (a dominant-negative protein essential for circadian rhythm activity) and in Vipr2-/- null mutant mice (affecting the generation and output of the circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus) with wild type (WT) litter mates under both a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle and continuous darkness. Results: Uteri from ClockΔ19 mice show no circadian rhythm and Vipr2-/- mice show a phase-advanced rhythm compared to WT uteri. In neither mutant line were homozygous or heterozygous fetuses lethal. Sexually mature adults of both mutant lines showed mildly reduced male in vivo (but not in vitro) fertility and irregular estrous cycles exacerbated by continuous darkness. However, pregnancy rates and neonatal litter sizes were not affected. The ClockΔ19 mutant line was distinguishable from the Vipr2-/- null mutant line in showing more peri-natal delivery problems and very poor survival of offspring to weaning. Conclusions: A fully functional central and peripheral circadian clock is not essential for reproduction and development to term, but has critical roles peri-natally and post-partum. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Sleep disorders are linked with mood disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824 women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances following an induced abortion compared to a birth. The difference was most pronounced in the first 180 days after pregnancy resolution and was not significant after the third year.

N2  - A combined time-variant analysis of nonlinear stability and parametric bispectral measures was applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep between 0.7 and 0.9 gestation to examine the maturation of sleep states and synchronization patterns of the ECoG. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already at 0.7 gestation and suggests the presence of premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature NREM sleep. Maturation of NREM sleep begun at 0.78 gestation and preceded that of REM sleep that begun at 0.85 gestation. Our results suggest that maturation of brain stem and thalamic function precedes that of cortical function.

N2  - Objective: To examine the association between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and physiological measures of regulation, which included heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Methods: Potential mediators and moderators of this association were explored. Participants were 141 mother-infant dyads (77 cocaine exposed and 64 nonexposed) recruited at birth. Average infant HR and RSA was assessed at 4-8 weeks of age during a 15 minute period of sleep. Results: Results indicated a dose-dependent effect of prenatal exposure to cocaine on RSA. There was no evidence that fetal growth or other prenatal exposure to substances mediated this association or that fetal growth or maternal age moderated this association. Regression analyses also indicated that birth weight (BW), but not birthlength (BL), head circumference (HC) or other substance use, mediated the association between prenatal exposure to cocaine and heart rate. Conclusions: These results suggest that cocaine exposure is associated with physiological regulation at 4-8 weeks of age and highlight the importance of considering level of exposure when assessing infant outcomes. © The Author 2005.

N2  - Sex hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers at least of the humoral immunity and androgens and progesterone (and glucocorticoids) as natural immune-suppressors. Several physiological, pathological, and therapeutic conditions may change the serum estrogen milieu and/or peripheral conversion rate, including the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, being elderly, chronic stress, altered circadian rhythms, inflammatory cytokines, and use of corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, and steroid hormonal replacements, inducing altered androgen/estrogen ratios and related effects. In particular, cortisol and melatonin circadian rhythms are altered, at least in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and partially involve sex hormone circadian synthesis and levels as well. Abnormal regulation of aromatase activity (i.e., increased activity) by inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6) may partially explain the abnormalities of peripheral estrogen synthesis in RA (i.e., increased availability of 17-beta estradiol and possible metabolites in synovial fluids) and in systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as the altered serum sex-hormone levels and ratio (i.e., decreased androgens and DHEAS). In the synovial fluids of RA patients, the increased estrogen concentration is observed in both sexes and is more specifically characterized by the hydroxylated forms, in particular 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a mitogenic and cell proliferative endogenous hormone. Local effects of sex hormones in autoimmune rheumatic diseases seems to consist mainly in modulation of cell proliferation and cytokine production (i.e., TNFalpha, Il-1, IL-12). In this respect, it is interesting that male patients with RA seem to profit more from anti-TNFalpha strategies than do female patients. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.

N2  - Supplementation during pregnancy forms a vital part of the well-being and development of the unborn child as well as the mother. Very often different brands of over-the-counter vitamins and minerals are taken, without considering the possibility of exceeding the maximum daily allowance, particularly where it concerns fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A. Although many people are aware of the consequences of taking too little vitamin A, this fat-soluble vitamin is stored in the body and over-dosage may occur when taking high doses. In this paper we investigate the effects of hypo- and hypervitaminosis A on craniofacial structures, lungs, hearts, limbs and the kidneys as well as the involvement in foetal nervous system development and post-natal sensorimotor functioning. Furthermore, we discuss how hypo- and hypervitaminosis A may affect the midline and lateral parts of the cerebellum, vermis, flocculi, ganglionic cell layer as well as the suprachiasmatic nucleas of the brain. Changes in the functioning of these areas due to hypo- and hypervitaminosis A, may lead to developmental and learning disabilities involving all forms of motor learning, vestibular functioning, eye and visual system deficits, disrupted sleep rhythms as well as altered mood and emotional processes.

N2  - This study examined the association between maternal smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during pregnancy and infant heart rate. Participants were 62 mother-infant dyads where mother smoked during pregnancy, 47 dyads where mother did not smoke during pregnancy but was exposed to ETS and 47 dyads where mother did not smoke and was not exposed to ETS. Average heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed at 2-4 weeks of age during sleep. Infants in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than nonexposed infants. Furthermore, boys in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than girls. These results highlight the importance of considering prenatal ETS exposure and infant gender when assessing infant outcomes. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Obesity is a worldwide growing epidemic. The negative influence of obesity is huge and considered to be one of the major contributors to health problems in the western world. There is a significant association between obesity and diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, some cancers and syndromes of sleep apnea. Furthermore, obesity was described to have a negative influence on fertility, pregnancy, labor and pregnancy outcomes. It was also discovered that obesity was significantly associated with gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus and complications in cesarean delivery and anesthesia. This review aims to present updates on the relationship between obesity and pregnancy and labor outcomes, emphasizing the significance of obesity as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome.

N2  - Parental smoking and prone sleep positioning are recognized causal features of Sudden Infant Death. This study quantifies the relationship between prenatal smoking and infant death over the time period of the Back to Sleep campaign in the United States, which encouraged parents to use a supine sleeping position for infants. This retrospective cohort study utilized the Colorado Birth Registry. All singleton, normal birth weight infants born from 1989 to 1998 were identified and linked to the Colorado Infant Death registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between outcomes of interest and prenatal maternal cigarette use. Potential confounders analyzed included infant gender, gestational age, and birth year as well as maternal marital status, ethnicity, pregnancy interval, age, education, and alcohol use. We analyzed 488,918 birth records after excluding 5835 records with missing smoking status. Smokers were more likely to be single, non-Hispanic, less educated, and to report alcohol use while pregnant (p < 0.001). The study included 598 SIDS cases of which 172 occurred in smoke-exposed infants. Smoke exposed infants were 1.9 times (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) more likely to die of SIDS. The attributed risk associating smoking and SIDS increased during the study period from approximately 50% to 80%. During the entire study period 59% (101/172) of SIDS deaths in smoke-exposed infants were attributed to maternal smoking. Due to a decreased overall rate of SIDS likely due to changing infant sleep position, the attributed risk associating maternal smoking and SIDS has increased following the Back to Sleep campaign. Mothers should be informed of the 2-fold increased rate of SIDS associated with maternal cigarette consumption.

N2  - A few cases of death worldwide during GH treatment in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been recently described. The evaluation of further cases is needed to better identify possible causal mechanism(s), as well as to suggest some additional guidelines for prevention. We report the death of 2 additional children with genetically confirmed PWS in the first months of GH therapy. Case 1: This 3.9-yr-old girl was born at 39 weeks gestation. Low GH response to two stimulation tests was observed. GH administration was started at the age of 3.5 yr (0.33 mg/kg per week), when the patient was at 130% of her ideal body weight (ibw). Hypertrophy of adenoids was previously demonstrated. Snoring and sleep apnea were present before GH treatment, and did not increase during therapy. Four months later she died at home suddenly in the morning. Case 2: This patient was a 6.3-yr-old boy. He was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. At the age of 6 yr, his weight was at 144% of his ibw. He showed reduced GH secretion during provocation tests, and GH therapy was started (0.20 mg/kg per week). The previously reported nocturnal respiratory impairment had worsened after beginning GH administration. Tonsils and adenoids hypertrophy were noted. At the age of 6.3 yr he died at home in the morning following an acute crisis of apnea. These additional cases seem to confirm that some children with PWS may be at risk of sudden death at the beginning of GH therapy. © 2005, Editrice Kurtis.

N2  - Background: Cholelithiasis is a common disease worldwide and many epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of cholelithiasis is rapidly increasing in the last decade. Aims: To provide reference evidence for decision-making in cholelithiasis prevention through analyzing the risk factors related to the increasing incidence of cholelithiasis in China. Methods: The results of case-control studies on risk factors of cholelithiasis in China published domestically and abroad from January 1978 to February 2004 were analyzed by meta-analysis method. The pooled odds ratio(OR)and 95% confidence interval(CI)of the risk factors were calculated. Results: The cumulative cases and controls were 3 145 and 3 812, respectively. Greasy food (2.49), meat diet (2.19), favoring of animal edible oil (2.19), favoring of animal viscera (2.20), having no breakfast (2.03), body mass index ≥25 (1.95), hyperlipidemia (1.67), multigravidity (1.47), menopause (2.02), history of biliary ascariasis (6.25), history of cholecystitis (28.42), family history of cholelithiasis (3.36), alcohol drinking (1.54), lack of exercise (2.39), taking contraceptive orally (2.50) were the main risk factors for cholelithiasis in China. Vegetable diet (0.42), milk drinking (0.43), deep-well water drinking (in the countryside) (0.51), sleep after 22 p.m. (0.55) were the protective factors for prevention of cholelithiasis. Conclusions: Improving the dietary habit, breakfast eating, milk drinking, deep-well water drinking (in the countryside), body weight control, decreasing gravidity among women, decreasing of wine or liquor drinking, more exercises, and sleep after 22 p.m. are factors useful in prevention of cholelithiasis.

N2  - It has recently become obvious that the prevalence of obesity has been rapidly increasing in the United States, as well as other countries, over the past two decades. This change has involved both sexes, all age ranges and various ethnic groups. The rising prevalence in children and adolescents is of particular concern because of the implications for negative effects on their morbidity and mortality in young adulthood. Obesity is definitely associated with a relative increase in diabetes, cardiovascular disease, various cancers, respiratory disorders in sleep, gallbladder disease and osteoarthritis. It also has negative effects on a variety of other conditions such as pregnancy complications, menstrual disorders, psychological disorders, and urinary stress incontinence. It is an integral component of the metabolic syndrome, which is emerging as a key constellation of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Dealing with this epidemic will require the mobilization of multiple constituencies and allocation of adequate resources. These approaches should be instituted with urgency.

N2  - To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome relevant in Lithuania. A nationwide case-control study surveying parents of 35 infants who died from sudden infant death syndrome during the period of 1997-2000 and parents of 145 control infants matched with SIDS infants for date of birth and for region of birth was carried out. Deaths incidence was greater in the warm period (60%) vs. cold period (40%). Prone and side sleeping positions both carried no increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome compared with supine because of a rare prone sleeping (4.1% of controls vs. 0% of dead infants) and more prevalent side than supine sleeping (84.8% of controls vs. 94.3% of dead infants) in the controls as well as the cases. Bed sharing for the whole night as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome has not been confirmed, either, as bed sharing was common only for the controls (13.8% of controls vs. 0% of dead infants). Routine sleeping environment factors such as heavy wrapping (> or =4 togs) of an infant (odds ratio 8.49; 95% confidence interval 2.38 to 30.32), sleeping in a bassinet (4.22; 1.16 to 15.38) and maternal factors such as maternal education < or =12 years (4.48; 1.34 to 14.94), unplanned pregnancy (5.22; 1.49 to 18.18) and > or =2 previous live births (3.90; 1.00 to 15.10) were significantly associated with sudden infant death syndrome on multivariate analysis. The results of this first population-based case-control study have shed some light on the epidemiology of the syndrome in Lithuania. Although the mortality of sudden infant death syndrome in Lithuania is not high, it might be lowered moreover by public informing about sudden infant death syndrome and related risk factors. Special attention must be paid to mothers with low education on potentially modifiable risk factors such as routine heavy wrapping of an infant during sleep, routine sleeping in a bassinet and unplanned pregnancy.

N2  - Objective. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the number 1 cause of postneonatal infant death. Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare. Methods. Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon's population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant "always," "almost always," "sometimes," or "never." Frequent bedsharing was defined as "always" or "almost always"; infrequent was defined as "sometimes" or "never." Results. Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers. Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse. Conclusions. Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants <8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death "suffocation" or "overlay asphyxiation" simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This "diagnostic drift" may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants <3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opiates. SEARCH STRATEGY: The previous review was updated with additional searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966-December 2004) and EMBASE (1980-December 2004) supplemented by searches of conference abstracts and citation lists of published articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to opiate or control. Control could include an opiate, sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included control of symptoms, seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Seven studies enrolling a total of 585 infants met inclusion criteria (Carin 1983; Finnegan 1984; Jackson 2004; Kaltenbach 1986; Kandall 1983; Khoo 1995; Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984; Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies; sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four studies; and imbalances in group characteristics after randomisation in one study.Opiate (morphine) vs supportive care only: One study (Khoo 1995) found no significant effect on treatment failure (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a significant increase in hospital stay (MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and significant reductions in time to regain birthweight (MD -2.8 days, 95% -5.3, -0.3) and duration of supportive care (MD -197.2 minutes/day, 95% CI -274.2, -120.3).Opiate vs phenobarbitone: Meta-analysis of four studies found no significant difference in treatment failure (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51, 1.11). One of these studies (Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used only opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be interpreted with caution. One study (Jackson 2004) reported a significant reduction in duration of treatment and admission to the nursery for infants receiving morphine compared to phenobarbitone. One study (Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate.Opiate vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of opiate.No study reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbitone, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery admission for infants on morphine. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.

N2  - In a prospective study of 247 pregnant Chinese women, the prevalence of sleep disturbances across pregnancy has been assessed using a set of validated questionnaires including the Sleep and Health Questionnaire (SHQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The frequency of self-reported snoring increased from 29.7% in the first trimester to 40.5% and 46.2% in the second and third trimesters, respectively, with an increase in the prevalence of moderate or severe snoring from 1% in the first trimester to 7.2% in the third trimester (P < 0.01). There was a higher frequency of moderate to severe snoring intensity among subjects with BMI ≥25 compared with those with BMI <25 kg/m2 in the third trimester (20.8%vs 5.3%, P < 0.01). Subjective sleepiness, as determined by the ESS, increased significantly from 8.6 to 9.4 and 9.6 in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. © RCOG 2005.

N2  - Background. Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by smoking and/or drinking. We investigate here the joint effect of smoking and drinking with respect to sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Methods. Survey of about 16,000 pregnant women in Japan, conducted in 2002 using a self-administered questionnaire. Results. Both smoking and drinking increased the odds of sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, early-morning awakening, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome. The joint odds ratios for smoking and drinking corresponded more or less to the products of the odds ratio for smoking or drinking. Conclusion. Smoking and drinking are independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy, in addition to their other well-known side-effects. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - This descriptive research aimed to analyze the Nursing Diagnoses identified in low-risk pregnant patients. Eleven pregnant women received prenatal care in a safe maternity in the state of Goiás. The data were classified under the NANDA (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) taxonomy II and analyzed according to the referrals in obstetrics. Twenty-five different Nursing Diagnoses were identified. All pregnant women presented: insufficient knowledge (different levels and subjects), disturbed sleep pattern, activity intolerance, self-care deficit (bathing and hygiene), stress urinary incontinence, and some risk diagnoses. Identifying NANDA's Nursing Diagnoses allows the identification of the risk level, early detection of complications, and individualization in nursing assistance.

N2  - Our understanding of when the fetus can experience pain has been largely shaped by neuroanatomy. However, completion of the cortical nociceptive connections just after mid-gestation is only one part of the story. In addition to critically reviewing evidence for whether the fetus is ever awake or aware, and thus able to truly experience pain, we examine the role of endogenous neuroinhibitors, such as adenosine and pregnanolone, produced within the feto-placental unit that contribute to fetal sleep states, and thus mediate suppression of fetal awareness. The uncritical view that the nature of presumed fetal pain perception can be assessed by reference to the prematurely born infant is challenged. Rigorously controlled studies of invasive procedures and analgesia in the fetus are required to clarify the impact of fetal nociception on postnatal pain sensitivity and neural development, and the potential benefits or harm of using analgesia in this unique setting. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The study estimates the unpredictable disorder (chaos) within the 24 h pattern of sinus R-R intervals (SRRI) in clinically healthy pregnant women (CHPW) and clinically healthy non-pregnant women (CHNPW), in order to evaluate the early gestational changes in neurovegetative cardiac pacing. SRRI were provided by the 24-h Holler ECG of 10 CHPW and 10 CHNPW. SRRI were investigated by descriptive conventional statistics by means of the Time and Frequency Domain Analysis, and subsequently, in their chaotic component by means of entropy analysis. Both the SRRI and entropy were tested via the Cosinor method to better decipher whether or not the periodic disorder in heart rate variability is modified in pregnancy as a result of a gestational tonic resetting of the cardiac sympatho-vagal regulation. Cosinor analysis documented that the arcadian rhythm of both the SRRI and entropy were preserved in CHNPW and CHPW. However, the circadian rhythm of SRRI and entropy in CHPW exhibited a significantly decreased 24 h mean. Via the analysis of the rhythmicity of entropy, this study has documented that the chaos in the 24 h pattern of SRRI is less prominent in CHPW than in CHNPW. Such a reduction of level in the deterministic periodic chaos of heart rate variability provides evidence that, in early pregnancy, a tonic elevation of the sympathetic activity regulates cardiac pacing.

N2  - Women are at greatest risk of suffering from depression during the childbearing years and thus may either become pregnant while taking an antidepressant or may require a prescription for one during pregnancy. The antidepressant fluoxetine (FX) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which increases serotonin neurotransmission. Serotonin is involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological systems, including the sleep-wake cycle, circadian rhythms and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Each of these systems also plays an important role in fetal development. Compared with other antidepressant drugs, the SSRIs, such as FX, have fewer side effects. Because of this, they are now frequently prescribed, especially during pregnancy. Clinical studies suggest poor neonatal outcome after exposure to FX in utero. Recent studies in the sheep fetus describe the physiological effects of in utero exposure to FX with an 8 day infusion during late gestation in the sheep. This is a useful model for determining the effects of FX on fetal physiology. The fetus can be studied for weeks in its normal intrauterine environment with serial sampling of blood, thus permitting detailed studies of drug disposition in both mother and fetus combined with monitoring of fetal behavioural state and cardiovascular function. Fluoxetine causes an acute increase in plasma serotonin levels, leading to a transient reduction in uterine blood flow. This, in turn, reduces the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, thereby presenting a mechanism for reducing growth and/or eliciting preterm delivery. Moreover, because FX crosses the placenta, the fetus is exposed directly to FX, as well as to the effects of the drug on the mother. Fluoxetine increases high-voltage/non-rapid eye movement behavioural state in the fetus after both acute and chronic exposure and, thus, may interfere with normal fetal neurodevelopment. Fluoxetine also alters hypothalamic function in the adult and increases the magnitude of the prepartum rise in fetal cortisol concentrations in sheep. Fetal FX exposure does not alter fetal circadian rhythms in melatonin or prolactin. Studies of the effects of FX exposure on fetal development in the sheep are important in defining possible physiological mechanisms that explain human clinical studies of birth outcomes after FX exposure. To date, there have been insufficient longer-term follow-up studies in any precocial species of offspring exposed to SSRIs in utero. Thus, further investigation of the long-term consequences of in utero exposure to FX and other SSRIs, as well as the mechanisms involved, are required for a complete understanding of the impact of these agents on development. This should involve studies in both humans and appropriate animal models. © CSIRO 2005.

N2  - We report a rare case of type 1 diabetes in a woman associated with acromegaly who was treated with surgery after pregnancy. An 18-year-old woman came to our hospital in April, 1998, complaining of thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, appetite loss, body weight loss of 8 kg in a month, and amenorrhea beginning 2 months earlier. Based on laboratory data, she was diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although we suspected her of having acromegaly because of high growth hormone (GH) levels (6.9 or 8.5 ng/ml), blood levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were within normal range and the circadian rhythm of her blood GH levels was normally maintained. Her blood GH level was elevated to 12.6 ng/ml 15 minutes after a TRH administration. Blood GH levels were suppressed from 49 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml 4 hours after an oral administration of 2.5 mg of bromocriptine. A magnetic resonance images (MRIs) showed pituitary swelling, but no nodules were found in the pituitary. Therefore, we diagnosed her as having acromegaly and observed her without surgery, while prescribing diet therapy and intensive insulin therapy for diabetes. We started a treatment of oral administration of 7.5 mg of bromocriptine per day for the acromegaly from April 28, 2000, because her elevated GH was suspected of causing her diabetes to be poorly controlled. During a pregnancy from October, 2000 to September, 2001, diabetic control was improved with increased administration of insulin under a constant dose of bromocriptine. She delivered a normal full-term infant. After the bromocriptine therapy was stopped as she hoped to breastfeed, blood levels of GH and IGF-1 became elevated and her diabetic control deteriorated. As her pituitary tumor observed in pituitary MRIs became larger during the course, a transsphenoidal surgery was performed on March 8, 2002. After the surgery, blood levels of GH and IGF-1 lowered and diabetic control improved again. We concluded as follows: to rule out acromegaly in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, 1) measurements of serum GH and IGF-1 should be performed, and 2) pituitary MRIs should be performed if blood levels of GH or IGF-1 are high.

N2  - Background: Although incident snoring is common in pregnant women and has been proposed as a potential risk factor for adverse maternal-fetal outcomes, the development of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy has not been prospectively described. Methods: Using the Apnea Symptom Score from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, we prospectively assessed symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime somnolence in 155 women to determine whether symptoms increased during pregnancy and the characteristics associated with increasing symptoms. Results: We found that sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (Apnea Symptom Score, 0.44 (SEM 0.58) vs 0.95 (0.09, P < .001) and the degree of daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 8.6 (0.3) vs 10.2 (0.4), P = .0003) increased significantly during pregnancy. Women with higher baseline body mass indexes and greater increases in neck circumference during pregnancy reported higher apnea symptom scores. Of the 155 subjects, 11.4% reported an increase in Apnea Symptom Score of 2 units or more, consistent with a clinically significant increase in symptoms; these women experienced a significantly greater increase in subjective sleepiness than other subjects (P = .03). Excessive daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) was prevalent throughout pregnancy (31.0%-45.5%). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing increase during pregnancy and that more than 10% of our subjects may be at risk for developing sleep apnea during pregnancy. Excessive daytime somnolence was highly prevalent even early in pregnancy and became increasingly common as pregnancy progressed.

N2  - This study aimed at examining any relation between the circadian variation in blood pressure (BP) in human pregnancy and fetal growth. A prospective study included 52 pregnant women monitored during the third trimester of pregnancy. There were 33 uncomplicated pregnancies with normal fetal growth (Group 1) and 19 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), confirmed at birth (Group 2). Ten women (five in each group) had pregnancy-induced hypertension. All women were hospitalized and followed a similar daily routine. BP was recorded with an automatic wearable device. Measurements were obtained every 20 min for 24 ± 1 h. BP profiles were analyzed by conventional statistical methods and by cosinor, involving the least squares fit of cosine curves with an anticipated period (24 h) to the data. BP parameters, fetal outcome, demographic and obstetric characteristics were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression and multivariate analyses were used to assess factors putatively associated with fetal outcome. The circadian amplitude of diastolic BP was found to be larger in normotensive women with IUGR. As gauged by odds ratios (OR), the circadian amplitude of diastolic BP (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8; P = 0.03) and hematocrit (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0-1.9; P = 0.04) were the only variables positively and independently associated with IUGR. In the presence of maternal hypertension, the circadian amplitude of systolic BP was negatively associated with IUGR (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-1.0; P = 0.03). A larger circadian variation in diastolic BP, rather than a difference in the mean value of systolic or diastolic BP, was found to be statistically significantly associated with IUGR. This study adds another condition in which the circadian BP amplitude constitutes a harbinger of elevated risk, apart from an association with a shortened lifespan in the absence or presence of malignant hypertension and with an increased risk of stroke and nephropathy reported earlier. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

N2  - Few studies exist that identify a useful self-report measure of physical activity for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 y ears. The women wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring, the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r = 49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day. © 2005 Sage Publications.

N2  - The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and (b) to determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant (≤ 31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards- Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had no apparent effect on lactation. © 2005 Sage Publications.

N2  - Coffee has become an essential accompaniment to daily life, so much so that the aromatic cup has become a pleasant ritual that helps equilibrate and tones the nervous system. Coffee is an aqueous solution containing numerous substances that are present in varying degree according to the type of plant (Arabica, Robusta), the toasting process, and method of preparation used to make the coffee. Besides the aromatic composts present, coffee contains trigonelline (which during toasting is transformed into nicotinic acid or vitamin PP), chlorogenicacid, caffeic acid, potassium, essential oil of coffee and of course caffeine, a trimetyl xantine which attracts most of the attention of coffee advocates and detractors. Caffeine produces its main effects on the nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems through its inhibitory activity on adenosine receptors, thus enhancing attention and learning capacities, besides increasing coronary perfusion and diuresis. As for the negative effects, they can appear only after a high intake of coffee, usually more than 650 mg. a day. All studies indicate in fact that these effects aren't produced with moderate intakes. In particular no risks have been seen for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pregnancy, and neoplastic disease (in fact, in this last case coffee is considered a protective agent against colon cancer). It must be however pointed out that the quantity of caffeine present in "espresso coffee" is not high (40-70 mg.), quite inferior to that in a homemade cup of coffee usually drunk by Italians (80-100 mg.) and to the standard cup consumed by Americans (100-150 mg.). this is due both to the toasting process used and to the time of contact between coffee and water extraction preparation. Of utmost importance is the presence of two phenol composts, cholorogenic acid and caffeic acid that perform an antioxidant action against free radicals preventing those negative effects of aging and chronic-degenerative diseases. In particular chlorogenic acid has been singled out as the anti-neoplastic factor in coffee. In conclusion, even if there are some contraindications for some patients with neuropsychological disorders, we can state that coffee taken in quantities of 4-5 cups a day, in particular that processed in the Italia toasting method, can produce only positive effects. These being in the morning a better passage from the sleep to the walking state, and during the day, an increased ability to overcome tiredness with an improved work performance, besides offering a pleasant moment of relaxation between friends and relatives.

N2  - The two principal challenges of neonatal physiologic monitoring device are: (1) the development of computational strategies that consider the rudimentary forms of neonatal sleep state especially for preterm infants and (2) any physiologic monitoring device for clinical applications in a neonatal intensive care setting must be small, portable, and user-friendly. Our multicenter neonatal sleep consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over 370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index: quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals, spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.

N2  - Background/Aims: Knowledge of the presence or absence of cortisol (F) circadian rhythm in preterm infants is important for the interpretation of F measurements made in samples taken for both clinical and research purposes. Little is known about its emergence in very preterm infants. This study examines circadian rhythm in F secretion in hospitalized infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. Methods: Design: Prospective longitudinal observational study. Subjects: 11 infants admitted consecutively and born before 30 completed weeks of gestation. Measurements: F was measured by highly specific radioimmunoassay on morning and evening saliva samples gathered at weekly intervals until discharged home. Circadian rhythm was defined as ≥40% reduction from morning to evening level. Results: For all data, the median salivary F was 10.3 nmol/l (range <0.5-372.8). F levels were highest in the first 3 weeks of life. No infants displayed classical circadian rhythm for 4 weeks or more prior to being discharged from hospital. The other infants showed randomly distributed morning and evening F values with a trend in 4 infants towards periods of consistently higher evening than morning values. Conclusion: Adult-type F circadian rhythm is rarely evident in hospitalized preterm infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of domestic violence (DV) against women during pregnancy and to identify risk factors for DV and effects on women's mental health. METHODS: Pregnant women from an OB-GYN outpatient clinic at a hospital in an urban area were recruited consecutively from February to May 2003. Women who agreed to participate in the research answered three self-administered questionnaires: the GHQ30, the Rosenberg Self Esteem, and one for demographic characteristics at 14 gestational weeks. In order to determine DV prevalence rate during pregnancy, the Japanese version of the Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA) for measuring severity of DV was provided to those women over 35 gestational weeks. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy nine women answered all questionnaires. 15 of the 279 respondents (5.4%) were DV positive during pregnancy based on the Japanese version of the ISA. Nine had experienced physical violence, and twelve had non-physical violence Compared with women who had not experienced DV during pregnancy, DV positive pregnant women were more likely to be multipara (OR = 3.9) and to have experienced physical violence in the past from a different partner (OR = 9.1). Moreover, general illness (OR = 3.8), sleep disturbance (OR = 5.8), anxiety (OR = 6.3), depression (OR = 11.5) and low self-esteem (P = 0.02) were identified as effects of DV on women's mental health. CONCLUSION: Some 5.4% of women in Japan, approximately 1 in every 20, may experience DV during pregnancy. This is associated with parity and a past history of DV as demographic characteristics, and has an adverse impact on mental health, especially depression. Development of a support system for screening, intervention and referral for DV sufferers is urgently needed.

N2  - Factors contributing to maternal sleep when infants are 4 to 10 weeks of age were examined. Twenty-four-hour sleep-wake diaries collected from 37 mother-infant dyads in the home environment were summarized to describe total, longest, and mean sleep period; synchrony of maternal and infant sleep; and feeding frequency and duration. Regression and post hoc analysis of variance were used to examine factors contributing to maternal and infant sleep. Maternal sleep is driven by infant sleep and feeding pattern. The minimum and maximum numbers of infant sleep episodes per day were 6 and 15, respectively, and mean infant total sleep was 13.47 hours (SD 1.73). Mean maternal total sleep was 7.18 hours (SD 1.51), with half of the mothers reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Mean number of infant feedings was 11.14 (SD 3.27), with 11 infants (29.7%) receiving 13 or more feedings per 24 hours; minimum and maximum times per feeding were 15 and 41.7 minutes, respectively. Male infants had more sleep episodes, shorter sleep periods, and less sleep than females, and these gender differences resulted in shorter and more fragmented sleep for mothers. Findings suggest there is continued need for interventions to improve maternal sleep following childbearing. © 2005 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives.

N2  - Patients with obesity and those with sleep apnea syndrome are prone to gastroesophageal reflux. Likewise, both groups demonstrate an increased risk of difficult intubation. Rapid sequence induction remains important in obese and sleep apnea syndrome patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux or other predisposing condition such as diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, emergency surgery, and gastrointestinal conditions. In the case of elective surgery in a fasted patient with no risk factors other than obesity or sleep apnea syndrome, the requirement for rapid sequence induction is debatable. Cricoid pressure is probably efficacious but has not been proven in a randomized, controlled trial to prevent gastric aspiration. The clinician should be aware of the possibility that cricoid pressure will worsen mask ventilation and laryngoscopy and be prepared to loosen or release the pressure if mask ventilation or intubation is compromised. Regular training for the administration of cricoid pressure is indicated. If rapid sequence induction is required, succinylcholine remains the neuromuscular blocking agent of choice if there are no contraindications. Adequate anesthesia and muscle relaxation during induction are vital because coughing or straining during induction is a major risk for pulmonary aspiration. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Four behavioural states are recognised in the human fetus and are comparable to those of the neonate: 1F (quiet sleep), 2F (active state), 3F (quiet awake), and 4F (active awake). State 5, or crying, is not considered to have a fetal correlate. In a study assessing the effects of exposure to tobacco and cocaine during pregnancy on fetal response and habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation, what appears to be the fetal homologue of crying was observed. These behaviours were seen on ultrasound, and have been captured on video recordings and include: an initial exhalation movement associated with mouth opening and tongue depression, followed by a series of three augmented breaths, the last breath ending in an inspiratory pause followed by an expiration and settling. This is the first report/video documenting these behaviours and suggests the possibility of a state 5F.

N2  - We report a case of lingual thyroid. A woman presented with a few years history of mild dysphagia, cough and uncomfortable breathing when going to sleep at night. Laryngostroboscopy showed a mass lesion at the base of the tongue. A CT scan and thyroid scanning revealed a bilobar mass of thyroid tissue, compatible with a lingual thyroid. No thyroid gland was found at its usual location. The woman was euthyroid and since her symptoms were mild she was treated with thyroxin and observation. Lingual thyroid is a rare phenomenon caused by abnormal migration of thyroid cells during the first weeks of fetal life. Females are affected more often than males and although this condition is often asymptomatic, symptoms can occur, most often during puberty, pregnancy and menopause. On examination a mass is noted at the base of the tongue and the diagnosis is then confirmed with CT/MRI and thyroid scanning. Treatment can vary from observation to thyroxin medication, radioactive iodine and complicated surgical intervention, depending on the symptoms and the overall health of the patient.

N2  - Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal smoking, sleeping position, sleep state and postnatal age on heart rate changes following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation in infants. Subjects: We studied healthy term infants, 13 of whom were born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Each infant was studied using daytime polysomnography on 3 occasions: (a) 2-3 weeks, (b) 2-3 months and (c) 5-6 months after birth. Nasal air-jet stimulation was presented in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. Results: We found no difference between infants of smoking and non-smoking mothers in any of the parameters measured. Minimum HR (MinHR) following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation was significantly lower in the supine compared to the prone sleeping position at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months of age (p < 0.05) in AS, and at all 3 ages in QS (p < 0.01). MinHR was significantly lower in QS compared to AS at 2-3 months when infants slept prone and at 5-6 months when sleeping supine (p < 0.01). In QS, MinHR became lower with increasing postnatal age in both sleep positions (p < 0.01). In AS, there was no maturational effect. The normalized bradycardia (ΔHR%) was significantly greater in AS than in QS at 2-3 weeks of age (p < 0.05) when infants slept supine. Conclusion: Our study has shown that there was a decrease in heart rate (MinHR) following trigeminal stimulation in infants up to 6 months of age and this was affected by sleep position and sleep state, being larger in the supine sleeping position and the QS state. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Aim: To investigate the sleeping condition of pregnant women for the first time, and compare the sleep quality between pregnant women with and without the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: Seventy-five first-time pregnant women (pregnant group), who delivered in the sickroom of Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University and Kaifeng Hospital for Obstetrics and Gynecology between May 2000 and May 2004, were investigated with the scales and questionnaires voluntarily. Another 75 healthy physical examinees (control group) in the hospital at the same period were selected matched according to the one-to-one ratio. All the subjects were assessed with sleep quality inventory, self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) at 1 week after admission. The t test was used for the intergroup comparison. Results: All the 75 pregnant women and 75 healthy people were involved in the analysis of results. There were 33 and 42 pregnant women with and without the symptom of anxiety, 29 and 46 pregnant women with and without the symptom of depression. 1 The scores of time to fall sleeping, sleeping maintenance, self-rating sleeping and total sleeping time and the total score of sleep quality were obviously higher in the pregnant group than in the control group (1.09±0.35, 0.41±0.04, 0.92±0.13, 0.96±0.24, 4.75±0.97; 0.81±0.40, 0.29±0.04, 0.50±0.08, 0.72±0.16, 3.92±0.72, t=2.166-3.165, P < 0.05-0.01). 2 The scores of time to fall sleeping, sleeping maintenance, self-rating sleeping, time of mid-day rest, total sleeping time and dream memory and the total score of sleep quality were obviously higher in the pregnant women with anxiety than in those without anxiety (1.22±0.40, 0.47±0.07, 0.92±0.16, 1.29±0.43, 0.99±0.25, 0.74±0.13, 4.95±1.05; 0.96±0.38, 0.36±0.08, 0.63±0.15, 1.06±0.32, 0.78±0.20, 0.60±0.06, 4.25±0.95, t=2.231-3.127, P < 0.05-0.01). 3 The scores of time to fall sleeping, self-rating sleeping, total sleeping time and the total score of sleep quality were obviously higher in the pregnant women with depression than in those without depression (1.14±0.38, 0.87±0.15, 1.26±0.31, 0.95±0.27, 4.84±1.01; 0.89±0.40, 0.69±0.13, 1.04±0.52, 0.80±0.32, 4.19±0.83, t=2.245-2.407, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The sleep quality of the first-time pregnant women is obviously decreased, and the sleep quality is worse in those with the symptoms of anxiety and depression.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Depression during pregnancy is frequently treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (FX), commonly known as Prozac (Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN). FX potentiates serotoninergic neurotransmission and serotonin has been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms. We have therefore investigated the effect of chronic administration of FX on maternal and fetal circadian rhythms in sheep. METHODS: Following an initial bolus dose of 70 mg FX, an 8-day continuous infusion of FX (n = 11, 98.5 μg/kg·d) was performed. Controls (n = 13) were treated with sterile water vehicle only. Maternal and fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations were determined every 3 hours for 24 hours and then every 6 hours for 24 hours beginning on the fourth day of infusion. RESULTS: FX treatment did not alter either the basal or circadian rhythms of either maternal or fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations. Fetal cardiovascular and behavioral state parameters were measured continuously. While the incidence of low-voltage (LV) electrocortical (ECOG) activity was significantly reduced in fetuses in the FX group, there was no effect of FX on the diurnal rhythms in fetal arterial pressure, heart rate, breathing movements, or behavioral state. CONCLUSION: These results show that maternal FX treatment does not result in significant alterations in maternal and fetal hormonal and behavioral circadian rhythms.

N2  - Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum "blues," depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders. © 2005 CMA Media Inc.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe factors associated with actigraphic and subjective sleep quality in young women. Methods: Participants were 73 regularly menstruating women, 20-40 years old, who were not taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, or shift workers. Women contributed an average of 7 nights of actigraphy data during the luteal menstrual cycle phase, resulting in a total of 595 nights of data. Results: One night of actigraphy data was unreliable for measuring total sleep time, sleep onset, and time in bed (intraclass correlation ≤.15) but was acceptable for measuring sleep efficiency and total wake time (intraclass correlation [ICC]=.52). Going to bed late, medication use, employment, increased daylight hours, longer menstrual cycle length, and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with poorer actigraphic sleep measures. Employment, age, and perceived stress were associated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusion: Multiple factors were associated with sleep quality in these young women who were sleeping at home. However, the associations differed for subjectively versus actigraphically assessed sleep quality. Actigraphy is feasible for measuring sleep, but multiple recording nights may be needed to obtain reliable estimates. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Maternal prenatal stress has been found to be related to over-activity and/or dysregulation of the HPA-system in the offspring. These effects are more readily apparent in response to novel situations. The aim of the present report was to examine whether pregnancy stress predicted HPA-axis reactions of children to the first day of school after the summer break. Children of mothers with more prenatal stress were compared to those of mothers with less stress. Habituation was studied by comparisons between the first school day and a second school day a week later. Finally, cortisol levels at school were compared to those of a weekend day. The participants were 29 mother-child pairs (20 girls and nine boys, mean age 5.31 years, SD=0.50). The children's cortisol levels were determined in saliva. Multilevel analysis (hierarchical linear modelling) was used to analyze the data. Both prenatal cortisol and pregnancy anxiety were related to the children's cortisol levels as a reaction to the first school day. Children whose mothers had higher levels of morning cortisol during pregnancy, and more fear of bearing a handicapped child showed higher levels of cortisol on school days. In addition, the circadian rhythm of cortisol on school days appeared to have a steeper slope as compared to that of the circadian curve on a weekend day. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Most studies on sleep and sleep disorders have been performed selectively in men or male animals. This is because females are more heavily influenced by cyclic sex hormones that may affect sleep- wake structures. Indeed, women often develop sleep disturbances in association with reproductive events. During the menstrual cycle, some women feel sleepier during the luteal phase than the follicular phase. Rodents are significantly most active during the night of ovulation but sleep the most after successful mating. Sleep dynamics change in human pregnancy as well; most women experience excessive sleepiness during the first trimester. Although the roles of female hormones in sleep regulation have not been fully understood, sex hormones provide a drive to sleep more so as to protect breeding. By contrast, when ovarian function declines, sleep problems significantly increase. In aged female rats, as similarly seen with ovariectomized young rats, circadian rhythms of sleep-wake distribution are disturbed. Such deteriorated sleep patterns are restored with continuous injection of estrogen. Hormonal replacement therapy for humans can be expected to exert a similar effect, but at this moment care needs to be given to the risks involved. Women are reported to suffer more than men from sleep disorders. A possible explanation may implicate the more active hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis in females. Growth-hormone releasing hormone (CHRH) usually promotes sleep in healthy males, but not in females. Gender differences in somnogenic effects of CHRH could be explained by gender-specificity of the HPA system. It is necessary to investigate the sexual dimorphisms of sleep-wake activities to generate strategies for gender-specific treatments. © 2005 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

N2  - Study Objective: Changes in sleep-disordered breathing associated with late pregnancy have not previously been systematically investigated; however, a number of case reports indicate exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea in late pregnancy, often in association with maternal hypertension. We aimed to compare the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state. Design: Case-controlled, longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and postpartum. Study Patients: Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 ± 15 per hour antenatally to 18 ± 4 per hour postnatally (P = .03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 ± 11 per hour to 22 ± 4 per hour (P = .002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was increased from 86% ± 2% antenatally to 91% ± 1% postnatally (P = .01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally. Conclusion: This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.

N2  - Objective: This study was undertaken to test the effects of acupuncture on insomnia in a group of pregnant women under real life conditions, and to compare the results with a group of patients undergoing conventional treatment alone (sleep hygiene). Methods: A total of 30 conventionally treated pregnant women were allocated at random into groups with or without acupuncture. Seventeen patients formed the study group and 13 the control group. The pregnant women scored the severity of insomnia using a Numerical Rating Scale from 0 to 10. Women were followed up for eight weeks and interviewed five times, at two-week intervals. Results: Eight women dropped out, five in the study group and three in the control group. The study group reported a larger reduction on insomnia rating (5.1) than the control group (0.0), a difference which was statistically significant (P=0.0028). Average insomnia scores decreased by at least 50% over time in nine (75%) patients in the study group and in three (30%) of the control group. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that acupuncture alleviates insomnia during pregnancy and further research is justified.

N2  - Evaluation of risk factors and short-term outcomes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are essential to identify infants in need of developmental intervention after discharge. This study examined risk factors with the potential to affect short-term neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes in preterm infants born at <31 weeks gestation. Data were obtained in a larger longitudinal randomized study of the effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness on health. Severity of neurological insults and caffeine use predicted poorer neurobehavioral outcomes; and severity of neurological insults, caffeine use, length of hospitalization and ventilator days were associated with altered sleep-wake state organization. There were no significant effects of environmental lighting on the short-term developmental outcomes of preterm infants. Early knowledge of an infant's neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes can provide families and health care providers with important information to target the utilization of early intervention services. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: Fetal heart rate (FHR) variability indicates autonomic nervous system response. Absence of variability may be due to various causes, including fetal metabolic acidosis, neurologic abnormality, marked prematurity, cardiac arrhythmia, effects of drugs, fetal sleep or inactivity. We present the case of a pregnant woman with acute appendicitis whose fetus demonstrated poor variability in heart rate, and we explore the possible reasons that caused poor variability in FHR in this patient. Case Report: A pregnant woman at 40+1 weeks of gestation was admitted because of acute right lateral subcostal tenderness and rebounding pain. Under the impression of acute appendicitis, emergency appendectomy was arranged. Epidural combined with general anesthesia were offered to the patient. Absent variability of FHR on fetal monitoring was noted immediately after laparotomy, and did not reappear until 5 hours after the operation. Emergency cesarean section with spinal anesthesia was arranged due to prolonged active phase in cervical dilatation. The fetus was born with Apgar scores of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Abdominal sepsis due to acute appendicitis that subsequently caused chorioamnionitis and fetal infection was the most probable reason for the poor FHR variability. Conclusion: When sources of infection are eradicated from a pregnant patient, whether by surgical or medical methods, FHR variability will gradually return. Seldom is cesarean section indicated at the time of appendectomy. We suggest that the choice of delivery should depend on the obstetric indications, and not on the event of acute appendicitis.

N2  - Objectives: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Methods: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). Results: Overall, 9.2% of all women "usually" chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1%) or other sites (8.3%). Compared to health department prenatal clinic patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep position, adjusted odds ratio = 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92). Conclusions: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs. Providers:Especially private providers"should continue to stress the importance of supine sleep position for infants. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.
