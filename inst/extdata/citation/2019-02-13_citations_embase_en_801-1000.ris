N2  - Introduction: Infant sleep consolidation is an important developmental milestone that may support optimal child outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate if maternal history of child abuse (CA) was associated with infant sleep consolidation in the first year of life and identify modifiable psychosocial mediators of the association. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of the All Our Babies study; a Canadian community based mother child cohort. Participants included 1250 women who provided self-report data on history of CA (physical, emotional, or sexual) during pregnancy and infant sleep consolidation (average number of infant night wakings and longest length of night time sleep) at 4 and 12 months postpartum. Results: Approximately 15% (n = 190) of women reported a history of CA. After controlling for differences in maternal education, income, ethnicity, parity, and infant sex there were significant group differences in sleep consolidation at 12 months (MD = 0.51 hours, 95% CI [0.050, 0.97]), but not 4 months postpartum; women with a history of CA reported less infant sleep consolidation than women without a history of CA. Results of serial mediation indicated a pathway whereby history of CA was associated with higher maternal anxiety at 4 and 12-months. In combination, these two variables fully mediated the relationship between maternal CA and infant sleep consolidation (p < .05). Conclusion: Findings showed that maternal history of CA was associated with poorer infant sleep consolidation at 12 but not 4 months; maternal anxiety at 4 and 12 months postpartum fully mediated this relationship. For mothers with a CA history, maternal anxiety may play a role in the development of poorer infant sleep consolidation. Treating maternal anxiety in women with a history of CA may represent a target of intervention for preventing or mitigating the development of poor infant sleep consolidation.

N2  - Objectives: Tis study expanded knowledge about the relationship between sleep problems and emotional dysregulation from childhood to adolescence by investigating their joint developmental trajectory. Methods: Participants were from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) study, which followed 2,868 children from age 5 to 17years old and collected detailed sleep problems and dysregulation profle data during assessments. In order to better capture the developmental patterns, we focused on participants who had data for at least four out of the fve measurement points, both for sleep problems and dysregulation profle. Te effective sample size was 1625 (56.7% retention). Results: Two similar trajectories of sleep problems and emotional dysregulation were identifed. Joint trajectory models revealed a strong overlap between the course of sleep problems and emotional dysregulation: Adolescents in the troubled sleepers trajectory were at the highest risk to follow a high dysregulation trajectory and vice versa. Conclusion: Tis study suggests that during childhood and adolescence, both sleep problems and emotional dysregulation were relatively stable. Te development of sleep problems and emotional dysregulation is highly related.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Childhood obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have severe long-term consequences. Known risk factors include a history of preterm delivery. We sought to determine whether the different subgroups of 'term' delivery impact differently on the prevalence of childhood OSA. STUDY DESIGN: In this population-based cohort analysis all term singleton deliveries occurring between 1991-2013 at a single tertiary medical center were included. Gestational age upon delivery was sub-divided into: early (37-38+6 weeks' gestation), full (39 - 40+6 weeks' gestation), late (41 - 41+6 weeks' gestation) and post term (>42 weeks). Fetuses with congenital malformations were excluded. The rate of OSA related hospitalizations up to the age of 18 was assessed in the different categories of gestational age, and cumulative rates compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the association between gestational age at birth and the risk for OSA related hospitalization, while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: During the study period 225 260 term deliveries met the inclusion criteria. OSA related hospital encounters up to the age of 18 years (n=1194) were significantly more common in the early term delivery group (0.7%) and decreased in the full (0.5%), late (0.4%), and post term (0.3%) groups (p<0.001; using the chi-square test for trends). In the Cox model, as compared to full term deliveries, early term delivery exhibited an independent association with pediatric OSA (adjusted HR-1.33 95%CI 1.16-1.52, p<0.001, Table, Figure) while late and post term deliveries were associated with significantly lower OSA hazard ratios (adjusted HRs of 0.79 95%CI 0.67-0.94 and 0.60 95%CI 0.41-0.86, respectively, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Deliveries occurring at early term are associated with higher rates of pediatric OSA related hospitalizations which decrease gradually as gestational age advances. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction: The back to sleep/safe sleep campaign has made a significant change in the rate of SIDS across the United States since 1994. Prone positioning has decreased as has SIDS' incidence. Most information for demographic adherence is based on race, age and socioeconomic factors. Orthodox Jews have a birthrate of approximately 4.1 (nationwide birthrate 2.2) and make up at least 30% of the Jewish children under 18 years of age in the United States. No data exist for SIDS rates or appropriate supine sleep rates among Orthodox Jewish families. Methods: Through an anonymous paper and online survey, our team compared answers of 63 Orthodox Jewish parents to 23 non-Orthodox parents. Our survey used demographic information modeled after the CDC's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) which included marital status, number of children in the home, parental age, tobacco use, and household income. We tabulated their responses related to the sleep position of their most recent child under 4 months old, similar to the PRAMS questionnaire. Results: The Orthodox parents reported a rate of infants supine sleeping of 64%. This is significantly below the national rate of 81.9% of Caucasian parents (p<0.001). The non-Orthodox parent's rate was 93% in comparison. The relationship remained even after correcting for age of parents and number of children in the household. Both groups were overwhelmingly married, insured, educated beyond high school, employed, and had almost non-existent tobacco use. Conclusion: Practitioners should attempt to address infant supine sleep positioning more strongly in Orthodox Jews particularly given their high birth rate. Further research is needed to determine why the safe sleep message has not been more broadly accepted by this group.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To predict the impact of changes in maternal body composition and physical activity in relation to birthweight percentiles in dichorionic-diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective longitudinal study of 20 women (pregravid BMI 18.5-29.9) with DCDA twin gestations. Body composition based on total body water, air displacement plethymography and total body potassium; total energy expenditure (TEE) and physical activity (PAL) by doubly labeled water and calorimetry; and activity and sleep duration by accelerometry were measured during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters and postpartum. Air displacement plethymography was used to evaluate newborn body composition. Birthweight percentiles were assigned with adjustment for gender (Fenton 2003). Mixed models with random intercept were used to control for clustering effect of twins. In all models the interaction between gestational age and maternal characteristics were tested. Covariates included gestational age, maternal age, and pregravid BMI. Rates of gestational weight gain (GWG) were evaluated as gaining above or within versus below Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for pregravid BMI. RESULTS: Total GWG (p=0.05), total body protein (p=0.04), total energy expenditure (p=0.04), but not total fat mass gain or total body water, were significantly associated with increased birthweight percentiles (Table). Birthweight percentiles were significantly higher (p=0.03) in women who gained above or within IOM recommendations (least square mean 41.6%) compared with women who gained less than recommended (least square mean 18.7%). Birthweight percentiles were not affected by physical activity level, number of daily steps, or sleep duration. CONCLUSION: Maternal weight gain equal to or above IOM recommendations for DCDA twins is associated with increased birthweight percentile. Higher birthweight percentiles are also associated with higher maternal energy expenditure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to correlate maternal body composition and physical activity with neonatal size in twin gestations.(Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to examine how therapists' ratings of patient adherence to stimulus control (SC) instructions, sleep restriction therapy (SRT), and hyperarousal reduction guidelines are related to change in insomnia severity among participants in an ongoing randomized controlled study on the treatment of perinatal insomnia. Methods: Data from 46 participants randomized to receive 5 sessions of individual Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy are included in the study. Therapists rated adherence to 4 SC instructions (i.e., go to bed only when sleepy; get out of bed when unable to sleep in the beginning of the night; get out of bed when unable to sleep in the middle of the night; use bed and bedroom only for sleep;), 3 SRT instructions (i.e., go to bed no earlier than prescribed; wake up at prescribed time; get out of bed shortly after waking), and 3 recommendations targeting hyperarousal (i.e., buffer zone, worry time, and relaxation). Three composite adherence ratings were constructed (SC, SRT, Hyperarousal) as the average of relevant items across sessions. Insomnia severity was measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Results: Greater percent improvement in insomnia severity was correlated with better therapist rated adherence to SRT (r=.310, p=.036) and hyperarousal reduction guidelines (r=.322, p=.033). Among the three hyperarousal guidelines, only adherence ratings of the 'use of buffer zone' recommendation were correlated with percent improvement in insomnia severity (r=.545, p=.001). Conclusion: Prior studies of non-pregnant individuals have shown that greater adherence to SRT guidelines is related to larger treatment gains. This study extends past findings using a sample of pregnant women and assessing adherence to treatment components beyond SRT. We found that therapist-rated adherence to hyperarousal reduction guidelines, particularly setting aside time to unwind before bedtime, was positively related to improvement in treatment. It is unclear if this result will generalize to non-pregnant individuals with insomnia. Multi-modal assessment of adherence that includes both therapist and patient derived data could deepen our understanding of change processes in CBT-I.

N2  - Study Objectives: Deterioration in sleep quality seems to be a natural consequence of physical changes during pregnancy. It is still unclear if insomnia in pregnancy is associated with the same factors as chronic insomnia in the general population. The aim of this study was to explore the determinants of insomnia during pregnancy. Methods: The study included 266 women (mean age: 30.6 ± 5 years, weeks of pregnancy: 36 [interquartile range 32-38]) recruited at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical University of Warsaw. The assessment of variables was performed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Regestein Hyperarousal Scale (HS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire, and a semi-structured interview about different sleep disorders. Results: Almost 40% of the women in our study received a diagnosis of insomnia based on AIS cutoff scores. The between-group analyses indicated that HS score, BDI score, eating at night, legs tingling, nightmares, snoring, and myoclonus differentiated the groups of individuals with insomnia from those without insomnia. Other variables were not significantly different between the groups. We divided individuals with insomnia in terms of insomnia duration: 49% developed insomnia at least 1 year before the study onset and 39.6% during pregnancy. For further analyses we used only the women in whom insomnia developed during pregnancy. Logistic regression confirmed that depressive symptoms (BDI) and eating at night were significant predictors of insomnia in pregnancy. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms and night eating are key factors related to insomnia developed during pregnancy.

N2  - Melnick-Needles syndrome (M-NS) is a rare genetic disorder which primarily affects skeletal developments. M-NS may also affect the cardiorespiratory and renal systems. A 35 kg patient presented complaining of abdominal pain. Following a positive pregnancy test and ultrasound examination, she was diagnosed with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. She had a significant background history of M-NS, obstructive sleep apnoea (with narrow gauge tracheostomy in situ), obstructive lung disease and scoliosis. She received fluid resuscitation, and the case was managed using an open salpingectomy and clot evacuation under combined spinal/epidural anaesthesia. Anticipated difficulty in securing a definitive airway was pivotal to choosing a regional anaesthetic technique. The operation was successful and the patient recovered well. This was a unique surgical and anaesthetic challenge due to abnormal facial, spinal and abdominal morphology compounded by the time-critical emergency nature of the case. Individually tailored perioperative management is frequently required for patients with rare syndromes.

N2  - RATIONALE: Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) are at higher risk of hypoxia during bronchoscopy compared to patients without OSA, due to pathological upper airway. It is unknown whether use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) during bronchoscopy improve hypoxia and other complications in patients with OSA or at risk of OSA. Therefore, we conducted a study to examine the use of NIPPV during bronchoscopy in patients with OSA or at risk of OSA. METHODS: This was a single center, single blind prospective randomized control trial. All patients undergoing bronchoscopy at out tertiary care hospital were screened. Inclusion criteria were 1. Patients with previous diagnosis of OSA, and 2. Patients with STOP-BANG score of ≥ 3. We excluded pregnant patients, Age < 18, patients with any contraindications to NIPPV, and patients who were high risk of complications during procedure due to underlying comorbidities. Patients in NIPPV treatment group received Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure at settings of Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) 12 cmH2O and Expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) 8 cmH2O, while patients in control group received O2 at 2-4 liters per minute via nasal cannula during bronchoscopy. Primary outcome was the number of desaturation events, defined as a decrease in pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) of ≥ 4% from baseline or SpO2 of ≤ 88% for ≥ 1 minute. Secondary outcomes recorded were the Lowest SpO2 during the procedure and the number of interruptions during the procedure due to a hypoxia related event. RESULTS: We had 10 patients in treatment group and 6 patients in control group. Number of desaturation events in treatment group were 1.1 compared to 1.8 events in the control group (p value = 0.50). The lowest SpO2 during procedure in the treatment group was 91.4% versus 85.5% in the control group (p value = 0.44). Odds ratio of the number of interruptions was 0.05 (95% CI 0.004 to 0.668) (p value = 0.02) for NIPPV group compared to control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a decrease in hypoxic events and improvement in lowest oxygen desaturation during flexible bronchoscopy with the use of NIPPV in patients with OSA or at risk of OSA. This study suggests potential benefit of using NIPPV during bronchoscopy.

N2  - Drugs used in the treatment of depression can cross the placenta giving rise to questions regarding the effects these drugs exert on the fetus. Hypericum perforatum L., Hypericaceae, is a natural product used to treat depression. However, information about its toxicity and the occurrence of alterations in the central nervous system development of the offspring is scarce. This work assessed the behavior of adult male rats born from mothers treated with Hypericum extract during gestation and analyzed the fluorescence of the extract in different organs of mothers and fetuses. Male pups were divided into three treated groups, corresponding to the administration of the Hypericum extract to mothers at the dose levels of 36 mg/kg, 72 mg/kg and 144 mg/kg, and one control group in which the mothers received distilled water. At 90 days of age, the offspring underwent the following tests: rotarod, pentobarbital-induced sleep time, elevated plus maze, hole-board and forced swimming test. The observed fluorescence indicated the presence of the extract in all tissues analyzed. The obtained results suggest lasting changes in the performances displayed in the CNS, depression and anxiety tests, indicating that the use of Hypericum during gestation could interfere with the behavioral development of the offspring reducing anxiety and depression when they become adults. We suggest that these alterations are associated with the reprogramming of the brain regions related to changes in emotional reactivity.

N2  - A 36-year-old lady presented with suspected seizure. She is G1P1 after delivering three months earlier and is currently breastfeeding. Her only medication is domperidone to assist with breast-milk production. The patient had four previous events concerning seizure activity since the age of 14 with investigations non-diagnostic. Previous triggers included sleep deprivation, alcohol and cocaine use. Her phe-notype involved loss of consciousness, behavioural arrest and jerking. She has no family history of sudden death. Her sister has a history suggestive of seizures including one during pregnancy. The patient was brought in by ambulance after waking from a nap disorientated. She called her partner, sounding confused and incoherent, and he subsequently called an ambulance. She had been sleep-deprived in recent days. Initial rhythm with the ambulance was atrial fibrillation. CT brain, electroencephalography and echocardiogram were unremarkable. On spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm, sinus bradycardia with a prolonged QT interval was noted (500-540ms) and persisted despite cessation of domperidone. Whilst on telemetry, she developed pre-syncope. This correlated with recurrent short runs of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) initiated by the typical sequence of short-long-short R-R intervals, suggestive of long QT (LQT) syndrome. Atenolol was started and she was referred for genetic testing, revealing both her and her sister have LQT type 2 (LQT2) syndrome (KCNH2 gene). She received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Conclusion: This is a novel case of domperidone triggering polymorphic VT and leading to the diagnosis of LQT2 syndrome.

N2  - Introduction: Women with NT1 face difficult decisions about medication use during the perinatal period, a time when expectant/new mothers experience shortened, fragmented sleep and optimizing symptom relief is essential. The short half-life of Xyrem (sodium oxybate, SO) suggests that postpartum women may be able to take SO and breastfeed safely. Based on gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) half-life and one case report, current literature suggests waiting 4-5 hours after taking SO to breastfeed. Our goal was to determine concentration of GHB in milk of postpartum women taking SO for treatment of NT1. Methods: Two women with NT1 treated with SO before pregnancy, who elected to discontinue treatment during pregnancy, collected milk samples for analysis of GHB concentration after resuming SO postpartum. One woman collected 15 samples across 2 nights (doses: 3.0gm and 4.5gm twice per night) five months after the birth of her first child; the other collected 13 samples across 2 nights (doses: 2.25gm and 3.0gm twice per night) nine months after the births of her first two children. GHB concentration was determined by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry in the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center at CWRU. Results: Endogenous GHB levels before taking SO ranged from 5.81- 7.60μM in milk. GHB levels were 2- to 4-times higher 4 hours after the first SO dose (10.44-23.88μM) and 3-5 times higher 4 hours after the second dose (8 hours after first dose; 14.60-34.01μM). In general, GHB levels returned to endogenous levels 6-10 hours following the second SO dose, however variability was observed between patients and pregnancies. Higher GHB levels in breast milk were observed with higher SO doses for both patients. Conclusion: SO is transmitted to breast milk. Despite its short halflife, GHB concentrations remained 2- to 5-times higher than endogenous levels 4 hours after both nighttime doses. To avoid excess GHB exposure, mothers who take SO and breastfeed should consider expressing and discarding their morning milk. Future work should examine breast milk GHB levels after chronic SO use and determine whether GHB levels change as milk composition changes across the postpartum period.

N2  - The patient is a 1-week-old boy born at 37+2 weeks’ gestational age through spontaneous vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia. The Apgar score was 9 at both 1 minute and 5 minutes after birth. Because of hypoglycemia at delivery that required IV dextrose, he was admitted to the local neonatal intensive care unit. His blood glucose levels quickly stabilized, dextrose administration was discontinued, and the patient began breast-feeding. On day 2 of life, the patient began having intermittent oxygen desaturation, with oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry down to 70% while sleeping; he was transferred to a tertiary-care NICU for further management. Aside from the hypoxia, he was otherwise asymptomatic. He was breast-feeding without difficulty and had no vomiting or gastroesophageal reflux; no cyanosis, stridor, or snoring; and no seizure-like activity or hypertonicity.

N2  - Background. The brain activity of a newborn affects postnatal adaptation, the disorder of which can cause dysfunction of organs and systems of the immature organism and the development of diseases in more distant periods of maturation. Objective: Our aim was to study the effect of levocarnitine on dynamics of the brain bioelectrical activity formation in term infants delivered by cesarean section. Methods. The study included term infants (gestation period 38-40 weeks) delivered by cesarean section, with perinatal hypoxic lesion of the central nervous system (cerebral ischemia). Children were randomized into groups of standard (recommended) treatment and standard treatment enhanced with levocarnitine (plus levocarnitine) - 30% oral solution at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks starting from the 7th day of life. The brain bioelectrical activity was assessed with electroencephalography (EEG) of the natural sleep period on the 3rd-6th day and then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results. 45 children were randomized into groups of standard treatment and standard treatment plus levocarnitine, of which 44 and 40 children completed the study, respectively. Initially, the delayed formation of age-related brain activity was detected in 16/40 (40%) children receiving levocarnitine and in 19/44 (43%) in the experimental group (p = 0.767), disturbances in the EEG sleep pattern with generation of background anomalies - in 17 (43%) and 16 (36%) (p = 0.565), pathological graph elements - in 1 (3%) and 2 (5%) children (p = 0.536), respectively. According to the dynamic EEG control results, it was found that after 1 year the cerebral dysfunction was registered less frequently in children receiving levocarnitine - in 32 (80%) vs. 42 (96%) children in the group of standard treatment (p = 0.028). Conclusion. Adminisration of levocarnitine in the neonatal period reduces the risk of developing cerebral dysfunction by the end of the first year of life.

N2  - This nonconsanguineous family included four family members affected by lens dislocation in three generations (Fig. 1a). The proband, a 6-year-old boy (Fig. 1b), was referred for evaluation of developmental delay. Following an uneventful pregnancy, he was delivered at 39 weeks' gestation by Caesarean section. Birth weight was 2000 g, length was 51 cm and Apgar score was 7. Developmental milestones were delayed: he walked alone at 24 months, babbled at 13 months and said his first words at 3 years. He had feeding difficulties with failure to thrive during his first year of life and was noted to have hypospadias, bilateral lens dislocation and frequent respiratory infections. At 6 years, his height was 110 cm (50th centile), weight was 19 kg (50th centile) and occipitofrontal circumference was 48 cm (<3rd centile), arm span was 130 cm and the arm span/height ratio was 1.18. He was noted to have facial dysmorphism (bitemporal narrowing, periorbital fullness, a broad nasal tip, long philtrum, a wide mouth with full lips, high-arched palate, small, widely spaced teeth and micrognathia), long fingers and toes and clinodactyly of the fifth fingers (Fig. 1b). He also had joint laxity, impaired fine motor activities and severe speech delay. Psychological evaluation showed severe mental retardation (IQ 30). He had a happy and sociable personality, hyperactivity, attention deficit, increased sensitivity to sounds, continuing feeding problems and a sleep disorder. Family history indicated that his mother, maternal uncle and maternal grandfather had been diagnosed with bilateral lens dislocation as teenagers. All these relatives had hyperlaxity, high-arched palates, long fingers, pectus carinatum and the wrist and thumb signs. The mother, 31 years old, had 170 cm height, 62 kg weight and 174 cm arm span; the uncle, 28 years old, had 187 cm height, 80 kg weight and 200 cm arm span (arm span/height ratio: 1.07); the maternal grandfather, 61 years old, had 180 cm height, 88.5 kg weight and 200 cm arm span (arm span/height ratio: 1.11).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The current study was undertaken to describe diurnal patterns of fetal behavioral states across a typical third trimester day in fetuses of mothers taking SSRI (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor) antidepressants (n=30) and in a control, nonexposed group (n=64). STUDY DESIGN: Participants, in a prospective observational study (singleton, uncomplicated pregnancies at mean 35+ weeks gestation. The study included two sessions [Figure 1] - a morning session (∼0830), before the SSRI mothers took their daily drug and an afternoon session (∼1300), following the treatment. The control group were also examined in the morning and in the afternoon. Each monitoring session included ultrasound study and computerized cardiotocography. Fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns and behavioral states coding was based on visually coding system. Four bio behavioral patterns (BBP) were classified based on four patterns of variability, coupled with different fetal movement patterns: BPP A - quite sleep; BPP B- active sleep, BPP C - quite awaking and BPP D - active awake. The percentage of time a fetus displayed in each state was calculated. RESULTS: Maternal characteristics did not differ between the SSRI exposed and non-exposed group. Comparing heart rate patterns of non-exposed fetuses to the SSRI exposed fetuses, there was a trend for fetuses in the exposed group to spend less time in the quite pattern (14% vs. 9%, P = 0.05) and more time in the active pattern [Table 1]. Along with that, in the morning session, fetuses from the non-exposed group spent significantly more time in the quite sleeping state compared to exposed fetuses (15.46% vs. 6.26% p=0.003). Fetuses from the exposed group spent more time in the active sleeping state compared to the non-exposed fetuses (87.4% vs. 78.15% p=0.048). This difference was not seen in the afternoon session, which was following the drug administration. The effect was consistent in the early neonatal period when the exposed neonates showed higher rates of jittery and low Apgar scores. CONCLUSION: Fetuses that were exposed to maternal SSRI treatment were more active and spent less time in the quite behavioral state compared to control group when the antidepressant was withheld. This difference was not seen following the SSRI administration. This demonstrates a unique finding of in utero SSRI withdrawal response. (Figure presented).

N2  - Background: Childhood weight problems require early preventive measures. Many studies have done in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) covering several cities, but it is difficult to follow up on the current situation because access to reliable national data is not always possible. Objective: To estimate the prevalence and risk factors of overweight, obesity and underweight among children aged below 2 years old in Abha city, KSA. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study of children aged 0-24 months, attending the primary health care (PHC) centers. A previously validated questionnaire was used. It consisted of personal characteristics, prenatal history of (smoking, gestational diabetes and obesity), details of feeding practice and other risk factors for obesity (weaning food, TV watching, duration of sleep and who caring of the child). Results: Among the 373 children, 75.1% had normal weight whereas 14.5% were underweight. Overweight and obesity were reported among 8% and 2.4% of them, respectively. Among various studied risk factors (maternal nationality, educational level, birth weight, taking soft drinks before age of 6 months, not providing food at definite time, providing food several times in large amount during the day, sleeping for continuous long period, watching TV or playing video games more than 1 h/day and maternal overweight during pregnancy) were statistically significant, modifiable and can be the target of interventions. Conclusion: Weight status problems among children aged below 2 years of mothers attending PHC centers within Abha city is not uncommon. Underweight is more prevalent than overweight and obesity.

N2  - Introduction: Narcolepsy with cataplexy (NC) has been associated with excessive weight gain via several mechanisms. Some studies have suggested a common genetic predisposition, intrinsic increased BMI or decreased energy expenditure. Compulsive nighttime eating has been suggested as another possible underlying contributor. We report a clinical case so as to illustrate some of the issues involved. Report of Case: A 38 year old female with a past medical history of narcolepsy with cataplexy diagnosed in 1998 who later established care at our center in 1999 for management and follow up. Patient was initially put on sodium oxybate (GHB, Xyrem, Jazz Pharmaceuticals), methylphenidate and fluoxetine. During her pregnancy in 2009 and after delivery, patient stopped taking sodium oxybate for fear it may prevent her from waking up at night to care for her child. She was off the medication until December 2015 when she presented to our clinic for new symptoms of snoring, worsening of daytime sleepiness and nocturnal arousals. The patient weighed 108 lbs in 2000 while at her visit in 2015 she weighed 170 lbs. Patient endorsed nocturnal eating whereby she wakes up at around 1 am and is not able to return to sleep before eating a meal. This nocturnal eating impulse has been present since her college years. Decision was made to have repeat polysomnography to rule out obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). PSG done on 2/24/2016 confirmed moderate OSA AHI= 15.7 with a supine AHI of 32.7. Patient was later titrated on a CPAP of 8 cmH2O. Patient opted for an oral device. Conclusion: Night Eating Syndrome (NES) is characterized by hyperphagia after the evening meal, either before bedtime or after fully awakening during the night. Monitoring for weight gain and screening for NES should be considered in NC patients.

N2  - Hypermethioninemia is an inborn error of methionine metabolism caused by deficiency of the S-adenosylmethionine enzyme, leading to an accumulation of this essential amino acid and its metabolites. Recent studies showed that pups of mothers submitted to gestational hypermethioninemia presented oxidative stress and inhibition of Na+K+-ATPase activity in encephalon. During fetal development, these changes could lead to memory deficit and/or development of neurodegenerative diseases in postnatal life. Melatonin is a hormone released by the pineal gland and is involved, among other functions, to circadian rhythm control, removal of reactive species, antiapoptotic effect and reduction of lipid peroxidation. The aim of this study was to verify the possible neuroprotective effect of melatonin on biochemical (Na+K+-ATPase) and behavior parameters (memory by water maze task) in hypermethioninemic rats offspring at 30-day-old. Methionine (2.68 μmol/g body weight) was administered subcutaneously in Wistar female rats, twice a day during entire pregnancy. Melatonin (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered at the same way, but once a day. Control rats were treated with saline or melatonin. Pups were submitted to Morris water maze task in order to verify spatial memory and 12 hours after the animals were killed by decapitation without anesthesia. Results showed that hypermethioninemia reduced Na+K+-ATPase (P < .05) activity and melatonin was able to significantly reverse such effect. Results also demonstrate that the pups treated with methionine presented memory deficit since the average learning time of these pups was longer when compared to the control group (P < .05). On the other hand, pups treated with melatonin obtained values closer to the control, but not significantly. In accordance with our studies, methionine inhibits Na+K+-ATPase activity, which is essential to brain function and changes in its activity could be, at least in part, one of the reasons memory deficit caused by gestational hypermethioninemia. Mechanisms of melatonin action must be further investigated to elucidate how it can work as a possible preventive therapy to reduce neurological disorders found in patients with hypermethioninemia.

N2  - Introduction. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypoventilation and autonomic nervous system dysregulation. CCHS is caused by mutations in the Paired-Like Homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) gene. Case report. This male infant was the firstborn to Ashkenazi Caucasian Jewish parents (whose great-grandparents were biologically related) after an uneventful pregnancy and normal vaginal delivery. Soon after birth, the infant developed central apneas and bradypneas with hemoglobin desaturations to a nadir below 75% and hypoventilation with hypercarbia to a peak of 60 mmHg during sleep, requiring assisted ventilatory support during sleep and bottle feedings. He was treated with non-invasive ventilation and supplemental oxygen until 5 weeks of age when a tracheostomy was placed. Now 16 months old, he continues to require artificial ventilation during sleep and feedings. The infant has no symptoms suggestive of Hirschsprung disease or neural crest tumor, and no overt symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysregulation. PHOX2B analysis using the Screening Test (Rush University Medical Center) and the Sequencing Test (Lurie Children's Hospital) confirmed that the baby is heterozygous for two mutations: a polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (PARM) with 24 repeats (genotype 20/24; normal is 20/20) and a non-PARM (NPARM) missense variant on the other allele (NM-003924.3:c.785G>T, p.Gly262Val). Family investigation identified the 20/24 genotype in the father and paternal grandfather and the NPARM variant in the mother and maternal grandfather (variant previously reported in only 1 of 52,280 alleles in ExAC database but not in any other genomic database). The parents and grandparents carrying the PHOX2B mutations are reported to be asymptomatic. The mother underwent several surgical procedures under general anesthesia as a young infant and during recent years, and all were uneventful with rapid recovery. On polysomnography neither parent has evidence for apnea, hypoxemia, or hypercarbia. Novelty and importance. This unique case reports the first co-occurrence of a PARM and NPARM in the same child, with evidence for a CCHS phenotype. It also demonstrates that either of these two mutations may be completely asymptomatic for generations and will not necessarily be detected clinically. Hence, many subjects with these single PHOX2B mutations that produce mild or asymptomatic phenotypes may not be identified clinically, so parents may not recognize their reproductive risk for passing the mutation to the next generation in an autosomal dominant manner. Nevertheless, when both of these potentially “benign” mutations occur in one subject, a classical presentation of CCHS may occur.

N2  - Malnutrition involves either energy undernutrition or nutrient deficiencies, as well as overnutrition implicating calories or food excess consumption. Undernutrition usually concerns underfeeding, famine and poor nutritional status while obesity refers to excessive fat accumulation. These conditions are largely dependent on unbalanced energy equilibrium or in some nutrients, which are associated with starvation, impaired food consumption, or diseases, which trigger metabolic alterations. Interestingly, maternal undernutrition or overnutrition during gestation/lactation (inadequate maternal diet or health) negatively impact child growth and future physiopathological functions. Additionally, malnutrition is related to immunodeficiency, disease onset and accelerated aging, and has adverse influences on health in the adulthood, including excessive body weight, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular events and eventually cancer or other diseases. Growing scientific evidences are supporting the view that environmental and social factors, including undernutrition, can alter epigenetic signatures (particularly DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications and non-coding RNA expression), affecting gene expression and subsequently cell functions, with lasting effects on adult life health. In this context, inadequacies in dietary methyl-donors (folate, choline, betaine or B vitamins) and other micronutrients, low-protein diets or calorie restriction and famine exposure during early stages, but also excessive calorie intake, high-fat and high-sugar diets, or obesity itself may modify the epigenome and promote the onset of several pathological conditions by impairing epigenetic mechanisms affecting genes associated with insulin sensitivity, growth, inflammation, adipogenesis, lipid turnover, etc. Interestingly, these breakthroughs are contributing to devise original dietary approaches targeting the epigenome. Differences among individuals in disease predisposition rely on the DNA sequence (e.g. SNPs), and also on epigenetic phenomena affecting gene expression including the regulatory actions of DNA methylation and miRNA. Indeed, the recognition of individuals eliciting epigenetic changes at a perinatal period in the methylation profiles of specific genes might contribute to assess the future susceptibility for obesity and related comorbidities in adulthood. Furthermore, newer approaches for individualized dietary treatments by means of algorithms based on genetic and epigenetic knowledge are paving the way for their possible implementation in precision individual's nutrition by better understanding the role of genes regulating appetite, thermogenesis, nutrient turnover and deposition, oxidative and reticulum stress, and other metabolic pathways. Summing up, current undernutrition and obesity research should be focused on understanding epigenetic marks and messengers related to the regulation of cell signaling, inflammatory and intermediate metabolic pathways, accentuating health interactions with social and environmental factors (diet, physical activity, stress, sleep) to achieve precision nutrition. Actually, recent findings have demonstrated an epigenetic underlying of different metabolic disorders with appearance in adulthood, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes as well as cancer, and the involvement of some specific processes participating in the developmental origin of disease in the adult known as the Do- HAD hypothesis.

N2  - Introduction: Shift work has deleterious effects on reproductive health and has been linked to irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, reduced fertility, increased miscarriage, and low birth weight. These effects may be due to disruptions of the circadian timing system. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that mis-timed food, a common disruptive feature of shift work, would impair reproductive success in mice. Methods: Male and female Per2::Luc mice that carry a fusion protein of Per2 and luciferase were fed either during their active or inactive phases. Circadian desynchrony was verified by in vivo imaging of antiphase Per2 oscillations in the liver. Prior to pairing, estrus cycling was monitored in all females for three weeks. Males and females, balanced for age and body weight, were then paired. Copulatory behavior (inferred from copulatory plugs), pregnancy, litter sizes, and uterine implantation sites (stained with ammonium sulfide), were measured in both groups. Reproductive tissues were collected for phase assessment by real time PCR. Results: Food timing determined the phase of the circadian clock in the ovary and uterus, suggesting that internal desynchrony caused by restricted feeding extends to the reproductive system. Mice fed during their inactive phase had significantly fewer litters (25% versus 73%, Chi2 test, p<0.05). This was likely due to a reduction in mating behavior, as the number of females with copulatory plugs was similarly reduced in the inactive phase feeding group (42% versus 82%, Chi2 test, p<0.05). Surprisingly, there was no evidence of a difference in estrus cycle stability. Litter size and the number of spontaneous abortions did not differ between groups. Conclusion: Mis-timed feeding disrupts circadian phase in reproductive tissues and inhibits reproductive success in mice by reducing copulatory success.

N2  - The global prevalence of obesity continues to rise at an alarming rate and 37.7% of US adults are obese. Understanding the causes of excessive weight gain is extremely important, as it paves the way for the development of new therapies to control this epidemic. Obesity is a heterogeneous chronic disease where multiple factors interact to produce a state of positive energy balance leading to an increase in body weight. This review focuses on the major biological, environmental, and behavioral determinants of obesity. The key biological factors include genetics, brain-gut axis, prenatal determinants, pregnancy, menopause, neuroendocrine conditions, medications, physical disability, gut microbiome, and viruses. Propensity to develop obesity owing to one or more of these elements is exacerbated by environmental and behavioral influences. Environmental factors include food abundance, built environments, socioeconomic status, culture, social bias, and environmental chemicals. Behavioral factors comprise excessive calorie intake, eating patterns, sedentary lifestyles, insufficient sleep, and smoking cessation. It is essential to identify the determinants of adiposity in individuals with obesity to tailor prevention and treatment techniques effectively.

N2  - Background and Aims: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic disease which, untreated, progresses to fibrosis and cirrhosis.With a relapsing and remitting nature, treatment is frequently lifelong. This has significant implications given the side effects with long term medication use. Patient perspectives are not frequently documented although the impact on adherence to therapy is clear. Methods: An e-survey of patients was undertaken in conjunction with the national patient group, AIH Support. 185 people responded. 162 respondents were female (88%), average age 49 years. Results: First line therapy: 182 had started on treatment, 161 on Prednisolone either alone (n = 93) or in combination with another agent; 13 were on Budesonide (6 in combination with Azathioprine). 4 patients (2%) recalled being given a choice between Prednisolone and Budesonide; 3 chose Budesonide. Side effects: 178/183 (97%) reported at least one corticosteroid related side effect: weight change (77%), sleep disturbance (70%), facial/skin/ hair changes (67%), mood/personality change (57%), GI disturbance (30%). 73% told their clinician. 27% reported that their corticosteroids were changed or stopped. The most common reasons given for not altering treatment were: necessary for disease control (n = 26), side effects normal (n = 19), side effects mild (n = 8), no alternative available (n = 6). Information: Respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with information they received from their clinician about AIH itself, initial treatment and current treatment on a scale of 1-5 (1 = not at all, 5 = thoroughly). 18 recalled being given information about relevant patient groups. 95% of those who did not thought that this would be useful. Other information considered by patients as useful included long term prognosis, current research, diet, lifestyle advice, effect on fertility and pregnancy, understanding blood test results. Conclusions: Corticosteroid related side effects are encountered by the majority of patients with AIH. Most did not change or stop medication, however, as treatment was deemed necessary to control disease and side effects were “normal” and expected. Alternatives to Prednisolone with fewer systemic side effects such as Budesonide were offered to only a small number. Patient responses also highlighted opportunity for clinicians to improve information about diagnosis and treatment provided, as well as to direct individuals towards patient support groups (Table presented).

N2  - Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) is an ultra-rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal disease characterized by deficiency in beta-glucuronidase enzyme. Over sixty different mutations distributed along GUSB gene have been reported to date.Mutation spectrum includes missense, nonsense, deletions and splice site mutations. Population specific GUSB mutations have been reported, with Pro408Leu and Pro415- Leu being observed only in Mexican patients and Ala619Val only in Japanese patients.We present a severely affected MPS VII patient from Thailand with no reported Japanese ancestry, who harbors Ala619Val GUSB mutation. This patient is a female product of nonconsanguineous Thai parents from a rural area and G2P1 mother, who was born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestation. Prenatal history was significant for hydrops fetalis detected by ultrasound. Post-natal, neonatal and childhood history was significant for short stature, poor weight gain, mild coarse facial features, macrocephaly, corneal clouding, hypertelorism, obstructive sleep apnea, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, mild hepatomegaly, umbilical hernia, kyphoscoliosis, hip dysplasia, congenital club feet, cervical cord compression, global developmental delay and wheelchair confinement. Comprehensive diagnostic workup including the following was obtained: Karyotype showed 46, XX; skeletal survey showed dysostosis multiplex mainly involving hip and cervical spine; echocardiograms showed malformed atrio-ventricular annulus and aortic root with resolution of pulmonary stenosis and atrial septal defect; MRI spine showed cervicomedullary and C7-T2 compression for which the family declined neurosurgical intervention. At age of 9.5 years, further diagnostic workup confirmed MPS VII. Leukocyte beta-glucuronidase enzyme was deficient (4.45 nmol/hr/mg, normal 31.4-224 nmol/hr/mg). GUSB sequencing revealed homozygous c.1856C>T (p.Ala619Val) mutation. Literature review revealed only two other MPS VII patients, both Japanese, harboring Ala619Val mutation which was considered a founder mutation. Follow-up with patient's family affirmed their Thai but not Japanese ancestry. This report represents a severely affected non-Japanese MPS VII patient carrying the Japanese-specific GUSB Ala619Val mutation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is indicated treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) but has various complications. We describe a patient with lacrimal duct air regurgitation while on CPAP requiring discontinuation. While this has been previously reported in patients with a Lester-Jones tube and in CPAP forums, we discuss an alternative treatment for OSA using a Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD) in a patient with lacrimal duct air regurgitation while on CPAP. REPORT OF CASE A 52-year-old female with moderate OSA, Apnea-Hypoxia Index (AHI) of 16, requiring CPAP at 10 cmH20 complained of air regurgitation through the right eye, morning scleral injection and xerophthalmia with CPAP therapy. Symptoms resolved after discontinuing CPAP. She recalls having air regurgitation while sneezing and nose blowing, but no ophthalmologic complications. She has no history of ophthalmologic surgeries. External eye examination was unremarkable. Despite a decrease in CPAP pressure and a change of mask, air regurgitation persisted. A MAD alleviated the air regurgitation while treating her OSA. Follow-up home sleep test with MAD showed an AHI of 3. DISCUSSION Air regurgitation is explained by the positive pressure created in the upper airways, especially in the lower nasolacrimal duct, that is exaggerated with CPAP. This forces air into the nasolacrimal duct through the inferior meatus in patients with abnormal valves. Valve insufficiency may be due to embryological defects during development completed in the eighth month of gestation. CPAP is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe OSA. Studies have reported ocular complications associated with CPAP for treatment of OSA such as: floppy eyelid syndrome, ocular irritation, abnormal tear break-up, increased upper and lower lid laxity, and conjunctivitis. Similar complications have been cited in patients with Lester-Jones tube insertion and silicone stent deployment, and in a child using nasal CPAP for respiratory support in a neuromuscular disorder requiring high pressures. Online CPAP forums report lacrimal air regurgitation as a feeling of air leaking through the tear duct, audible air bubbling under the eyelid, etc. Treatment included switching from a nasal mask to a full mask, although some noted worsening symptoms, and using a Valsalva maneuver for temporary relief. Interventions for lacrimal duct air regurgitation including reducing CPAP, switching to variable pressure and using barrier ointment were unsuccessful in a limited number of patients with Lester-Jones tube. Recognition of lacrimal duct air defects can increase compliance with treatment for OSA with alternative therapies such as a MAD. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), also known as Sanfilippo syndrome, is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate. These disorders are classified in four types (A-D). MPS IIIB is caused by mutations in the NAGLU gene. The aim of this study is to describe the clinical, biochemical and molecular findings of a patient with MPS IIIB. The diagnosis was performed by clinical findings suggestive of MPS, qualitative chemical tests in urine of the first urination and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) for MPS in 24-hour urine. We quantified the enzymatic activity of N-α-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU). The pathogenic variants were identified by mutation analysis. The patient studied was a 4-year-old boy, with a prenatal history of small stomach and oligoamnium in the second and third trimesters of gestation, respectively. He presented with weight and normal height, discrete facial dysmorphia and recurrent respiratory infections from 4 months of age, accompanied by severe episodes of sleep apnea requiring adenotonsillectomy at 2 years. He had hyperactive behavior with signs of aggressiveness and bruxism, associated with bilateral hearing impairment. In the qualitative tests, we detected an increment of GAG in urine. TLC showed urinary heparan sulfate excretion. NAGLU enzyme activity was deficient in leukocytes. In the molecular study of the NAGLU gene we detected 2 mutations: 3G>A (associated with severe phenotypes) and Met1Ile (allelic variant). The Met1Ile mutation was a novel finding. The carrier study in the parents suggested the parental origin of each variant found. The clinical manifestations, the heparan excretion, the decrease in NAGLU activity allowed the diagnosis of a Sanfilippo syndrome B type in this patient. Besides, the molecular study confirmed the presence of a novel mutation associated with this disorder.

N2  - Background and objectives: Previous obesity prevention interventions all targeted groups where both normal weight and overweight children were present, e.g. in school settings. Only about 1/4 of these previous interventions were effective in reducing weight gain, and studies have proposed, that the few positive effects were restricted to those already overweight, or to high-risk individuals. The objective of this primary prevention RCT was to examine, if excessive weight and fat gain over on average 1.3 years can be prevented among normal weight, but obesity susceptible, young children aged 2-6 years. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01583335. Methods: All children born in 2004-2007 from 11 greater Copenhagen municipalities, with either a high birth weight, maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, or maternal low education, were identified from public registries, and invited to participate. Totally 21% agreed to be included (n=635) and were randomized as intervene-tion or control children. All children who were already overweight or obese were subsequently excluded (n=92). The intervention delivered improvement in diet and activity habits, optimization of sleep quantity and quality, and reduction of stress. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed a lower gain in %-fat mass in the intervention group compared to the control group (difference D=-2.1% (95% CI -3.7; -0.5; p=0.01)), but non-significant differences in BMI z-score gains (p=0.55). Conclusions: Gain in fat may be prevented among normal weight young children at high risk of future obesity, suggesting not only a more favorable growth, despite a similar weight development, but also that primary prevention of obesity is possible.

N2  - Background and objectives: Evidence of effective obesity prevention interventions is limited, and hence new strategies are needed. This study reports the dietary intervention effects from the 15 month primary obesity prevention intervention (Healthy Start). Methods: The “Healthy Start primary intervention study” aimed to prevent excessive weight gain among Danish obesity- prone normal weight preschool children. The intervention was conducted during 2009-2011, and focused on improving the child's diet, physical activity and sleep as well as managing stress in the families of the young children. Children were considered obesity prone if they had either a high birth weight (≥ 4,000 g), a mother with a pre-pregnancy BMI≥ 28 kg/m2), or low maternal education (<10 years of schooling). From a baseline population of 543 Danish normal weight preschool children, 285 completed the intervention with complete information on dietary intake at the baseline- and follow-up examination. Information on diet intake was obtained using a 4-day dietary record, from which a diet quality index assessing complance with the Danish national dietary guidelines was constructed. Linear regression per protocol and intention-to-treat analyses of differences in total energy-, macronutrients-, fruit-, vegetables-, fish- and sugar sweetened beverages intakes and diet quality index between the two groups were conducted. Results: Children in the intervention group had a lower total energy intake after the 15-month intervention compared to the control group (Group mean: 5.3 vs. 5.6 MJ; p=0.02). We found no effect of the intervention on the individual macronutrients-, fruit-, vegetables-, fish- and sugar sweetened beverages intakes or the diet quality. Conclusions: Our results suggest an overall effect of the Healthy Start primary intervention on total energy intake. However, no effects were seen for the individual components of children's dietary intake.

N2  - Introduction: OTC deficiency (ornithine transcarbamylase) is a urea biosynthesis disorder with X-linked recessive inheritance, characterized by recurrent and often fatal hyperammonemic encephalopathy in affected males, but carrier females are usually asymptomatic. The present report is a symptomatic heterozygous female with OTC deficiency. Case description: The index case is a 36 years old female which was referred for genetic counseling with her nonconsanguineous husband, because their first male newborn was suspected as affected by urea cycle disease (death occurred at 8 days of life). She had a good school performance and reached university level. Her mom describes her as a person with “chronic sleep.” She described herself as chronically protein intolerant with recurrent vomiting episodes during childhood and teens years. OTC gene analysis showed a missense heterozygous mutation OTC: c.1005G>A (p.Met335Ile) mutation (NCBI: rs281865553) and confirmed her status as a carrier of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. The couple choose for their next pregnancy in vitro fertilization followed by preimplantation diagnosis, and they have a healthy noncarrier female. She used a diet with fruits and restriction of animal proteins. Sometimes she has apathy after she ate her protein restricted food. Actually, she has recurrent episodes of headache, nausea, epistaxis, and blurred vision. High ammonium levels were detected 107 mg/dL (18.7-86.9) with normal hepatic function. Physical examination shows an asthenic habitus with overweight, short hair, and thin, brittle, and fluted nails. Discussion: OTC partial deficiency have been described in males and females from infancy to adulthood with diverse signs and symptoms as developmental delay, intellectual disability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and executive function deficits, fine motor ability, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition ability, even in mild forms of the disease after a sudden hyperammonemic crisis, may change rapidly in a life-threatening situation. We report a young woman with OTC mutation which was identified after the death of a previous affected son. She lived with a long history of nonidentified signs and symptoms of partial OTC deficiency as episodes of irritability, nausea, episodic vomiting and lethargy, chronic rejection to proteins, and headache. Greater than 90% of partial OTC deficiency survives beyond five decades with decrease of hyperammonemic episodes with long-term treatment.

N2  - According to O'Neil et al. “Breakfast is the first meal of the day that breaks the fast after the long period of sleep and is consumed within 2 to 3 hours of waking; It is comprised of food or beverage from at least one food group, and may be consumed at any location “. Breakfast is considered one of the most important meals of the day, because it provides essential nutrients and produces pleasant sensations that are maintained throughout the day. In addition, different investigations have shown that breakfast helps to improve eating habits and the cardio-metabolic risk profile. According to the first National Nutrition Survey, traditional Paraguayan food is comprised of three important meals per day. Breakfast was one of them and varied according to the urban or rural area. In urban areas, breakfast included milk that was generally not drunk alone, but accompanied by infusions (infusion of yerba mate called “cocido”, or coffee). It was accompanied by baked goods (biscuits), made with wheat flour. In rural areas the “cocido” with milk was accompanied by manioc which is a tuber consumed very much in Paraguay. Milk could also be accompanied by ground coconut or peanuts in a “Mortar and pestle”. However, different factors have influenced this traditional feed pattern to change substantially. The accelerated urbanization experienced by the Paraguayan population; The change of working hours from a double shift schedule with a break at noon to a continuous schedule, where workers who move appreciable distances, consume one or two meals outside the home, globalization with a promotion of foods rich in Calories, sugars and saturated fats, and with devaluation of the consumption of traditional foods like seasonal fruits and vegetables, are factors that have influenced the change. One of the main problems in relation to the food consumption habits of the Paraguayan population, especially the young population living in urban areas, is the high percentage of people who have insufficient and inadequate breakfast before going to work or to study. In a pilot study investigating breakfast-related habits among 50 students in medical and nutrition careers in Asuncion, we have shown that 60% of the students had adequate breakfast, 35% ate insufficiently at breakfast and 5% did not eat breakfast. Insufficient breakfast is a very frequent habit in our young population. It generally consists of a portion, represented by a glass or cup, of milk or fruit juice, without any other food. These figures are similar to the findings of other studies in the school population. We are currently developing research in different populations (schoolchildren, university students, pregnant women and the elderly) to determine the severity of the changes experienced in the habits related to breakfast of the Paraguayan population.

N2  - Introduction Hypercarbia is a common abnormality seen in premature babies, usually caused by lung disease. We report a rare cause of persistent hypercarbia observed in twins that were born premature. Case report Male monochorionic, diamniotic twins were born at 31 weeks gestation by cesarean section due to premature rupture of membranes. Both babies required intubation after birth due to respiratory failure. Twin B had mild respiratory distress syndrome. Sepsis, pneumonia and upper airway obstruction were initially ruled out in both. Following initial intubation and stabilization, both twins failed multiple attempts to wean off ventilator support due to persistent respiratory acidosis. Episodes of apnea did not respond to caffeine. Chest X-rays in both showed changes of mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Cardiac, hematologic and neurologic evaluations were negative. Both babies required placement of tracheostomy at 2 months of age for inability to wean from respiratory support. Persistent hypercarbia out of proportion to lung disease raised suspicion of central dysregulation of respiration. Genetic studies were sent for both with positive results for paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX 2B) 25/20 gene mutation confirming the diagnosis of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Both babies were discharged from hospital on home mechanical ventilator support. Discussion Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by disordered respiratory control and resultant alveolar hypoventilation due to diffuse autonomic nervous system dysregulation. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene located on chromosome 4. Depending on genetic variation due to number of polyalanine repeats, there can be considerable difference in phenotypic expression. As a result of hypoventilation, these individuals become hypoxemic and hypercarbic but typically lack the ability to respond to these endogenous stimuli of ventilation regulation. Hirschsprung disease, tumors of neural crest origin, cardiac asystole and symptoms reflecting autonomic nervous system dysregulation have been associated with CCHS. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome in twin babies, especially those born premature, has rarely been reported. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains a significant cause of respiratory illness in premature babies. In this instance, both twins did not respond to traditional management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Persistent hypercarbia out of proportion to lung disease should raise suspicion for abnormalities affecting control of ventilation such as CCHS. Patients with PHOX 2B, 25/20 mutation are reported to be ventilator dependent only during sleep, but both of these babies currently require 24 hour ventilator support, possibly due to coexisting bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal maternal obesity has been linked to adverse childhood neuropsychiatric outcomes, including increased symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), internalizing and externalizing problems, affective disorders and neurodevelopmental problems but few studies have studied neuropsychiatric outcomes among offspring born to very severely obese women or assessed potential familial confounding by maternal psychological distress.
METHOD: We evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms in 112 children aged 3-5 years whose mothers had participated in a longitudinal study of obesity in pregnancy (50 very severe obesity, BMI ⩾40 kg/m2, obese class III and 62 lean, BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2). The mothers completed the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale, Early Symptomatic Syndrome Eliciting Neurodevelopmental Clinical Examination Questionnaire (ESSENCE-Q), Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) to assess child neuropsychiatric symptoms. Covariates included child's sex, age, birthweight, gestational age, socioeconomic deprivation levels, maternal age, parity, smoking status during pregnancy, gestational diabetes and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using State Anxiety of Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), respectively.
RESULTS: Children exposed to prenatal maternal very severe obesity had significantly higher scores in the Conners' Hyperactivity Scale; ESSENCE-Q; total sleep problems in CSHQ; hyperactivity, conduct problems and total difficulties scales of the SDQ; higher externalizing and total problems, anxious/depressed, aggressive behaviour and other problem syndrome scores and higher DSM-oriented affective, anxiety and ADHD problems in CBCL. Prenatal maternal very severe obesity remained a significant predictor of child neuropsychiatric problems across multiple scales independent of demographic factors, prenatal factors and maternal concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal maternal very severe obesity is a strong predictor of increased neuropsychiatric problems in early childhood.

N2  - Objectives: To observe and compare the treatment effect of multiple insulin injections and insulin pump therapy on pregnant women with gestational diabetes. Methods: From January, 2015 to May, 2017, 90 pregnant women with gestational diabetes enrolled in Linyi Chinese Medicine Hospital were collected and randomly divided into research group and reference group. In the research group, 45 patients were treated with insulin pump therapy. All 45 patients in the reference group were treated with multiple insulin injections therapy. General treatment effect of these two groups was then observed and compared. Results: After treatment, in research group, patients’ fasting blood-glucose level was 5.2 ± 0.6 mmol/L, 2 h post-meal blood sugar level was 7.3 ± 1.2 mmol/L and the blood-glucose standard time was 2.5 ± 0.8 d; However, in the reference group, the fasting blood-glucose level was 6.8 ± 0.6 mmol/L, 2 h post-meal blood sugar level was 8.8 ± 1.2 mmol/L and the blood-glucose standard time was 6.9 ± 1.4 d, P<0.05. When comparing the changes of peripheral blood sugar between the 2 groups after treatment, in research group, the peripheral blood sugar level was 4.8 ± 0.7 mmol/L before breakfast, 5.3 ± 1.2 mmol/L after breakfast, 5.8 ± 1.2 mmol/L before lunch, 5.4 ± 1.2 mmol/L after lunch, 5.2 ± 1.0 mmol/L before dinner, 6.3 ± 1.1 mmol/L after dinner, 6.7 ± 1.4 mmol/L before sleep, while in reference group, the peripheral blood sugar level was 3.6 ± 0.8 mmol/L before breakfast, 6.5 ± 2.3 mmol/L after breakfast, 6.6 ± 1.5 mmol/L before lunch, 7.3 ± 1.5 mmol/L after lunch, 5.8 ± 1.2 mmol/L before dinner, 8.6 ± 1.7 mmol/L after dinner, 7.3 ± 1.3 mmol/L before sleep, P<0.05. Hypoglycemia occurred more frequently in reference group than in the research group after calculation and observation. Conclusion: Compared with multiple insulin injections therapy, the project of treating gestational diabetes patients with insulin pump therapy has more precise effect. Additionally, it has great safety and reliability, along with huge application value.

N2  - Background and objectives: One obstacle to increasing compliance with multi-micronutrient (MMN) or iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation in pregnant women is the side effects, such as a bad smell, nausea, vomiting, stomachache, or headache. To address this problem, in this study, IFA and MMN were each encapsulated in soft capsules, and we evaluated the compliance and acceptance reported by respondents. Methods: This study was conducted in three sub-districts of Banggai district from October 2016 to February 2017. The subjects were preconception women who were newlywed and 18-35 years of age and who did not have serious diseases, such as tuberculosis, heart disease, or kidney failure. Both IFA and MMN tablets were crushed and then placed in capsule shells with the same color and size. The capsules were randomly delivered to the respondents, who consumed a capsule once per week unless they were menstruating, at which time consumption was daily. Of the 102 preconception women who were recruited, 40 were interviewed about consumption and any side effects that they felt. The level of pleasure was scored on a 3-point hedonic scale, and the response for each sensory quality, namely, color, odor, taste and size, was rated 2 or 3 (likable or very likable).The data were analyzed based on distribution and frequency. Results: The results showed that 36 respondents (90%) consumed the capsules consistently, as recommended. As many as 38 respondents (95%) liked the color, 37(92.5%) described no odor, 37(92.5%) liked the flavor, and 37 (92.5%) liked the size. Ten respondents (25%) reported an increase in appetite, and 5 respondents (12.5%) reported deeper sleep. Approximately 4 respondents (10%) reported headache, and 2 (5%) complained of constipation. Conclusions: Encapsulation of MMN or IFA may be an alternative approach for increasing compliance with consumption and reducing side effects.

N2  - Background: 14% of Indiana infant deaths are sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID). When a baby dies suddenly an investigation is carried out and the mother is interviewed or she may complete a questionnaire. The Fetal Infant Mortality Report (FIMR) contains the detail of the mothers' (or caregiver) narrative. By examining the interview - the mother's perspectives could contribute understanding of their experiences and may assist in ameliorating the risks associated with an infant death and inform practice and policy. The purpose of our research study was to describe the mothers' experiences when death of an infant occurs suddenly and unexpectedly. Objective(s): Learning Objectives: At the end of this presentation, the attendee will be able to: 1. describe the socioeconomic disparity as described in the FIMR report. 2. appreciate the experiences of mothers with a SUID loss. 3. inform their practice from the study's findings. Material/Methods: A total of 17 cases were reviewed. The Thematic Analysis Program (TAP) from the Joanna Briggs Institute ( JBI) was used to analyze the interview data. The software assisted with identifying categories. Results: A total of nine categories were identified from the maternal narrations. Meta-aggregation resulted in three synthesized themes. Extreme Emotional Shock 911.Help me! I was in shock Checking my story We Feel Like We're to Blame Not where s/he was supposed to sleep. Naming the cause increases my guilt o It was our fault. Working Toward Moving On I can't talk about it One step forward. Support helps me get through. Conclusions: All the babies were found in an unsafe sleep environment. Hospital discharge records showed that the mother was given “safe sleep” Risk Factors are: women no smoking, no alcohol or illegal drugs, especially during pregnancy. African Americans are at higher risk of infant deaths. Anyone who cares for children should know the ways to reduce the risk of SUID.

N2  - Daily torpor is a physiological adaptation in mammals and birds characterized by a controlled reduction of metabolic rate and body temperature during the resting phase of circadian rhythms. In laboratory mice, daily torpor is induced by dietary caloric restriction. However, it is not known which nutrients are related to daily torpor expression. To determine whether dietary protein is a key factor in inducing daily torpor in mice, we fed mice a protein-restricted (PR) diet that included only one quarter of the amount of protein but the same caloric level as a control (C) diet. We assigned six non-pregnant female ICR mice to each group and recorded their body weights and core body temperatures for 4 weeks. Body weights in the C group increased, but those in the PR group remained steady or decreased. Mice in both groups did not show daily torpor, but most mice in a food-restricted group (n=6) supplied with 80% of the calories given to the C group exhibited decreased body weights and frequently displayed daily torpor. This suggests that protein restriction is not a trigger of daily torpor; torpid animals can conserve their internal energy, but torpor may not play a significant role in conserving internal protein. Thus, opportunistic daily torpor in mice may function in energy conservation rather than protein saving.

N2  - Hyperprolactinaemia especially affects women in reproductive age (90/100,000) but also often is diagnosed in menopause age and leads to disturbances in functioning of LH-RH neurons and, as a consequence, to a decrease of FSH and LH, which causes inhibition of oestradiol production. Prolactin is a peptide hormone, phylogenetically one of the oldest, stimulating cells of various organs, which is produced and secreted mainly by lactotrophic acidophilic cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary. It influences the increase in the mass of the mammary glands, and stimulation and maintenance of lactation after delivery. There are a number of factors apart of pregnancy, delivery, and lactation than can influence secretion of the hormone in other physiological and pathological circumstances, like high-protein diet, stress, REM sleep, or neoplastic tumours, inflammatory diseases, chronic systematic diseases, thyroid hormonal changes, and drug intake. The purpose of this review is to summarise the current knowledge regarding the proper diagnosis and possible influence of hyperprolactinaemia on fertility and menopause symptoms and current treatment methods.

N2  - Background. The treatment and prevention of migraine attacks has for long yielded insufficient results. A usual level of result achieved (using standard treatment methods) (i.e. 50% reduction in frequency of attacks) [1] does not produce satisfactory quality of life for the patients. Neither does it reduce the problem of resistant attacks. We conducted the current study with the goal of increasing efficacy of the prevention of migraine attacks using quetiapine as an additional (supplementary) medicine in patients suffering from Chronic Migraine [2] and already taking anticonvulsants. Materials and methods. 118 male and female patients from 18 to 50 y.o., suffering from Chronic Migraine were included in this study. Pregnant and nursing mothers and any patient suffering from somatic illnesses were excluded from the sample. Patients were prescribed topiromat (up to 300 mg/per day) for a 6-month period, but were transferred to sodium valproat (up to 30 mg/ kg of weight) in cases of non-response. In cases of response to treatment quetiapine was added as a supplementary (secondary) medicine after 6-month treatment with sodium valproat. A single dose of quetiapine was prescribed at night. The dosage was titrated from 25 mg to 400 mg for a period of 1-1.5 months until a therapeutic effect was attained . The treatment using topiromat+quetiapine or sodium valproat+ quetiapin lasted for a period of 6 months. Results. We observed in 68.5% of patients complete absence of attacks as result of supplementing quetiapine to the achieved existing level of their individual therapeutic dosage. In 32.5% of cases frequency of attacks was no more than 2 per month. In 1%, frequency of attacks were remained up to 4 per month. All observed attacks were relieved rapidly by NSID or triptans. Conclusions. Quetiapine shows a high efficacy as a supplementary (secondary) medicine when insufficient results were achieved over a 6 months period when prescribing topiromat or sodium valproat respectively. The following side-effects were observed when dosage of quetiapine was rapidly increased (up to 100mg per 1-1.5 months): daytime drowsiness for the first 10 days of medication in doses up to 100 mg/per day. This side-effect disappeared when the pain subsided. In 3 patients, congestion of nasal passages was observed before sleep, which was also reduced with increased dosage. In addition to the pain relief achieved, the following concomitant disorders were reduced: anxiety and asthenia, insomnia, hiperalgomenorroea. The total effect was a general enhancement of the patients' quality of life. We suggest that increased level of transmissions of serotonin may be underlying reason basis of high efficacy of quetiapine in resistant and chronic forms of migraine (with and without aura).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep deprivation may compromise obstetricians' performance in the delivery room. We sought to evaluate the impact of time of day on maternal and neonatal outcome following Vacuum assisted vaginal delivery (VAVD). STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort analysis of all women carrying singleton term pregnancies undergoing VAVD in a tertiary hospital (2007-2014). Cohort was stratified by time of day: morning (07:00- 14:59), evening (15:00-22:59) or night shift (23:00-06:59). Adverse outcome was defined as (1) birth trauma (any of: subgaleal hematoma, subarachnoid hematoma, subdural hematoma, skull fracture, or erb's palsy); (2) neonatal morbidity (any of: 5' Apgar score<7, asphyxia, seizures, intraventricular hemorrhage, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, meconium aspiration syndrome, sepsis or mechanical ventilation); and (3) maternal morbidity (any of: post-partum hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, obstetric anal sphincter injuries, blood transfusion, laparotomy or hysterectomy). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to adjust results to potential confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 5,175 women underwent VAVD during the study period, of them 4,993 women met inclusion criteria. Maternal characteristics were overall similar between shifts. Women delivered during the night shifts had higher rates of neonatal asphyxia (3.5% vs. 3.7% vs. 5.3%), neonatal sepsis (7.1% vs. 7.7% vs. 9.5%) and neonatal morbidity (10.6% vs. 11.5% vs. 13.7%), morning, evening and night shifts, respectively, p< 0.05 for all (table 1). Rate of birth trauma was similar between groups although differences in neonatal cephalohematoma and subdural hematoma. Maternal morbidity was similar besides higher rates of obstetric anal sphincter injuries occurring more often during the night shifts (0.7% vs 1.5% vs. 2%, p= 0.004) (table 2). Differences in neonatal morbidity and anal sphincter injuries remained significant after adjustment to potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Our study supports higher rates of perinatal morbidity following VAVD performed during night shifts. (Table Presented).

N2  - The design of an early mobile health application (app) prototype to manage interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by recurrent pain/discomfort in the bladder and pelvic floor, is described. The purpose of this app prototype is to help people who have IC/PBS manage and learn what triggers their symptoms. Another aim of this research was to provide an example of how sex and gender could be included into the design of a health information system. Based on a literature search of common symptoms and challenges faced by people living with IC/PBS, the researcher created an app prototype design including many features: resources for relaxation, mental health, intimacy, pregnancy, and daily life; reminders for appointments, and medication; logs for diet, activity, sleep, pain, menstruation; and a link to a public washroom locator. This prototype will later undergo usability and content evaluation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse factors associated with the susceptibility of early childhood caries (ECC), populations with a high risk of ECC were screened and guidance for ECC prevention was proposed.
METHODS: A total of 392 children aged 24 to 71 months were selected for oral examination in Qingdao. Parents or guardians of the participants completed the questionnaires and decayed missing filled surface (dmfs) were recorded. Differences in caries condition and oral health behaviour in different families were compared. Risk factors related to ECC were screened. The subjects were finally grouped based on the obtained dmfs into three groups: caries-free, ECC and S-ECC (severe ECC). Association of risk factors with the caries status was analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: There were significant differences among the caries-free, ECC and S-ECC groups in three parameters: eating too many sweets each day, brushing before and after sleeping, and whether parents helped to brush (P < 0.01). Combined factors such as the parents' level of education, oral health knowledge, attitudes, the family's annual income, the age of children when they start to brush and not brushing regularly were also significantly related to ECC (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed among the three groups for these factors, including birth condition and nursing state, physical condition of the mother during pregnancy, feeding situation, if a pacifier was used during sleep, duration of brushing, frequency of mouth rinsing after meals each day and brushing with fluoride toothpaste (P  > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Eating a lot of sweets, an incorrect brushing method, starting brushing at a later stage and not brushing regularly are susceptible factors for ECC. Emphasising oral health knowledge to parents and guardians, conducting proper brushing methods, limiting the frequency of sweets being eaten and avoiding an inappropriate habit of eating sweets are very important factors in the prevention of ECC.

N2  - Worldwide, the prevalence of childhood obesity has increased, amounting to 42 million overweight or obese children, and there is increasing evidence that the origins are within the first 1,000 days: the period of conception through 2 years. Antecedents of early childhood obesity are multifactorial, and associations of varying strength have been documented for genetic/epigenetic, biologic, dietary, environmental, social, and behavioral influences. Modifiable factors in pregnancy and early infancy associated with childhood obesity include maternal overweight/obesity, maternal smoking, gestational weight gain, infant and young child feeding, caregiver responsive feeding practices, as well as sleep duration, and physical activity. Promising obesity prevention interventions include those beginning during the first 1,000 days, using a multicomponent approach, with roots in nutrition education theories or behavior change communication that can continue over time. However, the limited number of completed interventions to date (within pediatric clinics or in home-based or community settings) may not be scalable to the magnitude needed for sustainable obesity prevention. Scale-up interventions that can be maintained for the durations needed, addressing infant and young child feeding and other modifiable risk factors associated with childhood obesity are needed.

N2  - Background: Holoprosencephaly is a rare spectrum of cephalic disorders resulting from a failure or incomplete division of the embryonic forebrain into distinct cerebral hemispheres. It is the most common brain malformation with an incidence of 1:250 during embryogenesis; however, owing to the associated high rates of spontaneous abortion the incidence is 1:16,000 among live deliveries. Pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly is complex and heterogeneous involving genetic abnormalities, teratogenic exposures, and syndromic associations. Among the teratogenic exposures, maternal diabetes is a well-established risk factor associated with a 200-fold increased incidence of holoprosencephaly. Case presentation: We report a case of a delayed diagnosis of semilobar holoprosencephaly in a 12-month-old baby boy of African descent who presented to us with a history of global developmental delay, erratic sleep patterns, and poor weight gain. He was born to a type 1 diabetes mellitus mother at 39+ weeks by emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress and breech presentation. The baby weighed 2315 g and had Apgar scores of 6/10 and 8/10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. A physical examination done at 12 months of age revealed a small-for-age child with a developmental age of 2 months. He had normal facies but a neurological examination revealed hypotonia in all four limbs. The rest of systemic examination was unremarkable. Hematological and biochemical investigations revealed normal findings except for iron deficiency anemia. The child also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of his brain which revealed distinctive features of semilobar holoprosencephaly. He was treated for iron deficiency anemia with Hemovit syrup (ferric ammonium citrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin, and zinc sulfate) 10 ml thrice daily, ferrous sulfate 10 mg once daily, folic acid 1 mg once daily, and multivitamin syrup 5 ml once daily. Furthermore, nutritional and genetic counseling was offered to his parents. Conclusions: In conclusion, although rare, holoprosencephaly is the commonest structural anomaly of the brain with a complex and multifactorial etiopathogenesis. It is prudent to diagnose it prenatally, classify its severity, and forge its prognosis so that parents are counseled early enough to make informed decisions especially where termination of pregnancy may be implicated.

N2  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) complicates 5-10% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, mortality and neurodevelopmental delay. The development of sleep and cardiovascular control are closely coupled and IUGR is known to alter this development. In the long-term, IUGR is associated with altered sleep and an increased risk of hypertension in adulthood. Melatonin plays an important role in the sleep-wake cycle. Experimental animal studies have shown that melatonin therapy has neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in the IUGR fetus. Consequently, clinical trials are currently underway to assess the short and long term effects of antenatal melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies. Given melatonin's role in sleep regulation, this hormone could affect the developing infants' sleep-wake cycle and cardiovascular function after birth. In this review, we will 1) examine the role of melatonin as a therapy for IUGR pregnancies and the potential implications on sleep and the cardiovascular system; 2) examine the development of sleep-wake cycle in fetal and neonatal life; 3) discuss the development of cardiovascular control during sleep; 4) discuss the effect of IUGR on sleep and the cardiovascular system and 5) discuss the future implications of melatonin therapy in IUGR pregnancies.

N2  - Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disease whose patients suffer from chronic anemia, hemolysis, vascular damage, and impaired cerebral blood flow that lead to early and cumulative neurological insults. Adverse effects associated with chronic anemia and hemolysis in SCD include progressive large vessel vasculopathy, stroke, silent cerebral infarctions, and ultimately, early mortality. Few studies have attempted to characterize the effects of this disease on brain morphometry and most have been limited to school age children, despite the progressive nature of the cerebrovascular disease. Thus, this study aims to quantify the hematological effects of SCD on brain morphometry in adolescents and young adults. Methods: 3D T1-weighted images (TE =3.8ms TR =8.3ms; resolution = 1mm3) were acquired on 25 clinically asymptomatic SCD patients (age=20.8 ± 6.7; F=13, M=12) and 26 ethnically matched control subjects (age=26.4 ± 7.7; F=17, M=9). MRI data were acquired on a 3T Philips Achieva (v.3.2.1) using an 8-channel head coil. All patients were recruited with informed consent or assent; the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CCI#11-00083). Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, previous overt stroke, acute chest, or pain crisis hospitalization within one month. T1-weighted images were processed using BrainSuite (brainsuite.org) in a semi-automated fashion to calculate whole brain gray matter volume (GMV), and white matter volume (WMV). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis was run on GMV and WMV against laboratory data and vital signs to find predictors of total brain volume. Laboratory data probed including complete blood counts and indices, quantitative hemoglobin electrophoresis, and markers of hemolysis (LDH, reticulocyte count, cell free hemoglobin). After correcting for age and sex, the remaining predictors of grey and white matter volume were used to probe for regional changes in brain volume through tensor based morphometry (Brain Suite Statistics Toolbox). Results: White matter, but not grey matter, was diffusely smaller in SCD patients. Sex, age (log transformed) and mean platelet volume (MPV) were the parameters retained in the multivariate model to predict GMV (r2 =0.65; F ratio=28.9) where MPV had a positive correlation to GMV. Hemoglobin, sex, and MPV were found as predictors of WMV (r2 =0.43; F ratio = 11.8) where both hemoglobin and MPV had a positive correlation to WMV. Using tensor based morphometry (TBM), both hemoglobin and MPV were positively associated with brain volume changes diffusely in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices (Figure 1). Hemoglobin had a strong localized effect on the subcortex (white matter and basal ganglia) (Figure 1) suggesting that anemia was associated with volume loss in these areas. MPV overall was found to have a strong effect on cortical morphology diffusely. Conclusion: Hemoglobin's relationship to brain volume and morphology suggests global white matter shrinkage due to anemia. The association is strongest in the phylogenetically younger portions of the brain and co-localizes with brain regions impacted by silent stroke. MPV was an unexpectedly strong predictor of cortical volumes in both SCD and control subjects. MPV is an indicator of platelet activation and is associated with ischemic stroke, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and coronary artery syndromes in the general population, similar to C-reactive protein. However, the broad association of MPV and grey matter volumes in both SCD patients and controls, independently, suggests a developmental interplay between brain maturation and inflammatory signaling that requires further study.

N2  - Introduction: White matter strokes are a major concern for patients with sickle cell disease and other forms of anemia. SCD patients are known to have diffuse white matter volume loss, abnormal WM microstructure, silent strokes, and poor neurocognitive function. Similar neurological abnormalities have been described in thalassemia intermedia. Low levels of hemoglobin have been associated with risk of silent cerebral infarctions across patient populations with chronic anemia and severe anemia may increase the risk for cerebral vascular accidents. In this current study, we use MRI brain mapping techniques to explore the relationship between a wide range of hemoglobin levels and WM neural tissue properties. Methods: 16 SCD patients (age=26.1 ± 10.3; F=9, M=7; hemoglobin=9.4 ± 2.1), 8 patients with non-sickle anemia (age=23.6 ± 7.4; F=4, M=4; hemoglobin=12.2 ± 3.2), and 15 control subjects (age=22.8 ± 7.2; F=10, M=5; hemoglobin=13.2 ± 1.3) were recruited with informed consent or assent; the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CCI#11-00083). Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, previous overt stroke, acute chest, or pain crisis hospitalization within one month. MRI data were acquired on a 3T Philips Achieva (v.3.2.1) using an 8-channel head coil. 3D T1-weighted images (TE =3.8ms TR =8.3ms; resolution = 1mm ) were pre-processed using BrainSuite (brainsuite.org) and registered to a common atlas space using Surface Volume Registration (SVReg15a). Diffusion weighted images (TE = 2.5ms; TR = 4.8ms; 2.5mm isotropic voxels) included 30 diffusion-encoding directions at b-value=1000m/s and a reverse-gradient b=0. Fieldmaps were estimated using FSL's topup module. BrainSuite Diffusion Pipeline (BDP15a) performed distortion correction, co-registration to T1-weighted images, and diffusion tensor modeling. Voxel-wise calculations of DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were transferred to the common atlas space. Pearson correlations were performed using BrainSuite Statistics Toolbox. Results: Hemoglobin was correlated to FA, AD, and, RD in multiple brain regions after controlling for age and sex (Figure 1) The colorbar represents the r-value for the correlations (red positive, blue negative) and only statistically significant values are displayed. Anemia was associated with increased RD and AD broadly over the brain (blue), including corpus callosum, subcortical nuclei, and frontal and parietal white matter. These regions represent classic “watershed” areas that are the primary targets of silent strokes in sickle cell disease, hypertension, aging, and obstructive sleep apnea. FA changes were more modest in extent, but also occurred in areas classically associated with silent stroke. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the severity of anemia, rather than the type of anemia, is the primary risk factor for white matter damage. Low hemoglobin concentration correlated to increases in RD and AD, indicative of demyelination and axonal degeneration respectively. Interestingly, the regions of abnormal diffusivity parallel the pattern of regional vulnerability to stroke in SCD patients in previous literature (frontal lobe > parietal lobe, subcortical nuclei, > temporal lobe, >> occipital lobe and cerebellum). While silent strokes and abnormal diffusivity co-localize, the volume of infarcted tissue is much smaller, suggesting that changes in RD and AD are detecting preclinical white matter injury in anemic patients. We postulate that anemia, by depleting cerebrovascular reserve, leaves patients vulnerable to acute interruptions in supply or increases in metabolic demand. Our observations may have important implications for choosing set points for chronic transfusion therapy in anemic patients.

N2  - Adequate sleep is crucial for general health and wellbeing. Although the neuronal control of the reproductive axis and sleep-generating neurons share an anatomical location, little is known regarding the impact of sleep and circadian disruption on fertility in women. Animal models have established clear circadian control of the pre-ovulatory luteinizing hormone surge. Additionally, disruption of the circadian timing system by exposure to abnormal light-dark cycles or mutations of core clock genes results in diminished reproductive capacity in animals. Abnormalities in menstruation, fertility, and early pregnancy maintenance in female shift workers provide evidence for a role of circadian rhythms in the reproductive health of women. Reproductive hormones may modify sleep, and the relationship is bidirectional such that sleep disruption may alter the profile of reproductive hormone secretion. Therefore, sleep, apart from its circadian timing, may also have relevance in attaining pregnancy. Additionally, infertility is associated with psychological distress which may result in poor quality sleep. The interaction between psychological distress and disturbed sleep in reproduction has garnered minimal attention and may be a crucial factor to consider during the evaluation and treatment of infertility. This work reviews animal models and evidence in women that suggest a role for sleep and circadian rhythms in reproductive health and reveals areas that require future investigation.

N2  - We evaluated the psychometric properties of a Mandarin Chinese version of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire-10 (FOSQ-10) in pregnant women. A total of 228 first-trimester pregnant women participated in the study, which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = .85), adequate corrected item-total correlations (from .40 to .67), and acceptable test-retest reliability over 7 days (ICC = .73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one-factor structure with item loadings between .49 and .77. Significant associations with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey 12 version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index supported criterion-related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Ceiling effects were observed for all items, but no floor or ceiling effects were found for total scores. Findings suggest that the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 is a valid and reliable instrument to identify important effects of sleep-related impairment in Chinese women during pregnancy. Further testing is needed in more diverse pregnant women, such as women with complicated pregnancies and those with sleep disorders. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) during pregnancy has emerged as a predictor of both maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Data suggest that SDB during pregnancy is associated with maternal gestational hypertension and preeclampsia as well as gestational diabetes. Furthermore, there are increasing reports that SDB may play a role in fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, increased cesarean sections, and increased neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions. The public health impact of unrecognized maternal SDB is therefore immense. Treatment of SDB in the general population has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes and daytime functioning, and although no large intervention trial has been conducted in pregnant women, small pilot studies demonstrate promising results.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine if there is a difference in the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and sleepiness between pregnant and non-pregnant women. It also aimed to evaluate if obstetric outcomes were associated to sleep-disordered breathing among the pregnant women. Methods: One hundred pregnant women (gestational weeks 24–34) and 80 age- and body mass index-matched non-pregnant women underwent whole-night respiratory recordings (airflow, snoring, respiratory movements, body position, pulse oximetry). The women also answered a questionnaire including the Epworth sleepiness scale. Results: Eighty-nine percent of the pregnant women had normal body mass index (BMI). Objectively, recorded snoring was more common among the pregnant women (median 9 % of total estimated sleep time) than among the controls (4 % of total sleep time, p = 0.005). Three of the pregnant women had OSA (apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) >5), but in two cases, this was mainly due to central hypopneas. None had AHI >10. Two controls were diagnosed as OSA. Respiratory parameters including snoring showed no impact on obstetric outcomes. Total Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score was higher among pregnant women than among controls (median 9 vs 7, p < 0.001). There was no difference concerning the separate items. There were no significant associations between either subjectively reported or objectively recorded snoring and ESS scores. Conclusion: There was no increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among pregnant women. One reason for this could be that the majority of the women in this study were non-obese. Neither OSA nor snoring was likely an explanation for the increased daytime sleepiness seen in the pregnant women.

N2  - Chronic exposure to light at night, as in shift work, alters biological clocks (chronodisruption), negatively impacting pregnancyoutcomein humans. Actually the interaction of maternalandfetal circadian systems could be a key factor determining a fitting health in adults. We propose that chronic photoperiod shift (CPS) during pregnancy alter maternal circadian rhythms and impair circadian physiology in the adult offspring, increasing health risks. Pregnant rats were exposed to normal photoperiod (12 h light, 12 h dark) or to CPS until 85% of gestation. The effects of gestational CPS were evaluated on the mother and adult offspring. In the mother we measured rhythms of heart rate, body temperature, and activity through gestation and daily rhythms of plasma variables (melatonin, corticosterone, aldosterone, and markers of renal function) at 18 days of gestation. In adult offspring, we measured rhythms of the clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), locomotor activity, body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, plasma variables, glucose tolerance, and corticosterone response to ACTH. CPS altered all maternal circadian rhythms, lengthened gestation, and increased newborn weight. The adult CPS offspring presented normal rhythms of clock gene expression in the SCN, locomotor activity, and body temperature. However, the daily rhythm of plasma melatonin was absent, and corticosterone, aldosterone, renal markers, blood pressure, and heart rate rhythms were altered. Moreover, CPS offspring presented decreased glucose tolerance and an abnormal corticosterone response to ACTH. Altogether these data show that gestational CPS induced long-term effects on the offspring circadian system, wherein a normal SCN coexists with altered endocrine, cardiovascular, and metabolic function.

N2  - Background: An increased risk of stillbirth associated with maternal supine sleep position in late pregnancy has been reported by three studies, with the Auckland Stillbirth Study demonstrating a two-fold increased risk for women who did not go to sleep on their left side. Sleep position is modifiable, so our aim was to survey women's self-reported late pregnancy sleep position and views about changing position, in a multi-ethnic community with a high risk of stillbirth. Method: A random sample of ethnically representative women (n = 377), between 28 and 42 weeks' gestation, were surveyed in South Auckland, New Zealand in 2014. Factors independently associated with non-left side going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Self-reported going-to-sleep position in the last week was left side (30%), right side (22%), supine (3%), either side (39%) and other (6%). A non-left position was more likely to be reported by women of Maori (aOR2.64 95%CI 1.23-5.66) or Pacific (aOR2.91 95% CI 1.46-5.78) ethnicity, and in those who did not sleep on the left-hand side of the bed (aOR3.29 95% CI 2.03-5.32). Most (87%) non-left sleepers reported that they would have little or no difficulty changing to settling to sleep on their left side if this was recommended as being better for their baby. Conclusions: Going-to-sleep position in late pregnancy appeared to be readily modifiable in this multi-ethnic sample, suggesting a public health intervention about optimal pregnancy sleep position is likely to be feasible in similar communities with an increased risk of stillbirth.

N2  - The last few years have witnessed a number of publications linking sleep disordered breathing to adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in various populations. Associations with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and growth restriction have been consistent across many studies. Though the manuscripts reviewed here consist mostly of preliminary data and need further confirmation, the studies have highlighted new directions in the assessment of the impact of sleep disordered breathing and pregnancy, and paved the way for new fields of research in this area.

N2  - Background: JNJ-42847922 (MIN-202) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human orexin-2 receptor (OX2R) (pKi = 8) that is being developed for the treatment of insomnia and major depressive disorder (MDD). Orexins promote arousal (wakefulness) and are hypothesized to play a role in excessive arousal (e.g. hypervigilance, anxiety, somatic tension, agitation and/or excessive rumination), including arousal persisting into the sleep period, which occurs in subsets of patients with mood disorders (Germain et al., 2004; Ho et al., 1996; Nofzinger et al., 2005). The intrinsic antidepressant activity of a selective OX2R antagonist has not yet been explored clinically; however, there is support for a role of OX2R antagonism in modulating depressive-like behaviors in rodent models of chronic stress, hypothesized to be related to normalizing glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity via the paraventricular nucleus (Nollet 2011, 2012, 2013) and/or attenuating orexin-induced increases in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels (Samson 2005). JNJ-42847922 therefore may have benefit in treating depression by attenuating hyperarousal during the sleep period and normalizing HPA axis hyperactivity. Methods: This was a Phase 1b multi-center, double-blind, diphenhydramine-and placebo-controlled study, consisting of a screening examination (day-28 to-1), a parallel group treatment phase of 10 days (women of child-bearing potential [WOCBP]) or 28 days (women not of childbearing potential (WONCBP) and men), and a 2-wk followup period. Subjects with a DSM-IV or 5 diagnosis of MDD, aged 18-64 years old, with a body mass index (BMI) between 18-30 kg/m2, were enrolled. Subjects had a total score of = 30 on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30) at screening and were either currently antidepressant-naive or treated with a maximum of 2 concurrent antidepressants, which were given at an optimal dose and for at least 4 weeks, but not longer than 24 weeks, with a suboptimal response. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive JNJ42847922 20 mg, diphenhydramine 25 mg or placebo at bedtime. Diphenhydramine was included as an experimental control, as it has well-established hypnotic effects, but no known antidepressant activity at the selected dose level. Due to limited reproductive toxicology data at the time of the study, the duration of treatment was limited to 10 consecutive days for WOCBP and 28 days for men and WONCBP. Symptoms of depression, sleep disruption, sleep quality, and rumination were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), IDS-C30, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR16), polysomnography (PSG), subjective sleep measures, and the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS). For the HDRS-17, ICDSC30 and QIDS-SR16, summary statistics were produced excluding the insomnia items from the total score for each measure, to determine change in non-sleep related depression items. Results: A total of 47 subjects (22 WOCBP, 25 men or WONCBP) were randomized (22 subjects to JNJ-42847922, 12 subjects to placebo and 13 subjects to diphenhydramine), all of whom completed the study. Most subjects were not currently treated with an antidepressant (10 of 47 subjects were taking an antidepressant; 9 were treated with an SSRI and one with duloxetine). Mean (SD) baseline depression scale scores were: HDRS-17 total score 19.0 (4.99), IDS-C30 total score 37.2 (6.91) and QIDS-SR16 total score 12.9 (3.43). The mean (SD) changes from baseline in HDRS-17 total score at Day 11 were: JNJ-42847922 (-5.5 [3.86]), placebo (-3.6 [4.03]), and diphenhydramine (-4.1 [3.66]). On Day 28 (N = 24), the corresponding changes were: JNJ-42847922 (-9.9 [5.98]), placebo (-5.0 [5.37]) and diphenhydramine (-6.6 [5.62]). There was a greater reduction (p<0.05) in mean (SD) change from baseline in the adjusted HDRS-17 score (sleep items removed) at Day 11 (N = 47) in the JNJ-42847922 group (-4.5 [2.76]) compared with the placebo (-2.3 [3.03]) and the diphenhydramine (-2.3 [2.81]) groups. Scores on the HAM-D6, a subscale of the HDRS-17, lend support for an effect of JNJ-42847922 on the core symptoms of depression: mean (SD) change from baseline at Day 11 was significantly greater (p<0.01) in the JNJ-42847922 group (-3.8 [2.22]) than in the placebo (-1.5 [2.15]) and diphenhydramine groups (-1.8 [(2.01]). JNJ-42847922-induced antidepressant efficacy was comparable in subjects who did, versus those who did not, receive concomitant antidepressant therapies. Notably, the antidepressant effect did not correlate with changes in PSGmeasures such as latency to persistent sleep or total sleep time, supporting an antidepressant effect independent of the compound's effect on sleep. Treatment with 20 mg JNJ-42847922 daily up to 28 days was well-tolerated. Conclusions: Overall, larger improvements in clinician-rated depression symptoms were observed for subjects treated with JNJ-42847922 compared with placebo and the experimental control, diphenhydramine. Efficacy of JNJ-42847922 in treating the symptoms of depression was manifest when sleep items were removed from the HDRS-17 and also on the HAM-D6 core depressive symptom subscale, suggesting that OX2R antagonism may have utility in the treatment of depression independent of effects on PSG-measured sleep parameters.

N2  - Background Few studies have looked at the relationship between psychological and the mental health status of pregnant women in rural China. The current study aims to explore the potential mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts between negative life events and antenatal depression. Methods Data were collected in June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, negative automatic thoughts were measured by the automatic thoughts questionnaire, and negative life events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect. Results The prevalence of antenatal depression was 13.7%. In the logistic regression, the only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the eventual direct and general effects of negative automatic thoughts were 0.39 and 0.51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events.Conclusions This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts. Pregnant women who had lower scores of negative automatic thoughts were more likely to suffer less from negative life events which might lead to antenatal depression.

N2  - Background: Prenatal maternal infection is associated with increased risk in the offspring for a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia, autism, and ADHD. Impaired cerebral inhibition is associated with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses and has been proposed as a mechanistic contributor. Prenatal infection predicting postnatal cerebral inhibition deficits would be consistent with this model, yet has never been assessed. In both animal and human models, prenatal stimulation of the alpha7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor with dietary choline supplementation leads to improved development of sensory gating, improved memory, and decreased anxiety; however, whether that relationship extends to non-supplemented women and their children has not been assessed. Using P50 sensory gating as a measure of infant cerebral inhibition, this report examines whether maternal prenatal infection and/or maternal serum choline levels predict infant cerebral inhibition, and whether there is an interaction between these two factors. Methods: 155 initially healthy pregnant women were surveyed at 16 and 28 weeks gestation as to whether they had experienced moderate-to-severe symptoms consistent with any infection in the previous six weeks. Serum was drawn for choline levels at the same gestational time points. P50 sensory gating was assessed during active sleep in the resultant infants at a mean adjusted age of (SD) 28 (10) days. Results: At 16, but not 28 weeks gestation, women who report moderate-to-severe symptoms of any infection (n = 61) birth infants with more impaired P50 sensory gating (t = 2.285, p =.024, standardized s =.187 and t = 0.374, p =.709, standardized s =.030 respectively). At 16, but not 28 weeks gestation, lower maternal serum choline levels are associated with more impaired infant P50 sensory gating (t = 2.068, p =.040, standardized s =.167 and t = 1.169, p =.244, standardized s =.094 respectively). At 16 weeks gestation, there is an interaction between maternal reported infection and serum choline (t = 2.921, p =.004, standardized s =.343): in mothers who report infection, maternal serum choline is inversely correlated with infant sensory gating ratio (Pearson r =-.405, p =.001); no similar correlation is identified for women who did not report such an infection (Pearson r =-.003, p =.975). Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to maternal infection in the late first trimester/early second trimester period has previously been associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. These results support a similar relationship between infection and development of cerebral inhibition raising the possibility that cerebral inhibition is a mediator between prenatal infection and later onset of psychiatric illness. Higher maternal serum choline, which impacts cerebral inhibition development via stimulation of the alpha7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor, compensates for maternal infection. Prenatal choline supplementation remains a potential primary prevention strategy.

N2  - Background: Increasing evidence suggests a role for inflammatory processes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An immunological subtype of ASD may exist, considering that a subset of individuals with ASD show elevated inflammatory markers and neuroimmune responses, as well as epidemiological associations with familial autoimmune disorders. Previous research in mice has shown that immune activation during critical developmental periods can result in a phenotype that reproduces some of the core features of ASD. We have recently explored a “multiple hit” immune model, whereby mice are exposed to repeated perinatal immune activation. Methods: In the multiple hit model, pregnant mice are injected with the viral mimic poly(I:C) (polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid) (20 mg/kg) on gestational day 12.5 in accordance with an established model of maternal immune activation. A subset of these offspring receives a second injection of LPS (lipopolysaccharide) (10 mg/kg) to induce a robust innate immune response on postnatal day 9. Preliminary data from our group shows that these regimens induce a state of ongoing immune activation in the brain that persists into adulthood, evidenced by a heightened level of multiple inflammatory markers. Here, we examined this two-hit model on behaviors related to three key domains of ASD: social, communication, and repetitive behavior. Additionally, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess two physiological measures that are commonly dysregulated in individuals with ASD: sleep and epileptiform activity. As part of a remote telemetry system, a batterypowered multi-lead transmitter was implanted subcutaneously at postnatal week 6, enabling constant measurement of EEG, electromyography (EMG), generalized motor activity, and body temperature for a period of several weeks. Results: We found that both prenatal and postnatal immune activation produce a complex behavioral phenotype that resembles ASD in multiple domains, and these effects were sex-dependent, as male mice were more affected in a number of measures. Overall, however, postnatal LPS treatment resulted in a more pronounced behavioral phenotype, and the effects of combined treatment were not greater than those of LPS alone. In the remote telemetry study, postnatal LPS resulted in several alterations in activity and sleep, qualitatively similar to the hyperactivity and sleep disturbances frequently observed in ASD. Considering that epilepsy is found in a higher percentage of individuals with ASD than in the general population, and there is evidence for increased epileptiform activity even in the absence of epilepsy, we examined EEG recordings from perinatal immune activated mice for the presence of epileptiform activity. This analysis revealed that a subset of the mice that received postnatal LPS displayed heightened levels of epileptiform activity, including the presence of spike-wave discharges, which were not seen in controls. Conclusions: In summary, perinatal immune activation resulted in a sex-dependent behavioral phenotype that was accompanied by alterations in sleep and epileptiform activity that resemble key features of ASD, further supporting a potential immunological involvement in this condition.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of 100 mg/d regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy on high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We consecutively selected 98 cases high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients. After obtaining the informed consent of the patients, we randomly divided the patients into aspirin group (50 cases) and placebo group (48 cases). The oral intake of aspirin lasted from the final diagnosis of pregnancy to antepartum time, and was taken before sleep. The bleeding index was closely detected and we stop taking aspirin when necessary.
RESULTS: The comparison of clinical outcome showed that the incidents of pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia of aspirin group were significantly lower than that of the placebo group (p<0.05). Comparing the complications of fetus perinatal period, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: 100 mg/d regular oral intake of aspirin during pregnancy is safe, effective and worthy of generalization to high-risk pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome patients.

N2  - Recent studies have shown associations between maternal obesity at pre- or early pregnancy and long-term neurodevelopment in children, suggesting in utero effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain development. In this study, we examined whether brain functional connectivity to the prefrontal lobe network is different in newborns from normal-weight or obese mothers. Thirty-four full-term healthy infants from uncomplicated pregnancies were included, with 18 born to normal-weight and 16 born to obese mothers. Two weeks after delivery, the infants underwent an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination during natural sleep, which included structural imaging and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scans. Independent component analysis was used to identify the prefrontal lobe network, and dual regression was used to compare functional connectivity between groups. Infants born to normal-weight mothers had higher recruiting (P<0.05, corrected) of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex regions to the prefrontal network after adjusting for maternal intelligence quotient, gestational weight gain and infant postmenstrual age, gender, birth weight/length, head circumference and neonatal diet. The functional connectivity strength in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex negatively correlated (P<0.05) with maternal fat mass percentage measured at early pregnancy. This preliminary study indicates that exposure to maternal obesity in utero may be associated with changes in resting-state functional connectivity in the newborn offspring's brain.

N2  - Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are the mainstay treatment for the 10-20% of pregnant and postpartum women who suffer major depression, which, in turn, exposes tens of thousands of children annually to serotonergic agents during crucial developmental periods. SSRIs are generally considered safe, with minimal risk for pregnancy complications or teratogenic risk, although accumulating evidence suggests that in utero antidepressant exposure perturbs neurodevelopment and may elicit detrimental effects on offspring's' neuropsychological health. These findings in humans are consistent with data in rodents showing that manipulating serotonin in the developing brain negatively impacts lifelong emotional behavior. For example, neonatal SSRI exposure produces disturbances within multiple behavioral domains that are typically associated with mood disorders, including increased helplessness in the Forced Swim Test (FST), enhanced anxiety-like behavior, anhedonia, perturbed sleep, and diminished sexual performance. Perinatal SSRI exposure also leads to abnormal sensory perception and sociability, suggesting that perturbing early-life serotonin transmission is relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism. Interestingly, both human and rodent studies suggest that certain individuals are more vulnerable to perinatal SSRI exposure than others, but the mechanisms driving this differential susceptibility are unknown, representing a critical barrier in the field. Our research group recently showed that Sprague-Dawley rats selectively bred for high versus low novelty seeking traits exhibit differential susceptibility to perinatal SSRI exposure, with low novelty responding (LR) rats displaying increased FST immobility in response to early life SSRI exposure while high novelty responder (HR) rats were unaffected (Glover et al, Neuroscience 2015). We also conducted a transcriptome profiling study showing marked SSRI-induced gene expression changes in the early postnatal hippocampus, including decreased expression of DNA methylation-related genes Dnmt3a and Mecp2. Our new experiments are testing the working hypothesis that the adverse behavioral consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure are mediated by perturbed DNA methylation in the early postnatal hippocampus. Methods: We hypothesize that perinatal SSRI exposure downregulates DNA methylation in the early postnatal hippocampus and that this may provide a molecular switch that triggers adverse downstream effects on neurodevelopment and emotional behavior. To test this, the present study examined global DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine) levels in brains of neonatal rats that were perinatally exposed to the SSRI paroxetine. Because we previously showed that LR rats are susceptible to behavioral effects of perinatal SSRI exposure while HRs are resistant, we predicted and indeed found that SSRI exposure selectively affected DNA methylation in brains of LR offspring. Using next-generation sequencing, we interrogated gene-specific methylation changes in the hippocampus of perinatal SSRI-exposed LR offspring. Our final experiment tested the hypothesis that siRNA-mediated suppression of Dnmt3a expression in the hippocampus of early postnatal rats would elicit adverse behavioral consequences (e.g., enhanced FST immobility) akin to what occurs following perinatal SSRI exposure. Results: Perinatal SSRI exposure led to decreased hippocampal DNA methylation levels specifically in LR offspring relative to vehicle-exposed LR controls; notably no changes were observed in other limbic brain regions. HR offspring were not affected by SSRI exposure, with both SSRI-and vehicle-exposed HR groups showing similar DNA methylation levels. Next generation sequencing analyses identified numerous gene-specific methylation differences in the hippocampus of perinatal SSRI-exposed rats, with a preponderance of hypomethylated genomic regions in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus subregions. Results of our siRNA study showed that transient knock-down of Dnmt3a in the early postnatal hippocampus lead to greater depression-like behavior (FST immobility) in adult offspring with no effect on anxiety-like behavior. These results were highly reminiscent of the behavioral consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure. Conclusions: This study found that perinatal SSRI exposure induced DNA methylation changes in the early postnatal hippocampus, which may drive adverse behavioral consequences such as increased adult depression-like behavior. These SSRI-induced methylation changes were associated with reduced neonatal hippocampal expression of the DNA methylating enzyme, Dnmt3a, and we found that siRNAmediated Dnmt3a knockdown in the neonatal hippocampus recapitulated the behavioral effects of early-life SSRI exposure in both male and female rats. Our results may have important implications on the use of SSRIs during pregnancy and on the etiology of depression in general, as early-life changes in epigenetic mechanisms disrupt normal hippocampal development, leading to an increased risk for depression in adulthood.

N2  - Objective Acupuncture has become popular and widely practiced in many countries around the world. Despite the large amount of acupuncture-related literature that has been published, broader trends in the prevalence and scope of acupuncture research remain underexplored. The current study quantitatively analyzes trends in acupuncture research publications in the past 20 years. Methods A bibliometric approach was used to search PubMed for all acupuncture-related research articles including clinical and animal studies. Inclusion criteria were articles published between 1995 and 2014 with sufficient information for bibliometric analyses. Rates and patterns of acupuncture publication within the 20 year observational period were estimated, and compared with broader publication rates in biomedicine. Identified eligible publications were further analyzed with respect to study type/design, clinical condition addressed, country of origin, and journal impact factor. Results A total of 13,320 acupuncture-related publications were identified using our search strategy and eligibility criteria. Regression analyses indicated an exponential growth in publications over the past two decades, with a mean annual growth rate of 10.7%. This compares to a mean annual growth rate of 4.5% in biomedicine. A striking trend was an observed increase in the proportion of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), from 7.4% in 1995 to 20.3% in 2014, exceeding the 4.5% proportional growth of RCTs in biomedicine. Over the 20 year period, pain was consistently the most common focus of acupuncture research (37.9% of publications). Other top rankings with respect to medical focus were arthritis, neoplasms/cancer, pregnancy or labor, mood disorders, stroke, nausea/vomiting, sleep, and paralysis/palsy. Acupuncture research was conducted in 60 countries, with the top 3 contributors being China (47.4%), United States (17.5%), and United Kingdom (8.2%). Retrieved articles were published mostly in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) journals with impact factors ranging between 0.7 and 2.8 in the top 20 journals, followed by journals specializing in neuroscience, pain, anesthesia/analgesia, internal medicine and comprehensive fields. Conclusion Acupuncture research has grown markedly in the past two decades, with a 2-fold higher growth rate than for biomedical research overall. Both the increases in the proportion of RCTs and the impact factor of journals support that the quality of published research has improved. While pain was a consistently dominant research focus, other topics gained more attention during this time period. These findings provide a context for analyzing strengths and gaps in the current state of acupuncture research, and for informing a comprehensive strategy for further advancing the field.

N2  - Background: Narcolepsy is a chronic primary sleep disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep dysfunction with or without cataplexy. Narcolepsy is uncommon, with a low prevalence rate which makes it difficult to diagnose definitively without a complex series of tests and a detailed history. The aim of this study was to review patients referred to a tertiary sleep centre who had been labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy prior to referral in order to assess if the diagnosis was accurate, and if not, to determine the cause of diagnostic misattribution. Methods: All patients seen at a sleep centre from 2007–2013 (n = 551) who underwent detailed objective testing including an MSLT PSG, as well as wearing an actigraphy watch and completing a sleep diary for 2 weeks, were assessed for a pre-referral and final diagnosis of narcolepsy. Results: Of the 41 directly referred patients with a diagnostic label of narcolepsy, 19 (46 %) were subsequently confirmed to have narcolepsy on objective testing and assessment by a sleep physician using ICSD-2 criteria. Conclusions: The diagnosis of narcolepsy was incorrectly attributed to almost 50 % of patients labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy who were referred for further opinion by a variety of specialists and generalists. Accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy is critical for many reasons, such as the impact it has on quality of life, driving, employment, insurance and pregnancy in women as well as medication management.

N2  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis–Ekbom disease, is a common sleep-related neurological disorder, with prevalence rates estimated to be between 1 and 10 %, increasing with age. RLS is characterized by an imperative desire to move the extremities, paraesthesia, worsening of symptoms at rest, improvement by motor activity, and worsening in the evening or at night. Sleep disorders are thus a frequent complaint. A positive family history is often reported for the primary form. Important comorbidities or triggers include iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, polyneuropathy, and drug-induced RLS. In cases of unknown etiology, genetic vulnerability, dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission, and alteration of central iron metabolism appear to be important pathophysiological factors. In addition to non-drug-based treatment strategies, dopaminergic, opioidergic, and anticonvulsant drugs are often effective. In the case of secondary or comorbid RLS, treatment of the underlying disease is necessary.

N2  - Background: New technology provides health professionals opportunities to enhance health delivery to patients and their families. Challenges are faced when providing services to families living in regional and remote areas given the geographic variation within our population. ZOOM technology is a video conferencing facility that is freely available and accessible, meeting HIPPA criteria in the USA. Method: We present a case using ZOOM technology to a regional family from the NICU outreach nurse perspective, post discharge from a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. The literature around the use of technology to provide this service is reviewed, and potential future advances are discussed. Results: TA was a 27week gestation infant born at 1.365 kg. He had an expected neonatal stay and was discharged home at 35 weeks gestation. His home was 222km from the tertiary unit he was discharged from. Outreach nursing home visits were not possible given the geographic distance, and ZOOM video conferencing was initiated. Support included feeding issues, maternal health, safe sleep, immunizations and ensuring access to other services. Physical assessments were not undertaken as part of this process (and if the need had occurred referral to primary health carers would have been made). Conclusions: Video conferencing with ZOOM is easily accessible, cost effective and acceptable to the families used to date. While it is less effective than a personal home visit, it provides a more interactive experience than a telephone call. Future research needs to explore parental and nursing staff experiences of this technology prospectively.

N2  - Circadian clocks influence virtually all physiological processes, including lactation. Here, we investigate the role of the CLOCK gene in regulation of mammary epithelial cell growth and differentiation. Comparison of mammary morphology in late-pregnant wild-type and ClockΔ19 mice, showed that gland development was negatively impacted by genetic loss of a functional timing system. To understand whether these effects were due, in part, to loss of CLOCK function in the gland, the mouse mammary epithelial cell line, HC11, was transfected with short hairpin RNA that targeted Clock (shClock). Cells transfected with shClock expressed 70% less Clock mRNA than wild-type (WT) HC11 cultures, which resulted in significantly depressed levels of CLOCK protein (P < 0.05). HC11 lines carrying shClock had four-fold higher growth rates (P < 0.05), and the percentage of cells in G1 phase was significantly higher (90.1 ± 1.1% of shClock vs. 71.3 ± 3.6% of WT-HC11) following serum starvation. Quantitative-PCR (qPCR) analysis showed shClock had significant effects (P < 0.0001) on relative expression levels of Ccnd1, Wee1, and Tp63. qPCR analysis of the effect of shClock on Fasn and Cdh1 expression in undifferentiated cultures and cultures treated 96 h with dexamethasone, insulin, and prolactin (differentiated) found levels were reduced by twofold and threefold, respectively (P < 0.05), in shClock line relative to WT cultures. Abundance of CDH1 and TP63 proteins were significantly reduced in cultures transfected with shClock. These data support how CLOCK plays a role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and differentiation in the mammary gland.

N2  - Acknowledgments: The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) has grant support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), DHHS, through the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) and the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) (Grants U01NR004061, U01AG012505, U01AG012535, U01AG012531, U01AG012539, U01AG012546, U01AG012553, U01AG 012554, U01AG012495). The content of this presentation is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the NIA, NINR, ORWH, or the NIH. The prevalences or vasomotor symptoms (VMS, hot flashes and night sweats), sleep difficulties and vaginal dryness increase in women during the menopause transition (MT), while the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) tends to decline through the MT. Based on results from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) and other longitudinal data, VMS affect 50-80% of women in the MT; urinary incontinence (UI) affects about half; sleep disturbances are reported by 15-40% and vaginal dryness by 20-30% of midlife women. SWAN is a community-based, longitudinal cohort study of women who at baseline were aged 42-52 years, had an intact uterus and at least one ovary, had no current exogenous hormone use, and were not pregnant or lactating. SWAN has a 75% follow-up rate after about 13 years. VMS affect quality of life, result in increased outpatient visits, cost hundreds of millions of dollars for health care and have been associated with cardiovascular risk factors and lower bone density. The prevalence of VMS increases in early perimenopause, peaking in late perimenopause, and is higher in African American and lower in Asian than in white women. In SWAN, the median duration of VMS is 7.5 years, 10 years in women who first reported VMS in early perimenopause, but 4-5.5 years in women who first reported VMS in late perimenopause or postmenopause, and was negatively associated with age at first report of VMS, having a college education, and having greater symptom sensitivity and stress scores. Duration of VMS was longest, 9-10 years, in Hispanics and African Americans but 5-6 years in Asians. In addition to menopause status, higher body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for VMS in pre- and early perimenopause, but negatively related in late peri- and postmenopause (p>0.0001 for interaction with menopause status for any VMS). Thus, change in weight might have preventive implications, but in SWAN, change in weight was not associated with VMS in pre- and early perimenopause and had an inverse U-shape in late peri- and postmenopause (though interaction with menopause status was only significant, p=0.004, for frequent VMS), which did not improve prediction of incident VMS beyond that of concurrent BMI. Smoking and prior increased anxiety scores also were significantly associated with increased reporting of VMS and have preventive implications. The incidence of UI tends to decline with progression to postmenopause. Type of UI reported differed somewhat by race/ethnicity: urge UI was reported by more African American and fewer Asian and Hispanic than white women but was more likely to become more frequent in Hispanic than white women and was not associated with menopause status in SWAN. The prevalences of sleep difficulties and vaginal dryness tend to increase with progression through the MT and have been associated with declines in estrogen levels. In summary: VMS, sleep difficulties and vaginal dryness tend to increase with progression through the MT, but UI may decline over this time. The duration of VMS is longer than previously reported with a median of 7.5 years but varies by menopause status and age at the onset of VMS. The prevalence of most of these symptoms differs by race/ethnicity with VMS and urge UI being more prevalent in African American and less prevalent in Asian women, adjusting for socioeconomic and other risk factors; and increased BMI tends to be related to many of these symptoms. These differences in prevalence, duration and risk factors are important for assessing women clinically and for advising them about potential methods for reducing symptoms, eg, maintenance of a healthy weight, and about the anticipated duration and likely natural course of some symptoms over the MT.

N2  - Key points: Nitric oxide is essential in the vascular adaptation to pregnancy, as knockout mice lacking nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) have abnormal utero-placental perfusion, hypertension and growth restriction. We previously showed with ex vivo studies on transgenic animals lacking NOS3 that adverse intrauterine environment alters fetal programming of vascular reactivity in adult offspring. The current research shows that altered vascular reactivity correlates with higher blood pressure in vivo. Our data suggest that higher blood pressure depends on both genetic background (NOS3 deficiency) and uterine environment, becomes more evident with age (> 7 postnatal weeks), activity and stress, is gender specific (preponderant among males), and can be affected by the sleep–awake cycle. In utero or early postnatal life (< 7 weeks), before onset of hypertension, may represent a potential window for intervention to prevent future cardiovascular disorders. Abstract: Nitric oxide is involved in the vascular adaptation to pregnancy. Using transgenic animals, we previously showed that adverse intrauterine environment alters vascular reactivity in adult offspring. The aim of our study was to determine if altered vascular programming is associated with abnormal blood pressure (BP) profiles in vivo. Mice lacking a functional endothelial nitric oxide synthase (KO, NOS3−/−) and wild-type mice (WT, NOS3+/+) were crossbred to generate homozygous NOS3−/− (KO), maternally derived heterozygous NOS3+/− (KOM: mother with adverse intrauterine environment from NOS3 deficiency), paternally derived heterozygous NOS3+/− (KOP: mother with normal in utero milieu) and NOS3+/+ (WT) litters. BP was measured in vivo at 7, 14 and 21 weeks of age. After univariate analysis, multivariate population-averaged linear regression models were used to identify factors affecting BP. When compared to WT offspring, systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean (MAP) BP progressively increased from KOP, to KOM, and peaked among KO (P < 0.001), although significance was not reached for KOP. Higher BP was also associated with male gender, older age (> 7 postnatal weeks), higher locomotor activity, daytime recordings, and recent blood pressure transducer insertion (P < 0.001). Post hoc analysis showed that KOM had higher SBP than KOP (P < 0.05). Our study indicates that adverse intrauterine environment contributes, along with multiple other factors, to account for hypertension; moreover, in utero or early postnatal life may represent a possible therapeutic window for prevention of cardiovascular disease later in life.

N2  - Background: Depression during pregnancy is a common and high impact disease. Generally, 5-10 % of pregnant women suffer from depression. Children who have been exposed to maternal depression during pregnancy have a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes and more often show cognitive, emotional and behavioural problems. Therefore, early detection and treatment of antepartum depression is necessary. Both psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, first choice treatments in a non-pregnant population, have limitations in treating depression during pregnancy. Therefore, it is urgent and relevant to investigate alternative treatments for antepartum depression. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a promising treatment for pregnant women with depressive disorder, for it combines direct availability, sufficient efficacy, low costs and high safety, taking the safety for the unborn child into account as well. Methods: In this study, 150 pregnant women (12-18 weeks pregnant) with a DSM-V diagnosis of depressive disorder will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms: treatment with BLT (9.000 lux) or treatment with dim red light therapy (100 lux). Both groups will be treated for 6 weeks at home on a daily basis for 30 min, within 30 min of habitual wake-up time. Follow-up will take place after 6 weeks of therapy, 3 and 10 weeks after end of therapy, at birth and 2, 6 and 18 months postpartum. Primary outcome will be the average change in depressive symptoms between the two groups, as measured by the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale - Seasonal Affective Disorder version and the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale. Changes in rating scale scores of these questionnaires over time will be analysed using generalized linear mixed models. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in maternal cortisol and melatonin levels, in maternal sleep quality and gestational age, birth weight, infant behaviour, infant cortisol exposure and infant cortisol stress response. Discussion: If BLT reduces depressive symptoms in pregnant women, it will provide a safe, cheap, non-pharmacological and efficacious alternative treatment for psychotherapy and antidepressant medication in treating antepartum depression, without any expected adverse reactions for the unborn child.

N2  - Background: Approximately 25 % of pregnant women suffer from a high level of Fear of Childbirth (FoC), as assessed by the Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire (W-DEQ-A, score ≥66). FoC negatively affects pregnant women's mental health and adaptation to the perinatal period. Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting (MBCP) seems to be potentially effective in decreasing pregnancy-related anxiety and stress. We propose a theoretical model of Avoidance and Participation in Pregnancy, Birth and the Postpartum Period in order to explore FoC and to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of change of MBCP. Methods/Design: The 'I've Changed My Mind' study is a quasi-experimental controlled trial among 128 pregnant women (week 16-26) with a high level of FoC, and their partners. Women will be allocated to MBCP (intervention group) or to Fear of Childbirth Consultation (FoCC; comparison group). Primary outcomes are FoC, labour pain, and willingness to accept obstetrical interventions. Secondary outcomes are anxiety, depression, general stress, parental stress, quality of life, sleep quality, fatigue, satisfaction with childbirth, birth outcome, breastfeeding self-efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The total study duration for women is six months with four assessment waves: pre- and post-intervention, following the birth and closing the maternity leave period. Discussion: Given the high prevalence and severe negative impact of FoC this study can be of major importance if statistically and clinically meaningful benefits are found. Among the strengths of this study are the clinical-based experimental design, the extensive cognitive-emotional and behavioural measurements in pregnant women and their partners during the entire perinatal period, and the representativeness of study sample as well as generalizability of the study's results. The complex and innovative measurements of FoC in this study are an important strength in clinical research on FoC not only in pregnant women but also in their partners. Trial registration: Dutch Trial Register (NTR): NTR4302, registration date the 3rd of December 2013.

N2  - Background: Perinatal depression (PND) has an overall estimated prevalence of roughly 12 %. Untreated PND has significant negative consequences not only on the health of the mothers, but also on the physical, emotional and cognitive development of their children. No certain risk factors are known to predict PND and no completely safe drug treatments are available during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sleep and depression are strongly related to each other because of a solid reciprocal causal relationship. Bright light therapy (BLT) is a well-tested and safe treatment, effective in both depression and circadian/sleep disorders. Methods: In a 3-year longitudinal, observational, multicentre study, about 500 women will be recruited and followed-up from early pregnancy (10-15 gestational week) until 12 months after delivery. The primary aim of the present study is to systematically explore and characterize risk factors for PND by prospective sleep assessment (using wrist actigraphy, polysomnography and various sleep questionnaires) and bloodbased analysis of potential markers during the perinatal period (Life-ON study). Secondary aims are to explore the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudy Life-ON1), to investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treating PND (substudy Life-ON2) and to test whether a short term trial of BLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy Life-ON3). Discussion: The characterization of specific predictive and risk factors for PND may substantially contribute to improve preventive medical and social strategies for the affected women. The study results are expected to promote a better understanding of the relationship between sleep disorders and the development of PND and to confirm, in a large sample of women, the safety and efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND.

N2  - Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare, severe, chronic, life-threatening disease with multiorgan involvement that requires optimal multidisciplinary care to normalize both prognosis and quality of life. In this article, each key team member of all the medical disciplines of a multidisciplinary health care team at the Hamburg Marfan center gives a personal account of his or her contribution in the management of patients with MFS. The authors show how, with the support of health care managers, key team members organize themselves in an organizational structure to create a common meaning, to maximize therapeutic success for patients with MFS. First, we show how the initiative and collaboration of patient representatives, scientists, and physicians resulted in the foundation of Marfan centers, initially in the US and later in Germany, and how and why such centers evolved over time. Then, we elucidate the three main structural elements; a team of coordinators, core disciplines, and auxiliary disciplines of health care. Moreover, we explain how a multidisciplinary health care team integrates into many other health care structures of a university medical center, including external quality assurance; quality management system; clinical risk management; center for rare diseases; aorta center; health care teams for pregnancy, for neonates, and for rehabilitation; and in structures for patient centeredness. We provide accounts of medical goals and standards for each core discipline, including pediatricians, pediatric cardiologists, cardiologists, human geneticists, heart surgeons, vascular surgeons, vascular interventionists, orthopedic surgeons, ophthalmologists, and nurses; and of auxiliary disciplines including forensic pathologists, radiologists, rhythmologists, pulmonologists, sleep specialists, orthodontists, dentists, neurologists, obstetric surgeons, psychiatrist/psychologist, and rehabilitation specialists. We conclude that a multidisciplinary health care team is a means to maximize therapeutic success.

N2  - RESULTS: The numbers of subjects in sleep deficiency group,sleep sufficiency group and sleep excessive group were 16 (2.95%),268 (49.45%) and 258 (47.60%),respectively.The incidences of GDM for sleep deficiency group,sleep sufficient group,and sleep excessive group were 62.50%(10/16),25.75%(69/268) and 22.09% (57/258),respectively,the difference was statistically significant (χ2=11.280,P<0.05).Compared with either sleep sufficiency or sleep excessive group,sleep deficiency group had higher GDM occurrence rate with statistically significant (χ2=8.410,11.218,P<0.017).Insomnia subjects in early pregnancy were 137 (25.28%).The incidences of GDM in insomnia group and normal group were 32.12% and 22.72% respectively,the difference was statistically significant (χ2=4.813, P<0.05).After adjusting the confounding factors [age,education,pre-pregnant body mass index (BMI),gained body mass in early and medium pregnancy,family history of type-2 diabetes,gravidity,parity,smoke,drink,exercise and occupation],non-conditional logistic regression results show that sleep deficiency for early pregnant women was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of GDM [odds ratio (OR)=7.38,95% confidence interval (CI): 2.25-24.17].However,the association between insomnia and the occurrence of GDM was not found.
CONCLUSIONS: Sleep deficiency in early pregnancy may be a risk factor for the occurrence of GDM.
METHODS: In this prospective study,542 pregnant women in early pregnancy were selected as subjects.The sleep time,insomnia,pre-gestational body mass and basic information of the subjects were collected by the trained investigators through questionnaire.At the 24th to 28th pregnant week,the body mass of each subject was measured and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted.The diagnosis of GDM was followed the guidelines of diagnose and treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus in China (2014).A non-conditional logistic regression method was adopted to analyze the correlation between sleep status of early pregnant women and the occurrence of GDM.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of sleep status in early pregnant women on the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

N2  - The term fetal behavior includes fetal sleep states, which in precocial mammalian species (i.e., those born relatively mature at birth) develop in late gestation, along with the fetal physiological processes, such as fetal body movements and breathing activity, cardiovascular function, blood gas, and acid-base status, which are linked to fetal sleep states. Since ~1970, as a result of technological and technical advances, there has been significant advances in our understanding of fetal behavior in man and animals, and also the development of fetal monitoring techniques in human pregnancy that are based on the changes in fetal behavioral variables that are altered in pathophysiological complications of pregnancy. In species such as sheep, guinea pigs, and primates, including the human, fetal sleep states, comprised primarily of quiet sleep and REM sleep, develop in the second half of gestation. Fetal motility in the form of body and breathing movements develop earlier in gestation, but when fetal sleep states develop they become linked to these states. In all species, fetal breathing is episodic occurring about 40 % of the time. In the fetal lamb, fetal breathing activity occurs only in REM sleep, whereas in primates, breathing occurs in both sleep states although the character of the breathing movements changes with sleep state. Fetal body movements occur in both sleep states, but vigorous body movements occur mainly during brief periods of a more aroused state, in which vigorous breathing and fetal swallowing also occur. However this aroused state is unlikely to represent wakefulness. Although they do not fulfil the functions that they will after birth, fetal breathing and body movements are important for the development of the lung and musculoskeletal system, respectively. Uterine activity, in the form of pre-labor contractions, which appear to occur in all species, can also affect fetal behavioral activity, particularly in species, like sheep, where the contractions are quiet long (5 min). There are also circadian rhythms in breathing and body movements, and various other fetal variables, with a higher incidence breathing and motility at night. Evidence from sheep indicates that the fetal circadian rhythms are derived from the maternal melatonin rhythm via maternal to fetal transfer of maternal melatonin. Fetal movements are associated with transient changes in fetal heart rate, usually accelerations, and this response forms the basis of the non-stress test and is an element of the fetal biophysical profile score, which are commonly used diagnostic methods to assess fetal well-being in human pregnancies. The transient accelerations in fetal heart rate increase cardiac output and umbilical blood flow. In contrast to the situation after birth, fetal vascular oxygenation fluctuates consistently with transient decreases due to episodic fetal breathing and body movements and uterine contractions. In sheep, increasing the frequency of these uterine contractions above the normal rate, via pulsatile maternal intravenous oxytocin administration, has maturational effects on neural and cardiovascular functions. Overall the data indicate that in late gestation, the healthy fetus exhibits an organized constellation of cyclic activities, including motility, breathing activity, ingestion, and cardiorespiratory function, all of which are linked to the regular alterations in behavioral states. In all species studied, there is a progressive decrease in fetal motility with advancing gestation and there are also reductions in fetal motility with fetal metabolic compromise. More studies are required in the human and other species to more precisely define the changes in fetal behavioral and related variables with advancing gestation and with deteriorations in fetal metabolic status.

N2  - This overview shows how the physical and, in particular, hormonal changes during pregnancy affect breathing and sleep and how and when breathing and sleep develop in the fetus. Pregnancy has a significant influence on respiratory regulation and respiratory mechanics as well as on sleep regulation. Due to its increased size, the uterus restricts the maximum voluntary ventilation; the pregnancy hormone progesterone, on the other hand, causes compensatory bronchodilatation and marked hyperventilation with arterial PCO2 values of the pregnant women below 30 mmHg. Sleep quality decreases during pregnancy, especially due to increasing hormone levels of progesterone, a general metabolism, nocturia, fetal movements, and the promotion of sleep-related breathing disorders. In the embryo, the lung develops as early as the 4th week and matures through a pseudoglandular, canalicular, sacular to the alveolar stage. From pregnancy week 29 -30 type 2 alveocytes begin to produce surfactant. From the middle of the second trimester fetal respiratory movements are detectable. They cause the essential stimulus for adequate lung growth, are dependent on the resting/ activity rhythm of the fetus and respond to increased carbon dioxide partial pressure, while they are inhibited by hypoxia. The fetal internal clock develops in the last trimester, and is controlled by "zeitgeber" of the mother, e.g., by the melatonin level. In the last 10 weeks of pregnancy, phases of quiet (NREM) and active (REM) sleep can be differentiated. Pregnancy and intrauterine development are accompanied by considerable changes in breathing and sleep in mother and child, which can be the starting points of pathophysiological developments.

N2  - Sleep problems are one of the most important issues of public health. Poor sleep quality in this period of pregnancy common problem that can have harmful effects on the health of the fetus and the mother. This study aimed to determine the sleep quality and its predictive factors in nulliparous pregnant women was conducted in Hamadan city, Iran. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on 309 pregnant women, which were admitted to health centers in Hamadan city, Iran, 2016. They were allocated into case group (undesirable Sleep Quality, PSQI score of > 5, n=165) and the control group (desirable Sleep Quality, PSQI score of ≤5, n=144). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Data obtained using demographic, obstetric and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which were collected by census method. Analyzing the data was performed by SPSS/20, using Pearson correlation test, t-test, chi-square and multiple linear regression were analyzed. P-value < 0.05 was regarded as significant. The results showed that 165 patients (53.4 percent) of the participants had poor sleep quality. Two groups in terms of age, jab, body mass index, pre-pregnancy surveillance, spouse's job, monthly income and regular prenatal care showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). Between quality of sleep and gestational age, maternal education and the consent of the wife and husband's education were significant negative correlation (P < 0.05). Considering the high prevalence of sleep disorders and the importance of this issue in the mental health of pregnant women should be given to improve the quality of sleep.

N2  - The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) affects 27.5% of all pregnant women in the third trimester and shows an association with pre-eclampsia. In a systematic Medline research, up to July 2016, 198 publications treated this topic. In many of these studies the connections between pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome have been confirmed. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of OSA on pregnancy and to initiate appropriate treatments.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based cognitive-behavioral training program for sleep during late pregnancy. METHODS: A nonrandomized quasiexperimental sample of nulliparous women who received the intervention during pregnancy (n25) was compared with two control groups (n76 and n48) from other intervention studies at similar postintervention time points: approximately 1 month before childbirth and 1-2 months after childbirth. The home-based Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy consisted of 4 weeks of sound-enhanced audio relaxation programs, readings, and daily sleep diaries. Both control groups received dietary recommendations for improving sleep. Sleep duration (total sleep time) and sleep disruption (wake after sleep onset) were measured using wrist actigraphy for a minimum of 48 hours on consecutive weekdays. RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly longer sleep duration and less sleep disruption than both control groups, particularly at the postpartum assessment. Intervention participants slept an average of 430 (95% confidence interval [CI] 397-464) minutes during pregnancy compared with 420 (95% CI 403-438) and 417 (95% CI 395-439) minutes for the two control groups. At the postpartum assessment, the intervention group slept 446 (95% CI 415-478) minutes compared with 390 (95% CI 373-408) and 370 (95% CI 348-393) minutes for those in the control groups. In terms of sleep disruption, women in the intervention group had 16.1% (95% CI 11.9-20.2%) wake after sleep onset during pregnancy, whereas women in the control groups had 13.4% (95% CI 11.2-15.5%) and 20.4% (95% CI 17.7-23.0%). Postpartum, the intervention group had 20.3% (95% CI 16.4-24.1%) wake after sleep onset compared with 26.6% (95% CI 24.5-28.8%) and 28.7% (95% CI 26.0-31.5%) among women in the control groups. Participant feedback about the intervention was generally positive, although intervention adherence was variable. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of the Sleep Enhancement Training System for Pregnancy intervention for enhancing sleep that typically worsens during late pregnancy and after childbirth.

N2  - Sleep related disorders of breathing (SDB) in terms of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are common in postmenopausal women. But also in the premenopausal period OSA has a frequency of more than 2%. Some physiological changes during pregnancy may support the appearance of obstructive SDB. But younger women with sleep apnea very often do not suffer from typical symptoms of SDB. Therefore screening questionnaires for SDB are not very suitable for the detection of sleep apnea in younger women and notably during pregnancy. The prevalence rate of SDB in pregnancy varies dependent on definitions, methods and the investigated population. At least at the beginning of pregnancy in young women with normal weight snoring and OSA are rather seldom. Overweight and older age are the crucial risk factors for the appearance of pathological snoring and OSA at the beginning of pregnancy and for the increase of frequency of SDB during pregnancy. In the 3rd trimenon the frequency of SDB increases up to 10 - 30%. SDB are supposed to have both a negative impact on morbidity and mortality of the mother and on the fetal outcome.

N2  - Timing of balanced and precise daily delivery of oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and biophysical cues from mother to fetus is essential for fetal growth and successful transition to extrauterine life. Such timing is provided by an arrangement of biological clocks operating in the mother and fetus. However, adverse intrauterine conditions including effects of altering the photoperiod (chronodisruption) during gestation on fetal growth/development and postnatal physiology may translate into adult disease, in which the role played by fetal circadian system remains unclear. Here we review the development of the circadian system, changes experienced by the maternal circadian system during pregnancy, evidence that chronodisruption during pregnancy has long-term effects on the offspring, and current experimental approaches utilized to investigate these issues. However, we are aware that we are just now obtaining new pieces of information that needs to be broadened and studied searching for a diurnal model more comparable to humans. Physiological and pathophysiological questions related to the mother-fetus pair and neonate in vivo need to be addressed as well as the corresponding consequences in adulthood, wiThexpanded and new techniques: among the latter, effects on the transcriptome, microRNA regulome (miRNome), and proteome of different maternal-fetal, neonatal, and adult tissues.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by total or partial interruptions of airflow during sleep, despite ongoing efforts to breathe. These pauses result from repeated upper airway obstructions that generate a systemic inflammatory condition with consequences for the endothelial function that increase the risk of cardiometabolic events. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy is greater than that observed in the general population and increases in the third trimester. Although limited, the information currently available supports the notion that obstructive sleep apnea is an independent, and potentially modifiable, risk factor for maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Experimental and prospective studies in humans have demonstrated an association between obstructive sleep apnea and low birth weight. Endothelial dysfunction may be the link that underlies the association of obstructive sleep apnea with high perinatal risk. The information reviewed herein suggests that treating obstructive sleep apnea with positive-pressure devices could be an effective strategy for decreasing perinatal morbidity and mortality.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the independent associations between nausea, vomiting, fatigue and health-related quality of life of women in early pregnancy in the Generation R study, which is a prospective mother and child cohort. Analyses were based on 5079 women in early pregnancy in the Rotterdam area, the Netherlands. The information on nausea, vomiting and fatigue in the previous three months was measured in the questionnaire at enrollment, as well as potential confounders (i.e., maternal/gestational age, ethnic background, educational level, parity, marital status, body mass index, tobacco and alcohol use, chronic/infectious conditions, uro-genital conditions/symptoms, sleep quality, headache, anxiety, and depression). Health-related quality of life was assessed by the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and physical and mental component summary scores were calculated. Multivariate regression models were performed to evaluate the independent associations of the presence of nausea, vomiting and fatigue with health-related quality of life, adjusting for potential confounders. 33.6% of women experienced daily presence of nausea, 9.6% for vomiting and 44.4% for fatigue. Comparing with women who never reported nausea, vomiting and fatigue, women with daily presence of at least one of these symptoms had significantly lower scores of physical component summary and mental component summary, after adjusting for potential confounders. Our study shows how common nausea, vomiting and fatigue are among women in early pregnancy and how much each of these symptoms negatively impact on health-related quality of life. We call for awareness of this issue from health care professionals, pregnant women and their families.

N2  - Aims: A longitudinal birth cohort provides an opportunity to study the impact of childhood conditions persisting into adulthood. This study examines the cross-sectional association of asthma with sleep quality and snoring in the adolescent and young adult population and the extent to which asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years independently predict themselves or each other at 21 years. Methods: Data from a 21-year follow-up of mothers and their children recruited into the Mater–University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy (n = 7223). Complete asthma and sleep information (questionnaire data) was available for 5015 participants at 14 years and 3527 at 21 years, with 3237 participants at both 14 and 21 years. Results: Poor sleep quality and snoring were independently associated with asthma at 14 years and 21 years, with stronger associations evident in women. At 21 years, associations were mediated by asthma symptom severity. Asthma, sleep quality and snoring at 14 years each strongly and independently predicted themselves at 21 years. Asthma at 14 years predicted snoring at 21 years, while poor sleep quality and snoring in women predicted asthma at 21 years, the latter partially mediated by body mass index. Conclusions: The relationship between asthma, sleep quality and snoring varied by gender. Sleep quality and snoring should be considered in the assessment and holistic management of asthma. The predictive relationship seen between 14 and 21 years provides an opportunity to address these issues at a younger age.

N2  - Disruption of the maternal environment during pregnancy leads to behavioral changes and diseases in the adult offspring. To explore the influence of prenatal continuous light exposure (PCLE) on the adult offspring, we exposed pregnant Wistar rats to constant light during late gestation. Adult PCLE offspring showed an anxiety-like behavior and impairment of short-term memory in different tests. Measurements in the whole brain homogenates from newborn and adult offspring indicated decreased melatonin and serotonin levels and increased reactive oxygen species level in PCLE offspring. Further, we determined melatonin-, serotonin-, oxidative stress-, apoptosis-, and circadian system-related genes expression in different brain areas of adult offspring. The serotonin reuptaker Slc6a4 displayed a decreased expression in the prefrontal cortex of PCLE group. The circadian rhythm-related gene Rora was upregulated in the amygdala of PCLE offspring. Our results point to adverse behavioral effects of PCLE on adult offspring, involving serotonin and melatonin signaling dysregulation, increased chronic oxidative stress, and altered gene expression.

N2  - Objective: To identify the combination of factors most protective of developmental delay at age 2 among children exposed to poor maternal mental health. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: Pregnant women were recruited from primary healthcare offices, the public health laboratory service and community posters in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Participants: 1596 mother-child dyads who participated in the All Our Babies study and who completed a follow-up questionnaire when their child was 2 years old. Among participants who completed the 2-year questionnaire and had complete mental health data (n=1146), 305 women (27%) were classified as high maternal mental health risk. Primary measures: Child development at age 2 was described and a resilience analysis was performed among a subgroup of families at maternal mental health risk. The primary outcome was child development problems. Protective factors were identified among families at risk, defined as maternal mental health risk, a composite measure created from participants' responses to mental health life course questions and standardised mental health measures. Results: At age 2, 18% of children were classified as having development problems, 15% with behavioural problems and 13% with delayed social-emotional competencies. Among children living in a family with maternal mental health risk, protective factors against development problems included higher social support, higher optimism, more relationship happiness, less difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities, limiting the child's screen time to <1 hour per day and the child being able to fall asleep in <30 min and sleeping through the night by age 2. Conclusions: Among families where the mother has poor mental health, public health and early intervention strategies that support interpersonal relationships, social support, optimism, work-life balance, limiting children's screen time and establishing good sleep habits in the child's first 2 years show promise to positively influence early child development.

N2  - Night waking in preschoolers has been associated with adverse health outcomes in cross-sectional studies, but has rarely been analyzed in a longitudinal setting. Therefore, little is known about the evolution of night waking in early childhood. The objectives of the present study were: to identify night-waking trajectories in preschoolers, and to examine the risk factors associated with those trajectories. Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Data on a child's night waking at the ages of two, three, and five, six years, and potential confounders, were collected through parental self-reported questionnaires. Night-waking trajectories were computerized using group-based trajectory modeling on 1346 children. Two distinct developmental patterns were identified: the “2–5 rare night-waking” (77% of the children) and the “2–5 common night-waking” pattern. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors associated with the trajectories. Risk factors for belonging to the “2–5 common night-waking” trajectory were: exposure to passive smoking at home, daycare in a collective setting, watching television for extended periods, bottle feeding at night, high emotionality, and low shyness. This approach allowed identification of risk factors associated with night waking during a critical age window, and laid the groundwork for identifying children at higher risk of deleterious sleep patterns. Those risk factors were mainly living habits, which indicated that prevention and intervention programs could be highly beneficial in this population.

N2  - While the diagnosis of migraine in children is generally straightforward, treatment can seem complex with a number of medication choices, many of which are used “off label.” Patients with intermittent migraines can often be managed with ibuprofen or naproxen taken as needed. Unfortunately, by the time that children present to our practice, they have often tried these medications without improvement. Triptans are frequently prescribed to these patients with good success. It is important to make the patient aware of the possible associated serotonergic reactions. If the patient is having more than one headache per week or the headaches are prolonged, prophylactic treatment is indicated. In our practice, the overwhelming majority of these patients will be treated with amitriptyline or topiramate. We generally allow side effect tolerability to guide our choice of medication. Cyproheptadine is often used in younger patients as it comes in a liquid form. There is evidence supporting the use of propranolol, though the potential worsening of underlying asthma symptoms may limit its use, and sodium valproate, which must be used with caution in female patients of childbearing age due to significant teratogenicity risks. Other prophylactic treatments with less robust evidence include the antiepileptic drugs gabapentin, zonisamide, and levetiracetam; calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and amlodipine; and the angiotensin receptor blocking agent candasartin (not available in the USA). Almost all patients in our practice are advised to take magnesium supplementation. Magnesium is a supplement with relatively few adverse effects and good evidence for improvement of migraine symptoms. We evaluate lifestyle issues and comorbidities in all our patients. Ignoring these will make successful treatment near impossible. Good sleep, adequate hydration, appropriate diet, and exercise are vitally important. Finally, most of our patients benefit from a psychology evaluation with cognitive behavioral therapy. Stress management and biofeedback are tremendously helpful in improving quality of life in migraineurs.

N2  - Sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) is one of the most effective ways for people in malaria-endemic countries to protect themselves against malaria. As most of Sub-Saharan Africa is moving towards universal coverage of the population with mass ITN distribution campaigns, net use rates have been increasing. However, there is still a lack of data on user characteristics, especially of nets with different degrees of physical damage. Two cross-sectional household surveys were carried out in eight districts in Tanzania in 2014 and 2015 to collect data on net ownership, use and physical condition (hole surface area and proportionate Hole Index) combined with household member characteristics. The surveys were conducted in 2,944 households with 15,627 household members and 4,793 used mosquito nets. This data will be analysed to assess who uses mosquito nets of what quality under different ITN ownership scenarios. Results will be presented on characteristics of ITN users (e.g. age, gender, pregnancy status, role in household), whether certain user groups are more likely to sleep underneath “good” or “too torn” nets and whether household ownership of ITNs has any effect on who uses nets of different qualities. This study provides important information, to our knowledge for the first time, on who uses mosquito nets of varying physical integrity, and whether this depends on the access of household members to ITNs. These factors will help malaria policy makers target the right audiences when developing behavioural communication strategies and net replacement campaigns.

N2  - Snoring, chronic rhinitis and fragmentation of sleep are common symptoms in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is also increased in pregnant women and can be associated with pregnancy induced hypertension, preeclampsia and diabetes mellitus. The fetus is as well exposed to a higher risk of prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction. Given the lack of adequate screening tool, the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is a challenge for the physician and a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary in order to identify the patients at risk and propose an appropriate management.

N2  - Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a disease which is estimated to be undiagnosed to a large extent. Hence, the prevalence of OSAS in pregnant women is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnant women with chronic diseases. Methods: In the study, 97 pregnant women with chronic diseases and 160 healthy pregnant women were included. A form questioning socio-demographic characteristics and pregnancy characteristics, Epworth scale and the Berlin questionnaire to evaluate the risk of OSAS were applied to participants. Results: It has been determined that 10–12.5% of healthy pregnant women, 34–45.4% of pregnants with chronic diseases and 20.6–23.3% of all pregnant women had a high risk of OSAS, the pregnants with chronic disease compared to healthy pregnant women had statistically significant higher risk of OSAS. The risk of OSAS was found to be significantly higher especially in pregnant women with hypertension and diabetes. Conclusions: OSAS can lead to the adverse consequences in pregnancy, should be questioned for all pregnants especially those with chronic diseases. Pregnant women with OSAS should be monitored more carefully in terms of diabetes and hypertension in antenatal care.

N2  - Background: Clinically significant psychological distress in pregnancy is common, with epidemiological research suggesting that between 15 and 25 % of pregnant women experience elevated symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Untreated psychological distress in pregnancy is associated with poor obstetrical outcomes, changes in maternal physiology, elevated incidence of child physical and psychological disorders, and is predictive of maternal postpartum mood disorders. Despite the wide-ranging impact of antenatal psychological distress on mothers and their children, there is a gap in our knowledge about the most effective treatments that are available for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy. Additionally, no trials have focused on potential physiological changes that may occur as a result of receiving mindfulness training in pregnancy. The proposed trial will determine the effectiveness of an 8-week modified Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) intervention delivered during pregnancy. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of MBCT to treat psychological distress in pregnancy. A sample of 60 consenting pregnant women aged 18 years and above will be enrolled and randomized to the experimental (MBCT) or control (treatment as usual) condition. Primary (e.g., symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety), secondary (cortisol, blood pressure (BP), heart rate variability (HRV), and sleep) and other outcome data (e.g., psychological diagnoses) will be collected via a combination of laboratory visits and at-home assessments from both groups at baseline (T1), immediately following the intervention (T2), and at 3 months postpartum (T3). Descriptive statistics will be used to describe sample characteristics. Data will be analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Hierarchical linear models will be used to test intervention effects on primary and secondary outcomes. Discussion: The trial is expected to improve knowledge about evidence-based treatments for psychological distress experienced in pregnancy and to evaluate the potential impact of mindfulness-based interventions on maternal physiology.

N2  - Symptoms, such as dizziness, are frequently observed in pregnant women. Because type I Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM) may cause lethal complications, such as central sleep apnea, patients with neurological symptoms require extremely careful management. There are no strict recommendations regarding the management of parturients with type I ACM. Case: A 30-year-old pregnant woman was referred to our department at 10weeks of gestation with complications of type I ACM. At the age of 27 she had complained of dizziness and was diagnosed with type I ACM. A neurological examination confirmed both persistent ataxia and anesthesia of the extremities. Cranial and cervical magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebellar tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum. A magnetic resonance imaging scan at 27weeks of gestation revealed a type I ACM, unchanged since age 27. For this reason, we chose conservative treatment rather than surgical decompression. Her obstetrical course was unremarkable and she delivered a healthy, term male baby, weighing 3560g. Pregnant women with known type I ACMs who experience neurological deterioration require prompt evaluation of their anatomic and neurologic status. Further clinical observation and study are necessary for the better understanding of dynamic physiolosy of type I ACMs during pregnancy.

N2  - PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that involves episodic apneas during sleep. Previous studies have suggested an association between OSA and maternal hypertension (HTN) during pregnancy, but the incidence of OSA in pregnant women is not well known. The purpose of the study is to determine the associations within OSA in pregnant women who have high-risk pregnancies due to obesity, pre-eclampsia, and/or hypertension. We examined the risk and incidence of OSA in high-risk pregnancies and we also compared levels of sleepiness and quality of sleep within the study population. METHODS: We enrolled 54 pregnant women admitted to OHSU's inpatient Labor & Delivery Unit with conditions of obesity (pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 or pregnancy BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2), pre-eclampsia, and/or hypertension. Risk of OSA was determined using Berlin and STOP-BANG questionnaires, sleepiness was measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and quality of sleep was determined using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). 37 subjects underwent overnight oximetry recording using either the ApneaLink ResMed Device or the PROFOX Oximeter Device. Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) or Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) was used to determine incidence of OSA. All analyses were completed using STATA 14 statistical software. RESULTS: The population included 54 females with an age range of 19 to 46 years, with a mean age of 29.43 (SD ± 6.37) years. The population BMI range was 21.5-79.4, with a mean BMI of 43.4 (SD ± 10.48). Obesity and pre-eclampsia were significantly associated with high risk for OSA using the Berlin Questionnaire (χ2 = 14.58, p = .006). When measuring for the incidence of OSA using AHI and ODI overnight oximetry recordings, 4/37 subjects had results within the range for a clinical diagnosis of OSA (c2 = 14.58, p = .0000). When examining quality of sleep in pregnant women with high-risk conditions, there is no statistical significance overall (c2 = 4.9287, p = .295), but there is a significant association between poor sleep quality and both preeclampsia (p = .000) and obesity (p = .000). A Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that there was no statistically significant difference in sleepiness between high-risk pregnancy conditions (χ2 = 4.685, p = .3212). CONCLUSIONS: Conditions of obesity and pre-eclampsia are associated with higher risks of OSA and poor quality of sleep.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate sleep quality and health-related quality of life in pregnancy. In a cross-sectional design, 492 women (292 pregnant and 200 nonpregnant healthy controls) were included in this study between November 2014 and June 2015. Participants completed a survey on sociodemographic characteristics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D). The PSQI total and EQ-5D scores of pregnant women were significantly worse than the controls (P = .017 and P < .001, respectively). Linear regression analysis showed that only pregnancy status was related to PSQI scores (β = .117; P = .009). Compared with the first trimester, the risk of poor sleep quality increased 2.11-fold in the second trimester (P = .048) and 1.86-fold in the third trimester (P = .054). Compared with the first trimester, EQ-5D scores significantly decreased in the second (P = .038) and third (P < .001) trimesters. Sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women were worse than those of nonpregnant healthy controls. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of deteriorations in sleep quality and health-related quality of life of pregnant women.

N2  - Excessive tiredness is a common problem in pregnant women. Previous literature has suggested an increased incidence of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) in pregnant women. The association between OSA, obesity and diabetes is well established and is a predictor of poorer outcomes in pregnancy. We surveyed 60 women in the Gestational Diabetes screening clinic at our local maternity hospital. The Epworth Sleep Score (ESS) was used as a screening tool for Obstructive sleep apnoea. Women completed the ESS and basic demographic data from their booking visit was recorded e.g. height, weight, BMI and comorbidities. All women were between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant. Twin pregnancies were excluded. No patient had a previous diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). One patient was actively smoking. The average BMI was 28.49 with a range of 18.5 to 55.4. The average age was 34 years-range of 19-43 years. 44/60 were Irish ethnicity, 5/60 southeast Asia and 8/60 were Eastern European and 3/60 African ethnicity. 6 of the 60 women had an abnormal score (>10 on the questionnaire), with 5 having borderline results (10-12). Only one woman had an abnormal reading of 13. The average BMI of those with an abnormal score was 30.8. Of the 60 women surveyed, 11 failed the OGTT. Of these 11 women, only one had an elevated ESS. This small pilot study does not suggest an association between OSA and gestational diabetes. It also suggests that the incidence of sleep apnoea is lower than expected in this highrisk pregnancy group.

N2  - Process C (internal clock) and Process S (sleep–wake homeostasis) are the basis of sleep–wake regulation. In the last trimester of pregnancy, foetal heart rate is synchronized with the maternal circadian rhythm. At birth, this interaction fails and an ultradian rhythm appears. Light exposure is a strong factor influencing the synchronization of sleep–wake processes. However, little is known about the effects of phototherapy on the sleep rhythm of premature babies. It was hypothesized that sleep in preterm infants would not differ during phototherapy, but that a maturation effect would be seen. Sleep states were studied in 38 infants born < 32 weeks gestational age and/or < 1 500 g birth weight. Videos of 3 h were taken over the first 5 days of life. Based on breathing and movement patterns, behavioural states were defined as: awake; active sleep; or quiet sleep. Videos with and without phototherapy were compared for amounts of quiet sleep and active states (awake + active sleep). No significant association between phototherapy and amount of quiet sleep was found (P = 0.083). Analysis of videos in infants not under phototherapy revealed an increase in time spent awake with increasing gestational age. The current data suggest that the ultradian rhythm of preterm infants seems to be independent of phototherapy, supporting the notion that sleep rhythm in this population is mainly driven by their internal clock.

N2  - Background: Maternal depression during pregnancy activates the HPA axis and leads to high levels of cortisol, which crosses the placenta [1]. The resulting fetal overexposure to cortisol in utero may programme the fetal HPA axis, leading to alterations in infant stress response and predisposing the infant to mental illness in adult life [2,3]. Some studies demonstrate that depression may have a trait effect on the HPA axis, with changes persisting after resolution of symptoms [4]. Aim: Prospective cohort study to measure differences in cortisol output across three groups - pregnant women with clinical depression (Depressed), euthymic pregnant women with a prior history of depression (History), and never-depressed pregnant women (Control); and to measure differences in infant cortisol stress reactivity within these groups. Method: All women underwent clinical assessment and were allocated to one of the three groups above. Women completed rating scales on mood, sleep and childhood trauma. Maternal saliva samples were collected at 25 weeks gestation to assess cortisol awakening response (CAR) and evening cortisol levels. Maternal CAR and infant cortisol response to vaccination stressor were assessed at two months, six months, and one year postbirth (PB1, PB2 and PB3 respectively). Cortisol data was log transformed and statistical significance was ascertained by t-tests, ANOVA or Pearson correlation as appropriate. Results: Salivary cortisol levels have been analysed in 66 women and 47 infants to date. Pregnancy: No significant differences. PB1: The Depressed group had significantly lower AUCi compared to women in both History (p = 0.04) and Control (p = 0.001) groups. PB2: Infants born to the Depressed group had significantly higher mean cortisol values compared to History (p = 0.000) and Control (p = 0.001) groups, with significantly higher baseline (p = 0.005 and p = 0.001 respectively) and post-vaccination cortisol levels (p = 0.000 and p = 0.001 respectively). Mean infant cortisol at this time point correlated positively with pregnancy mean morning cortisol levels (r = 0.390, p = 0.049). Infant baseline cortisol level correlated positively with maternal waking cortisol level at pregnancy (r = 0.527, p = 0.005) and PB2 (r = 0.506, p = 0.007). Conclusions: The relationship between CAR during pregnancy and infant cortisol measures suggests that overdrive in the HPA axis during pregnancy may be 'transmitted' to infant HPA axis. These findings suggest that maternal depression during pregnancy may constitute a very early life stressor for the fetus through its effects on the HPA axis. The study remains in progress.

N2  - The overall aim of this thesis was to validate the new concept of the Fertility Assessment and Counselling (FAC) Clinic at Rigshospitalet. The intention was to: explore the prognostic value of fertility risk factors by a risk score and provide an estimate of female fecundity, to quantify the impact of oral contraception (OC) on ovarian reserve parameters defined as Anti Müllerian Hormone (AMH), Antral Follicle Count (AFC) and ovarian volume, and to gain knowledge of attitudes and considerations toward family formation in women of advanced age. The thesis is based on the following four manuscripts:   Manuscript I describes the predictive value of individual fertility assessment and counselling in terms of subsequent time to pregnancy within two years after the initial consultation at the FAC Clinic. The follow up study comprised 519 women, of which 352 had tried to conceive. At the time of follow-up, 259/352 had achieved a pregnancy, 74/352 were still trying and 19/352 had given up. The remaining 167 women had no attempts to conceive. The risk assessment provided a score based on the appearance of fertility risk factors: green (low), yellow (low), orange (medium) and red (high). Two-thirds of the women with only low risk scores conceived spontaneously within 12 months (65%), while this figure was only 32% for women with at least one high risk score (n=82). Accordingly, presence of at least one high risk score reduced the odds of achieving a pregnancy within 12 months by 73% (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.13-0.57). The FAC Clinic concept seems as a usable tool for fertility experts to guide women on how to fulfil their reproductive life-plan, but longer follow-up studies are needed. Manuscript II describes the impact of OC on ovarian reserve parameters in 887 women at the FAC Clinic. Of the 887 women, 244 (27.5%) used OC.  The 244 users of OC were significantly younger than non-users with a mean age of 31.5 (SD 4.3) vs. 34.1 (SD 4.3) years (p < 0.001). Overall, there was no difference between the two groups in relation to bodyweight, BMI, smoking habits, gestational age at birth, prenatal exposure to maternal smoking or maternal age at menopause. In linear regression analyses adjusted for age, ovarian volume was 50% lower, AMH was 19% lower, and AFC was 18% lower in OC-users compared to non-users. Among the OC users there was a significant decrease in antral follicles sized 5-7 and 8-10 mm and an increase in the number of small follicles sized 2-4 mm. Physicians have to be aware of the impact of OC use on ovarian reserve parameters and possible concealment of premature ovarian insufficiency, when assessing the fertility status and estimating the reproductive lifespan in OC users. Manuscript III describes the family intentions and personal considerations on postponing childbearing in 340 childless women of advanced age. The study comprised 140 cohabiting and 200 single women aged 35-43 seeking fertility assessment and counselling at the FAC Clinic. The majority (82%) was well-educated and in employment. Despite their mean age of 37.4 years, the main reasons for attending the FAC Clinic were to gain knowledge on the possibility of postponing pregnancy (63%) and due to a concern about their fecundity (52%). Both the cohabiting and single women expressed a wish for two or more children (60%). The most important benefits were "personal development" (89%) and "to give and receive love" (86%). The main concerns about childbearing were "less time to myself" (82%) and "less time to job and career" (76%). The single women were more positive regarding the use of donor sperm (70%) compared to the cohabiting women (25%). Our results indicated a general overestimation of the women´s own reproductive capacity and an underestimation of their risk of future infertility and childlessness with continuous postponement of pregnancies. Manuscript IV describes attitudes toward family formation in ten single and ten cohabiting childless women of advanced age. The women were interviewed one week before their consultation at the FAC Clinic about their family formation intentions, considerations and concerns. The interviews were analysed and condensed into four categories: ''The biological clock'', ''The difficult choice'', ''The dream of the nuclear family'', and ''Mother without a father''. The categories were condensed into two subthemes; `Fear´ and `Expectations´ and gathered into one main theme 'The conflict of choosing', which reflected the women's attitudes toward family formation prior to individual fertility counselling. The women attended the FAC Clinic due to a concern about their fecundity and a fear for infertility. Overall, the women expressed a dream of the nuclear family and finding "Mr. Right" and many with the wish of buying more time. Both groups would consider solo motherhood due to their advanced age, although it was considered to be Plan B, as it was not "natural".

N2  - Objective: Women with bipolar disorder have a high risk for symptom exacerbation during pregnancy. Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is an appropriate option for managing psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy although it is often neglected. We report a case of bipolar, 6th week of gestation woman who discontinued medication in the 2nd week of pregnancy but had to resume her pharmacotherapy with ECT due to manic episode that recurred during the first trimester. Case: A 23 year-old female, with a history of one psychiatric hospitalization (for a manic episode in 2012) and euthimic state with lithium 900 mg/day and olanzapine 5 mg/day use for three years until 2nd week of gestation admitted to psychiatry clinic due to complaints of decreased need for sleep, increased speech, lability of emotions, religious delusions, looseness of associations and irritability for the last two weeks. Young Mani Score (YMS) was 32. ECT, which was considered as the first-line treatment, was not carried out due to low pseudocholinesterase (2401). Therefore, olanzapine was reinstated at 6th week of gestation with a dose of up to 20 mg/day. Although taking olanzapine, the patient still continued irritability. Therefore during the 8th week of gestation medication was switched from olanzapine to haloperidol 15 mg/day and quetiapine 25 mg/day. Sleep duration lengthened but still appeared to be irritable, talkative, and hyperactive. Due to persistent symptoms, after necessary consultations and family approval taken, she was administered 6 sessions of ECT with oral haloperidole, although low pseudocholinesterase. Since improvements in manic symptoms and 7 in YMS, she was discharged with haloperidol 15 mg/day, biperiden 4 mg/day and quetiapine 25 mg/day without any cognitive and gynegological problems. Discussion: This case highlights the effectiveness of ECT in mania during the first trimester of pregnancy. We suggest that ECT might be considered as a valid and safe option when manic episode symptoms manifest during pregnancy.

N2  - Supporting Abstract 1: Challenges of Cancer and Fertility from a Systemic Perspective Dr. Snezana Mijalkovic, M.Sc., ECP Counselling Centre for Psycho-Oncology, Clinic for Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Clinical Centre in Belgrade Serbia Nowadays, a lot is known about the physical changes caused by cancer and its medical treatment. One of them can be decreased fertility in premenopausal woman. This challenge, in addition to cancer itself, can be emotionally very distressing for these women and their partners/ families and can have a negative impact on their quality of life. It is important for clinicians to have an awareness of how important fertility issues are for these patients and to be able to extend empathy and comfort in discussing these issues. This may sometimes be a challenge because the patient's existential issues may trigger clinicians to questions their own life priorities and what they require for a good quality of life. In addition, their life perspective sometimes may differ from their clients. These are some of the challenges that both clients and clinicians face in making decisions about medical treatment, the preservation of fertility and dealing with grief over their overt or hidden losses caused by cancer- related infertility. It is important that clinicians use a systemic approach when asking clients about these challenges, in discussing fertility preservation and in helping clients find meaning in coping with these life events. The therapeutic goal we should aspire to is to empower women diagnosed with cancer and their partners/families during this delicate time and help them overcome these life challenges through self-development and growth. Supporting Abstract 2: Psychological Aspects of Cancer in Pregnancy Tineke Vandenbroucke, MSc University of Leuven, Department of Oncology; University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Leuven, Belgium One in 1000 to 2000 pregnant women is diagnosed with cancer. A cancer diagnosis during pregnancy may be considered as an emotional challenge for pregnant women and their partners. Emotions of joy, happiness, hope and expectation become intertwined with distress, concerns, worries and questions. Standard treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy during pregnancy is often indicated. For these women, the pregnancy period is characterized by uncertainty about their own health and that of the baby. However, termination of pregnancy induces additional psychological challenges for the patient and the partner. Besides grief about losing health and perspectives for the future, these couples also experience grief about the loss of their child. The postpartum period is usually a difficult period for the patients and their partner. Fear of recurrence, continuation of treatment after delivery or a poor treatment response in combination with the normal postpartum difficulties like sleep deprivation and baby blues makes these women extremely vulnerable in the postpartum period. Moreover, some children are born preterm and need intensive care at a neonatal intensive care unit. In some cases, this may complicate the development of bonding and attachment to the new-born, as mother-infant interactions may be more restricted due to the risk of infections for both the mother and the baby. A thorough examination and follow-up of the distress, concerns, coping strategies and social network by a psychologist and a social worker are therefore recommended. Supporting Abstract 3: Development of an EORTC quality of life questionnaire to assess fertility related issues J. Weis, E. Greimel, V. Kesic, R. Schwab, A. Hasenburg Due to improving survival rates, the subject of fertility and quality of life in young cancer patients is becoming increasingly important. In most cancer types, there is decrease of fertility or complete loss of fertility due diagnosis or cancer treatment. Therefore, fertility is an important problem for many young cancer patients, which influences various aspects of their quality of life. In clinical practice, fertility issues require adequate patient-oriented counselling and shared decisionmaking in the fertility-preserving treatment options. Against this background, in collaboration of EORTC Quality of Life Group and ESGO, an international validated instrument will be developed to measure the individual psychosocial aspects of fertility and patient care needs. The questionnaire is covering fertility-related aspects in all cancer diagnoses (male and female) and in all medical treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, stem cell transplantation etc.). Preliminary qualitative interviews with patients and experts detected the following aspects as important topics: information needs, shared decision making, wish for children (before and after diagnoses), partnership issues, doctor-patient communication, psychological issues of fertility and psychosocial support. Supporting Abstract 4 Psychosocial distress and supportive care needs in partners of women with breast cancer A. Mehnert, J. Meise, A. Höcker For many women with breast cancer, being in a functioning relationship represents an important resource for coping with cancer-related stress. Breast cancer has a similarly distressing effect on both patients and their partners. In return, the distress that patients' partners experience has a large impact on patients' distress levels as well as the risk of suffering from anxiety and depression. The purpose of this study was to (a) assess the scope of psychosocial distress and symptom burden in partners of women with breast cancer; (b) explore how patients and partners assess not only their own psychosocial distress (self-report) but also that experienced by their partners; and (c) assess partners' supportive care needs and finding predictors for their need of counselling. We assessed 102 women with breast cancer treated in oncological outpatient facilities as well as their partners with standardized questionnaires. We found that anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger and need for support were equally high in patients and partners, and psychosocial distress was higher in partners than in patients. Patients' evaluation of their partners' mental wellbeing was consistent with the partners' self-report, but patients' partners tended to overestimate the patients' level of distress. Partners reported the strongest supportive care needs regarding 'health care system and information' followed by 'psychological issues'. More than three out of four partners (77.5%) reported unmet supportive care needs, and these were positively associated with psychosocial distress and can be predicted by levels of anxiety.

N2  - Background/Purpose: Poor sleep quality is an underappreciated complaint commonly observed in patients with SLE. We hypothesize that poor sleep quality contributes to worsening lupus disease activity. The aims of this study are to evaluate the relationship between: 1) subjective sleep measures and active SLE, 2) objective sleep actigraphy and active SLE, and 3) confounding variables that influence sleep quality and active SLE. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal, observational study was designed to evaluate the relationship between sleep quality and SLE disease activity. Analysis was restricted to the first study visit. 127 subjects from the Lupus Clinic at Washington University who met ACR or SLICC criteria for SLE were enrolled. Patients with hepatitis B/C, HIV, cirrhosis, ESRD, or pregnancy were excluded. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Instrument System (PROMIS)-Sleep Related Impairment (SRI), and PROMIS-Sleep Disturbance (SD) survey instruments were administered to measure patient reported subjective sleep quality. 39 actigraphy watches recorded objective sleep data (sleep efficiency) over 7 days. SLEDAI 2K Responder Index-50 (S2K RI-50) assessed SLE disease activity (S2K RI-50 >4 = active SLE). Pearson Correlation measured the correlation between individual measures of sleep quality and SLE activity. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses explored predictors of active SLE and poor sleep. Results: Of the sleep surveys, SRI (Pearson coefficient 0.20, p=0.026) and SD (Pearson 0.20, p=0.031) both correlated with active SLE, whereas ESS (p=0.66) and PSQI (p=0.74) did not. Univariate linear regression of SRI showed that active SLE predicted an increase in SRI that was significant but with modest effect (r2=0.042, p=0.026) whereas PROMISFatigue (r2=0.69, p<0.0001) and PROMIS-Anxiety (r2=0.34, p<0.0001) comorbidities had a stronger effect on predicting SRI. In multivariate linear regression, only the effect of fatigue remained significant (p<0.0001). Univariate and multivariate analyses of predictors of SD showed similar results. Sleep efficiency measured by actigraphy was nearly significant with active SLE (Pearson coefficient -0.30, p=0.064) due to underpowered sample size (n=39). However, sleep efficiency poorly correlated with the subjective sleep surveys: SRI (Pearson -0.18, p=0.28), SD (Pearson -0.19, p=0.26), ESS (Pearson -0.16, p=0.33), PSQI (Pearson -0.33, p=0.09). Conclusion: Our study reinforces that poor sleep quality remains a problem in SLE patients. We found that the SRI and SD surveys correlated with active SLE, but when considering confounding variables, fatigue best explained the relationship between poor sleep. Interestingly, despite the low sample size, we nearly achieved statistical significance when examining sleep efficiency via actigraphy to active SLE. Furthermore, sleep efficiency poorly correlated with the patient-reported sleep surveys. Thus, these data suggest that sleep quality is an unappreciated need in patients with SLE, and that current, validated sleep surveys may not best represent poor sleep quality for these patients.

N2  - Objectives: Sleep quality of an infant is largely variable during the first year of life, but factors beyond this variability are still poorly characterized. We aimed to characterize environmental factors related to sleep quality in early infancy. Methods: The results are based on population-based CHILD-SLEEP birth cohort (N = 1,673 families). The results are based on parental reports on sleep quality at the age of three months (N = 1,427) and maternal reports on their well-being during pregnancy (N = 1,667). The data were subjected to statistical analyses (pairwise statistical testing and multivariate modeling). Results: Sleeping difficulties (nocturnal awakenings, sleep-onset problems, and difficulties in settling into sleep at night) were reported in 22.3 percent of the infants. Practices at bed time were not related to sleeping difficulties (P > 0.358), but the ability to self-sooth was related to shorter sleep onset (P < 0.001) and fewer awakenings (P = 0.028) but not to severe awakenings (P = 0.23). Pacifier users had fewer sleep-onset problems than other infants (P < 0.001), whereas breast-fed infants had more sleep-onset problems (P = 0.037) and awakenings (P < 0.001) than other infants. Sleeping position was related to the number of awakenings (more awakenings when sleeping on back/side, P < 0.001). Sleeping in a parental bed was related to more sleep onset difficulties (P = 0.001), awakenings (P = 0.002), and difficulties to fall asleep at night (P < 0.001), and changing sleeping place was related to nocturnal awakenings (P ≤ 0.001). Exposure to nocturnal lighting was related to the frequency of awakenings (P = 0.003) and the average number of awakenings per night (P = 0.004). Maternal depression, anxiety, and stress during pregnancy were related to infant sleep quality at three months of age. In particular, sleep-onset problems were related to depression, anxiety, and stress during pregnancy (P < 0.001, 0.017, 0.048), whereas difficulties to settle were related to depression (P = 0.034) and stress (P = 0.022). Conclusions: Sleep quality in infancy is highly variable. Whereas early development reflects largely maturational issues, many environmental factors and maternal psychiatric symptoms during pregnancy are also related to sleep quality in early infancy, calling for new intervention studies to prevent sleeping difficulties later in life.

N2  - The maternal mortality rate for parturients with severe pulmonary hypertension is 30% to 50%. General, epidural, and combined low-dose spinal-epidural anesthesia have been used successfully for cesarean deliveries in patients with pulmonary hypertension. We describe a cesarean delivery performed using an intrathecal catheter in a 25-year-old morbidly obese (body mass index, 82 kg/m2) woman (gravida 3, para 2 at 32 weeks of gestation) who had severe pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, pulmonary emboli, and obstructive sleep apnea. We discuss the anesthetic considerations for parturients with severe pulmonary hypertension undergoing cesarean delivery including the selection of anesthetic technique, vasopressors, and uterotonic agents.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of leptin and other selected variables on gestational weight gain (GWG) according to pre-gestational body mass index (BMI). Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Public Health Center, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sample: Two hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women. Methods: Women were followed at the 5–13, 20–26 and 30–36th gestational weeks. The effects of independent variables on GWG in normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2) women were assessed using longitudinal linear mixed-effects models. Main outcome measure: Maternal body weight (kg) throughout pregnancy. Results: Leptin concentrations were associated with GWG in normal weight (β = 0.048, P < 0.001) and overweight (β = 0.023, P = 0.048) women, but not in obese ones (β = 0.011, P = 0.308). Additionally, the number of hours slept per night decreased the effect of leptin on GWG in OW women (β = −0.013, P = 0.002). The effect of other maternal characteristics on GWG was different depending on the BMI category. Conclusions: Leptin concentrations were positively associated with GWG in normal weight and overweight women, but not in obese ones. Maternal height was associated with GWG in all BMI categories, but other variables such as sleep duration, QUICKI values, HDL-c, smoking habit and marital status presented differential effects according to BMI. We encourage further studies to investigate the association between leptin and gestational weight gain, taking into account the pre-pregnancy weight and sleep duration, in order to compare and confirm our results. Tweetable abstract: Leptin is associated with weight gain in normal weight and overweight pregnant women, but not in obese ones.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of the present study was to assess early speech and language development in a large birth cohort. The underlying factors that might be related to slow and fast development of expressive vocabulary were analyzed. Methods: The data were collected from the large birth cohort CHILD-SLEEP in which the development of sleep in early childhood was investigated. Data for this study were collected during pregnancy and when the children were ages 18 and 24 months (N = 1,162 and N = 946, respectively). Pairwise comparisons and series of logistic regression models were constructed to find factors that are related to slower speech development. Results: At age 18 months, 67.4 percent (n = 783) were reported to have 20 or fewer words in their vocabulary, and 35.1 percent (n = 408) had five words or less. Most of the children used only single word expressions (68.7 percent, n = 799). Approximately one-third of the children did not use understandable word forms (34.8 percent, n = 405), and 11.2 percent (n = 130) were only babbling. A number of children (n = 85, 7.3 percent) did not seem to understand small everyday guidance. At 24 months of age, 31.6 percent (n = 299) were reported to have less than 50 words, 18.4 percent (n = 175) were reported to have less than 20 words, and 6.2 percent (n = 59) had five words or less. Some of the children (15.6 percent, n = 146) were still using single word expressions, 14.7 percent (n = 139) of the children did not have understandable word forms, and 2.7 percent (n = 26) were only babbling. Only 3.5 percent (n = 33) did not seem to understand small daily instructions. As much as 45.3 percent (n = 273) had vocabulary development slower than expected (>20 words at 18 months and >50 words at 24 months). Approximately 21.1-22.8 percent of the difficulties at 18 months persisted at 24 months. In multivariate models, smaller vocabulary (<20 words) at 18 months was related to parental socioeconomic status, gestational age, the number of children in the family, sleep onset difficulties, and habit of reading stories in the family when age, parental age, and electronic media exposure were controlled. Conclusions: We found that delays in speech development are highly prevalent, which underlines the need for early recognition and for more studies to understand factors beyond the slow development of vocabulary.

N2  - Introduction: Hepatitis E is an important cause of acute viral hepatitis in India.1 The disease is usually self limited and has a case fatality rate of50.1% in general population. However it is more severe, amongst pregnant women and often lead to fulminant hepatic failure and death in a significant proportion of patients.2HEV is a positive sense single stranded RNA icosahedral virus with a 7.5 kilobase genome classified under the genus Hepevirus.3 Transmission is fecooral. Epidemic occurance is common. According to the South-East Asia Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO), hepatitis E is widespread in developing countries, accounting for upto 60-70% of all sporadic cases of acute viral hepatitis.1,4 HEV causes high mortality in pregnant women, 20- 30% as compared to 0.2-1% in general population.5,6 Aims & Methods: This study was conducted over a period of 5 years from Jan 2010 till Dec 2015. This was a retrospective observational study. All the patients tested positive for anti HEV IgM antibodies were included in the study including pregnant women, children and patients with preexisting Chronic Liver Disease. Details of clinical history at presentation to the hospital, history of pre existing Chronic Liver Disease, clinical examination, Investigation reports, Progression of the disease, response to treatment, complications encountered and outcome of the disease were noted. Results: Males were more affected than females in all the age groups. The highest incidence was found in the age group of 451 yrs. Three out of the fifteen females were pregnant on admission. Twenty three (31.5%) patients amongst the seventy three had preexistent chronic liver disease. A majority of the patients presented with jaundice (91.78%). Other associated symptoms in the decreasing order of frequency were - anorexia (78.08%), nausea/vomiting (68.49%), abdominal pain (58.90%), sleep disturbances (49.31%) and hepatomegaly (50.68%). Pruritis, bleeding manifestations and altered consciousness were present in 23.28%, 20.54% and 16.43% of patients, respectively Serum Bilirubin values were elevated in all the patients with the lowest value noted at 1.5 mg/dl and the highest value noted was 41.2 mg/dl. ALT raise was seen in 84.12% patients. The highest value noted was 7355 U/L. Hepatic coagulopathy was the commonest complication (34.24%). Renal failure was noted in 16.43%, hepatic encephalopathy in 13.69% and fulminant hepatic failure in 7.93% respectively. There were no deaths among the general population. Overall mortality was 5 patients (6.84%) and all of them had background history of CLD. There were no deaths among pregnant women in the study nor were any cases of Intra Uterine Deaths. Among 23 patients with CLD, 21 patients (91.30%) had ACLF with mortality of 5 amongst them. Conclusion: We concluded that acute viral hepatitis E is generally a self limiting disease among the general population, but can cause significant morbidity and mortality among special groups (pregnant women and people with preexisting Chronic Liver Disease). Progression of HEV related illness depends on multiple factors like age, comorbid illnesses, nutritional status, initial severity at presentation, early diagnosis, timely intervention and effective treatment.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: While non-pulmonary causes of asthma, such as valvular heart disease and gastroesophageal reflux are commonly recognized, the mechanical causes of asthma are often over looked. We now present a case of adult onset asthma due to diaphragm elevation. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 51 year old woman with a history of asthma, sleep apnea, GERD and obesity who presented for further evaluation of progressively worsening asthma. It was first diagnosed 10 years ago. She complained of wheezing, chest tightness, and severe dyspnea with minimal exertion minimally relieved by bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. She reported that her symptoms were triggered by dust and cold air. On examination, she had diminished breath sounds, most notable on the right. Her symptoms first appeared after her C-section and spirometry at that time showed an FVC of 53%, FEV1 of 53% and FEV1/FVC of 116%. Computed tomography of the chest revealed an elevation of the right diaphragmatic cupola to the T4-T5 level, with the liver entering into the chest cavity and marked volume loss. The patient was referred for diaphragm plication and had surgical correction of the diaphragm to its expected position. There was full expansion of the affected lung leading to near complete resolution of her symptoms. DISCUSSION: Eventration of the diaphragm is a rare entity. It can be congenital or acquired. Congenital cases, which are more common, can remain undiagnosed until symptoms occur in the setting of increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as in pregnancy or increased body mass1. Acquired cases are often due to interruption or injury to the phrenic nerve due to mass effect (such as neoplasm), or surgical injury1. The surgical repair consists of moving the diaphragm to its original position and adhering it via sutures to the chest wall. Appropriate tension must be placed on the diaphragm to allow the lung to fully re-expand without tearing this thin and often weakened muscle2. Improvement in chest wall mechanics and subsequently respiratory symptoms following diaphragm plication can occur along with documented improvement in both FEV1 and FVC3. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma is a clinical diagnosis, but it is important to remember that this is also a diagnosis of exclusion. Symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness and coughing require a complete and thorough evaluation for non-pulmonary causes of asthma prior to the institution of chronic therapy.

N2  - Introduction: Anti N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a distinct autoimmune entity predominantly affecting children and young adults. Its clinical features include impaired cognition, psychosis, seizures, catatonia, movement disorders and autonomic instability. Although relapses following treatment have been noted in 20-25% of cases, recurrent episodes of complete spontaneous recovery are rare. Methods: A 34 year old lady was admitted in January 2016 with complaints of altered behavior and one episode of seizure, subsequently developed dystonia of her upper limbs, infrequent catatonic spells and sleep disturbances during the hospital stay. She first became symptomatic 10 years back, when she developed fever, altered sensorium and status epilepticus requiring intensive care for 3 months, and was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of viral meningitis, also later developing transient depression. Following an asymptomatic period of 4 years, she developed status epilepticus during her pregnancy, followed by post-partum psychosis. She responded to routine medical management in both episodes and showed complete spontaneous recovery without immune modulatory therapy. Results: Investigations done during the current admission were repeatedly positive for anti-NMDAR antibodies. Anti-thyroid peroxidase and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain showed cerebral atrophy. Video telemetry showed presence of diffuse cerebral dysfunction with more emphasis on the left side. PET scan of the brain showed global hypometabolism with relative sparing of the left parietal and temporal lobes; patchy areas of preserved metabolism in bilateral cerebellar cortex. Co-existent neoplastic disease was ruled out by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan of whole body. She was managed with intravenous steroids initially followed by intravenous immunoglobulin after which she showed minimal improvement. Conclusion: Anti NMDAR encephalitis presenting with recurrent and spontaneously recovering prior neuropsychiatric episodes without immunomodulatory treatment has only been rarely reported. As it is just 9 years since its first description, these could represent previously undiagnosed cases.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Mild congential pulmonary anamolies are usually well tolerated by patients well into their adulthood. However, most major congenital pulmonary anamolies become evident in infancy. We present a rare case of unilateral lung and pulmonary artery hypoplasia, which was diagnosed in the sixth decade of life. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old African American woman presented to the pulmonary clinic with complaints of worsening shortness of breath. Her physical examination revealed HR 103 bpm and saturation of 82% on 5L NC, decreased breath sounds without ronchi or crackles and moderate lower extremity edema. Her past medical history was significant for morbid obesity, severe scoliosis and obstructive sleep apnea(uncontrolled). Her chest X ray did not show any focal abnormality, however it was limited by her body habitus(BMI 50). Her pulmonary function tests showed restrictive defect with very low diffusing capacity Give numbers. Her echocardiogram showed elevated pulmonary pressure and right heart catheterization confirmed severe pulmonary hypertension with RV dysfucntion. Pulmonary hypertension work-up including a CTA of the chest revealed significant hypoplasia of left lung and left pulmonary artery. The patient was not aware of this diagnosis until this point. She had always attributed her dyspnea to her body habitus and group 3 pulmonary hypertension due to her sleep apnea. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary hypoplasia is a rare congenital anomaly, typically diagnosed in infancy and childhood. This type of congenital anomaly can develop between the 4th and 24th week of gestation. Although congenital pulmonary hypoplasia leads to decreased number or size of airways, vessels and alveoli, the gross morphology of the lung is essentially normal. However, the pulmonary reserve is tenuous when there is a combination with other cardiopulmonary comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Timely diagnosis and management of complications of congenital pulmonary defects is pivotal. Pulmonary diseases in adulthood is often complicated by several comorbidites and hence congenital anamolies may get ignored until the patient cannot compensate anymore.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: GBS is a gram positive coccus that colonizes in the human gastrointestinal and genital tracts (1). The reported annual incidence of GBS infection in the general population of non-pregnant adults is between 4 and 8 per 100,000 (1,2,3). In population- based surveys, invasive GBS bacteremias are responsible for 2 to 9% of heart infections and 4% of central nervous system infections (3). Indeed, 20 to 60% of invasive GBS bacteremias are fatal (3). CASE PRESENTATION: A 75 year old female with a history of Diabetes presented with 1 week of body aches, an episode of fever, and 1 to 2 days of altered mental status. Vital signs were normal. Patient was oriented, but falling to sleep during the conversation. Positive physical examination findings included 4/5 motor strength in bilateral lower extremities. Laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis at 16,800/ microliter. Patient was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone after obtaining blood cultures. CT of the head and MRI of the spine did not show any acute pathology. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed nucleated cells as 311 (79% neutrophils), glucose as 133 and protein as 122. Blood cultures came back as positive for Penicillin sensitive GBS with MIC of < 0.12, so the antibiotics were changed to Penicillin. Patient continued to have persistent GBS bacteremia on repeated blood cultures, so Gentamicin was added. A Trans Esophageal Echocardiogram showed small vegetation on the aortic valve. Patient's daughter visited her mother a few days after admission and revealed that patient had been having significant discomfort from vaginal pessary for a few months. Repeated blood cultures did not grow any organisms after removal of vaginal pessary, and a culture of pessary grew rare GBS. Patient's mentation and lower extremity weakness significantly deteriorated over time. Repeat MRI of brain and spine revealed acute infarction of left posterior parietal region and epidural abscess extending from T 12 to L3. Patient was emergently taken to the operating room, and epidural abscess was drained. Patient completely recovered after finishing the course of antibiotics and rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: No case of GBS bacteremia leading to epidural abscess, endocarditis, and septic embolic stroke secondary to vaginal pessary has been reported so far. In our patient, the likely source of infection was vaginal pessary; however we could not completely conclude that source, as GBS colonizes in the genital tract. CONCLUSIONS: Despite new advancements in medical technologies, a medical practitioner should never ignore the importance of history and the physical examination.

N2  - Background: During pregnancy, a sedentary lifestyle may have negative consequences on maternal and foetal health status. The main objective of this project is to assess the effects of an exercise intervention in overweight and grade I obese pregnant on maternal and foetal health markers. Methods/design: The present study aims to recruit 60 overweight and grade I obese women interested in participating in an exercise intervention program from the 17th gestational week until delivery. Women will be randomized to either an exercise (three 60-min sessions/week of combined aerobic and strength training and pelvic floor exercises), or usual care (control) group (30 women per group). The primary outcome measures are maternal weight gain, and maternal and neonatal glycaemic profile. Secondary outcome measures are: i) perinatal obstetric records; i) body composition; iii) dietary patterns; iv) physical fitness; v) low-back pain; vi) objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour; vii) haematology and biochemical analyses; viii) oxidative stress; ix) pro- and anti-inflammatory markers; x) bone health biomarkers; xi) sleep quality; xii) mental health, quality of life and positive health. Discussion: The findings of this project will help to identify strategies for primary prevention and health promotion based on this exercise-based intervention program among overweight and grade I obese pregnant women.

N2  - Background Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period. A risk factor for mood disorders is poor sleep quality. In this study we investigate the effects of poor subjective prenatal sleep quality on postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, independent of prenatal depression or anxiety, amongst pregnant women in the general population. Methods We analysed data from a subset of women taking part in a prospective cohort study, Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes. The participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory between 26 and 28 weeks of pregnancy (Time 1) and at 3 months postpartum (Time 2), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at Time 1. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between subjective prenatal sleep quality and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms, while adjusting for prenatal depressive/anxiety symptoms and education. Results Although borderline-high depressive/anxiety symptoms were the strongest predictors of postnatal depressive/anxiety, independent of this, poor subjective sleep quality during pregnancy was also associated with borderline-high postnatal depressive symptoms, but not with postnatal anxiety. Limitations Sleep quality and prenatal/postnatal mood were derived from self-reported questionnaires, which may be more susceptible to bias. Conclusion Although treatment of symptoms of prenatal depression and anxiety will be the most important for reducing postnatal depression and anxiety, in addition to that, future studies may explore treatments improving prenatal sleep quality, particularly for women with antenatal depressive symptoms.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the level of serum cystatin C (s-CC) and reverse-dipper blood pressure (BP) pattern.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Single centre.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 718 hypertensive patients were eventually recruited from cardiac clinics between 2012 and 2014 in the Second Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. They were diagnosed as essential hypertension according to their casual office records of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Patients were excluded if they were <18 or >90 years old, under antihypertensive treatment, night workers, suffering from acute stroke or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, diagnosed as secondary hypertension, sleep apnoea or other sleep disorders, renal failure, cardiac failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, women during pregnancy or intolerant to the ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).
MEASUREMENT: The selected patients were evaluated with 24 hours ABPM. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected to evaluate the s-CC levels by ELISA.
METHODS: The distribution of hypertensive patients with different levels of s-CC among each circadian BP pattern group was analysed using analysis of variance. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between the relevant variables and ABPM results.
RESULTS: S-CC level in reverse-dipper group (1.19±0.53 mg/L) was increased significantly when compared with dipper group (1.06±0.36 mg/L) (p=0.021). In addition, after multinomial logistic regression analysis, s-CC (OR 1.717; 95% CI 1.033 to 2.854; p=0.037) and diabetes (OR 2.313; 95% CI 1.401 to 3.821; p=0.01) were significantly different between the reverse-dipper group and dipper group. On the other hand, the decline rate of nocturnal SBP (r=-0.117; p=0.002) and DBP (r=-0.089; p=0.018) was negatively correlated with the s-CC level.
CONCLUSIONS: The s-CC level was significantly higher in the reverse-dipper group than the dipper group and that s-CC was associated with the reverse-dipper pattern of BP examined with 24 hour ABPM.

N2  - Literature review and objective: Insomnia and decreasing the sleep quality causes the performance to be fallen as well as to defects in functions of the people. Disorder in sleep quality is a common problem in pregnancy which seems that it faced with psychological consequences in pregnant women. This study was done with the aim to sleep quality of pregnant and non-pregnant women who refer to the Health &Treatment centers of Sayed-al-shohada. Methods and Procedures: this descriptive-analytical study was done over 250 persons of pregnant and non-pregnant women. Information were collected by using Pittsburgh sleep questionnaire through interview and it was analyzed by using Spss 18 software and Pearson’s descriptive and correlation methods. Findings: From 250 samples of this research 97 persons (38/8%) were pregnant and 153 persons (61/2%) were not pregnant. There was a positive correlation between the weeks of pregnancy and the time to fall asleep which was statistically significant. The average score of sleep disorders in pregnants was 69/7,So that the average scores of sleep disorders in weeks of 2-10,11-19,20-28,29-37sequently are:6,89/7,81/8,86/8 and is 47/8 for non-pregnants. Conclusion: by increasing pregnancy weeks,the time to fall asleep was significantly increased that it can indicate reducing of sleep quality in pregnant women. Therefore,it is suggested an appropriate measures to be taken to improve sleep quality in this group.

N2  - Sleep disorder is common in pregnancy. Sleep disturbance in pregnant women can cause an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including anxiety, fatigue, depression during pregnancy and after delivery, maternal diabetes, etc. Therefore, due to the importance of the subject, this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sleep disorders in pregnancy and some of the associated factors in Hamadan city, Iran in 2015. This case-control study was carried out on 385 pregnant women (case: sleep disorder, n=176; control: without sleep disorder, n=209) referred to health centers in Hamadan. Cluster sampling was done. The measures used in this study included demographic questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. The results showed that 45.7% of the pregnant women suffered from moderate to severe poor sleep quality. The average of PSQI score was 6.83±3.17. No significant differences were found in gravidity, age, body mass index(BMI), job, different work shifts, husband's occupation, husband's education, prenatal care and how to get it, wanted or unwanted pregnancy, family income, house status, being satisfied with the sex of the fetus, smoker husband, being satisfied with husband's support, and getting support from her family between the two groups. In another hand, statistically significant differences were found in gestational age, education, BMI ranging, sexual satisfaction, being satisfied with getting support from husband's family, and being satisfied with sleep quality before pregnancy between two groups. Most of pregnant women experienced sleep disorder in pregnancy. Due to factors affecting the sleep quality, measures should be taken to improve quality of sleep in pregnant women.

N2  - Objective To examine the relationship between prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, and to determine whether resilience plays a mediating role in the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality among pregnant women. Methods Two hundred and thirty-one pregnant women in their second trimester participated in the study. They completed questionnaires, including: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), and the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). A structural equation model was used to analyze the relationships among prenatal maternal stress, resilience, and sleep quality, with resilience as a mediator. Results Prenatal maternal stress was negatively associated with sleep quality in pregnant women (p < 0.01), whereas resilience was positively associated with sleep quality (p < 0.01). Furthermore, resilience mediated the relationship between prenatal maternal stress and sleep quality, and the mediation effect ratio was 22.0% (p < 0.01). Conclusions The risk factor for disturbed sleep was pregnancy-specific stress; however, the protective factor for sleep quality was resilience. This finding could provide scientific evidence for the development of intervention strategies with which to improve sleep quality in pregnant women.

N2  - One in five women in the UK are obese at antenatal booking with adverse short- and long-term outcomes for both mother and child. Risks of complications increase with increasing severity of obesity. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is common in obesity in the general population with well recognised adverse health consequences. Likewise the risk of SDB is known to increase during pregnancy and has been associated with metabolic complications for the mother. Few studies have considered the consequences of sleep disordered breathing in obese pregnancy for maternal and child health. We have been studying a cohort of very severely obese (BMI>40) pregnant women, characterising the women in detail during pregnancy and following up their offspring to age 5 years. Very severe obesity in pregnancy was associated with high risk of SDB compared to normal weight women but paradoxically did not increase risk of maternal pregnancy complications including gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. However SDB was an independent risk factor for childhood adverse neurobehavioural and neuropsychiatric outcomes assessed using a range of validated scales at aged 5 years. High maternal anxiety levels, which were common in very severely obese pregnant women, also independently predicted childhood sleep problems. Our findings highlight SDB as a novel risk factor for child neurodevelopmental problems and suggest interventions to reduce risk of SDB in very severe obese pregnancy are urgently needed.

N2  - METHODS: Weight was measured at 2 and 16 weeks postpartum in 21 women with previous major depression or bipolar disorder (mean age 29.5±4.7 years) who self-reported pre-pregnancy weight during third trimester. Wrist actigraphy was acquired at 33 weeks gestation and postpartum weeks 2, 6, and 16. Circadian phase was measured at 33 weeks gestation and 6 weeks postpartum. The Horne-Östberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory were completed during third trimester. Women were classified as PPWR+ if weight at 16 weeks postpartum exceeded pre-pregnancy weight by ≥5kg.
RESULTS: Compared to pre-pregnancy, average weight gain (±SD) was 6.3±8.8 kg at 2 weeks postpartum and 5.2±8.5 kg at 16 weeks postpartum. ANOVA showed that PPWR+ women (n=8, 38%) had later sleep offset times and lower sleep efficiencies than PPWR- women at all time points and were more likely to report snoring during pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from this small sample showed that women with PPWR had more disturbed sleep and later wake times and were more likely to report symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. Future work in larger samples should examine whether interventions to improve sleep during pregnancy decreases PPWR.
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed sleep and circadian rhythms across the perinatal period in new mothers with and without postpartum weight retention (PPWR).

N2  - Introduction: Increasing evidence suggests that sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) is prevalent in pregnancy and is associated with adverse gestational and perinatal outcomes. Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard diagnostic test, however, simple screening devices for SAHS have not been validated in this population. Aims and Objectives: To determine the relationship between diagnostic test characteristics and its associations with key variables obtained from PSG and a type 3 portable sleep monitoring system (Alice PDx) in pregnancy. Methods: We included women in the third trimester of pregnancy in a multicentre observational study. All women were studied with a 22-channel PSG and simultaneously a respiratory polygraphy (PR) (Alice PDx). PSG and Alice PDx raw data were blinded scored by experienced technologists using AASM 2007 criteria. Exclusion criteria were: steroid treatment, twin pregnancy, SAHS treated with CPAP and Diabetes Mellitus. Results: 157 singleton pregnant women were studied. They were 34.6 ± 4.3 years old. Mean gestational age was 34 ± 2.9 weeks. 8.6% of the women had an AHI > 5 h-1 on PSG, however PR correctly classified as SAHS 4.7% of the pregnant women. The correlation coefficient between the AHI by PSG and manual PR was 0.459 (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.584 (IC95% 0.339-0.828) for the cut point AHI >5 h-1 . The sensitivity of the PR was 36.4%, and the specificity was 98.2%. Conclusions: The respiratory polygraphy Alice PDx is not an appropriate tool to screen for SAHS in pregnant women.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the differences in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcCO2) during normal pregnancy compared to controls. Methods: Standard polysomnography (PSG) with transcutaneous CO2/O2 measurement (tcCO2, tcO2) was performed in 18 healthy women during pregnancy weeks 31-33. Twelve non-pregnant women were studied as controls. Apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI) and flow-limitation time were determined. In addition, breath-to-breath respiratory analysis was used discriminate normal breathing and flow-limited breathing and the corresponding tcCO2 values were pooled for each breath type and sleep stage. Results: There were no differences in AHI or flow-limitation time. Also, there were no differences in tcCO2 between sleep stages or breath types between gravidas and controls. Post-hoc analysis revealed transient increases in tcCO2 “tcCO2-spikes” in 72% of pregnant women, whereas only 33% of controls showed similar phenomena. Gravidas also tended to have more spikes (N = 89 vs. N = 5). Spikes were visually scored and tcCO2 parameters of the spikes were tabulated. Average spike duration was 4:05 minutes and height 0.20 kPa (1.5 mmHg). Average slopes were: 0.11 kPa (up) and -0.09 kPa (down). TcCO2-spike association to flow-limitation was 58% and 18% of the tcCO2-spikes were associated with simultaneous tcO2 increase. Conclusions: Differences in respiratory parameters were not observed between the groups, but gravidas were more susceptible to transient tcCO2 increases during the night, which were only partly explained with inspiratory flow-limitation. Transcutaneous measurement of CO2 and O2 is also sensitive to changes in peripheral blood flow and the observed phenomena might be explained by that also.

N2  - Many studies of sleep and its corollary the Rapid Eyes Movement sleep have tempted to establish a relation between environmental, ecological and physiological variables and sleep duration. It is suggested here that gestation is the main determinant of the Rapid Eye Movement sleep duration of most mammals. Gestation offers the advantage that one species is characterized by a precise value of its gestation time, with relative small variations and it is a quantity that can easily be measured. This observation leads to the comparison of REM sleep state with gestation and fetus development. From numerous results already published on REM sleep behavior a similarity with the fetal state can be established. Many characteristic traits of REM sleep can be recognized in the fetal development. Even if at birth all sensory organs are fully developed their functions have not been exercised and REM sleep may be a time to strengthen adaptation of the senses to the external world and its components; light, sound, contact, taste, odors and gravity. The assumption proposed is that REM sleep is needed for the brain to reorder and rearrange all sensations accumulated during wake and prepare for the following wake period.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to preterm delivery (PTD), using the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ). Methods: This was a large, prospective cohort study among pregnant Thai women. The BQ was employed for symptom-based OSA screening during the second trimester, and PTD was recorded in 1345 pregnant women. Multivariate models were applied in controlling for potential confounders. Results: The overall prevalence of the high risk of OSA was 10.1 %, and it was significantly associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index and score on the Perceived Stress Scale. An adjusted odds ratio for PTD in women with a high risk of OSA was 2.00 (95 % confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.20, 3.34). Stratified analyses, after adjusting for confounding factors, indicated that a high risk of OSA was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (odds ratio (OR) = 2.45, 95 % CI = 1.20, 5.02), but not with preterm premature rupture of membranes (OR = 1.61, 95 % CI = 0.61, 4.26), and medically indicated preterm delivery (OR = 1.83, 95 % CI = 0.72, 4.64). Conclusion: Pregnant women with a high risk of OSA are at an increased risk of having PTD, compared with pregnant women with a low risk of OSA.

N2  - Introduction: A pregnant woman's sleep disturbance due to fetal movement is well-known. We have been developing a system of fetal movement acceleration measurement (FMAM) in order to investigate fetal well-being since 2008 (Early Hum Dev 84). This system consists of two channels of fetal and maternal movements (Med Eng Phys 34). This study examined whether the FMAM system is not only useful for fetal well-being, but also for maternal sleep disturbance. Methods: The subjects were twelve healthy pregnant women (29- 39 yr) at 24-36 gestational weeks. They were instructed to record fetal and maternal movements during their sleep once every 4 weeks. The fetal movement sensor was placed on maternal abdomen, and maternal movement sensor was on her thigh. We analyzed fetal and maternal movements using an original software (Plos One, 2015). We calculated three parameters; maternal time in bed, maternal waking time at night, and the number of synchronous fetal-maternal movements. They gave written informed consent to the study. Results: Mean values of maternal time in bed ranged from 384.0 min to 400.3 min. Mean values of maternal waking time ranged from 17.1 min to 20.1 min. Mean values of the number of synchronous maternal-fetal movements ranged from 58.5 to 86.3. We compared the results with our previous polysomnographic findings, time in bed and waking time were similar, and the number of synchronous fetalmaternal movements was larger than the number of maternal microarousals. Conclusion: The results suggested that the FMAM system is useful to see maternal sleep disturbance.

N2  - Sleep is one of the essential biorhythms of the body that helps in optimum restoration of many body functions. The sleep-wake cycle is determined by the circadian centre and is responsible for the anabolic functions in the body. Infants require about 14 to 18 hours of sleep per day, which reduces gradually to about 8 hours in adults. Urbanization and evolutionary changes have altered the sleep hygiene and shortened the sleep duration. This lead to various sleep disorders like sleep disordered breathing, insomnia and narcolepsy. Sleep disorders lead to adverse cardio-metabolic consequences, including insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia. Pregnancy poses an enormous burden on the homeostasis of the women with alteration in many physiological functions. The sleep disorders during pregnancy lead to adverse foeto-maternal outcomes with long term cardiovascular implications. In this article, I review the pathophysiology of sleep disorders during pregnancy and their glycaemic implications.

N2  - Objective: Research suggests an association between maternal sleep loss, supine sleep position, sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and compromised fetal health. This study investigated maternal sleep, SDB and fetal heart rate with and without a wearable device developed to discourage supine sleep. Methods: 25 pregnant women (32-38 weeks) were monitored at home during their sleep periods over two nights - a control night (no device) and an intervention night (with device). On both nights, they wore a Watch-PAT200 to examine sleep patterns and SDB symptoms and a Monica-A24 Fetal heart monitor. Sleep position was scored from infra-red video camera recordings. Results: Sleep time and self-reported quality were not significantly different during intervention and control. The proportion of participants reporting supine sleep during the intervention (20%) was reduced compared to control (45%). During control, 30% of participants exceeded the cut-off for mild SDB (AHI>5). There was a significant group (“mild SDB”/others) by night (control/intervention) interaction (P < 0.05), such that for those in the “mild SDB” group, AHI was significantly reduced during the intervention (P < 0.05), while for others there was no significant effect. During intervention, there was a significant increase in minimum maternal oxygen (P < 0.01), fewer maternal oxygen desaturations (P = 0.02), and fewer fetal heart rate decelerations (P = 0.02) compared to control. Conclusions: Results provide tentative evidence that a supine sleep-reduction intervention in late pregnancy may provide maternal and fetal health benefits with minimal negative sleep impact. Ongoing analysis explore relationships between video-determined maternal sleep position, oxygenation and fetal heart rate.

N2  - Introduction: The prevalence of sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS) defined by an apnoeahypopnoea index (AHI) ≥5 / hour in reproductive-age women is only 1-3.4%. Several authors suggest that this ratio increases during pregnancy due to hormonal, physiological and physical changes (specially during the third trimester). However, the prevalence of SAHSdiagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) in pregnant women is still unknown. Aims and Objectives: To assess the prevalence of SAHS (AHI≥5 h-1 ) in uncomplicated singleton pregnant women in the third trimester. Methods: We studied women in the third trimester of pregnancy in a prospective multicenter observational study. Anthropometry data, sleep apnoea symptoms, Epworth scale and the hospital PSG results were analyzed. Exclusion criteria were: steroids treatment, twin pregnancy, SAHS treated with CPAP and Diabetes Mellitus. Results: 84 women were included. They were 31± 2 years old. When the PSG was performed the mean gestational age was 33.4 ± 2.9 weeks and the BMI 27.3 ± 3.7 Kg/m2 . Although snoring problems were reported in half of the women (51.9%), only 8 pregnant women (9.5%) had an AHI > 5h- 1 on PSG. The PSG data are shown in Table 1. Conclusions: Our data show that prevalence of SAHS in late uncomplicated third trimester pregnancy is 9.5%, which it is at least 3 times higher than in non-pregnant reproductive-age women.

N2  - Objectives: A number of studies suggest an association between sleep quality during pregnancy and maternal emotional state. We used animal model to address the effect of disordered sleep in mother during pregnancy on her emotionality and emotionality of the progeny. Methods: Pregnant Wistar rats (n = 20) underwent 3 h gentle sleep deprivation (SD) during three consecutive days on the first week of pregnancy; SD took place in the light period. Moving of chow pellets in the food tray, opening or rotation of the cage and handling were used as SD stimuli. Control rats (n = 8) were exposed to the same numbers and types of manipulations during wakefulness in the dark period. We evaluated dams' behavior during SD and control manipulations as well as their maternal behavior during the period of lactation. Anxiety test was performed in two-month pups in the elevated plus maze. Results: Provoked emotional reactions to SD manipulations in the experimental group were more vigorous than those in the control group. Maternal behavior of SD-rats also differed prominently from control rats' behavior. For example, five rats showed long lasting circling and abnormal “pups carrying” behavior; affective digging sawdust was recorded in another 12 rats. Pups of SD-dams in comparison to control ones demonstrated reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, showing increased mobility and spending more time in the open arms. Conclusions: Gentle SD during pregnancy has long-lasting effect on dams emotionality and emotionality of the offspring.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To partner with obstetrical providers to increase promotion of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for infant safe sleep. Specifically, this study evaluates the effectiveness of the Safe Sleep Toolkit during obstetrical visits. Secondary objectives include improving provider and maternal knowledge of safe sleep.
METHODS: Obstetrical providers (n=11) and staff at an outpatient clinic were trained using the Safe Sleep Toolkit and encouraged to discuss infant safe sleep with pregnant women at their 28- or 36-week gestation appointment (n=111, 56 pre- and 55 post-intervention). Provider-reported time spent counseling women on safe sleep recommendations and safe sleep knowledge was measured before and after the intervention. Surveys were conducted with women assessing safe sleep knowledge, intention to follow guidelines, and whether safe sleep was discussed at the appointment.
RESULTS: Significantly more post-intervention women reported their provider had discussed safe sleep (78% vs 32%) (P<.001). Similarly, provider-reported discussion with women increased significantly for all safe sleep guidelines (82%-90% vs 8%-12%) (all P<.001). Maternal knowledge, especially surrounding unsafe sleep practices, improved significantly post-intervention.
CONCLUSION: Training obstetricians to use a toolkit to promote infant safe sleep guidelines increases the prenatal delivery of this information, and improves pregnant women's knowledge and intentions regarding safe infant sleep.

N2  - “The delivery of the infant into the arms of a conscious and pain-free mother is one of the most exciting and rewarding moments in medicine.1 The pain that a woman experiences during labor is influenced by a multitude of physiological and psychosocial factors and varies in onset, timing, duration, and severity. These variations may be due to genetic, environmental, sociodemographic and biological variables, which, in turn, depend on such parameters such as age, parity, ethnicity, religious affiliation, maternal education and even circadian rhythm. However, despite the wide variability in pain experiences, most women in labor will need some form of 'analgesia' during the course of their labor and delivery.2,3,11-13 The childbirth process has been described as a painful and feared process since early times.5 Labor analgesia should be considered a basic human right for all pregnant women irrespective of their race, ethnicity or socio-economic circumstances. The lack of provision of adequate analgesia services should be considered a breach of the four ethical principles of non-maleficence, beneficence, autonomy and justice.6,9 Providing good pain control for patients should be considered as an ethical, moral and humanitarian duty for every healthcare practitioner.4 Treating the pain of labor and delivery will lead to an alleviation of the maternal stress response and a reduction in the degree of stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and result in reduced physiological stresses on both the mother and fetus. Uncontrolled pain and stress can increase the risks of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Poorly managed labor pain may also be associated with an increased risk of postpartum depression and maternal chronic pain syndromes. 10,14 It is, therefore, important, for both the mother and fetus, that the pain experienced during childbirth be adequately treated. The ideal labor analgesic technique should provide complete maternal pain relief without adversely affecting the labor process or causing unwanted side effects in the mother or baby. It should be freely available, simple, and inexpensive. It should be under the control of the mother, and should decrease or abolish the pain of labor without affecting uterine contractions or sensations such as motor function, proprioception or the desire to push. This ideal, but theoretical, method of providing labor analgesia does not currently exist, but we are continuously striving towards attaining this goal.12 Lumbar labor epidurals are considered to be the reference standard for intrapartum labor analgesia.3,10,12 Multiple randomized controlled trials comparing epidural analgesia with other analgesic options have demonstrated lower maternal pain scores and higher maternal satisfaction with labor epidural analgesia. 10,11 Modern innovations in neuraxial obstetric analgesia techniques are discussed in detail in the review by Sng and colleagues. Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, this form of analgesia is unavailable or unaffordable. In addition, societal norms in many countries may also discouragewomen from requesting labor epidural analgesia during childbirth. There is a multitude of analgesic options available for pregnant women in labor. The popularity of different options varies across the globe. Popular options are listed in table 1. This review will discuss selected alternatives to labor epidural analgesia focusing on some non-conventional forms of analgesia that can be used during the delivery process. Remifentanil patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA): Remifentanil, a short acting opioid, has been studied since the turn of the century for its analgesic efficacy in labor.15 The non-organ dependent metabolism, together with the rapid fetal metabolismof the drug, makes it an attractive option for labor analgesia16. Patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) has demonstrated positive labor analgesic effects in a number of early studies.17-20 Volmanen et al21 demonstrated that remifentanil PCIA had a better analgesic effect in labor when compared to nitrous oxide in a small cross-over study published in 2005. The combination of remifentanil PCIA and nitrous oxide was shown to be superior in analgesic effect when compared to nitrous oxide alone.22 Remifentanil PCIA has also been consistently demonstrated to be superior in terms of analgesic efficacy, when compared to other systemic opioid analgesics. Thurlowand colleagues23 showed a reduction in the pain scores of patients using remifentanil PCIA compared with patients using intramuscular pethidine for labor analgesia. These results were confirmed by a similar study conducted by Ng et al in 201124. When compared with fentanyl, Douma et al25 and Marwah et al26 also demonstrated superior analgesic effect with remifentanil PCIA. The analgesic advantages of remifentanil PCIA over systemic analgesics, together with the reduced nurse workload (associated with PCIA) make this type of analgesia more attractive than nurse administered systemic analgesia. When compared with neuraxial labor analgesia, current scientific evidence points towards analgesic superiority of neuraxial techniques over the remifentanil PCIA technique. The seminal study comparing these two modalities was published by Volmanen et al.27 The authors found that, when compared to a local anesthetic/fentanyl neuraxial block, remifentanil PCIA provided inferior analgesia for laboring patients. These results have been confirmed by a number of similar subsequent studies.28-30 A confounding factor in analyzing the results of remifentanil labor analgesia studies has been that most studies combined different analgesic therapies in the comparator groups, making the identification of individual analgesic effects difficult. While remifentanil PCIA appears to show analgesic superiority to inhaled and systemic analgesic options, it is still less effective than neuraxial analgesic techniques. In addition, remifentanil PCIA is associated with significant safety risks to the mother. These include respiratory depression, sedation, nausea and vomiting, and pruritus. The risk for respiratory depression was shown to occur in up to 32% of patients in whom remifentanil PCIA was used.32 This increased risk, combined with the inferior analgesic effect makes remifentanil PCIA a less attractive option for labor analgesia compared to neuraxial analgesia. However there still appears to be a valid place for this analgesic modality provided that detailed monitoring of the parturients is conducted when using remifentanil PCIA. Remifentanil PCIA becomes an attractive option when a major neuraxial block technique is contra-indicated (e.g. very low platelet count in preeclampsia) or undesirable (e.g. extreme fear of spinal needle technique). Acupuncture: Acupuncture refers to the technique of inserting needles into specific pressure point areas on the body to alleviate pain, stress and anxiety. The acupuncture points associated with relieving pain during childbirth are located on the hands, feet and ears. The technique is postulated to alleviate pain via a number of proposed mechanisms which include blocking pain impulses through the Gate Control Theory32, release of endogenous endorphins33 or release of endogenous opioids34. Three different clinical trials investigating the effect of acupuncture on labor pains were conducted in Scandinavia between 2002 and 2003.35-37 All three trials demonstrated a reduced need for analgesia (including neuraxial analgesia) in patients after acupuncture. The results of these trials were indicative that this form of analgesia may be efficient in areas where neuraxial and systemic analgesia are not available. However, in these studies, the acupuncture techniques were not standardized and therefore the results should be interpreted with caution. In addition, despite a reduction of analgesic use in the acupuncture group, Ramnero et al36 reported that there was no significant difference in the patient satisfaction scores between the control and experimental groups in their study of 90 women. This contradiction between the lack of improvement in satisfaction scores and reduced need for analgesia highlights the complexity of the multiple issues that influence a patient's pain experience. Unfortunately, a more recent metanalysis of trials published by Cho and colleagues38 has concluded that acupuncture does not confer any additional analgesic effects for women in labor. Hypnotherapy: Hypnosis has been reported to alleviate pain and anxiety during labor. This form of therapy is postulated to result in change of the patient's perception of the pain experienced during the delivery process and this can have a significant impact on the analgesic requirements during labor and delivery. The use of hypnosis for labor analgesia has been studied as far back as 1969.39 There have been five clinical trials reporting the effect of hypnosis on pain during labor.39-43 All five trials reported a reduced need for analgesia in the patients who received hypnosis training before delivery, compared to the control groups; however the patient randomization in the 1969 Rock et al39 study was inadequate and therefore the results of this study should be interpreted with caution. Freeman and colleagues41 showed no difference in pain relief between the experimental and control groups despite the reduced need for epidural analgesia in the hypnosis groups. Current available evidence indicates that hypnosis can provide a reasonable level of analgesia during labor. Based on the trials reported, hypnosis could be used, especially in hypnosis-receptive individuals, as the sole form of analgesia during labor. Hypnotherapy is, however, a very labor-intensive technique, requiring considerable coaching prior to the onset of labor and 1:1 physician: parturient interaction throughout labor.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal stress has been associated with adverse outcomes in mothers and their children. However, little research has been conducted to identify the factors associated with psychosocial stress in pregnant women.
PURPOSE: This study explored the predictors of psychosocial stress during pregnancy.
METHODS: A convenience sample of 136 second-trimester and 164 third-trimester pregnant women were recruited from a medical center in southern Taiwan. Data were collected using a demographic form, Pregnancy Stress Rating Scale (PSRS), Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale, and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List.
RESULTS: The results of this study found positive correlations between PSRS and both Edinburgh Prenatal Depression Scale (r = .368, p < .01) and Maternal-Fetal Attachment Scale (r = .168, p < .01) and negative correlations between PSRS and both gravidity (r = -.137, p < .05) and Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (r = -.266, p < .01). Higher pregnancy stress was predicted by depression, lower social support, maternal-fetal attachment, and primigravid status, which together explained 20% of the total variance.
CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Depression, social support, maternal-fetal attachment, and gravidity are discrete predictive factors of psychosocial stress in pregnant women. These findings add to existing knowledge of the factors associated with prenatal stress. Future research should include depression in a support model of antenatal stress management.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Considering that changes in the maternal environment may result in changes in progeny, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of sleep restriction during the last week of pregnancy on renal function and autonomic responses in male descendants at an adult age.
METHODS: After confirmation of pregnancy, female Wistar rats were randomly assigned to either a control or a sleep restriction group. The sleep-restricted rats were subjected to sleep restriction using the multiple platforms method for over 20 hours per day between the 14th and 20th day of pregnancy. After delivery, the litters were limited to 6 offspring that were designated as offspring from control and offspring from sleep-restricted mothers. Indirect measurements of systolic blood pressure (BPi), renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, glomerular area and number of glomeruli per field were evaluated at three months of age. Direct measurements of cardiovascular function (heart rate and mean arterial pressure), cardiac sympathetic tone, cardiac parasympathetic tone, and baroreflex sensitivity were evaluated at four months of age.
RESULTS: The sleep-restricted offspring presented increases in BPi, glomerular filtration rate and glomerular area compared with the control offspring. The sleep-restricted offspring also showed higher basal heart rate, increased mean arterial pressure, increased sympathetic cardiac tone, decreased parasympathetic cardiac tone and reduced baroreflex sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that reductions in sleep during the last week of pregnancy lead to alterations in cardiovascular autonomic regulation and renal morpho-functional changes in offspring, triggering increases in blood pressure.

N2  - Depression has been linked to an imbalance in cortisol. Until recently, cortisol has been studied by measuring concentrations at single time points in blood or saliva samples. Cortisol concentrations vary with circadian rhythm and experiences, from time point to time point. The measurement of hair cortisol concentration (HCC) is a new method of accessing mean, long-term cortisol concentrations. Recent studies show positive associations between depression and HCC, and prenatal maternal cortisol is thought to influence the developing fetus. We therefore examined the association between HCC and self-reported symptoms of depression in second trimester pregnant women. Participants were 181 women, recruited between September 2011 and October 2013 to the Little-in-Norway (LiN)-study. These women answered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Rating Scale (EPDS) on self-reported symptoms of depression, and one cm maternal scalp hair was collected and analyzed for cortisol concentrations. Multiple regression analyses did not show depressive symptoms as a predictor for HCC in our selection of pregnant women, while gestational age was significantly related. In conclusion, our study indicated that symptoms of depression during pregnancy did not predict HCC, but further studies of clinically depressed, pregnant women using gestational age as an adjustment variable are warranted.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among Japanese pregnant women with complications, and clarify correlation between RLS and clinical outcomes. In addition, to examine the relationship between periodic limb movement (PLM) of RLS and sleep parameters of pregnant women. Methods: RLS screening was conducted using the Johns Hopkins Telephone Diagnostic Interview for 81 pregnant women with complications in their third trimester. Severity of RLS was rated using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale, and the Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life questionnaire were performed. Blood test and biochemistry results, and delivery outcomes were compared between the RLS group and the control group. Results: RLS was experienced by 14 (17.3%) of the 81 participants. Almost all of the women were admitted to avoid premature delivery. No significant difference was found for hemoglobin, serum ferratin, serum folate levels and delivery outcomes between the RLS group and the control group. Participants diagnosed as mild, moderate, severe and very severe were 6 (46.2), 5 (38.5), 1 (7.7) and 1 (7.7%), respectively. The median value of the RLS-QOL (interquartile range) was 90 (43-100). Median of PLM index were 11.7 (4.0-18.7) in RLS group, and 6.9 (4.5-13.1)/h in the control group (P = 0.421). The sleep parameters were not significantly difference between two groups. Conclusion: The prevalence of RLS was high in Japanese pregnant women with complications who admitted at obstetrics ward. It is necessary to clarify whether a similarly high prevalence of RLS exists for Japanese pregnant women with obstetric complications.

N2  - It is known that learning begins far before birth. This conviction however raises interesting questions about how and what exactly an unborn baby is able to learn. Furthermore, a majority of studies on perinatal learning rely on few single cases and often lack neurophysiological data. In the present study we acoustically stimulate 30 pregnant women (and their unborns) with auditory nursery rhymes (replayed twice a day from the 34 weeks of gestational week onwards). At week two and five after birth, newborns were then tested by presenting an unfamiliar and the familiar rhyme (replayed prenatally) either uttered by the mother's voice or a stranger's voice (each presented for 3 min and preceded by a 3 min baseline). During the postnatal test, video as well as high density EEG (128 electrodes), EMG, and ECG were recorded. Results indicate that delta (4-6 Hz) and alpha (6-9 Hz) frequency ranges are modulated by both stimulus material and time after birth in the sense that at 2 weeks newborns are showing stronger responses to the familiar stimuli while on the contrary at week five they show a preference for unfamiliar stimuli. Data suggest a possible interaction with sleep as during the first recording almost all children were asleep throughout the recording. Interestingly, ECG results appear to show similar response patterns. We will discuss these findings in the light of brain maturation and processing during sleep.

N2  - Background: Short sleep duration (<10-11 h/night) is associated with higher BMI among children aged 2 to 20 years old. Little is known about the relation between sleep duration and objective measures of fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) by bioelectric impedance. We aimed to study, with a developmental approach, the association between sleep duration from age 2 to 5 and FM and FFM at age 5. Methods: Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Repeated measures of the child's sleep were collected at age 2, 3 and 5 through parental questionnaires and were used to computerized sleep duration trajectories (PROC TRAJ). Body composition was assessed in 1104 children. We performed multivariable regressions, adjusted on socio-economic factors and parental and child's characteristics to study the direct association between sleep duration trajectories from 2 to 5 and both FM and FFM at age 5. Results: Five distinct night-sleep duration trajectory groups were identified in 957 children (507 boys): short- (SS, < 10 h, 4.5%), medium-low- (MLS, < 11 h, 48.0%), medium-high- (MHS, ≈11 h 30, 37.5%), long- (LS, ≥11 h 30, 5.5%) and modifier sleepers (MS, i.e. LS then MLS, 4.5%). In multivariable analyses, children belonging to the SS trajectory showed lower FFM, FM and weight at age 5 compared to MHS while BMI and BMI-z-score were not different. There was no difference for the other trajectories. Conclusion: Despite a possible lack of power, we showed a small effect of short night-sleep duration on body composition.

N2  - Objectives: Most of pregnant women complain of sleep worsening. Polysomnography study show deterioration of the sleep quality, which increases with advancing of pregnancy. Earlier research has shown that the criteria for insomnia meets over 60% of women in the third trimester of pregnancy. The aim of this study was to find determinants of insomnia in women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: We gathered data of 266 women using Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Regestein Hyperarousal Scale (HS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), General Sleep Disorders Questionnaire and General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire. Insomnia was diagnosed in 39.85% based on AIS with 8 points as a cut-off, which is more restricted criteria then based on classification. Results: The social factors, daily habits, physical activity, maternal body weight nor advancement of pregnancy were not associated with insomnia. Although high percentage of women reported various sleep problems (30.075% snoring, 26.37% restless legs symptoms, 23.68% nightmares and 22.9% night eating) logistic regression analysis reveal independent correlates of insomnia for depressive symptoms (BDI) , hyperarousal (HS), there were also trend for night eating. Only 4% of our group met criteria of physically active. Conclusions: Our study shows that insomnia in the late pregnancy is linked to the same factors as in general population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively the extent to which duration and quality of sleep influences male fecundability. Sleep problems have been associated with lower sperm concentration, total sperm count, and percent normal sperm morphology, as well as decreased testosterone levels. No studies have been prospective in design. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Boston University Pregnancy Online Study (PRESTO) is a web-based prospective cohort study of couples residing in the United States and Canada. Male participants are aged 21 years or older; female participants are aged 21-45 years. At baseline, men reported data on their average nightly sleep duration and the frequency with which they had trouble sleeping in the previous two weeks (as assessed by the Major Depression Inventory). Male data were linked with those of their female partner, and follow-up questionnaires were completed by the female partner every 8 weeks for up to 12 months or until reported pregnancy, whichever occurred first. The analysis was restricted to 695 couples who had been attempting to conceive for 6 or fewer cycles at study entry. We used proportional probabilities regression models to estimate fecundability ratios (FR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), controlling for male and female age, male and female BMI, intercourse frequency, male education, smoking, multivitamin use, unemployment status, average number of work-hours per week, and clinical depression. RESULTS: We observed an inverted U-shaped relation between sleep duration and male fecundability. Relative to 8 hours/night of sleep, FRs for less than 6, 6, 7, and 9 or more hours/night of sleep were 0.69 (CI: 0.47- 1.02), 1.08 (CI: 0.84-1.39), 0.97 (CI: 0.77-1.21), and 0.51 (CI: 0.27-0.99), respectively. Compared with men who had no trouble sleeping, FRs for men who had trouble sleeping “some of the time or slightly less than half of the time” and “slightly more than half of the time, most of the time, or all of the time” were 0.79 (CI: 0.53-1.17) and 0.57 (CI: 0.27-1.23), respectively. When we did not control for intercourse frequency or clinical depression, which are possible causal intermediates, there was little difference in these effect estimates. Further restriction of the cohort to those with fewer than 3 cycles of attempt time at baseline produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of pregnancy planners, short and long durations of sleep, as well as trouble sleeping at night, were associated with reduced male fecundability.

N2  - During postnatal development, noradrenergic system has been proposed to play an essential role in cortical maturation. Brainstem structures organize during early embryonic development, and retinoic acid (RA) treatment on gestational day 7 (E7) has been shown to modify them, so affecting some neonatal functions, like breathing. These RA-treated mice have been demonstrated to present morphological modifications in the rostral pons, near the Locus coeruleus. Considering that this area is involved in the regulation of the sleepwake cycle also in young animals, the aim of this work is to study how sleep parameters are affected by functional modifications at the above mentioned region during early postnatal development. For such purpose, the electrical activities at the neckmuscles, heart and brain of RA-treated mice have been registered during the two first postnatal weeks. CD-1 pregnant females were orally administered with RA (0.5 mg/kg of maternal bodyweight dissolved in DMSO and olive oil) on E7. On the day of electrophysiological recordings, at P3, P7, P10 or P14 mice were removed from the litter. Under anaesthesia (hypothermia) the pup was implanted with two EMG hook recording electrodes aimed to the nuchal muscle, with two ECG recording electrodes in the chest and two EEG electrodes (only at P14). The electrodes were fixed to the skin with the help of Cyanoacrylate adhesive. After recovery for at least 1 h in a humidified incubator maintained at thermoneutrality (35 °C), electrodes (together with ground ones) were connected to differential amplifiers (Biopac MP35) and signals were recorded for 1 h. EMG, ECG and EEG signals were digitized at 1 kHz with BSL 3.7 software. The EMG and EEG signals for each subject helped us to distinguish between REM sleep, nonREM sleep and wakefulness. At P14 noradrenergic agents were administered and animals were recorded an additional hour. Our results demonstrate that prenatal RA treatment affects the sleep-wake cycle maturation. As a result, at P14 we observe a reduction of time spent in nonREM sleep and an increase in time spent in REM sleep, together with an increase in Heart Rate. At P14 noradrenergic agents restore normality. We conclude that noradrenergic system controls these activities during the second postnatal week.

N2  - Importance: African American women living in urban, low-income environments are at high risk for poor nutrition during pregnancy and birth complications. Objective: To test the effectiveness of prenatal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on birth outcomes and infant development in a sample of African American women with Medicaid insurance and living in the city of Pittsburgh. Design: The Nutrition and Pregnancy Study (NAPS) is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal DHA supplementation conducted between 2012 and 2014. Setting: Participants were recruited from obstetric clinics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Participants: Sixty-four pregnant, African American women were enrolled at 16-21 weeks of gestation and randomized to either 450 mg/day of DHA (22:6n-3)(n = 43) or a soybean placebo (n = 21). Four women (6.3%) withdrew from the study: two participants from each study arm; complete data were obtained for 49 infants (76.5%) at the 3-month assessment. Interventions: Supplementation with DHA or placebo continued from the beginning of enrollment through delivery. Main outcome and measures: Data on birth outcomes were collected from medical records. At approximately 3 months post-partum, mothers brought their infants to the laboratory where the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) were administered and cortisol response to the Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) paradigm was assessed. Results: Infants of mothers who received DHA supplementation had higher birth weight (3.174 g versus 2.890 g) than infants of mothers receiving placebo (F [2.40] = 6.09, p = 0.018, eta = 0.36), and were more likely to have a 1-min Apgar score greater than 8 (OR = 5.99 [95% CI = 1.25-28.75], p = 0.025). Infants of mothers who received DHA compared with infants of mothers receiving placebo had lower levels of cortisol in response to the FFSF paradigm (F [1.32] = 5.36, p = 0.018, eta = 0.36). None of the scores on the BSID-III differed as a function of active supplement versus placebo. Conclusions: Infants of women living in urban, low-income environments who received DHA supplementation had more optimal birth outcomes and more modulated cortisol response to a stressor. DHA supplementation may be effective in attenuating the negative effects of prenatal stress on offspring development.

N2  - Objectives: Pregnancy is frequently associated with sleep disturbance which, in turn, is linked with poor post-partum mental and physical health. Nevertheless, evidence is scarce and studies focused on poor sleep during pregnancy, rather than on complaints of insomnia, which could be even more strongly associated to post-partum adverse outcomes. The study aimed at evaluating the predicting role of insomnia during last month of pregnancy for postpartum depression (PPD) temporal course after birth. Method: Women (N = 188; age: 33.5 ± 5.8; range 18-46) were contacted at the hospital within 48/72 h after birth. At T0, all participants were administered a structured interview including socio-demographic and health information and questionnaires about insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI, Bastien et al., 2001), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI, Buysse et al., 1989), and PPD (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS, Cox et al., 1987). EPDS was further filled in after 1 week (T1), 15 days (T2), and 30 days (T3). Results: Insomnia during last month of pregnancy predicted PPD temporal course (F3,289=5.34, P = 0.001). While women reporting no insomnia (N = 129) presented gradual decrease in EPDS means from birth to 1-month after (T0 = 3.24 ± 3.14; T1 = 2.36 ± 2.47; T2 = 2.33 ± 2.68; T3 = 1.73 ± 2.1), women reporting insomnia (N = 59) did not (T0 = 5.29 ± 3.91; T1 = 6.56 ± 5.17; T2 = 5.81 ± 4.68; T3 = 4.97 ± 4.34). Insomnia was a stronger predictor of PPD temporal course compared to sleep quality and other relevant variables, such as premenstrual syndrome. Conclusions: Insomnia during last month of pregnancy is frequent and predicts maintenance of symptoms of PPD. Insomnia symptoms during pregnancy should be systematically assessed and effective interventions should be proposed.

N2  - Background & Objectives: There are limited educational studies that look at how fatigue and sleep deprivation affect performance of anesthesiology trainees. Nighttime performance may result in worse outcomes, such as accidental dural punctures when placing epidurals in parturients. Aya and colleagues found that there was an increased risk of six times for accidental dural punctures at nighttime. We hypothesized that accidental dural punctures would occur at a higher rate during the nighttime hours similar to previous studies. This is a pilot study to lay the foundation for a prospective study. Materials & Methods: The IRB approved this study. This was a retrospective study of anesthesiology residents to look at dural punctures and the time they occurred on a high risk labor and delivery ward. We reviewed 11090 labor epidurals placed over a 55 month period. Epidurals were performed by CA-1, CA-2, and CA-3s trainees. An accidental dural puncture was recorded if there was 1) positive aspiration for cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or if an epidural blood patch procedure was performed later. If an epidural was performed from 7:00- 19:00 it was considered done during the daytime and if performed from 19:00-7:00 it was considered done during the nighttime. Results: 11090 Epidural procedures were reviewed. 28 accidental dural punctures out of 4824 epidurals occurred during the night and 62 out of 6266 epidurals occurred during the day. The overall rate of accidental dural punctures was 0.81%. The percentage of accidental punctures during the night (0.58%) was lower (p from Fisher's exact test=0.0186) than during the day (0.98%). While statistically significant, the difference between the daytime and the nighttime adverse event rates is small: 0.41% (95%CI: 0.08%, 0.73%). These results were the opposite of what we hypothesized. We are looking for confounding reasons to explain the unanticipated results. These reasons include the experience of the person placing the epidural, the dilation of the parturient when receiving the epidural (urgency might lead to error), age of trainee, workload, day of the week (night float), and sleep hygiene. Patient factors that might lead to more difficulty in epidural placement need evaluated. Conclusion: Our study results conflict with the published studies that have been done so far. As anesthesiology educators, we need to understand what factors influence performance especially when it comes to sleep deprivation and fatigue.

N2  - Objective Only 9 % of women with young children consume a high quality diet. The association between sleep duration and health may be U-shaped. We examined diet quality in relation to sleep duration among US women within 5 years of childbirth. Methods Data were from non-pregnant women aged 20-44 years within 5 years of childbirth who completed two 24-h dietary recalls (N = 896) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2012. Self-reported weekday/workday sleep duration was categorized as short (≤6 h), adequate (7-8 h), or long (≥9 h). The Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010, range 0-100) estimated overall and components of diet quality. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models estimated the association between sleep duration and diet quality, adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and education. Results Thirty-four percent of women reported short, 57.1 % adequate, and 8.6 % long sleep duration. The average diet quality total score was 47.4 out of 100. Short sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. Long sleep duration was associated with lower quality diet (β = -4.3; 95 % CI -8.1 to -0.4), lower consumption of total fruit (β = -0.7; 95 % CI -1.3 to -0.1), whole fruit (β = -0.9; 95 % CI -1.6 to -0.2), and total protein (β = -0.7; 95 % CI -1.3 to -0.03), and higher consumption of empty calories (β = 2.2; 95 % CI -4.3 to -0.1). Conclusions for practice Future studies should examine the longitudinal association between sleep duration and diet quality among women following childbirth and whether interventions to improve sleep can enhance diet quality.

N2  - Background Longer photoperiod during gestation can produce more stable circadian clocks and less depressive-like behaviour in rodents; however, epidemiologic studies have not explored this association in humans. Objective We examined the association of gestational day length (as a proxy for light exposure) and depression among U.S. women in the Nurses' Health Studies. Methods Women reported their date and state of birth on initial study questionnaires, and this information was used to estimate the length of daylight for each gestational day (assuming an average gestation of 280 days), based on equations published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Women reported antidepressant use and clinician-diagnosed depression on study questionnaires at ages 37-79 years. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios [OR] (and 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for depression across quintiles of total gestational day length and differences between extreme gestational day lengths (to capture variation). These associations were also examined according to trimester of pregnancy. Results Total gestational day length was not associated with depression in these cohorts (multivariable-adjusted p-trend = 0.7 across quintiles of total gestational day length, and OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96-1.04 comparing highest vs. lowest quintiles), and results were similar by trimester (p-trends=1.0, 0.9, and 1.0 for the three trimesters, respectively). However, greater differences between minimum/maximum gestational day lengths were related to less depression (multivariable-adjusted p-trend<0.0001, and OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.89 comparing extreme quintiles), which was specific to the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (multivariable-adjusted p-trends=0.02 and <0.0001, respectively). Conclusions We found that greater variability in gestational light exposure may reduce depression in adulthood, which could reflect enhanced adaptation to environmental influences and better suitability for shift work among these women.

N2  - Objective To investigate whether the circadian rhythm disruption following the transition into and out of daylight saving time (DST) is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous delivery. Design We compared the number of spontaneous deliveries in the Swedish Medical Birth Register during the week after the change to and the week after the change from DST (exposure periods) with the average number of spontaneous deliveries in the control period, defined as the week before and the week after each exposure period. Setting Sweden, 1993-2006. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcomes were the weekly and the daily number of spontaneous deliveries in the exposure and the control periods. In secondary analyses we also compared the mean length of pregnancy of the women with spontaneous deliveries in the exposure and control periods. Results The number of deliveries during the week after the transition into or out of DST was similar to that in the comparison period (18519 observed vs 18434 expected in case of the spring shift and 19073 observed vs 19122 expected in case of the autumn shift); the corresponding incidence ratio and 95% CIs were 1.005 (0.990 to 1.019) and 0.997 (0.983 to 1.012), respectively. There were no differences in the length of gestation of the deliveries in the exposure and the control periods. Conclusions Our results do not support the hypothesis that a minor circadian rhythm disruption is associated with an increased short-term risk of spontaneous delivery.

N2  - Objective:Supine sleep positioning (SSP) has been shown to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and preterm infants are at higher risk for SIDS. Population-based estimates of SSP are lacking for the preterm population. The objectives of this study are: (1) compare the prevalence of SSP after hospital discharge for preterm and term infants in the United States; and (2) assess racial/ethnic disparities in SSP for preterm and term infants.Study Design:We analyzed the 2000 to 2011 data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 35 states. We measured prevalence of SSP by preterm and term gestational age (GA) categories. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) to evaluate the likelihood of SSP for each GA category compared with term infants and the likelihood of SSP for non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Hispanic infants compared with non-Hispanic white (NHW) infants.Results:Prevalence of SSP varied by GA: ≤27, 59.7%; 28 0/7 to 33 6/7, 63.7%; 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 (late preterm), 63.6%; and 37 0/7 to 42 6/7 (term) weeks, 66.8% (P<0.001). In the adjusted analyses, late preterm infants were slightly less likely to be placed in SSP compared with term infants (APR: 0.96, confidence interval: 0.95 to 0.98). There were racial/ethnic disparities in SSP for all GA categories when NHB and Hispanic infants were compared with NHW infants.Conclusions:All infants had suboptimal adherence to SSP indicating a continued need to better engage families about SSP. Parents of late preterm infants and families of NHB and Hispanic infants will also require greater attention given their decreased likelihood of SSP.

N2  - Background: Exposure to road traffic noise has been associated with adiposity and diabetes in adults. The suggested pathways have been through sleep disturbance and stress. Children may be particularly susceptible to noise induced sleep disturbance and stress and the effects hereof. Objectives: To examine the association between traffic noise exposure during pregnancy and early childhood and adiposity in children. Methods: We identified 40,974 singletons from the Danish National Birth Cohort with parentally given questionnaire information on weight and height at 7-years of age. Road and railway traffic noise were modeled at all historical addresses and expressed as time-weighted means for two exposure periods (pregnancy and childhood). Adiposity was assessed using BMI z-scores and a dichotomous measure of childhood overweight based on age and sex specific cut-offs. Associations were analyzed using linear regression for BMI z-scores and logistic regression for risk of childhood overweight, adjusting for socioeconomic position, maternal BMI, maternal smoking, maternal age, parity and degree of urbanization. Results: We found both pregnancy and childhood exposure to road traffic noise to be associated with a higher risk for childhood overweight (odds ratio (OR) = 1.06 per 10 dB, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.12 for exposure during pregnancy and OR = 1.06 per 10 dB, 95% CI: 0.99-1.12 for childhood exposure). There were no associations between road traffic noise and BMI z-scores. We found no associations between railway noise and adiposity. Conclusions: We found suggestions of a positive association between road traffic noise and risk of overweight in 7-years old children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: SLC4A10 is a sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter in exchange for intracellular chloride, expressed in principal and inhibitory neurons as well as in choroid plexus epithelial cells of the brain. Slc4a10 knockout mice have collapsed brain ventricles and display an increased seizure threshold. Heterozygous deletions encompassing SLC4A10 in man have been associated with epilepsy and autism. CASE REPORT: This male is the first child of non-consanguineous Austrian parents. Child movements during pregnancy were experienced as normal, there was no polyhydramnios or breech presentation. Frombirth on he showed severely decreased muscle tone (“floppy infant”) and failure to thrive. Neonatal as well as followup brain ultrasound at the age of 5.5months showed collapsed (“slit”) brain ventricles. Currently, aged 10 months, he has an elongated face with bilateral ptosis, tented mouth and high-arched palate. He has high hyperopia (+8,5/+7 dpt), hearing tests were unremarkable. His passive muscle tone is very low (no head control, no sitting), but he is able to move his limbs against gravity. He sleeps longer andmore frequent than peers, but when awake, he is alert, smiles, babbles and makes good contact. Parents report no seizures. A recent MRI at the age of 10 months shows small ventricles, especially slit anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense variant in SLC4A10, c.2269C > T, p.(Arg757∗) predicting a prematurely truncated protein and loss-of-function. There were no pathogenic variants in genes, or copy number variations affecting chromosomal regions, known to be related to neuromuscular disorders. DISCUSSION: In line with the existing mouse model, we assume that the biallelic mutations in SLC4A10 underly the paucity of cerebrospinal fluid in this individual. How this leads to muscular hypotonia needs further evaluation. Detection of further patients would be of enormous value.

N2  - Background: Transition to parenthood is challenging but for women with a history of recurrent psychiatric disorders becoming a mother has a number of additional issues. Women with a history of mood disorders or psychoses are at increased risk for exacerbation in the vulnerable postpartum period and fear the potential risk of medication during pregnancy for the unborn child as much as they fear a relapse. In these difficult situations women and their families seek advice and support from mental health providers and obstetricians. Methods and results: Based on the treatment of 420 mentally ill women with a desire to have children and pregnancy and prospective documentation of 196 pregnancies over the last 10 years (2006–2016) the authors developed the Bonn concept of peripartum management (BKPM). The plan was designed to reduce the incidence and severity of postpartum relapses in women suffering from psychiatric disorders. Factors to be considered include antenatal and postpartum medication as well as reduction of stress and stimuli, sleep preservation, social support and help from the partner in caring for the baby. Of the 196 women in the BKPM only 4.6 % (n = 9) experienced a severe postpartum relapse with hospitalization. Additionally, the informed consent discussion with patient and partner as part of the peripartum management plan showed positive effects on how women and their families experienced autonomy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. Discussion: Careful planning and monitoring with a structured perinatal management plan can reduce the risk of relapse in the perinatal period and thus support women with a history of mental disorder in the transition to motherhood. Therefore, the management concept employed in Bonn contributes to the major goal of current peripartum psychiatric care in developing effective prevention strategies for women at high risk.

N2  - Dwarfism is a catch all term for patients with acquired genetic mutations leading to short statures [1]. Caesarean section is the most recommended method of delivery in pregnant patients with dwarfism. In this group of patients there is no standard of care for the mode of anaesthesia, i. e. general anaesthesia vs. regional anaesthesia during caesarean section. Acceptable outcomes have been reported by either of these methods, although general anaesthesia has been used more frequently. General anaesthesia has tended to be favoured in the management [2] of these cases due to cardiopulmonary issues and concerns about spinal cord/column syndromes [1]. However, given the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea, atlanto-axial instability, and airway management issues underlying both dwarfism and the pregnant state make regional anaesthesia favoured by some [1, 3]. We report the details of anaesthetic methods and relevant clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with dwarfism who underwent caesarean section in our unit. We reviewed the anaesthetic charts of seven patients with a number of known and unknown genetic mutations leading to dwarfism. These patients underwent caesarean section in our unit from February 2012 to July 2015. Demographic data, mode of anaesthesia, comorbidities and other obstetric parameters were reviewed. All patients were seen by a senior anaesthesiologist with a detailed plan in place. All patients underwent caesarean section. Five successfully received regional anaesthesia (RA), four received the combined spinal and epidural (CSE) technique and one received single shot spinal anaesthesia. Two underwent planned general anaesthetic (GA). Details and patient demographics are listed in the table below. Discussion This case series demonstrates that dose-controlled regional anaesthesia is a safe mode of anaesthesia for patients with dwarfism. A multidisciplinary team of physicians and healthcare professional including the maternal and fetal medicine group were involved in the decision-making and coordination of a cohesive plan for each patient. Pre-operative planning in certain cases where general anaesthesia is required is of paramount importance.

N2  - Background: Little is known about the role of night-waking on the child's behavior, especially in preschool-aged children. The aim was to study with a developmental approach the association between night-waking from age 2 to 5 and behavior at age 5. Method: Analyses were based on the French birth-cohort study EDEN, which recruited 2002 pregnant women between 2003 and 2006. Repeated measures of the child's night-waking were collected at age 2, 3 and 5 through parental questionnaires and were used to computerized night-waking trajectories (PROC TRAJ). Behavior was assessed with the Strength and difficulty questionnaire (SDQ) which provides 5 subscales measuring the child's conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer relation problems, antisocial behavior and hyperactivity/attention problems. Analysis: SDQ's subscales were dichotomized according to the 10th percentile. Multivariate logistic regressions, adjusted on parents socio-economic factors, parental characteristic, child's characteristics and sleep habits, allowed us to study in 1146 children the direct association between night-waking trajectories from 2 to 5 and behavior at age 5. Results: Two night-waking trajectories were identified. The “2 to 5 rare night-waking” (77% of the children) and the “2 to 5 common night-waking”. Children belonging to the “2 to 5 common night-waking trajectory” had a two-fold increased risk to present emotional symptoms at age 5 (OR 2.18 IC95%[1.28-3.71] P = 0.004). A similar tendency was observed with the risk of having conduct problems (OR 1.62 IC95%[1.00-2.64] P = 0.051) and hyperactivity/attention problems (OR 1.59 IC95%[0.99-2.55] P = 0.053). Conclusion: Results suggest a very early onset of the association between night-waking and some aspects of behavior.

N2  - Objective: Cardiovascular diseases remain the primary cause of death in women. Assessment of cardiovascular risk in women is specific and should take into account hormonal factors. Preventive measures must be implemented and diagnosis and therapeutic approaches improved. In order to upgrade women's health, a coordinated healthcare pathway, Heart, arteries and women, was initiated at the Lille University Hospital. The objective was to assess the relevance of the healthcare pathway at two years to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment in women at cardiovascular risk. Design and method: We undertook a retrospective and consecutive observational study based on a cohort of post-menopausal women followed through the healthcare pathway “Heart, arteries and women”, at the Lille University Hospital, between January 1st, 2013 and December 31st, 2015. Clinical presentation, medical management and follow-up were assessed. Results: Of the 201 women included, with a mean age of 62 years, 64 (32%) were at high cardiovascular risk and 136 (68%) at very high risk. Arterial hypertension was present in 188 (94%) and diabetes in 88 (44%). Sixty-one women (30, 3%) had experienced high blood pressure or diabetes during pregnancy. Only eight women had current or previous hormone replacement therapy. Among the 91 women screened for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome by night polygraphy or polysomnography, 66 (73%) were positive. Among the 90 women who had a ischemic stress test, 11 (12%) were positive. Three women were diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease and 16 with a significant renal arterial stenosis. Medical therapies were optimized especially for women with atheroma in which 14.5% to 27% were properly treated (p < 0.05). Coordination between cardiologists and gynaecologists was improved: 20.4% of the gynecologists received conclusive reports versus 12% in the one year evaluation. Conclusions: At two years, our healthcare pathway, “Heart, arteries and women”, allowed optimizing medical therapy and clinical management of women. Coordination between cardiologists and gynaecologists should continue to improve.

N2  - Objective: Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) modulates the autonomic nervous system to restore sympathovagal balance. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of BAT on hypertension in patients with refractory (true resistant) hypertension (RH). Design and method: This academic (independent of industry support) randomized, double-blind, 1:1 parallel-design clinical trial will include 100 patients with RH from six hypertension centers in the Nordic countries. A Barostim Neo® System will be implanted and after 1 month of stabilization patients will be randomized to either BAT for 16 months or continuous pharmacotherapy (BAT off) for 8 months followed by the BAT for 8 months (Figure). Blood and urine samples will be drawn and measures of arterial and cardiac function and structure, and of autonomic function will be performed at randomization, and after 8 and 16 months. Eligible patients will be 18-70 years and have a daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure (ABMP) of 145 mmHg or more, and/or a daytime diastolic ABMP of 95 mmHg or more, after witnessed intake of antihypertensive treatment (including at least 3 antihypertensive drugs, preferably a diuretic), with no changes in medication for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to enrolment. Patients with secondary causes of hypertension, severe renal insufficiency, untreated sleep apnea, pregnancy, type 1 diabetes, alcohol/drug abuse, or psychiatric illnesses, other than sinus rhythm (controlled atrial fibrillation is not a contraindication), uncontrolled systolic heart failure, aortic stenosis, and a cardiovascular event 3 within months before enrolment will be excluded. Results: The primary end point is to test whether BAT reduces 24-hour systolic ABMP at 8 months of follow-up compared to pharmacotherapy. Secondary/tertiary endpoints are the effects of BAT on home and office blood pressure, measures of autonomic function, arterial and cardiac structure and function during followup, and extended long-term follow-up. Two patients have been included in the study so far. An interim analysis will be done after 50 patients. Conclusions: This initiative will increase the understanding of the mechanisms and role of BAT in the treatment of RH.

N2  - Background/Case Studies: Although apheresis platelets contain small vol-umes of red blood cells (RBC), they have been associated with RBC alloim-munization. We report a case of anti-C antibodies identified in an Rh-negative recipient following transfusion of Rh-positive apheresis platelets. Study Design/Methods: Patient's chart and literature were reviewed. Routine blood bank testing, including ABO/Rh type, indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) screen, and direct antiglobulin test (DAT), were performed in gel (Pro-vue; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics; Raritan, NJ). Red blood cell phenotyping was performed in tube using monoclonal blood grouping antisera (Immucor Inc., Norcross, GA). Adsorption/elution studies using R0r and r'r cells were performed in tube to evaluate for anti-G antibodies. Results/Findings: A 71-year-old Caucasian woman with acute-on-chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure was admitted for further evaluation after worsening of her symptoms. She had a past medical history of placement of a biventricu-lar implantable cardioverter defibrillator 5 years prior and a known history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary embolism. The patient was not a candidate for heart transplant, and therefore surgical placement of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) was planned. Blood products were requested for the operation. Pre-operatively, the patient's blood type was group B, Rh-negative and her IAT screen demonstrated a previously identified anti-D. During and after the surgery, the patient was transfused with 4 units of B, Rh-negative packed RBCs, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1 unit of B, Rh-positive apheresis platelets. Her post-operative course was not significant. Eight days following transfusion, a repeat IAT screen was positive with anti-D and anti-C specificities (41 on gel). Transfusion reaction work up was negative, including DAT and laboratory indicators of hemolysis. She was therefore diagnosed with a delayed serologic transfusion reaction. The patient's phenotype was C(-). She had no prior transfusions or pregnancy in the prior 3 months. All 4 RBC units were found to be C(-). The donor of the transfused platelet unit was not available for phenotyping. Anti-C was confirmed after ruling out anti-G. It was concluded that the anti-C was due to primary or secondary alloimmuni-zation against RBCs in the platelet product. At a 3-month follow-up visit, the patient continued to demonstrate anti-D and anti-C antibodies. Conclusion: Although anti-D alloimmunization is a rare but well-known complication of apheresis platelet transfusion, alloimmunization to non-D antigens may also occur.

N2  - Objective Skin-to-skin contact shows benefits in the relationship developed between a mother and her premature infant. In the skin-to-skin session, face-to-face exchanges are impossible in vertical infant positioning. We therefore undertook an observational, prospective, single-center study using kangaroo “supported diagonal flexion” (SDF) positioning. The first aim was to evaluate the safety of kangaroo SDF positioning compared to the usual vertical positioning. The second aim was to evaluate SDF positioning on early communication between the mother and her infant and to improve their well-being. Participants and setting Fifteen mothers and their very premature infants (birth 26 < 32 weeks’ gestation) were assigned to one of the two kangaroo positioning modes, either the current vertical positioning (n = 7) or SDF positioning (n = 8). Design Physiological variables and critical events were recorded before, during, and after ten successive skin-to-skin contact sessions. The first and last sessions were videotaped to allow later behavioral measurements. Mothers’ risk for depression and feelings about the way they experienced communication with their infant were assessed through questionnaires. Results In terms of the infant's physiology, no negative effects were associated with SDF positioning in comparison with the usual vertical positioning. SDF positioning led to fewer disorganized gestures, negative vocalizations, and drowsiness, in favor of more deep sleep. SDF led to more mother–infant eye-to-eye contact as well as maternal vocalizations, smiles, and caressing, although these differences did not reach significance. The score for the risk of postnatal depression decreased significantly between the first and the last session in the SDF group, whereas it did not change in the vertical positioning group. Conclusion These results support the idea that the kangaroo SDF positioning technique is physiologically safe, has obvious immediate benefits on mothers’ infant-directed communicative behaviors, and respects the baby's naturally flexed and asymmetrical tonic neck posture. It is an innovative, inexpensive, easy-to-use technique in daily practice, by all healthcare professionals working in a neonatal intensive care unit. These data suggest that the current kangaroo positioning technique could be improved. More studies are needed to confirm the benefits and safety of the kangaroo SDF positioning in larger groups of preterm infants.

N2  - Background: Statural overgrowth in SOTOS syndrome is well recognised. However excessive growth away from the usual growth trajectory should prompt assessment for other causes of growth acceleration. Case: TE was referred for a growth assessment at 6.8 years as he appeared to have grown more in the previous year. He was 142.9 cm (Ht SDS +4.32), weight 44.4kg (BMI SDS +2.85). He had no formal genetic diagnosis except that he was clearly dysmorphic with global developmental delay and had an 'overgrowth syndrome'. He was delivered at 36 weeks gestation and presented with sepsis at day 23. He suffered from sleep apnoea in the neonatal period which resolved by age 3 years, then obstructive apnoea until his adenoidectomy at age 4 years. Due to his large size and global delay, a genetics opinion was sought at 4 years following investigations which included a normal brain MRI and array CGH. No unifying diagnosis was made apart from an overgrowth dysmorphic syndrome. Further genetic tests were organised. When he was examined at 6.8 years, it was noted that he had large hands and feet, large ears, slightly long palpebral fissures and a pointed chin. He was also hypertrichotic and in puberty Tanner A1P1G2 with bilateral 8ml testes. He had selective eating habits. Investigations: Bone age, pituitary MRI, tumour markers, LHRH stimulation test. Results: Central precocious puberty was confirmed with LH peak of 9 IU/L, FSH 4.2 IU/L. Bone age was 11 years 6 months at a chronological age of 7 years 3 months. Pituitary and brain MRI was normal. Tumour markers were negative. Further genetic testing revealed a de novo loss of function mutation in the NSD1 gene. These results were only available after the diagnosis of precocious puberty. Management: TE was started on regular treatment with GNRH analogue. Conclusion: Growth and puberty data reported in SOTOS have not included an increased incidence of central precocious puberty although advanced bone age and early menarche have not resulted in excessive tall final heights in women. Most adult SOTOS men have final heights within the normal range. Excessive growth should always prompt investigation regardless of the underlying diagnosis.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To further understanding of how women who pursue OC for deferred reproduction think and act relative to reproduction and dating. DESIGN: 2016 anonymous 39-question survey with comparison to our prior OC patient survey completed in 2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2005-15, 1817 women underwent ≥1 OC treatment cycle at our facility; 866 (48%) agreed to post-treatment contact, and our survey was distributed to these patients. RESULTS: There were 224 survey responses (rate: 26%). From 2012 to 2016, the percentage of women that froze at 33-35y increased (13 to 24%) while those 39-41y decreased (39 to 23%); 44% froze between 36-38y consistent with our clinical data also demonstrating a decrease in age at time of OC. 53% underwent OC in the last 2 years. As in 2012, 80% of respondents were Caucasian, and >70% were never married, reported lack of partner as the no. 1 reason for not yet having children and wished they had undergone OC earlier. The majority now feel the ideal age for egg freezing is 29-34y, with only 16% choosing >35y and <1% choosing >38y. Of note, more (25 vs. 16%) were in a relationship at time of OC with 1/2stating the relationship was <1y. 77% reported difficulty finding someone with whom to co-parent at the time of OC. >80% currently report a desire to have children while <20% remain unsure as to whether they definitely want children in the future. Cost was the greatest obstacle to pursuing OC. 1/3 received financial support, mostly from family, with parents being the most common source. After OC, 30% admitted an attitude change toward parenting, mostly in a positive way (i.e. made it a priority or increased openness to alternative family-creating options). >60% also felt lessening of biological-clock pressure when dating and were more open to using donor sperm if still lacking a suitable partner by age 43 (average; range 35-50y). 1/4 said OC changed their dating habits: feeling more relaxed, focused, less desperate and with more time to find the right partner. >60% admitted discussing OC while dating and 90% with family/friends. They were most often met with positive/ supportive reception. 96% would recommend OC to another. After undergoing OC, 22% got pregnant or had children without resorting to their frozen eggs (2/3 naturally; 1/3 ART; 4% adoption). 13% of respondents thawed eggs resulting in a 32% live birth rate. Of those not yet thawing, 1/2 cited lacking a suitable co-parent as the obstacle; 90% reported future intent to thaw. CONCLUSIONS: Women are pursuing OC at younger ages, with the primary indication being lack of a suitable co-parenting partner; the latter was also the most common reason cited for not returning to use eggs sooner. Cost was prohibitive for many, with some relying on family finances. Most reported OC as a positive experience, improving views of parenting, inciting healthier dating practices, enhancing hope for future family and expanding acceptable options for achieving that goal.

N2  - Background: Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a biomarker of airway inflammation. Elevated FeNO measured in high-risk populations during early childhood is associated with school age asthma. It is unknown if assessment of FeNO shortly after birth is associated with asthma. Aim: We aimed to identify if postnatal, premorbid assessment of FeNO prior to viral infections is associated with asthma diagnosis at school age. Methods: In a population-based birth cohort, FeNO was measured in healthy term infants aged 5 weeks during quiet tidal breathing in unsedated sleep. At the follow-up with 6 years, we assessed the asthma and atopy diagnoses and a skin prick test (SPT) was performed. Associations between FeNO and diagnosis of asthma, atopy and positive (SPT) were calculated using regression analysis. Results: From 234 enrolled infants, 208 (89%) were followed-up until 6 years. FeNO at infancy was not associated with asthma (n=27), atopy (n=62) or positive SPT (n=26) at the age of 6 years. Per 1 ppb increase, the odds ratio (95% CI) for asthma was 0.96 (0.89-1.05), atopy 0.99 (0.94-1.05) and positive SPT 0.95 (0.88-1.03). Associations were not modified by assessed risk factors (sex, parental atopy, parental asthma and smoking during pregnancy). Conclusions: In this cohort of unselected healthy infants, FeNO from newborns was not associated with diagnoses of asthma or atopy at school age. We speculate that alterations in nitric oxide metabolism may occur during infancy, under conditions that should be further investigated.

N2  - Introduction: Nasal high flow (NHF) is increasingly used as a form of respiratory support in neonates, although the physiological mechanisms of this therapy remain unclear. Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate ventilatory changes during NHF therapy in healthy newborns. Methods: Calibrated respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) was conducted on 17 (10M/7F) neonates with a mean gestation age 39.4 (SD 1.2) weeks and mean birth weight of 3200 (SD 371.6) g. NHF at 8 L/min via a nasal cannula (AIRVO2™, Optiflow™, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, NZ) and control were applied in a randomized order during sleep. Sleep was recorded by electroencephalography and video. Gas exchange was assessed by oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2 ). Data were analyzed using paired t-test. Results: A variable ventilatory response was observed during NHF without change in TcCO2 (36.39 vs. 36.66 mmHg, p=0.79) or SpO2 (98.13 vs. 98.63%, p=0.41). There was no significant change in tidal volume (0.0113 vs. 0.0124 L, p=0.21) or respiratory rate (46.6 vs. 50.2 min , p=0.48) however, NHF produced a significant reduction in minute ventilation (MV), 0.664 (SD 0.207) to 0.506 (SD 0.145) L/min (p=0.0006) Conclusion: NHF (8L/min) produced a variable ventilatory response in neonates with a significant reduction in MV (24%) without evidence of change in blood gases. The findings may be explained by reduction of dead space ventilation during NHF.

N2  - Objective: Since the development of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), various studies have shown to be a very useful method in cardiovascular risk assessment and remains the only method of diagnosing a non- dipping blood pressure profile. It has been suggested that all forms of secondary hypertension, including renal / renovascular, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid excess, phaeochromocytoma and toxaemia in pregnancy are associated with blunted, eliminated or reversed nocturnal blood pressure fall. Design and method: We analysed 1621 patients referred to the Clinic of Endocrinology to be examined for secondary etiology of hypertension. ABPM revealed 268 subjects with white coat hypertension (WCH) so we didn't screened them for secondary hypertension. Meditech ABPM 05 device was used with appropriate cuff. We did all necessary analysis and tests in 1353 patients to see the aetiology of hypertension. The mean age was 42.6+/-10.8 years. There were 820 women and 533 men. Mean body mass index was 27 +/-8 kg/m2. Results: Screening for secondary hypertension revealed 68 patients with renovascular disease, 25 patients with all forms of hyperaldosteronism, 18 patients with pheochromocytoma including multiple endocrine neoplasia, 22 patients with glucocorticoid excess, 92 patients with obstructive sleep apnea. ABPM showed blunted or eliminated circadian blood pressure rhythm in 60 patients with renovascular disease or renal artery stenosis, 22 patients with all forms of hyperaldosteronism, 9 patients with pheochromocytoma including multiple endocrine neoplasia, 18 patients with glucocorticoid excess, every one of 92 patients with obstructive sleep apnea had blunted, eliminated or reversed nocturnal blood pressure fall. Conclusions: Results of our study indicate that nocturnal BP decrease was blunted or absent in a majority of patients with adrenal cause of hypertension. Nocturnal BP fall measured by ABPM may be very sensitive predictor of cardiovascular outcome and good method for screening for secondary hypertension.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Currently available options for family planning are often cumbersome and imprecise. Moreover, women's demand for insights into their cycles has increased due to older age at pregnancy and the need for better planning of life and career. The goal of the presented research project was to find out if physiological data measured at the wrist allows for natural family planning. DESIGN: Observational study. The study received approval by the Ethical Commission of the Canton of Zurich. 41 healthy women between 20 and 40 were recruited and kept anonymous throughout the study. Once trained about the proceedings of the study, subjects were able to conduct all measurements at home. 180 menstrual cycles were documented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a collaboration of scientists from the field of gynecology, physiology, sensor technology, and data science, a new solution for family planning was developed. It consists of a wrist worn sensor bracelet and intelligent algorithms. The bracelet contains various sensors which measure cardiovascular, movement, thermal, skin, and sleep parameters during sleep at night. The smart sensor bracelet was tested in a trial conducated by University Hospital Zurich and referenced with hormonal measurements. Daily surveys were filled out by the subjects to document confounding parameters. RESULTS: In a first step, skin temperature and pulse rate readings were analyzed. Both show significant differences between follicular and luteal phase. Minimum average resting pulse rate occurs in the follicular phase with 55.5 beats per minute and maximum resting pulse rate in the luteal phase with 59.3 beats per minute. Wrist skin temperature follows the same pattern with 34.3 degrees Celsius respectively 34.7 degrees Celsius. Alcohol intake in the evening decreased skin temperature non-significantly and increased pulse rate readings throughout the night significantly. Further confounding parameters and physiological parameters like breathing rate and sleep will be analyzed soon. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that wrist-based measurements allow for measuring parameters which correlate with the changes throughout the menstrual cycle. Compensating confounding parameters will be key for achieving precise information about the status of the menstrual cycle. Further analysis of the measured parameters will be conducted.

N2  - Background: The use of prone sleeping in the 1980s for infants resulted in a high incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). As a result of changing the recommendations to supine sleeping in the early 1990s the incidence dramatically declined. Aims and objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the adherence to national advice given to reduce the risk of SIDS. Methods: One thousand families with infants under one year of age registered at 28 child health care centres in western Sweden were approached and 753 completed the questionnaire (response rate 75.3%). Results: Bed sharing was practiced among 37.2% in the first three months and among 28.8% at 6 months. Bed sharing during the first six months was more common if the infant was breastfed (p<0.01), never used a pacifier (p<0.01) or if the infant didn't use a pacifier last sleep (p<0.01). In the first three months 0.9% slept prone and 5.1% at age three to five months. At six months this proportion was 9.1%. Prone sleeping during the first year was more common if the infant never used a pacifier (p<0.01). Nicotine was used during pregnancy by 3.5% of mothers and by 4.9% at the time for answering the questionnaire. In the first three months 5.5% slept in another room than the parental bedroom, 83.1% were breastfeeding and 15.9% never used a pacifier. Conclusion: The adherence to given advice were generally good. However there is potential to decrease the SIDS incidence further by reducing the prevalence of smoking and prone sleeping.

N2  - Background: Domestic violence during pregnancy is not only a severe public health issue that jeopardizes maternal and foetal health but also violates human rights. The aim was to explore the prevalence and incidence of domestic violence among pregnant women, in the southwestern region of Scania in Sweden, and their experience of a history of violence. In addition, to explore the association between domestic violence during pregnancy and possible risk factors. Methods: This is a longitudinal cohort-study including pregnant women ≥18 years of age, registered at antenatal care when pregnant. A cohort of 1939 pregnant women answered Questionnaire I (QI) in gestational week 13 (mean 12.8 week, SD 5.11). Response rate of Questionnaire II (QII) in gestation week 34 (mean 33.9 week, SD 2.2) was 78.8 % (n = 1527). Statistical analysis was descriptive statistics, logistic regression and multiple regression with Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results: Both QI and QII were completed by 77.8 % (n = 1509) of the women and 44.3 % (n = 668) reported a lifetime experience of abuse irrespective of type, severity or perpetrator. Also, 5.1 % (n = 77) reported some experience of abuse past year. Prevalence of domestic violence during pregnancy was 2.0 % (n = 29) and the incidence was 7.3 new cases per 1000 women. The strongest risk factor for domestic violence, during early and late pregnancy, was history of violence whereby all women who disclosed exposure had also reported history of violence (p < 0.001). To be single/living apart gave 8.4 times more risk associated with domestic violence during pregnancy (AOR 8.4; 95 % CI: 2.2-32.6). Having several symptoms of depression and lack of sleep gave 3.8 times more risk respectively (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI: 1.1-13.6) and (AOR 3.8; 95 % CI 1.1-12.9). Conclusions: Pregnant women with a history of violence as well as being single/living apart and/or having several symptoms of depression during pregnancy should be alerts for clinical working midwives and obstetricians. Further, this is important knowledge for health care providers to develop or upgrade guidelines and plans of action for pregnant women exposed to violence.

N2  - Abnormalities of sleep and biological rhythms have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, less is known about the influence of biological rhythm disruptions across the perinatal period on postpartum depression (PPD). The objective of this study was to prospectively evaluate the relationship between subjective changes in both sleep and biological rhythms and worsening of depressive symptoms from pregnancy to the postpartum period in women with and without mood disorders. Eighty-three participants (38 euthymic women with a history of a mood disorder and 45 healthy controls) were studied. Participants completed subjective assessments of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), biological rhythm disturbances (Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry), and depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) prospectively at two time points: third trimester of pregnancy and at 6–12 weeks postpartum. Multivariate regression analyses showed that changes in biological rhythms across the perinatal period predicted worsening of depressive symptoms in both groups. Moreover, women with a history of a mood disorder showed higher levels of sleep and biological rhythm disruption during both pregnancy and the postpartum period. These findings suggest that disruptions in biological rhythms during the perinatal period increase the risk for postpartum mood worsening in healthy pregnant as well as in pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

N2  - Background and aims: Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) is characterized by impaired ventilation during sleep resulting in intermittent hypoxia. Evidence concerning association between SDB and maternal and neonatal outcome remains conflicting.We evaluated self-reported parameters of sleep quality in early pregnancy: daily amount of sleep (AOS), number of days with snoring per week (SD) number of days with insufficient amount of sleep per month (IAS) as predictors of hyperglycemia and perinatal complications in obese pregnant women. Materials and methods: 905 participants of DALI study that aimed at prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosed following IADPSG/WHO 2013 criteria. Inclusion criteria involved singleton viable pregnancy, gestational age (GA) below 20 weeks,BMI >=29.0 kg/m2 and no history of diabetes. Statistical analysis: logistic regression and ROC analysis with sleep quality parameters as predictors and GDM and perinatal complications as dependent variables. Results: Characteristic of the study group at entry:maternal age: 31.5±5.4 years; GA: 15.3±2.3 weeks; BMI: 34.5±4.0 kg/m2; AOS: 7.8±1.4 hours; IAS: 10.6±9.6 days/month; SD: 1.7±2.5 days/week; NC: 36.5±2.2 cm; multiparity: 62.7%, shift work: 20.9%, nonsmokers: 52.9%. Perinatal outcomes: chronic hypertension:12.6%, preeclampsia: 2.9%, gestational hypertension (PIH): 11.1%, GDM at entry (early-onset GDM/e-GDM): 25.0%, GDM in late pregnancy: 26.7%, premature delivery: 5.7%, congenital malformations: 4.4%. Independent predictors for snoring were NC: OR 1.17 (1.11-1.25) and BMI: OR 1.06 (1.03-1.09). Snoring was associated with a risk of e-GDM: OR 1.52 (1.12-2.1). SD>3 days was independently associated with a risk of PIH: OR 1.13 (1.02-1.25). In women without e-GDM, shift work predicted fetal malformations: OR 2.3 (1.04-5.21). Conclusion: Self-reported information concerning snoring in early pregnancy can be useful in assessment of fetomaternal risk in obese pregnant women.

N2  - The influence of sleep restriction (SR) during pregnancy on blood pressure and renal function among female adult offspring was investigated. Pregnant Wistar rats were distributed into control and SR groups. The SR was performed between the 14th and 20th days of pregnancy (multiple platforms method for 20 h/day). At 2 months of age, half of the offspring from both groups were subjected to an ovariectomy (ovx), and the other half underwent sham surgery. The groups were as follows: control sham (Csham), control ovx (Covx), SR sham (SRsham), and SR ovx (SRovx). Renal function markers and systolic blood pressure (BPi, indirect method) were evaluated at 4, 6, and 8 months. Subsequently, the rats were euthanized, kidneys were removed, and processed for morphological analyses of glomerular area (GA), number of glomeruli per mm3 (NG), and kidney mass (KM). Increased BPi was observed in the Covx, SRsham, and SRovx groups compared to Csham at all ages. Increased plasma creatinine concentration and decreased creatinine clearance were observed in the SRsham and SRovx groups compared to the Csham and Covx groups. The SRovx group showed higher BPi and reduced creatinine clearance compared to all other groups. The SRovx group showed reduced values of GA and KM, as well as increased NG, macrophage infiltration, collagen deposit, and ACE1 expression at the renal cortex. Therefore, SR during pregnancy might be an additional risk factor for developing renal dysfunction and increasing BP in female adult offspring. The absence of female hormones exacerbates the changes caused by SR.

N2  - Many studies have shown that shorter sleep duration in childhood is associated with higher body mass index (BMI), and have proposed that it is due to an effect of sleep on adiposity. There is little evidence about the association of sleep with fat-free mass. This study examined the association between child's sleep duration at age 3 years and fat and fat-free mass at 4 years of age in a prospective cohort study of 302 boys and 285 girls. Study participants were taking part in the Southampton Women's Survey, a longitudinal study of mothers and children from preconception onwards. Total sleep duration at age 3 years was derived from parental report of night sleep and nap duration. Body composition was assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at 4 years. Mean total sleep duration was 11.5 hours. In linear regression analyses, adjusted for potentially confounding factors (maternal educational attainment, prepregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, child's gestational age at birth, age at DXA, sex, age last breastfed, dietary quality at 3 years, TV watching and hours actively on the move and parental social class), shorter sleep in hours was associated with higher BMI (kg/m2) [β: −0.2340, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.373 to −0.096], a greater fat mass index (kg) (β: −0.1182, 95% CI: −0.218 to −0.018) and a greater fat-free mass index (kg) (β: −0.100, 95% CI: −0.185 to −0.015). Previous research suggested that the association between shorter sleep and higher body mass index is due to an effect on adiposity. Our findings are novel, suggesting that the relationship between sleep and BMI is also determined by an effect on muscle.

N2  - Objective It is unclear whether objectively measured maternal sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) leads to poor fetal outcomes. In this study, we prospectively assessed whether polysomnography-based diagnosis of SDB in the third trimester is associated with the delivery of small for gestational age (SGA) infants. Study design Participants were recruited from a multicentre pregnancy cohort study. Eligible participants were evaluated for SDB based on symptoms (snoring and/or witnessed apnoeas assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire) and in-home complete polysomnography in the third trimester. SGA was defined as <10th centile using customised birthweight centiles adjusted for maternal parity, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, gestational age and infant sex. Results Of the 234 pregnant participants who completed a sleep study, 82% were Caucasian, with mean (SD) age of 31 (4.3) years and a prepregnancy BMI of 23 (4) kg/m2. The delivery of SGA infants occurred in 27 (12%) of the study participants. The symptoms of SDB had poor overall sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing SDB identified by polysomnography. Symptoms of SDB in the third trimester demonstrated a potential association with delivering an SGA infant, however this did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.36 (95% CI 0.85 to 6.54, p=0.10)). However, the odds of delivering an SGA infant were significantly increased with polysomnography-based diagnosis of maternal SDB (using apnoea-hypopnoea index cut-off of 10, OR 2.65 (95% CI 1.15 to 6.10, p=0.02)). Conclusions Objectively measured SDB in the third trimester is significantly associated with the delivery of SGA infants.

N2  - Rhythmic incremental growth lines and the presence of melatonin receptors were discovered in tooth enamel, suggesting possible role of circadian rhythm. We therefore hypothesized that circadian rhythm may regulate enamel formation through melatonin receptors. To test this hypothesis, we examined expression of melatonin receptors (MTs) and amelogenin (AMELX), a maker of enamel formation, during tooth germ development in mouse. Using qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, we found that mRNA and protein levels of both MTs and AMELX in normal mandibular first molar tooth germs increased gradually after birth, peaked at 3 or 4 day postnatal, and then decreased. Expression of MTs and AMELX by immunocytochemistry was significantly delayed in neonatal mice raised in all-dark or all-light environment as well as the enamel development. Furthermore, development of tooth enamel was also delayed showing significant immature histology in those animals, especially for newborn mice raised in all daylight condition. Interestingly, disruption in circadian rhythm in pregnant mice also resulted in delayed enamel development in their babies. Treatment with melatonin receptor antagonist 4P-PDOT in pregnant mice caused underexpression of MTs and AMELX associated with long-lasting deficiency in baby enamel tissue. Electromicroscopic evidence demonstrated increased necrosis and poor enamel mineralization in ameloblasts. The above results suggest that circadian rhythm is important for normal enamel development at both pre- and postnatal stages. Melatonin receptors were partly responsible for the regulation.

N2  - The most recent Cochrane reviews on oral antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy conclude that no substantial benefits for the mother or fetus are demonstrated so far. Whether this applies for a high-risk and diabetic pregnancy is doubtful. The aim of this short review is an introduction to the field of ambulatory blood pressure measurements in pregnancy and in particular in women with type 1 diabetes. Diabetic pregnancy is complicated with a 50% risk of hypertension/preeclampsia. In the nonpregnant, diabetic women minute increases in blood pressure as well as in albuminuria are forerunners for incipient and overt nephropathy. Medication is essential and can conserve renal function, modifying the risk of renal insufficiency. During pregnancy, renal insufficiency in women with diabetes leads to termination of pregnancy. Therefore, detection of minute changes based on reliable measurements in this high-risk population is invaluable to protect the mother’s kidney function and, if possible, prolong pregnancy for the benefit of the fetus. Estimates of risk by blood pressure evaluation in these women are influenced by pregnancy per se and diabetes vasculopathy. Several factors have to be considered as few monitors are validated for use in pregnancy and not many of the different methodologies have undergone thorough investigation. The use of absolute values of blood pressure have the advantage that fewer assumptions are necessary on how blood pressure behaves due to modes of evaluation and biological rhythm. Monitors should be chosen with care considering the clinical setting, timing, and population, which influences the outcome, thus, the monitors ought to be validated for the specific condition they are applied for. The strategy for the studies used for safe conclusions in this brief review was chosen with priority of the papers with the best, validated methodology on BP measurements, which is by no way guaranteed in numerous recent publications. Inherent characteristics of the measurements to be considered are reproducibility, consistency, precision, and trend over scale of measurement. Studies on these issues suggest that consistency and precision depend on which monitor is used. During pregnancy, the reproducibility and specificity depend on the timing and whether measurements are performed repeatedly. Over- and underestimations of blood pressure are typical for 24-h monitoring in high- as well as low risk pregnancies. Preeclampsia is associated with urinary albumin excretion rate, reduced night/day ratio, and elevated diurnal blood pressure from first trimester and onwards. However, due to blunting of the diurnal variation, the night/day rhythm provides no good prediction of preeclampsia. Diurnal measurement is a valuable estimate of blood pressure in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.

N2  - Newer generation antidepressant drugs (ADs) are widely used as the first line of treatment for major depressive disorders and are considered to be safer than tricyclic agents. In this critical review, we evaluated the literature on adverse events, tolerability and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, bupropion, mirtazapine, trazodone, agomelatine, vilazodone, levomilnacipran and vortioxetine. Several side effects are transient and may disappear after a few weeks following treatment initiation, but potentially serious adverse events may persist or ensue later. They encompass gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, gastric bleeding, dyspepsia), hepatotoxicity, weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, cardiovascular disturbances (heart rate, QT interval prolongation, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension), genitourinary symptoms (urinary retention, incontinence), sexual dysfunction, hyponatremia, osteoporosis and risk of fractures, bleeding, central nervous system disturbances (lowering of seizure threshold, extrapyramidal side effects, cognitive disturbances), sweating, sleep disturbances, affective disturbances (apathy, switches, paradoxical effects), ophthalmic manifestations (glaucoma, cataract) and hyperprolactinemia. At times, such adverse events may persist after drug discontinuation, yielding iatrogenic comorbidity. Other areas of concern involve suicidality, safety in overdose, discontinuation syndromes, risks during pregnancy and breast feeding, as well as risk of malignancies. Thus, the rational selection of ADs should consider the potential benefits and risks, likelihood of responsiveness to the treatment option and vulnerability to adverse events. The findings of this review should alert the physician to carefully review the appropriateness of AD prescription on an individual basis and to consider alternative treatments if available.

N2  - Introduction: It is well recognized that skeletal muscle exercises contributes to increase blood flow in trained muscles.[1] Internal pudendal artery (IPA) is one of the main arteries irrigating the pelvic floor muscles (PFM). Its assessment with color Doppler ultrasound has been used for the investigation of pudendal neuralgia but no study has yet tested the repeatability of IPA blood flow in adult healthy women. Objective: The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the test-retest reliability of the IPA blood flow measurements at rest and after repeated PFM contractions using color Doppler ultrasound in women. Methods: Heathy adult women participated in this cohort study. Exclusion criterion comprised pregnancy and pathology or medication likely to interfere with the stability of blood flow measurements. One observer performed the two repeated measurements sessions of the IPA blood flow (T1 and T2) at the same time of day (within 2 h apart) and the same phase of the women's menstrual cycle to control for the effects of hormonal and circadian rhythm on blood flow. Furthermore, participants were asked to not perform PFM training between T1 and T2 to control for changes in vascular measurements. Participants were asked to rest in the prone position for 15 min to ensure standardized conditions. Then, using a clinical ultrasound system (Voluson E8, GE Healthcare), the observer placed a 2-7 MHz curved-array probe on the participant's right gluteal area in a longitudinal plane according to Kovac's procedure.[2] IPA blood flow measurements were taken three times at rest and three times after a standardized PFM contractions protocol (5 10-s contractions followed by 10 1-s contractions). Each time, peak systolic velocity (PSV), timeaveraged maximum velocity (TAMX), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) were collected using the pulsed Doppler mode. Test-retest reliability of IPA blood flow measurements at rest and after PFM contraction was assessed using intraclass correlation (ICC), paired t-test and Bland-Altman plots. Results: A total of 20 women aged 22 to 53 years old (33.6 ± 9.9 years old) were recruited. Eleven were nulliparas, 9 multiparas; 18 women were pre-menopausal, 2 women were post-menopausal; 13 were taking hormonal contraception and 1 was taking systemic hormonal therapy. 17/20 measures of the dataset were adequately visualized for the analysis. At rest: There was no significant difference between T1 and T2 for all measurements (Table 1). Based on the ICC results, PSV and EDV measurements showed excellent reliability while TAMX, IP and IR showed fair to good reliability (Table 1). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated minimal bias with the mean difference close to zero (Table 1). The 95 % limits of agreement range was narrow for PSV at rest, indicating a high consistency between both tests (Table 1). After PFM contractions: There was no significant difference between T1 and T2 for all measurements (Table 2). Based on the ICC results, PSV and TAMX showed excellent reliability while EDV, IP, IR showed fair to good reliability (Table 2). Bland-Altman plots demonstrate minimal bias with the mean difference close to zero (Table 2). The 95 % limits of agreement range were also narrow for PSV after PFM contractions, but slightly higher than at rest. This result indicates higher variability, suggestive of a higher difficulty level in measuring this condition (after PFM contraction) (Table 2). Other parameters: For TAMX, EDV, IP and IR measurements, the limits of agreement on Bland-Altman plots were wide for both conditions considering the mean values, suggesting a weak consistency between T1 and T2 (Table 1 and 2). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PSV measurements of the IPA blood flow are reliable at rest and after PFM contractions. The use of color Doppler ultrasound is promising to evaluate the vascular changes following PFM training in women with lower or challenged vascularity such as atrophic women. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurological disorder with symptoms related to high intracranial pressure where the underlying causes are not fully known. The common clinical presentation is headache in combination with visual disturbances due to papilledema. IIH mainly affects overweight women of childbearing age. Although incompletely understood, it is thought that hormonal disturbances and exposure to medications such as tetracyclines might be associated with an increased risk of IIH. An IIH diagnosis is not always accurate and patient characteristics are incompletely described. Objectives: To identify comorbid diseases preceding correct diagnosis of IIH by review of medical records. Methods: Patients with IIH in Stockholm county between 2006 and 2013 were identified through the Patient Register using ICD 10 code G93.2 (n=210). Medical records were available for 207 individuals and information on clinical characteristics and treatments one year preceding diagnosis was collected. Each of the diagnoses was determined as IIH or non- IIH based on the modified Dandy diagnostic criteria for IIH.1 1. Friedman DI and Jacobson DM. Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1492-5. Results: In total, 112 (54%) patients fulfilled all the criteria for IIH and 23 (11%) were regarded as probable IIH. Female to male ratio was 6.1:1. Over 90 % of patients with definite or probable IIH with available data (103) were overweight. 28 (21%) of the patients had received a diagnosis of an infection (respiratory infections 10 (7%) and gastrointestinal infections 4 (3%)) prior to their IIH diagnosis, and 34 (25%) had a diagnosis of a hormonal disorder including diabetes 9 (7%) and thyroid disorders 10 (7%), or related to sex hormone changes 16 (12%). Over 20% of men but none of the women with IIH had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea prior to their IIH diagnosis. Conclusions: Prior to a correct IIH diagnosis, a large proportion of patients are exposed to infections, hormonal disorders and obstructive sleep apnea amongst men. This information can be useful in aiding an accurate diagnosis of IIH.

N2  - Clinical findings during the postpartum period include headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, fluctuation in conscious, and visual complaints (blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, visual field defects, and cortical blindness). A 31 years old woman was pregnant at 37th gestational week and evaluated for her findings of headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure, tendency to sleep and hypertension. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was found to be consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as well as venous sinus thrombosis. In conclusion, since their treatment are distinct, possibility of presence of both clinical diagnoses should be kept in mind in the case of headache and/or focal deficits and seizure occurring during the post-partum period.

N2  - Objective: We aimed to determine whether in utero exposure to smoking may influence the activity and dynamics of cardiac autonomic control in preterm infants. We hypothesized that cardiac autonomic control is altered in preterm infants exposed prenatally to smoking and that these effects may vary as a function of the sleep state. Methods: We studied healthy, preterm neonates born to mothers who had smoked throughout pregnancy but not since birth (n = 16). In utero-exposed neonates were matched with control preterm neonates born to non-smoking mothers (n = 18). Cardiac autonomic control was monitored as a function of the sleep state by assessing heart rate variability with both linear and non-linear methods. Results: Preterm neonates with in utero exposure to smoking displayed alterations (relative to control neonates) in short-term cardiac autonomic control in all sleep states. These alterations included low vagal activity, elevated sympathetic activity, and low complexity and adaptability in heart rate control dynamics. Conclusions: Our results constitute direct evidence that cardiac autonomic activity and control are altered in sleeping preterm infants exposed to smoking in utero. Significance: These alterations may place the affected infants at a higher risk of neurological and cardiovascular complications, which could conceivably persist throughout childhood and adulthood.

N2  - Introduction: Up to 43.9 % of women in their 20s and 30s void at least once a night whereas 18.0 % void twice or more.[1] In 2002, the International Continence Society defined nocturia as the complaint of interruption of sleep one or more times because of the need to void.[2] There have been recent suggestions that the definition of nocturia should be changed to include those who rise twice or more as the level of bother for those who rise only once is reported to be less. The ICS definition also does not include a measure of bother and may therefore include individuals who do not consider their nocturia to be bothersome, although this should be the threshold for investigation and treatment to prevent stigmatising 'normal' symptoms. Intuitively, increasing episodes of sleep interruption to void should cause more bother, however, the point at which the bother becomes significant needs to be defined. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether the level of bother suffered by women varies depending on the number of times they void at night. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of consecutive women complaining of symptoms of an overactive bladder (OAB) or nocturia between April 2011 and June 2015. Women who were over the age of 18 and English literate were eligible to participate. Women who suffered recurrent urinary tract infections, were pregnant, puerperal or lactating were excluded. All women completed a 3 day bladder diary including a validated urgency scale (PPIUS) and validated quality of life scale (King's Health Questionnaire). They subsequently underwent physical examination, urinalysis, uroflowmetry, cystourethrography and assessment of post-void residual. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS (Version 22.0). Results: 606 women who described OAB or nocturia symptoms were recruited. Table 1 analyses the characteristics of the women according to number of voids per night. Women who void once per night have a significantly greater age, BMI, maximumPPIUS and total KHQ score compared to those with OAB who do not void at night (Table 1). Those who rose twice or more had significantly greater age, BMI, maximumPPIUS, incidence of detrusor overactivity and leakage secondary to DO during urodynamics compared to those who did not rise at all. When looking at the individual KHQ question domains, despite an increased trend in the domain scores, (Fig. 1) only one domain out of nine, lifestyle modification, scored significantly greater bother between no nocturia and waking once (Table 2). All nine KHQ domain scores however, were significantly worse in the group who rose twice or more compared to those who did not rise at all. Comparing those who void twice or more per night and those who void just once, it can be seen that the former group were older and more likely to void due to DO during the urodynamics. When looking at the KHQ, six of the nine symptom domains scored significantly worse. Conclusions: Our study suggests that when compared to those with OAB who do not wake to void, patient bother is significantly raised in all domains including sleep and energy when a woman rises to void twice or more at night but this is not the case when she wakes to void only once. These data support consideration of a change in the definition to consider women who wake twice or more; or suffer significant bother from night time voids. (Table Presented).

N2  - Yoga is a mind-body practice that encompasses a system of postures (asana), deep breathing (pranayama), and meditation. Over 36 million Americans practice yoga of which the majority are reproductive-aged women. Literature to support this practice is limited, albeit on the rise. A prenatal yoga practice has been shown to benefit women who suffer from anxiety, depression, stress, low back pain, and sleep disturbances. A small number of studies have been performed in high-risk pregnancies that also demonstrate an improvement in outcomes. The safety of performing yoga for the first time in pregnancy and fetal tolerance has been demonstrated.

N2  - Background: In Cameroon, malaria continues to be endemic and the first major cause of morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable groups - children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, people living with HIV/AIDS and the poor. The use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs) is one of the recommended measures to prevent malaria. The present study was aimed at accessing the acceptability and effective use of LLINs on the prevalence of malaria in PMI Nkwen, Bambui and its environs. Methods: Hospital-based diagnosis consisted of 476 blood samples that were screened using the rapid diagnostic kits to determine the prevalence of malaria among users and non-users of LLINs. A structured questionnaire was also administered to pregnant women and children less than 5 years of age (476 hospital-based and 350 from the community) which consisted of demographic information, availability, accessibility affordability, acceptability, effective use and problems encountered with the use of LLINs. Results: Result obtained showed that out of the 476 hospital-based patients, 29 tested positive for malaria giving an overall prevalence of 6.09 %. Equally, results of the questionnaire showed that 743 (89.9 %) of the respondents owned LLINs with up to 649 (87.3 %) having been given to them free-of-charge, and that 578 (77.8 %) were using their LLINs to sleep, even though 18.2 % of the respondents used their LLINs for other purposes, such as fishing, nursing seeds and footfall nets. Malaria was minimal among users of LLINs than non-users and the results were significant at P ≤ 0.05. Also 71.9 % of the respondents said that their nets were in good condition while 52.2 % of them said the major problem with the usage of LLINs was heat and the feeling of suffocation. Conclusion: These results indicate that LLINs have significantly reduced the prevalence of malaria among the studied population, and so the government should not relent its efforts in the distribution of these nets especially to the vulnerable groups in order eliminate malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. Utilization of LLINs needs to be encouraged to match ownership, while free distribution of ITNs to vulnerable groups needs to be continuous and consistent.

N2  - Alterations to the supply of oxygen during early life presents a profound stressor to physiological systems with aberrant remodeling that is often long-lasting. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is a feature of apnea of prematurity, chronic lung disease, and sleep apnea. CIH affects respiratory control but there is a dearth of information concerning the effects of CIH on respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm-the major pump muscle of breathing. We investigated the effects of exposure to gestational CIH (gCIH) and postnatal CIH (pCIH) on diaphragm muscle function in male and female rats. CIH consisted of exposure in environmental chambers to 90 s of hypoxia reaching 5% O2 at nadir, once every 5 min, 8 h a day. Exposure to gCIH started within 24 h of identification of a copulation plug and continued until day 20 of gestation; animals were studied on postnatal day 22 or 42. For pCIH, pups were born in normoxia and within 24 h of delivery were exposed with dams to CIH for 3 weeks; animals were studied on postnatal day 22 or 42. Sham groups were exposed to normoxia in parallel. Following gas exposures, diaphragm muscle contractile, and endurance properties were examined ex vivo. Neither gCIH nor pCIH exposure had effects on diaphragm muscle force-generating capacity or endurance in either sex. Similarly, early life exposure to CIH did not affect muscle tolerance of severe hypoxic stress determined ex vivo. The findings contrast with our recent observation of upper airway dilator muscle weakness following exposure to pCIH. Thus, the present study suggests a relative resilience to hypoxic stress in diaphragm muscle. Co-ordinated activity of thoracic pump and upper airway dilator muscles is required for optimal control of upper airway caliber. A mismatch in the force-generating capacity of the complementary muscle groups could have adverse consequences for the control of airway patency and respiratory homeostasis.

N2  - Sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy. Insomnia is a frequent sleep disturbance experienced by pregnant women which can be primary or due to co-morbid conditions. The differential diagnosis of insomnia in pregnancy includes anxiety disorders, mood disorders, breathing related sleep disorders and restless legs syndrome. Early interventions to treat the sleep disturbance are recommended to avoid adverse pregnancy outcomes. Management strategies include improving sleep hygiene, behavioral therapies, and pharmacotherapy. The risks of pharmacotherapy must be weighed against their benefits due to the possible risk of teratogenicity associated with some medications. Methods: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar employing a combination of key words: pregnancy, sleep disturbances, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Sleep disorders and insomnia. We included original studies, review articles, meta-analysis and systematic reviews in our search prioritizing articles from the last 10-15 years. Articles older than 15 years were only included if their findings had not been superseded by more recent data. Further selection of articles was done from bibliographies and references of selected articles. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances in pregnancy are common and cause considerable morbidity. Management includes a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments carefully weighing the risks and benefits of each for the expectant mother and fetus.

N2  - The perinatal period introduces a myriad of changes. One important but often overlooked change is an increased reporting of sleep disturbance. Although casually regarded as a consequence of pregnancy or postpartum, there is emerging evidence implicating significant sleep disturbance, characterized by insomnia symptoms and/or poor sleep quality, with adverse outcomes, such as an increase in depressive symptomatology or the development postpartum depression (PPD). Significant consequences may arise as a result including issues with maternal-infant bonding, effective care for the infant, and behavioral or emotional difficulties in the infant. This review discusses the relevant literature as to how disturbed sleep during pregnancy as well as in the postpartum may increase the risk for PPD.

N2  - Introduction: In adults, arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) is regarded as a predictor of cardiovascular disease [1]. This association is less well established in infants, however. Infant and childhood vascular development is dependent on several factors related to the pregnancy, including maternal blood pressure (BP) with one study finding an inverse relationship between BP and neonatal aortic PWV at 1-3 days [2]. Objectives: To assess the association between maternal BP in pregnancy and infant brachio-femoral PWV at age 2-6 weeks. Methods: The Baby VIP study recruited mother-baby pairs from postnatal wards at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. PWV was measured non-invasively in 284 babies at a home visit 2-6 weeks after recruitment using the Vicorder device. Maternal BP at booking and at 36 weeks gestation, along with other co-variables, were collected from delivery and antenatal notes. Multivariable linear regression models were used to link maternal systolic and diastolic BPs, and BP change from booking to 36 weeks with PWV. Results: At booking, the mean maternal systolic BP was 112 mmHg (standard deviation (s.d) 12) and diastolic BP was 67 mmHg (s.d 10). At 36 weeks gestation, mean maternal systolic BP was 116.3 mmHg (s.d 15) and diastolic BP was 70.8 mmHg (s.d 12). Mean infant PWV was 6.7 m/s (s.d 1.3). PWV was not significantly associated with hypertension in pregnancy (at booking or at 36 weeks) in univariate analysis, where hypertension was defined as systolic BP≥140 mmHg or diastolic BP≥90 mmHg, or a rise in systolic BP of ≥30 mmHg or rise in diastolic BP of ≥15 mmHg from booking to 36 weeks (p > 0.05). There was no association between infant PWV and maternal systolic BP at 36 weeks assessed as a continuous variable (regression co-efficient 0.003 m/s, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -0.01, 0.01, p = 0.6) adjusted for pregnancy factors including maternal age, ethnicity, history of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, anaemia, BMI and infant factors including baby's age, position, whether sleep or awake at the time of measurement, and prematurity. There was no association between infant PWV and a ≥30 mmHg rise in systolic BP at 36 weeks from booking (adjusted regression co-efficient -0.4 m/s, 95% CI -1.1, 0.41, p = 0.4). Conclusions: This study has shown that there is no evidence of any associations between infant PWV and hypertension or maternal BP during pregnancy.We demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of using PWV in early infancy. However, further studies are required to determine the predictors of infant PWV, the significance and long term implications of PWV measurements in infants.

N2  - Introduction: Iatrogenic preterm delivery as a result of preeclampsia (PE) and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR) is common (23%) in women with hypertensive disease in early pregnancy. We sought to determine whether ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) profiles recorded in early pregnancy were different in women who subsequently developed pregnancy complications. Objectives: Compare ABPM profiles from a high-risk cohort and determine differences between those with and without an iatrogenic preterm delivery. Methods: An exploratory study was performed including 55 women. Women attending the Manchester Antenatal Vascular Services (MAViS) clinic who were <20 weeks gestation were offered ABPM. They were fitted with a SpaceLabs 90217A and asked to record sleep, wake and drug ingestion times. The BP was recorded every 30 min between 08:00 and 22:00 and hourly between 22:00 and 08:00. Results: The median gestation was 113 (IQR: 101-125) days. 39 women had chronic hypertension, 10 had renal hypertension, 4 had previous pre-eclampsia and 2 had suspected white coat hypertension. 35 (64%) women were taking antihypertensive medication during the period of monitoring; Labetalol n = 12, Nifedipine n = 15, Amlodipine n = 2, Methyldopa n = 1 and polypharmacy n = 5. 18 (33%) women required an iatrogenic preterm delivery, 17 (31%) developed PE (1 NND), 11 (20%) had FGR. The average daytime systolic and diastolic BP readings were not significantly different between groups: 133.7 mmHg (95% CI 130-137) vs 131.9 (125-138) and 85.2 mmHg (82.2-88.1) vs 83.8 (79.6-87.9), respectively. Similarly there was no difference in night time readings or in the night time dip; systolic 10.6 mmHg (8.6-12.7) vs 10.5 (8.2-12.8) and diastolic 14.0 (11.2-16.8) vs 13.6 (10.5-16.7). There was a non-significant trend towards an effect of ethnicity (black (n = 19) vs non-black (n = 35)) on night time BP profiles (p = 0.1) and black women were more likely to develop complications requiring iatrogenic preterm delivery (58% vs 29%; p = 0.057). In logistic regression models neither day or night time blood pressure characteristics, adjusted for medication type or ethnicity, were associated with the need for iatrogenic preterm delivery (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In this small preliminary study of high-risk women undergoing ABPM in early pregnancy, blood pressure characteristics were not predictive of adverse outcomes. ABPM profiles were unavoidably modified using medication in this study and therefore pathophysiological associations between BP and pregnancy outcome may have been attenuated; further study is necessary to determine the effect of early pregnancy haemodynamics on placental function and development.

N2  - Decreased oxygenation during pregnancy and early periods of ontogeny can affect normal body development and result in diseases in adulthood. The aim of this study was to use the model of prenatal intermittent hypoxia (PIH) and evaluate the effects of short-term hypoxia at the end of gestation on blood pressure (BP) control in adulthood. Wistar rats were exposed daily to PIH for 4 h during gestational day 19 and 20. In adult male rats, heart rate (HR), systolic BP and pulse pressure (PP) were acquired by radiotelemetry during 1 week. On the basis of HR variability and BP variability, sympathovagal balance (LF/HF) and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (sBRS) were evaluated. Systolic BP and PP were significantly elevated in PIH rats in comparison with control rats during the light and dark phase of the day, while LF/HF increased only during the light phase of the day. In contrast, sBRS tended to decrease only during the dark phase in PIH rats. In all measured and calculated parameters, significant circadian rhythms were present and were not affected by PIH. In conclusion, our data suggest that short intermittent hypoxia at the end of gestation can increase BP and PP via significant changes in LF/HF, which occur especially during the passive phase of the day. Results suggest that minor changes in the autonomous nervous system activity induced by environmental conditions during the perinatal period may contribute to development of hypertension in adulthood.

N2  - Α case of a chronic idiopathic form of a severe type of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which developed during pregnancy and persisted after this, misdiagnosed for 34 years as radiculopathy S1, is reported. In spite of the thorough clinical and laboratory investigation, in addition to constant changes of the therapeutic approach, the diagnosis of S1 radiculopathy could not be confirmed, resulting in a chronic clinical course; the latter was characterized by relapses and remissions not attributed or linked in any way to the treatment (various types of). In fact, it was due to a routine workup in a sleep clinic, where the patient was referred because of a coincident chronic insomnia (Restless Legs Syndrome is a known and important cause of insomnia/chronic insomnia), which resulted in a proper diagnosis and treatment of this case. With the use of Restless Legs Syndrome appropriate treatment (Pramipexole 0.18 mg taken at bedtime, a dopaminergic agent and Level A recommended drug for Restless Legs Syndrome) an excellent response and immediate elimination of symptoms was achieved. Restless Legs Syndrome may present with a variety of symptoms (with the most prominent shortly being reported with the acronym URGE: Urge to move the legs usually associated with unpleasant leg sensations, Rest induces symptoms, Getting active brings relief, Evening and night deteriorate symptoms); given the fact that Restless Legs Syndrome presents with a great variety and heterogeneity of symptoms (mostly pain, dysesthesia and paresthesia), which may occur in several other diseases (the so called "RLS mimics"), proper diagnosis of Restless Legs Syndrome usually fails. Restless Legs Syndrome misinterpreted as S1 radiculopathy, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported yet in the literature. Here, case history, clinical course and common RLS mimics are presented. Different forms of Restless Legs Syndrome manifestations, which are commonly -as in this case- misinterpreted due to their mimicking several pathological conditions, Restless Legs Syndrome prevalence on general population according to various large epidemiological studies and pathogenic hypotheses on the issue of Restless Legs Syndrome are discussed. Finally, by presenting another possible "RLS-mimic" our aim is to highlight the common misdiagnosis of Restless Legs Syndrome, which can mimic a variety of disorders, some of which are very common, such as an S1 radiculopathy, thus raising concern among doctors of various specialties addressed to by Restless Legs Syndrome sufferers, on the importance of proper diagnosis of the syndrome.

N2  - Background Smoking tobacco increases the risk of respiratory disease in adults and children, but communicating the magnitude of these effects in a scientific manner that is accessible and usable by the public and policymakers presents a challenge. We have therefore summarized scientific data on the impact of smoking on respiratory diseases to provide the content for a unique resource, SmokeHaz. Methods We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of longitudinal studies (published to 2013) identified from electronic databases, gray literature, and experts. Random effect meta-analyses were used to pool the findings. Results We included 216 articles. Among adult smokers, we confirmed substantially increased risks of lung cancer (risk ratio (RR), 10.92; 95% CI, 8.28-14.40; 34 studies), COPD (RR, 4.01; 95% CI, 3.18-5.05; 22 studies), and asthma (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.07-2.42; eight studies). Exposure to passive smoke significantly increased the risk of lung cancer in adult nonsmokers and increased the risks of asthma, wheeze, lower respiratory infections, and reduced lung function in children. Smoking significantly increased the risk of sleep apnea and asthma exacerbations in adult and pregnant populations, and active and passive smoking increased the risk of tuberculosis. Conclusions These findings have been translated into easily digestible content and published on the SmokeHaz website.

N2  - Purpose: To study the epileptiform discharges (EDs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 6-8-year-old children of women with epilepsy (WWE). Materials and Methods: All children born to women with epilepsy and prospectively followed up through the Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (KREP), aged 6-8 years, were invited (n = 532). Out of the 254 children who responded, clinical evaluations and a 30-min digital 18 channel EEG were completed in 185 children. Results: Of the 185 children examined, 37 (20%) children (19 males, 18 females) had ED in their EEG. The EDs were generalized in 7 children, and focal in 30 children. The EDs were present in the sleep record only of 16 (43%) children and in the awake record only of 6 (16%) children. Out of the 94 children for whom seizure history was available, 7 children (7.4%) had seizures (neonatal seizures: 4, febrile seizure: 1, and single nonfebrile seizure: 2) and none had history of epilepsy or recurrent nonfebrile seizures. The odds ratio (OR) for occurrence of ED in the EEG was significantly higher for children of WWE [OR = 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-6.0] when compared to the published data for age-matched children of mothers without epilepsy. There was no association between the occurrence of ED and the children's maternal characteristics [epilepsy syndrome, seizures during pregnancy, maternal intelligence quotient (IQ)] or the children's characteristics [antenatal exposure to specific antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), birth weight, malformations, IQ]. Conclusion: Children of WWE have a higher risk of epileptiform activity in their EEG when compared to healthy children in the community though none had recurrent seizures.

N2  - Background: Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is one of the most common sleep disorders, affecting between 5% and 10% of the U.S. population (1). However it has an unclear etiology, and is often overmedicated without a resulting qualitative improvement in lifestyle. It has not been determined whether iliofemoral or iliocaval venous disease, resulting from either thrombotic lesions or external compression, has an association with RLS. Methods: A total of 510 patients treated for iliofemoral venous compression syndrome (IVCS) with angioplasty and stenting were documented to have concomitant RLS per NIH screening criteria,2 prior to endovenous revascularization. 367 of the following patients were selected for retrospective research analysis based on pre-procedural selection criteria which included: IVCS with > 60% luminal stenosis, confirmed RLS > 1 year with or without current treatment, diminished quality of life, and clinical signs and symptoms of chronic venous disease. Patients with Diabetes, End stage renal disease, current pregnancy, and Rheumatic disease were excluded from this study. Patients with thrombotic lesions of the iliofemoral veins were also excluded. Following revascularization, patients were followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months with doppler evaluation and asked to rate the severity of their RLS using a scale developed by the International Restless Leg Syndrome study group (3). Results: Of the 367 patients studied, 52% of patients had improvement of their RLS symptoms at 3 months, 90% reported significant relief with cessation of medication(s) within 6 months, and 10% did not have any statistically significant improvement by 6 months (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates a strong relationship between deep vein outflow obstruction, with either iliocaval or iliofemoral stenosis, and RLS. It is suspected that a large population suffers from iliofemoral venous disease, and including this subset of patients in the differential diagnosis for RLS can allow for earlier treatment of IVCS and prevention of RLS.

N2  - CONTEXT: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) treatments have included medications with many adverse effects and limited utility. A noninvasive device would potentially have extensive use where RLS medications may not be appropriate, such as in pregnant or breastfeeding women, people with mild RLS, people who operate machinery or drive occupationally, people with severely impaired renal function, or people who are taking medications contraindicated with RLS medications.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a device that produces targeted pressure on the abductor hallucis and the flexor hallucis brevis muscles to reduce the symptoms of moderate to severe RLS, and to compare the current findings with findings from studies of ropinirole use in patients with primary RLS.
METHODS: This 8-week single-arm, open-label, clinical trial with a repeated measures design was conducted between April 2009 and August 2012 in 2 offices in Erie, Pennsylvania. Adults with moderate to severe primary RLS were recruited for the study. Mean (SD) follow-up was 15.6 (6) months. Patients wore RLS devices (1 on each foot) for set periods intermittently throughout the course of the study. The primary end point was mean change in the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) Rating Scale from baseline to day 56, and the secondary measure was the Clinical Global Impression scale. A meta-analysis was used to compare the RLS device findings with the findings of 3 historic studies of ropinirole vs placebo. The demographics, disease severity, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessment tools were similar among the 4 studies.
RESULTS: Thirty patients (22 women, 8 men; mean age, 51.5 years [range, 30-75 years]) participated in the study. Change in mean (SD) IRLSSG score was significantly greater for the RLS device (17.22 [6.16]; P<.001) compared with the ropinirole vs placebo findings (12 [0.86] vs 8.9 [0.86], respectively; P<.05). Sleep loss significantly decreased from 119.5 (61.6) minutes to 22.1 (31.1) minutes per night (P<.001). Global Improvement Scale scores indicated significantly greater improvement with the RLS device compared with ropinirole (27 of 30 [90%] vs 293 of 464 [63%], respectively; P<.05). Mild, transient adverse effects of the device (eg, pain, paresthesia) were reported, but these effects were relieved by loosening the straps. The RLS device demonstrated none of the adverse effects associated with current dopamine agonist therapy, such as augmentation, tolerance, rebound, somnolence, and nausea.
CONCLUSION: Producing targeted pressure on the abductor hallucis and flexor hallucis brevis muscles with an external RLS device reduced the symptoms of moderate to severe primary RLS without the adverse effects of medication therapy. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02386423.) J Am Osteopath Assoc.

N2  - Background: Lead is a pervasive neurotoxicant that has been associated with poorer cognitive, behavioral, and motor outcomes in children. The effects of lead on sensory function have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant sensory function, as measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and grating visual acuity (VA). Methods: Lead was measured in maternal blood in mid- and late-pregnancy (mean gestational age = 15.5 and 39.0 weeks, respectively) and umbilical cord blood in a cohort of full-term infants in rural northeastern China. ABR latencies (peaks I, III, V) were measured in newborns during unsedated sleep (n = 315). The ABR central-to-peripheral (C-P) ratio was calculated as the ratio between the III-V and I-III interpeak intervals. VA was measured in 6-week-olds using Teller Acuity Cards (n = 1019) and assigned as the narrowest grid the infant fixated on. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate relationships between tertiles of mid-pregnancy, late-pregnancy, or cord lead and newborn ABR or 6-week VA. Results: Higher late-pregnancy lead levels were associated with higher ABR C-P ratios and lower VA. In covariate-adjusted analyses, mean C-P ratios were 4.6 and 3.2 % higher in infants whose mothers had lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, than for infants whose mothers had lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.002). In adjusted analyses for VA, mean scores were 8.5 and 7.2 % lower for maternal lead > 3.8 μg/dL and lead = 2-3.8 μg/dL, respectively, compared to lead < 2 μg/dL (p-trend =0.009). Conclusion: Auditory and visual systems maturation appears delayed in infants with higher prenatal lead exposure during late-pregnancy, even at relatively low levels. Both systems start myelinating in late gestation and mature rapidly in infancy. Higher ABR C-P ratio and lower grating VA scores suggest effects of low-level lead exposure on sensory system myelination.

N2  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire-10 (FOSQ-10) in pregnant women. Methods: A total of 228 first-trimester pregnant women participated in the study which was conducted in an outpatient obstetric clinic at a medical center in Taipei Taiwan. Results: The Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 showed satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85), adequate corrected itemtotal correlations ranging from 0.40-0.67, and acceptable test-retest reliability over the 7 days (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.73). Construct validity was supported by exploratory factor analysis showing a one-factor structure with item loading between 0.49 and 0.77. Significant associations of the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 with the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey version 2 and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index parameters supported adequate criterion-related and convergent validity. Significant differences in the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 total scores were found between women with clinically significant daytime sleepiness and those without, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. No floor or ceiling effects were observed for the Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 total scores. Conclusion: The Chinese version of the FOSQ-10 is a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate functional status and identify important impacts of sleep-related impairment in women during pregnancy. This instrument holds great promise as a useful, feasible, and applicable tool for obstetric populations, but needs to be further tested in a broader population of pregnant women, such as women with high risk pregnancies and those with sleep disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance, depression, and daytime sleepiness are among the most prevalent symptoms reported by women during pregnancy. However, available data on the association between sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in pregnant women are sparse and methodological limitations have been acknowledged. The purpose of the study was to examine objective and self-reported sleep disturbances and symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness in a group of healthy pregnant women.
METHODS: A total of 274 third-trimester pregnant women wore a wrist actigraph continuously for 7 days to assess objective sleep quality and quantity. Self-reported sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with self-reported poor sleep quality defined as a PSQI score more than 5. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale were used to evaluate symptoms of depression and daytime sleepiness, respectively.
RESULTS: Sixty-four (23.4%) women were at risk for clinical depression and 69 (25.2%) had daytime sleepiness. Risk of clinically meaningful depressive symptomatology was significantly increased in women with objective total nighttime sleep less than 6 hours (OR 2.53 [95% CI 1.26-5.08]) and self-reported poor sleep quality (OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.74-6.30]), even after multiple adjustment. Neither objective nor self-reported sleep disturbances increased daytime sleepiness in this group of pregnant women.
DISCUSSION: Both objective nighttime sleep less than 6 hours and self-reported poor sleep quality in healthy third-trimester pregnant women is associated with significant risks for clinical depression. Improving sleep would likely be associated with a reduction in depression symptom severity and an attenuation of the prevalence of depression in pregnant women.

N2  - Introduction: Obesity has been associated with sleep disturbance during pregnancy. Although weight gain is recommended during pregnancy, even for overweight women, the relationship between weight gain and sleep disturbance has not been evaluated. Therefore, this study evaluates the effects of both pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain on sleep among pregnant women. Methods: Primiparous women in their last month of pregnancy completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess subjective sleep quality and wore a wrist actigraph for 72 hours to estimate wake after sleep onset (WASO, measuring sleep disruption) and total sleep time (TST, measuring sleep duration). Self-reported maternal height and pre-pregnancy and current weights were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Maternal weight gain was classified according to Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations. Women with a diagnosed sleep or mood disorder were excluded. Results: The 128 women included in the analysis were ethnically diverse, had a mean age of 27 ± 6 years (range 18-41), and were assessed an average of 21 ± 10 days before delivery (range 1-40). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that maternal weight gain exceeding the IOM recommendation was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality (p = .001) and increased WASO (p = .028). Pre-pregnancy BMI was not significantly associated with sleep parameters. However, 2-way ANOVA examining both weight gain and BMI indicated that the deleterious effects of excessive weight gain on WASO and TST were only evident among women who were overweight prior to pregnancy (interaction p = .002 for WASO and p = .004 for TST). Excessive weight gain was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality regardless of BMI. Sensitivity analyses excluding 22 women reporting frequent snoring and/or pauses in breathing during sleep yielded similar results. Conclusion: Weight gain during pregnancy that exceeds IOM recommendations is associated with increased sleep disturbance, particularly among overweight women.
