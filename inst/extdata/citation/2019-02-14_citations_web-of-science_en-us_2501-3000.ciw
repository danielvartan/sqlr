AB In Wistar rats, pregnant or not pregnant, sleep-wakefulness parameters were registered for 2 days from 10:00 till 14:00. Later, these rats were sub jected to 3-hour (11:00-14:00) dady sleep deprivation (SD) during 3 consecutive days. To prevent sleep, the following manipulations were used: acoustic stimulation from moving of the food pellets, opening or horizontal rotation of the cage and gentle handling. Control pregnant or Hot pregnant rats were placed in individual cages in the same room, but their sleep was not disturbed. On average, not pregnant rats spent about 65% of the time in sleep. Sleep episodes were mostly short (less than 1 min) or medium (1-15 min). After the beginning and with advance of pregnancy, the amount. deepness and duration of sleep episodes increased. With the methods of SD used, not pregnant rats did [lot sleep almost at all during the SE) session. In pregnant rats, the quantity and intensity of stimuli used for SD increased as compared to control, which was indicatives of the growth of "sleep pressure" during pregnancy.

TI Gains in awareness, ownership and use of insecticide-treated nets in
   Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda and Zambia
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

ID BED NETS; MALARIA TRANSMISSION; WESTERN KENYA; AREA; PREGNANCY;
   COVERAGE; CHILDREN; IMPACT
AB Background: In April 2000, the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) "Abuja Summit" set a target of having at least 60% of pregnant women and children under five use insecticide- treated nets (ITNs). Thereafter, programmes were implemented to create demand, reduce taxes and tariffs, spur the commercial market, and reach vulnerable populations with subsidized ITNs. Using national ITN monitoring data from the USAID-sponsored AED/NetMark project, this article examines the extent to which these activities were successful in increasing awareness, ownership, and use of nets and ITNs.
   Methods: A series of surveys with standardized sampling and measurement methods was used to compare four countries at two points in time. Surveys were conducted in 2000 and again in 2004 (Nigeria, Senegal, Zambia) or 2006 (Uganda). They contained questions permitting classification of each net as untreated, ever- treated or currently-treated (an ITN). Household members as well as nets owned were enumerated so that households, household members, and nets could be used as units of analysis. Several measures of net/ITN ownership, plus RBM ITN use indicators, were calculated. The results show the impact of ITN activities before the launch of massive free net distribution programmes.
   Results: In 2000, treated nets were just being introduced to the public, but four to six years later the awareness of ITNs was nearly universal in all countries but Nigeria, where awareness increased from 7% to 60%. By any measure, there were large increases in ownership of nets, especially treated nets, in all countries. All countries but Nigeria made commensurate gains in the proportion of under-fives sleeping under a net/ITN, and in all countries the proportion of pregnant women sleeping under a net/ITN increased greatly.
   Conclusion: A mix of demand creation, a strengthened commercial sector, reduced taxes and tariffs, and programmes making ITNs available at reduced prices resulted in impressive gains in awareness, ownership, and use of nets and ITNs in Nigeria, Senegal, Zambia, and Uganda between 2000 and 2004-2006. None of the countries reached the ambitious Abuja targets for ITN use, but they made substantial progress towards them.

AB Aim: To study the effects of postnatal exposure to nicotine on the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure in infants.
   Subjects and Methods: Thirty-eight mother-infant pairs were studied. Twenty nonsmoking and 18 smoking (2-20 cigarettes per day) mothers were included. All infants were healthy, exclusively breastfed and their postnatal age was 6 weeks. During a home visit infant's urine and mothers' milk were sampled and concentrations of nicotine and cotinine were analyzed. Infants' electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded, sleep state documented and blood pressure during sleep was measured. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated with spectral analysis of R-R intervals.
   Results: The smoking mothers exposed their infants to nicotine in milk with a median nicotine concentration of 47 (8-192) mu g/L. Analysis of infants' urine showed that the nonsmoking group had 0.8 (0-5.2) and the smoke group 60 (17-139) mu g cotinine/L (p < 0.01). The frequency domain low-to-high frequency (LF/HF) ratio, was correlated to milk nicotine concentrations in the milk sample, from smoking mothers. HRV decreased, with increasing milk nicotine, ingested by the boys (r = -0.74, p = 0.02) but not the girls (r = -0.13, p = 0.76). The differences of mean arterial pressure between sleep states in the infants, were significantly lower in the smoke group 5.8(6.8) compared to the nonsmoke group 11.5(7.2) mmHg (p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Postnatal exposure to nicotine influences autonomic cardiovascular control in infants.

AB Introduction: Prenatal alcohol exposure via maternal liquid diet consumption by C57BL/6 (B6) mice causes conspicuous midline neural tube deficit (dysraphia) and disruption of genesis and development of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei, together with brain growth retardation. The current study tested the hypothesis that concurrent treatment with either an activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) agonist peptide [SALLRSIPA, (SAL)] or an activity-dependent neurotrophic protein (ADNP) agonist peptide [NAPVSIPQ, (NAP)] would protect against these alcohol-induced deficits in brain development.
   Methods: Timed-pregnant B6 dams consumed alcohol from embryonic day 7 (E7, before the onset of neurulation) until E15. Fetuses were obtained on E15 and brain sections processed for 5-HT immunocytochemistry, for evaluation of morphologic development of the brainstem raphe and its 5-HT neurons. Additional groups were treated either with SAL or NAP daily from E7 to E15 to assess the potential protective effects of these peptides. Measures of incomplete occlusion of the ventral canal and the frequency and extent of the openings in the rhombencephalon were obtained to assess fetal dysraphia. Counts of 5-HT-immunostained neurons were also obtained in the rostral and caudal raphe.
   Results: Prenatal alcohol exposure resulted in abnormal openings along the midline and delayed closure of ventral canal in the brainstem. This dysraphia was associated with reductions in the number of 5-HT neurons both in the rostral raphe nuclei (that gives rise to ascending 5-HT projections) and in the caudal raphe (that gives rise to the descending 5-HT projections). Concurrent treatment of the alcohol-consuming dams with SAL prevented dysraphia and protected against the alcohol-induced reductions in 5-HT neurons in both the rostral and caudal raphe. NAP was less effective in protecting against dysraphia and did not protect against 5-HT loss in the rostral raphe, but did protect against loss in the caudal raphe.
   Conclusions: These findings further support the potential usefulness of these peptides for therapeutic interventions in pregnancies at risk for alcohol-induced developmental deficits. Notably, the ascending 5-HT projections of the rostral raphe have profound effects in regulating forebrain development and function, and the descending 5-HT projections of the caudal raphe are critical for regulating respiration. Protection of the rostral 5-HT-system may help prevent structural and functional deficits linked to abnormal forebrain development, and protection of the caudal systems may also reduce the increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.

AB Background: Concerns regarding potential harmful effect of medications on fetuses often result in inadequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy, whereas risks posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma are often underestimated.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of maternal asthma on preterm delivery and fetal growth.
   Methods: Study participants were individuals enrolled in the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists Asthma Medications in Pregnancy Study between February 1, 1998, and December 31, 2003. Pregnant women with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 719) evaluated their asthma control repeatedly during pregnancy based on symptom frequency and interference with daily activities and sleep and reported hospitalizations and unscheduled clinic visits for asthma exacerbations. The incidence of preterm delivery, the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction, and mean birth weight were evaluated relative to asthma symptom control and exacerbation measures.
   Results: The incidence of preterm delivery was significantly higher among patients with inadequate asthma symptom control during the first part of pregnancy (11.4%) compared with patients with adequate asthma control (6.3%; P = .02). Similarly, patients who were hospitalized for asthma during pregnancy had a higher incidence of preterm delivery (16.4%) compared with asthmatic women without a history of hospitalization (7.6%; P = .02). The effect seemed independent from use of systemic corticosteroids and other covariates. Neither the incidence of intrauterine growth restriction nor mean birth weight varied by any measures of asthma symptom control or exacerbations.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates a substantial risk for preterm delivery posed by poorly controlled maternal asthma and provides additional evidence regarding the importance of adequate treatment of asthma in pregnancy to maintain optimal asthma control.

AB Depression during pregnancy has been associated with a number of adverse outcomes, but the underlying physiological mechanisms involved remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of maternal depression during pregnancy on the autonomic modulation of heart rate, in a naturalistic setting. Eighty-one pregnant women were studied between 25 and 31 weeks of gestation and were identified as either Depressed (n = 46), or healthy, Control (n = 35), based on depression scores and lifetime psychiatric history. Subjects wore a 24-h Holter recorder to measure time-domain and frequency-domain of heart rate variability (HRV). Pregnant women in the Depressed Group had significantly reduced time-domain measures: standard deviation of all 24-h NN intervals (SDNN) and the standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals in all 5-min segments of the entire recording (SDANN) (P = 0.013, 0.016, respectively), as well as higher heart rates while asleep (P = 0.028), compared to Controls, after controlling for age, smoking, and antidepressant (AD) medication. The low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio during the sleeping hours was associated with higher depression scores (R = 0.24; P = 0.041). HRV measures improved in women taking AD medication. The autonomic nervous system may be affected in women experiencing depression during pregnancy, indicating a possible decreased parasympathetic (vagal) influence. Women taking AD medication showed some improvement in HRV measures. These data suggest that psychophysiological changes occur in women experiencing depression during pregnancy.

AB Aim. This paper is a report on a study identifying trajectories of childbirth-related fatigue intensity changes over time and the influencing factors related to specific trajectory patterns.
   Background. Childbirth is a period of time that encompasses considerable physiological and psychological fatigue, often having an adverse impact on women in labour. Empirical studies on this issue are scarce. How childbirth-related fatigue changes over time, and factors influencing fatigue development, remain unclear.
   Method. A prospective, correlational design with repeated measures was used. Data were collected by self-reported measures and laboratory analysis of blood specimens. From December 2004 to November 2005 a convenience sample of 209 low-risk pregnant Taiwanese women was followed throughout the labour process. Repeated measures of fatigue were analysed by using a semiparametric mixture model. Variables explaining trajectory class membership were identified by means of logistic regression.
   Results. Two distinct trajectories of childbirth-related fatigue were identified: low intensity (30.8% of women) and high intensity (69.2% of women). Fatigue level of both classes intensified following labour. The fastest period of fatigue-increasing rate was in the active phase. After birth, fatigue levels in the high-fatigue intensity class remained high. Primiparas in the high-fatigue intensity class experienced significantly more anxiety and higher lactate concentration at admission than the low-intensity class.
   Conclusion. Caregivers should endeavour to prevent high levels of fatigue once women enter the labour phase. Women who present with high fatigue at onset of labour should be targeted for early intervention, especially in the period of rapid fatigue increase.

TI Inconsolable night-time awakening: Beyond night terrors
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
ID SLEEP
AB Sophia is a 3-year-old girl who was brought to her pediatrician by her parents who were concerned about inconsolable night-time awakening. Her mother indicated that she has frequent (> 6), early nocturnal awakenings accompanied by screaming and crying lasting up to I hour since her birth. These episodes increased in intensity and frequency in the past year since the birth of her brother. With a bedtime routine (a cup of water by bedside with a washcloth and touching mother's nose, chin, and cheeks), Sophia falls asleep easily; however, within I hour she awakes screaming and flailing unaware of her surroundings and unable to be comforted. There are no tonic-clonic movements. Prior interventions, including a sleep coach and "letting Sophia cry it out," did not change her sleep pattern. Sophia's mother reports that she needs to be on a specific daily routine including set times for awakening, activity, snacks, naps, and meals. Diversion from the routine and separation from her mother results in a tantrum (kicking, hitting, screaming, and inconsolability) often lasting more than 30 minutes. Sophia was born after an uncomplicated 37-week gestation. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia required readmission for 24 hours of phototherapy; serum bilirubin levels were performed daily for 3 weeks after discharge. At 6 weeks, daily episodes of screaming, inconsolability, forceful vomiting, and inability to sleep led to a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux. Medication trials were not successful, but the symptoms resolved by 5 months. Formula intolerance and difficulty swallowing and chewing different textures of solid food occurred in the first year. occupational therapy was of "no benefit"; Sophia was overwhelmed by the activity and took a long time to warm up to the therapist. Her texture aversion resolved by 2 years of age. She prefers one-on-one play and has minimal interactions with other children. She has met all her developmental milestones appropriately and has no other health issues. Sophia lives with her parents and infant brother. There is a maternal family history of insomnia and sleep walking and a paternal history of sleep walking. Her mother adheres to a strict daily schedule. Sleep deprivation, different parental child-rearing practices, social isolation, and lack of quality parent time were all identified by the mother as significant marital stressors. During the office visit, Sophia required 30 minutes to warm up and smile, and over 60 minutes before she spoke her first word. Physical examination was normal (including growth measurements) and the developmental examination was age-appropriate. Upon completion of the assessment, she was engaging, playful, and cooperative with the pediatrician.

AB Objectives Catecholamines may contribute to the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). TH01, a tetrameric short tandem repeat marker in the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, regulates genie expression and catecholamine production.
   Study design We investigated TH01 in 172 German Caucasian SIDS cases and 390 sex- and age-matched control subjects.
   Results The *9.3 alleles were more frequent in patients with SIDS than in control subjects (40.12% vs 31.15%; P = .006). For homozygotes the odds ratio was 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 1.09-3.05). for carriers 1.58 (1.09-2.28). Moreover. *9.3 alleles were significantly more frequent during the winter (47.73% vs 35.38% in the warmer seasons), and the frequency of *9.3 alleles varied significantly with the age at death (weeks 7 to 12: 49.04% vs 29.63% within the first 6 weeks). Other risk factors (sleeping position, gestation, smoking) had no significant impact on the frequency of *9.3.
   Conclusions Our results indicate a relation ship between SIDS and TH01 genotype, presumably caused by an impairment of breathing regulation or arousal. We propose that noradrenalinergic neuronal activity contributes to tire cause of a major subset of SIDS victims. Moreover, the results further stress that SIDS is a highly heterogenic group.

AB Objective To identify factors predictive of either lateral or prone infant sleep positioning.
   Study design We used data for 11340 mother-infant pairs front the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for infants born in Washington State, 1996 to 2002. We used predictive modeling to identify statistically significant (P < .05) predictors of lateral and prone sleep positioning.
   Results Factors associated with both high-risk sleep positions included infant's year of birth. maternal race and ethnicity, maternal county of residence, and maternal parity. Mother's being US-born (versus foreign-born) and male infant sex were insurance, receipt of government benefits, low infant predictive only of prone sleep positioning. Having Medicaid as primary gestational age, and low birth weight were predictive only of lateral sleep positioning.
   Conclusions Factors predictive of either high-risk sleep position should be considered when devising public health intervention strategies for the prevention of SIDS.

   RLS; GENETIC ASSOCIATION
AB Restless-legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder, characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. It begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, is partially or totally relieved by movements and is exacerbated or occurs at night and in the evening, RLS sufferers represent 2 to 3% of the general population in Western countries. Supportive criteria include a family history, the presence of periodic-leg movements (PLM) when awake or asleep and a positive response to dopaminergic treatment. The RLS phenotypes include an early onset form, usually idiopathic with a familial history and a late onset form, usually secondary to peripheral neuropathy. Recently, an atypical RLS phenotype without PLM and L-DOPA resistant has been characterized. RLS can occur in childhood and should be distinguished from attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, growing pains and sleep complaints in childhood. RLS should be included in the diagnosis of all patients consulting for sleep complaints or discomfort in the lower limbs. It should be differentiated from akathisia, that is, an urge to move the whole body without uncomfortable sensations. Polysomnographic studies and the suggested immobilization test can detect PLM. Furthermore, an L-DOPA challenge has recently been validated to support the diagnosis of RLS. RLS may cause severe-sleep disturbances, poor quality of life, depressive and anxious symptoms and may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. in most cases, RLS is idiopathic. it may also be secondary to iron deficiency, end-stage renal disease, pregnancy, peripheral neuropathy and drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. The small-fiber neuropathy can mimic RLS or even trigger it. RLS is associated with many neurological and sleep disorders including Parkinson's disease, but does not predispose to these diseases. The pathophysiology of RLS includes an altered brain-iron metabolism, a dopaminergic dysfunction, a probable role of pain control systems and a genetic susceptibility with nine loci and three polymorphisms in genes serving developmental functions. RLS treatment begins with the elimination of triggering factors and iron supplementation when deficient. Mild or intermittent RLS is usually treated with low doses Of L-DOPA or codeine; the first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS is dopaminergic agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous droits reserves.

AB Objectives: To evaluate pregnancy-associated sleep disorders, pregnancy outcomes and inflammatory markers in pre-eclampsia and normal pregnancy (control).
   Patients and methods: We studied 15 consecutive pre-eclamptic women and 14 controls. Pre-eclamptic women underwent overnight pulse oximetry and nasal pressure measurements at a university teaching hospital, and the sleep study for the controls was performed at home. Mean gestation was 31 weeks. Nasal airflow was carefully analyzed visually, and the time with flow limitation was calculated as a percentage of total recording time. At the time of the sleep study, the subjects were clinically evaluated, they answered sleep questionnaires, and fasting blood samples were drawn for tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and sensitive Greactive protein. Pregnancy outcomes were collected after delivery.
   Results: Pre-eclampsia patients spent significantly more time with flow limitation (mean +/- SD: 21 +/- 18% vs. 4 +/- 9%), had higher plasma levels of TNF-alpha (6.2 +/- 2.3 ng/l vs. 4.1 +/- ng/l) and IL-6 (4.4 +/- ng/l vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4 ng/l), had more generalized edema, had increased fatigue and snoring, and had poorer pregnancy outcomes than did controls. Age, gestational age, mean SpO(2) and body mass index did not differ between the groups.
   Conclusions: Pregnant women with pre-eclampsia showed significantly more nasal flow limitation during the night, higher fasting IL-6 and TNF-alpha plasma levels, more edema and worse pregnancy outcomes than did healthy pregnant women. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The Abuja target of increasing the proportion of people sleeping under insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) to 60% by the year 2005, as one of the measures for malaria control in Africa, has generated an influx of resources for malaria control in several countries in the region. A national household survey conducted in 2005 by the Malaria Control Programme in Nigeria assessed the progress made with respect to ITN ownership and use among pregnant women and children under five years of age since 2000. The survey was the first nationally representative study of ITN use assessing progress towards the Abuja target amongst vulnerable groups.
   Population and Method: A cross-sectional survey of a sample of 7,200 households, selected by a multistage stratified sampling technique from 12 randomly selected states from the six geopolitical zones of the country. Data collection was done during the malarious rainy season (October 2005) using a modified WHO Malaria Indicator Survey structured questionnaire about household ownership and utilization of mosquito nets (treated or untreated) from household heads.
   Results: Household ownership of any net was 23.9% (95% CI, 22.8%-25.1%) and 10.1% for ITNs (95% CI, 9.2%-10.9%). Education, wealth index, presence of an under-five child in the household, family size, residence, and region by residence were predictive of ownership of any net. The presence of an under-five child in the household, family size, education, presence of health facility in the community, gender of household head, region by residence and wealth index by education predicted ITN ownership.
   Utilization of any net by children under-five was 11.5% (95% CI, 10.4%-12.6%) and 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3%-2.2%) for ITN. Predictors of use of any net among under-five children were fever in the previous two weeks, presence of health facility in the community, caregiver's education, residence, and wealth index by caregiver's education; while religion, presence of health facility and wealth index by caregiver's education predicted the use of ITN among this group.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the substantial increase in ITN utilization among children under five years of age in Nigeria is still far from the Abuja targets.

ID INTERMITTENT PREVENTIVE TREATMENT; TANZANIA; TRANSMISSION; SURVIVAL;
   DISTRICT; PROGRAM; HEALTH
AB Background: Since 2000, the World Health Organization has recommended a package of interventions to prevent malaria during pregnancy and its sequelae that includes the promotion of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), and effective case management of malarial illness. It is recommended that pregnant women in malaria-endemic areas receive at least two doses of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. This study assessed the prevalence of placental malaria at delivery in women during 1(st) or 2(nd) pregnancy, who did not receive intermittent preventive treatment for malaria (IPTp) in a malaria-endemic area with high bed net coverage.
   Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was done in Ifakara, Tanzania, where bed net coverage is high. Primi- and secundigravid women, who presented to the labour ward and who reported not using IPTp were included in the study. Self-report data were collected by questionnaire; whereas neonatal birth weight and placenta parasitaemia were measured directly at the time of delivery.
   Results: Overall, 413 pregnant women were enrolled of which 91% reported to have slept under a bed net at home the previous night, 43% reported history of fever and 62% were primigravid. Malaria parasites were detected in 8% of the placenta samples; the geometric mean (95% CI) placental parasite density was 3,457 (1,060-11,271) parasites/mu l in primigravid women and 2,178 (881-5,383) parasites/mu l in secundigravid women. Fifteen percent of newborns weighed < 2,500 g at delivery. Self-reported bed net use was statistically associated with lower risk for low birth weight [OR 0.34 (95% CI: 0.16-0.74) and OR 0.22 (95% CI: 0.08-0.59) for untreated and treated bed nets, respectively], but was not associated with placental parasitaemia [OR 0.74 (0.21-2.68) and OR 1.64 (0.44-6.19) for untreated and treated bed nets, respectively].
   Conclusion: The observed incidence of LBW and prevalence of placental parasitaemia at delivery suggests that malaria remains a problem in pregnancy in this area with high bed net coverage when eligible women do not receive IPTp. Delivery of IPTp should be emphasized at all levels of implementation to achieve maximum community coverage.

AB Restless legs syndrome is a common neurologic movement disorder that affects approximately 10 percent of adults. Of those affected with this condition, approximately one third have symptoms severe enough to require medical therapy. Restless legs syndrome may be a primary condition, or it may be secondary to iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, or the use of certain medications. The diagnosis is clinical, requiring an urge to move the legs usually accompanied by an uncomfortable sensation, occurrence at rest, improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome causes sleep disturbances, is associated with anxiety and depression, and has a negative effect on quality of life. Treatment of secondary causes of restless legs syndrome-may result in improvement or resolution of symptoms. Currently, there is little information regarding the effects of lifestyle changes on the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. If medications are needed, dopamine agonists are the primary medications for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome. Other medications that may be effective include gabapentin, carbidopa/levodopa, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

TI Maternal Feeding Controls Fetal Biological Clock
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: It is widely accepted that circadian physiological rhythms of the fetus are affected by oscillators in the maternal brain that are coupled to the environmental light-dark (LD) cycle.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To study the link between fetal and maternal biological clocks, we investigated the effects of cycles of maternal food availability on the rhythms of Per1 gene expression in the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver using a transgenic rat model whose tissues express luciferase in vitro. Although the maternal SCN remained phase-locked to the LD cycle, maternal restricted feeding phase-advanced the fetal SCN and liver by 5 and 7 hours respectively within the 22-day pregnancy.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that maternal feeding entrains the fetal SCN and liver independently of both the maternal SCN and the LD cycle. This indicates that maternal-feeding signals can be more influential for the fetal SCN and particular organ oscillators than hormonal signals controlled by the maternal SCN, suggesting the importance of a regular maternal feeding schedule for appropriate fetal molecular clockwork during pregnancy.

AB The practice of shift-work scheduling has long been part of normal work duties in emergency services such as health and security. It is only recently, in the wake of growing job opportunities and booming industries, where more employees are needed to keep services running over 24-hour periods that studies on the effects of shift work on workers' health have begun to delve deeper. The desynchronisation that occurs in circadian rhythms, with respect to sleep cycles, predisposes employees to coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal disturbances, increased risk of breast cancer and poor pregnancy outcomes. This literature review focuses on circadian rhythms, their molecular components, disturbances of these rhythms as a result of shift work and the adverse effects there of on the cardiovascular system.

DT Review
ID MAJOR MALFORMATIONS; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; UK-EPILEPSY; EXPOSURE;
   CARBAMAZEPINE; LAMOTRIGINE; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES; WOMEN; FETAL
AB In the United States, about I million women of childbearing age have epilepsy. Estimates vary as to the percentage of these women who consider pregnancy, but epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition encountered ill pregnancy. Women with epilepsy express significant interest in receiving guidance about pregnancy and the effects of seizures and anticonvulsant treatments on the developing fetus, but clinicians often are hard-pressed to find accurate and relevant information to share.
   In our practice, we devote many hours of clinical time to the counseling required when such a request is made. We begin by providing information about the risks of pregnancy for any woman, comparing the data for women with and without epilepsy; this gives patients perspective on the increase in the risk of fetal malformations associated with anticonvulsant therapy. We then proceed with an evaluation of whether the patient could consider withdrawing one or more anticonvulsants, particularly during the first trimester of gestation. For women who must continue taking anticonvulsants to prevent seizures, we explain that the increase in metabolism during pregnancy will require an increase in oral dosing to maintain prepregnancy concentrations of anticonvulsants. It is hoped that by maintaining prepregnancy blood levels during pregnancy, a woman with epilepsy can maintain the same level of seizure control during pregnancy that she had before conception.
   Additional time is spent discussing the need for adequate hydration, regular meals, and proper sleep during pregnancy and in the postpartum time to avoid behavioral alterations that can trigger seizures. As seizure medicines will need to be decreased after delivery, when a patient will be sleep-deprived and under the influence of hormonal changes that can increase the seizure tendency, our nurses meet with patients throughout pregnancy to develop plans for partner or family assistance with care of the neonate. Patients report appreciation for this type of personalized counseling but express frustration that we cannot provide absolute guidance with respect to the use of anticonvulsants in pregnancy. Therefore we often have to return several times to the topic of the limitations of scientific research regarding decision-making in pregnancy. Much of the information we have about the safety of anticonvulsant use in pregnancy comes from the registry studies discussed in this article. These studies can be difficult to interpret and compare because of the diversity of the methods used.

AB Background: In order to clarify the alcohol consumption status of pregnant women in Japan and the characteristics of pregnant women who abstained from alcohol after their pregnancy had been confirmed, a nationwide questionnaire-based study of alcohol consumption behavior was performed. We also examined the factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy.
   Methods: After random sampling, 260 institutions participated in the survey; these were selected from a list of survey points fixed by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The study was conducted on pregnant women with confirmed pregnancies by using self-administered anonymous questionnaires during the period from February 1 through 14, 2002.
   Results: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was reported in 11.1% of the study participants, and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy, in 76.9%. Significant associations were recognized between higher education and both alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after pregnancy confirmation. Furthermore, alcohol consumption was significantly associated with parity, smoking, and shorter sleep duration, whereas abstention was significantly associated with less frequent alcohol consumption and knowledge regarding the risk of alcohol consumption.
   Conclusion: The results clarified the factors associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy and abstention after the confirmation of pregnancy in Japan.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of prenatal and postnatal protein deprivation on the morphology and density of vasopressin (VP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) immunoreactive neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of young rats. Female Wistar rats were fed either 6% (malnourished group) or 25% (control group) casein diet five weeks before conception, during gestation and lactation. After weaning, the pups were maintained on the same diet until sacrificed at 30 days of age. The major and minor axes, somatic area and the density of VP- and VIP-immunoreactive neurons were evaluated in the middle sections of the SCN. The present study shows that chronic protein malnutrition (ChPM) in VP neurons induces a significant decrease in number of cells (-31%,) and a significant increase in major and minor axes and somatic area (+12.2%, +21.1% and +15.0%, respectively). The VIP cells showed a significant decrease in cellular density (-41.5%) and a significant increase in minor axis (+13.5%) and somatic area (+10.1%). Our findings suggest that ChPM induces abnormalities in the density and morphology of the soma of VP and VIP neurons. These alterations may be a morphological substrate underlying circadian alterations previously observed in malnourished rats.

AB Several modifiable pre- and postnatal determinants of childhood overweight are known, but no one has examined how they influence risk of overweight in combination. We estimated the risk of overweight at age 3 years according to levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, breastfeeding duration, and infant sleep duration. We studied 1,110 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study. The main outcome measure was child overweight (BMI for age and sex >= 95th percentile) at age 3. We ran logistic regression models with all four modifiable risk factors as well as the covariates maternal BMI and education, child race/ethnicity, and household income. From the model, we obtained the estimated probability of overweight for each of the 16 combinations of the four risk factors. During pregnancy, 9.8% of mothers smoked and 50% gained excessive weight. In infancy, 73% mother-child pairs breastfed for <12 m, and 31% of infants slept <12 h/day. Among the 3-year-old children in the cohort, 9.5% were overweight. In the prediction model, the estimated probability of overweight ranged from 0.06 among children exposed to favorable levels of all four risk factors, to 0.29 with adverse levels of all four. Healthful levels of four behaviors during early development predicted much lower probability of overweight at age 3 than adverse levels. Interventions to modify several factors during pregnancy and infancy could have substantial impact on prevention of childhood overweight.

AB Purpose. Postpartum mothers experience certain physical health conditions that may affect their quality of life, future health, and health of their children. Yet, the physical health of postpartum mothers is relatively neglected in both research and practice. The purpose of this review is to describe the general health status and prevalence of common physical health conditions of postpartum mothers.
   Methods. The review followed standard procedures for integrative literature reviews. Twenty-two articles were reviewed from searches in scientific databases, reference lists, and an up-to-date survey. Three tables were designed to answer review questions.
   Findings. In general, postpartum mothers self-rate their health as good. They experience certain physical conditions such as fatigue/physical exhaustion, sleep-related problems, pain, sex-related concerns, hemorrhoids/constipation, and breast problems.
   Conclusions. Despite a limited number of studies, the findings provide a glimpse of the presence of a number of physical health conditions experienced by women in the 2 years postpartum. In the articles reviewed, physical health conditions and postpartum period were poorly defined, no standard scales existed, and the administration of surveys varied widely in time. Those disparities prevented systematic comparisons of results and made it difficult to gain a coherent understanding of the physical health conditions of postpartum mothers. More longitudinal research is needed that focuses on the etiology, predictors, and management of the health conditions most prevalent among postpartum mothers. Instruments are needed that target a broader range of physical conditions in respect to type and severity.

AB To benefit from group living, group members need to keep the group cohesive by coordinating time and direction of travelling. Self-organization and leadership are two means of coordination and two types of decision can be made on the group level: combined and consensus. We studied the initiation process of group movements during the morning departure of a group of chacma baboons, Papio hamadryas ursinus, from its sleeping site in De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. Findings from other female-bonded primate groups led us to hypothesize that females should play a major role in the decision-making process. Approximately 75% of the adults made a start attempt, with 62 of 92 attempts being by males. There was no sex difference in the probability of being successful when initiating an attempt. Lactating females initiated fewer than pregnant or cycling females. Thus, at least for this group of chacma baboons, leadership appeared to be distributed and the decision about the timing of departure and travel direction seemed to be a partially shared consensus decision with adult males contributing more to the decision outcome, with a slightly more prominent role of the dominant male. Our results do not support the 'leading females' hypothesis. No behavioural patterns that might serve as specialized signals leading to a more successful recruitment of other group members were observed. The departure process appeared to be coordinated merely through individuals setting an example by moving off. (c) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To identify the concordance in assessments of health and social care needs of pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness as assessed by patients themselves and their mental healthcare professionals. Thirty-five staff-patient pairs were recruited from inpatient and community services. Staff and patients completed the Camberwell Assessment of Need-Mothers Version. There were significant differences in the total number of needs (p < 0.01) and total number of unmet needs (p < 0.001) reported by staff and patients themselves. There was moderate or better agreement on the presence of an unmet need in eight of 26 life domains. Agreement was low in several domains relevant to being a mother-notably pregnancy care, safety to child/others, and practical and emotional childcare domains. Unmet needs were particularly common in the areas of daytime activities, sleep, psychological distress and violence and abuse. Staff and pregnant women and mothers with severe mental illness moderately agree about health and social care needs but agree less often on which needs are unmet. This highlights the importance of the views of the mothers themselves, as well as assessments by staff.

AB The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate relationships among women's body attitudes, physical symptoms, self-esteem, depression, and sleep quality during pregnancy. Pregnant women (N= 215) at 15-25 weeks gestation completed a questionnaire including four body image subscales assessing self-reported feeling fat, attractiveness, strength/fitness, and salience of weight and shape. Women reported on 29 pregnancy-related physical complaints, and completed the Beck Depression Inventory, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In regressions, controlling for retrospective reports of body image, more frequent and intense physical symptoms were related to viewing the self as less strong/fit, and to poorer sleep quality and more depressive symptoms. In a multi-factorial model extending previous research, paths were found from sleep quality to depressive symptoms to self-esteem; self-esteem was found to be a mediator associated with lower scores on feeling fat and salience of weight and shape, and on higher perceived attractiveness.

AB Background: Quantitative information about the elastic properties of the large arteries can be obtained by determination of the pressure and the pulsatile changes of arterial diameter.
   Objective: To study the stiffness of major branches (common carotid artery; CCA, abdominal aorta; AA and femoral artery; FA) in newborn infants.
   Study design: The arterial stiffness index (SI) values were measured with a phase locked loop ultrasound technique to estimate the arterial systolic and diastolic diameters and their correlation with blood pressure.
   Subjects: We studied 62 appropriate-for-gestational age infants (between 30 and 41 weeks of gestation at birth) including 33 preterm infants.
   Results: The systolic and diastolic diameters of the CCA, AA and FA, as well as the SI, increased with the gestational age at birth. In the SI of the FA, there was considerable variation in the individual values for a given gestational age at birth. The gestational age associated increase in stiffness was statistically significant only in the CCA and the AA. Although the mechanical properties of the FA were significantly influenced by physical activities during the active waking and quiet sleeping states, the calculated SI values were less vulnerable to these activities in the central arteries.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that the SI of the FA (peripheral muscular artery) is modified appreciably by vasoactive stimuli. The mechanical properties of the deeper elastic arteries in newborn infants provide sufficiently reliable information about changes caused by development. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Rationale Psychological factors are acknowledged to impact on pregnancy, birth, neonatal outcomes and maternal mental health. The importance of psychological well-being is now recognized within maternity care and UK maternity policy advocates choice and control, equating this to increased quality of experience and improved psychological outcomes. There remains, however, lack of substantive and consistent evidence with regard to the psychological benefits of choice in maternity care. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of choice of maternity care on psychological health outcomes.
   Methods 165 antenatal women were recruited and sampled according to their choices for care. Women were assessed utilizing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Cambridge Worry Scale (CWS), Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), SF-36, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Culture Free Self-esteem Inventory (CFSEI) at 12 and 32 weeks pregnant and 14 days and 6 months postnatal.
   Results No significant differences between groups were revealed on any of the scales or subscales measured. Significant and corresponding differences were identified within groups over time for CWS socio-medical worries, MHLC 'powerful others', SF-36 bodily pain, vitality personal health and change in health, PSQI global sleep. An interaction effect for CFSEI general and social self-esteem was revealed between birth centre and midwifery-led care/main unit women at 14 days postnatal.
   Conclusions These results demonstrate that pregnancy represents a psychological challenge regardless of care type chosen and choice of no one care option confers greater psychological benefit across the maternity experience as a whole. It is possible, however, that differences in experience or environment at critical times can affect psychological status.

AB Complete deficiency in activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) results in neural tube closure defects and death at gestation day 9 in mice. ADNP-deficient embryos exhibit dramatic increases in gene transcripts associated with lipid metabolism coupled to reduction in organogenesis/neurogenesis-related transcripts. In the pluripotent teratocarcinoma cell line P19, ADNP was shown to interact with specific chromatin regions in the neurodifferentiated state, which was associated with binding to the heterochromatin protein 1 alpha. In this study, using P19 cells as a differentiation model, we showed that ADNP expression and cytoplasm/nucleus distribution is unique in neuronal-differentiated cells compared to cardiovascular and nondifferentiated pluripotent cells. ADNP-like immunohistochemical localization to the neuronal cytoplasm and neurites was shown in this study not only in the cellular model but also in the brain cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb. Small hairpin RNA ADNP downregulation was used to further investigate ADNP involvement in p19 neurodifferentiation. An approximately 80% robust reduction in ADNP led to a substantial reduction in embryoid body formation and a significant reduction (approximately 50%) in neurite numbers. These results position ADNP in direct association with neuronal cell differentiation and maturation.

AB Over the past 40 years, it has been recognised that the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis undergoes adaptations through pregnancy and lactation that might contribute to avoidance of adverse effects of stress on the mother and offspring. The extent of the global adaptations in the HPA axis has been revealed and the underlying mechanisms investigated within the last 20 years. Both basal, including the circadian rhythm, and stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid secretory patterns are altered. Throughout most of pregnancy, and in lactation, these changes predominantly reflect reduced drive by the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurones in the parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). An accompanying profound attenuation of HPA axis responses to a wide variety of psychological and physical stressors emerges after mid-pregnancy and persists until the end of lactation. Central to this suppression of stress responsiveness is reduced activation of the pPVN CRF neurones. This is consequent on the reduced effectiveness of the stimulation of brainstem afferents to these CRF neurones (for physical stressors) and of altered processing by limbic structures (for emotional stressors). The mechanism of reduced CRF neurone responses to physical stressors in pregnancy is the suppression of noradrenaline release in the PVN by an up-regulated endogenous opioid mechanism, which is induced by neuroactive steroid produced from progesterone. By contrast, in lactation suckling the young provides a neural stimulus that dampens the HPA axis circadian rhythm and reduces stress responses. Reduced noradrenergic input activity is involved in reduced stress responses in lactation, although central prolactin action also appears important. Such adaptations limit the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure on the foetus(es) and facilitate appropriate metabolic and immune responses.

AB For the first time, the relationship between depressive symptoms and sleep quality was explored prospectively during pregnancy. Participants (n = 273) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Beck Depression Inventory at three 8-week intervals, starting from 15-23 weeks gestation. In addition to sleep quality and depression remaining relatively stable during pregnancy, findings revealed that sleep quality earlier in pregnancy predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms at later stage in pregnancy (after controlling for prior depression levels). In contrast, there was no evidence to suggest that depressive symptoms earlier in pregnancy impacted on sleep quality later on. Given that depressive symptomatology can lead to major depression and given the prevalence of pre- and postnatal depression, our findings suggest that screening for sleep problems during pregnancy may be of clinical significance.

AB Although fatigue is a common experience for pregnant women and new mothers, few measures of fatigue have been validated for use with this population. To address this gap, the authors assessed psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, which was used in 2 independent samples of pregnant women. Results indicated that the psychometric properties of the scale were very similar across samples and time points. The scale possesses a high level of internal consistency, has good convergent validity with measures of sleep quality and depression, and discriminates well from a measure of social support. Contrary to previous evaluations of the MAF, data strongly suggest that the scale represents a unidimensional construct best represented by a single factor. Results indicate that the MAF is a useful measure of fatigue among pregnant and Postpartum women.

ID SLEEPING POSITION; MATERNAL SMOKING; SIDS; EXPOSURE
AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether previously identified risk factors for sudden death syndrome have a significant impact in a developing country.
   METHODS: Retrospective longitudinal case-control study carried out in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil. Cases (N=39) were infants born between 1996 and 2000 who died suddenly and unexpectedly at home during sleep and were diagnosed with sudden death syndrome. Controls (N=117) were infants matched by age and sex who died in hospitals due to other conditions. Data were collected from postmortem examination records and questionnaires answers. A conditional logistic model was used to identify factors associated with the outcome.
   RESULTS: Mean age at death of cases was 3.2 months. The frequencies of infants regarding gestational age, breastfeeding and regular medical visits were similar in both groups. Sleeping position for most cases and controls was the lateral one. Supine sleeping position was found for few infants in both groups. Maternal variables, age below 20 years (OR=2, 95% CI:1.1; 5.1) and smoking of more than 10 cigarettes per day during pregnancy (OR=3, 95% CI: 1.3; 6.4), significantly increased the risk for the syndrome. Socioeconomic characteristics were similar in both groups and did not affect risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Infant-maternal and socioeconomic profiles of cases in a developing country closely resembled the profile described in the literature, and risk factors were similar as well. However, individual characteristics were identified as risks in the population studied, such as smoking during pregnancy and maternal age below 20 years.

AB OBJECTIVES In December 2005 and March 2006, Niger conducted nationwide integrated campaigns to distribute polio vaccine and long lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to children < 5 years of age. We evaluated the campaign effectiveness, net retention, insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership, and usage.
   METHODS Two nationwide cross-sectional surveys in January 2006 (dry season) and September 2006 (rainy season), using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design. We mapped selected communities, selected households by simple random sampling, and administered questionnaires by interviewers using personal digital assistants.
   RESULTS The first survey showed that ITN ownership in all households was 6.3% prior to the campaign, increasing to 65.1% after the campaign in the second survey. The second survey also showed that 73.4% of households with children < 5 received an LLIN and that 97.7% of households that received >= one LLIN retained it. The wealth equity ratio for ITN ownership in households with children < 5 increased from 0.17 prior to the campaign to 0.79 afterward. During the dry season, 15.4% of all children < 5 and 11.3% of pregnant women slept under an ITN, while during rainy season, 55.5% of children < 5 and 48.2% of pregnant women slept under an ITN.
   CONCLUSIONS Free distribution during the integrated campaign rapidly increased ITN ownership and decreased inequities between those in the highest and lowest wealth quintiles. Retention of ITNs was very high, and usage was high during malaria transmission season. However, ITN ownership and usage by vulnerable groups continues to fall short of RBM targets, and additional strategies are needed to increase ownership and usage.

TI Voices of the Women: Feedback from Women of Child-bearing Age who are
   Living with HIV can help Improve Efficacy of Psychosocial Interventions
SO WEST INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID JAMAICA; TRANSMISSION; ADJUSTMENT; KINGSTON; MOTHERS
AB Background. We hypothesized that voluntary counselling and testing during pregnancy are necessary but not sufficient to provide the holistic psychosocial support needed by Jamaican women living with HIV and/or AIDS. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated a range of coping methods and support systems used by HIV-infected women and a group of their HIV-negative counterparts before, during and immediately after their pregnancies.
   Methods: Women attending obstetric clinics in urban Jamaica completed a quantitative survey aimed at discovering coping behaviours, social and spiritual support systems. Pre-survey focus group studies and key informant interviews contributed to the design of the questionnaire while post-survey focus groups were used to probe the validity of the data gleaned from the questionnaire survey. Survey data were analyzed using non-parametric tests for trend with independent univariate tests.
   Results: Fifty-five HIV-infected women and 51 HIV-negative women completed the survey. Compared with HIV-negative women, more HIV-infected women reported both feeling depressed (p = 0.07) and having difficulty concentrating (p = 0.05) during the month immediately prior to the study. Other statistically significant differences included: HIV-infected women were more likely to pray, to sleep and to change eating habits in response to worry and stress (p = 0.001 in each instance). Although several women declared religious faith, significantly fewer HIV-infected women were willing to talk to a religious leader about their problems compared to their HIV-negative counterparts (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Participation of HIV-infected women in post-survey focus groups augmented the survey findings. Many of the women reported negative emotions and some indicated serious challenges in accessing social support. The results point to the need for systematic documentation of psychosocial profiles as part of the approach to caring for these women. In addition, in the Jamaican sociocultural context, we recommend improved training of religious leaders and healthcare providers in psychosocial issues.

AB Orexin-A and -B are hypothalamic peptides which, in the adult brain, are associated with arousal, increased vigilance, and the seeking and ingestion of food. Because the fetus is mostly asleep, and hunger is a physiological state unlikely to arise until birth, we hypothesized that orexigenic neurons in the lateral and dorso-medial hypothalamic areas (LHA, DMH) and their projections to the locus coeruleus (LC) would develop only near the time of birth. We therefore determined orexin expression in fetal sheep, where birth occurs over a tightly regulated interval of 146-148 days gestation. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the presence and distribution of orexin-A positive fibres and cells at the level of the hypothalamus and LC in fetal (125-137 and 145+ days gestation age) and newborn sheep brains. Orexin was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples taken from chronically catheterised fetal and newborn sheep, and in CSF taken from fetuses and lambs at postmortem. Orexin-A positive cells bodies were observed in the hypothalamus, and orexin-A fibres were found throughout all hypothalamic, thalamic, and brain stem regions of all the fetal and newborn brains examined. Orexin-A was present in plasma and CSF at similar concentrations in fetal and newborn sheep. The presence of orexin in hypothalamic neurons and CSF throughout late gestation suggests that orexinergic regulation of hunger, appetite and the sleep/wake cycle is inhibited, by mechanisms yet to be identified, until the time of parturition.

AB Background: The aim was to investigate the susceptibility of embryos from 2 rat strains (U and H) to a 48 hours ethanol exposure in early pregnancy, both in vivo and in vitro.
   Methods: The embryos were studied on gestational days 9 to 11. We used 1 ethanol dose in vivo (6 g/kg x 2), 3 different ethanol concentrations in vitro (88 mM, 132 mM, 176 mM) and also attempted to diminish the teratogenic effect in vitro by supplying the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 0.5 mM) to the culture medium.
   Results: The U embryos were more damaged by ethanol than the H embryos, both in vivo and in vitro. NAC addition diminished, but failed to completely normalize, the embryonic maldevelopment. Ethanol increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the U embryos both in vivo and in vitro, but not in the H embryos. Furthermore, ethanol caused increased Caspase-3 immunostaining in U embryos, but not in H embryos. Ethanol exposure in vivo did not alter CuZnSOD and MnSOD mRNA levels in U and H embryos. In vitro, however, the ethanol-exposed U embryos increased their CuZnSOD and MnSOD mRNA levels, whereas the CuZnSOD mRNA was unchanged and MnSOD mRNA decreased in the H embryos, in neither strain did NAC exert any effect. The U embryos increased catalase gene expression in response to ethanol in vivo, but decreased catalase mRNA levels in vitro, changes normalized by NAC. The H embryos did not alter catalase mRNA levels in vivo, but increased gene expression in vitro, with no NAC effect. Ethanol affected the gene expression of the other ROS scavenging enzymes and the developmental genes studied-Bmp-4, Ret, Shh, Pax-6-similarly in the 2 strains.
   Conclusions: The findings support a role for genetic predisposition, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in ethanol teratogenicity, and suggest that the teratogenic predisposition of the more susceptible U rats may reside, at least in part, in the regulation of the ROS scavenging enzymes in the U embryos.

AB Background: Air travel may pose risks to ex-preterm neonates due to the low oxygen environment encountered during flights. We aimed to study the utility of the preflight hypoxia challenge test (HCT) to detect in-flight hypoxia in such infants.
   Methods: Ex-preterm (gestation <= 35 completed weeks) infants ready for air transfer from the intensive/special care nursery to regional hospitals were studied. A pretransfer HCT was performed by exposing infants to 14% oxygen for 20 min. Failure was defined as a sustained fall in pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) <= 85%. A nurse blinded to the test result monitored the in-flight oxygen saturations in each infant. lf SPO2 fell to <= 85%, oxygen was administered.
   Results: Forty-six infants with median gestation of 32.2 weeks (range, 24 to 35.6 weeks) and birth weight of 1,667 g (range, 655 to 2,815 g) were recruited. No infants were receiving supplemental oxygen at the time of transfer. The HCT was performed at a median corrected age of 35.8 weeks (range, 33.1 to 43 weeks). Thirty-five infants (76%) passed the test, and the remainder failed. During the flight, 16 infants met the criteria for in-flight oxygen, but 12 of these infants (75%) had passed the preflight HCT. Of the 11 infants who failed the HCT, only 4 infants (36%) required in-flight oxygen. The HCT incorrectly predicted in-flight responses in 42% (19 of 46 infants).
   Conclusions: A significant percentage of ex-preterm neonates require in-flight oxygen supplementation. The HCT is not accurate for identifying which infants are at risk for in-flight hypoxia.

AB This study aimed to determine the LD50, toxic effects on organogenesis/fetal-development, physical aspects, and developmental/neurobehavioral reflexes of litters previously exposed to Cecropia glazioui SNETHL (Cg) extract during the entire gestational period. Swiss mice were submitted to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 g/kg/p.o. Female rats received 1.0 g/kg/day of Cg extract (G1, n = 10) or 1.0 mL/kg/day of deionized water (G2, n = 10) during pregnancy. The number of successful gestations, pregnant females weight and born/dead-born offsprings were evaluated. Physical development (offspring weight; fluff and hair appearing; ear unsticking and opening; incisor teeth eruption; eyes opening; testis descent; vagina opening; rearing frequency; uprightness latency and negative geotaxis) and the sleeping time (30 mg/kg/i.p. sodium pentobarbital assay) were also observed. Open field assay evaluated the developmental/neurobehavioral reflexes of pups. LD50 was higher than 5.0 g/kg. The extract did not affect the gestation number, born/dead-born offspring number and the female weight during pregnancy. The weight and the physical development of both genders pups were not affected (p > 0.05), but the uprightness latency and the negative geotaxis reflexes were enhanced and the rearing frequency decreased (p < 0.05). Ambulation, cleaning activity, sleeping time, and immobility were not affected (p > 0.05). We concluded that Cg extract showed low toxicity to pregnant rats and their litters.

AB Objectives: To explore the relationship between infant feeding and maternal mental well-being among women of Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnicity; and to explore the sources of advice, information and support available to women before and after childbirth.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey of infant feeding and maternal well-being via structured interviews conducted in the home.
   Setting: Home visits within two inner-city wards of Newcastle upon Tyne.
   Subjects: Eighty-six women of South Asian ethnicity.
   Results: Enjoyment of everyday activities was higher among women who breast-fed only (P = 0.028); whereas feeling sad or crying during pregnancy was lower among breast-feeding women (P = 0.005), as was not sleeping well (P = 0.003) and feeling that everything was too much (P = 0.039), compared with women Who used formula or mixed feeding. Women who breast-fed only had better mean mood scores than those who formula-fed or those who both breast-fed and formula-fed (P < 0.001). Mean mood responses were also significantly associated with the mother's level of understanding of English and number of years in education (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively). The association between method of feeding and maternal mood remained strong after controlling for the effects of English language and maternal education.
   Conclusions: The Study suggests that breast-feeding may be an important mediator of maternal mental well-being after childbirth. Community-based, programmes tailored to the needs of Bangladeshi and Pakistani women which support breast-feeding and encourage exclusive breast-feeding may be of benefit.

AB The term biological clock is usually used by physicians and psychologists to refer to the declining fertility, increasing risk of fetal birth defects and alterations to hormone levels experienced by women as they age. Female fecundity declines slowly after the age of 30 years and more rapidly after 40 and is considered the main limiting factor in treating infertility. However, there are several scientific reports, chapters in books and review articles suggesting that men may also have a biological clock. The aim of our study was to conduct a review of the literature, based on the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), to evaluate the male biological clock. After adjustments for other factors, the data demonstrate that the likelihood that a fertile couple will take more than 12 months to conceive nearly doubles from 8% when the man is < 25 years old to 15% when he is > 35 years old. Thus, paternal age is a further factor to be taken into account when deciding on the prognosis for infertile couples. Also, increasing male age is associated with a significant decline in fertility (five times longer to achieve pregnancy at the age of 45 years). Patients and their physicians therefore need to understand the effects of the male biological clock on sexual and reproductive health, in that it leads to erectile dysfunction and male infertility, as well as its potential implications for important medical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

AB BACKGROUND: Maternal exposure to wood fuel smoke may lead to impaired fetal growth due to hypoxia and or oxidative stress from smoke constituents such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter.
   OBJECTIVES: We studied the risk of low birth weight (LBW) and reduced mean birth weight in relation to reported use of wood for cooking during the prenatal period, compared with natural gas (NG).
   METHODS: We studied a historical cohort of women who had a singleton live birth in the years 2000-2002, from a semirural area of Pakistan. Infant's birth weight was obtained from records, and prenatal records had data for maternal body mass index and parity. Cooking habits, daytime sleep habits, and type of fuel used during the pregnancies in 2000-2002 were ascertained by a survey done in 2004-2005. We performed multiple linear and logistic regression modeling using propensity scores to adjust for confounding variables.
   RESULTS: Unadjusted mean (+/- SD) birth weight was 2.78 +/- 0.45 kg in wood users, and 2.84 +/- 0.43 kg (p < 0.06) in NG users. Infants born to wood users averaged 82 g lighter than infants born to NG users when weight was adjusted for confounders (p < 0.07). The rate of LBW (< 2,500 g) was 22.7% among wood users compared with 15.0% in NG users (p < 0.01), for an adjusted relative risk of 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 1.10-2-34). The population attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use was estimated to be 24%.
   CONCLUSION: Cooking with wood fuel during pregnancy, a potentially modifiable exposure, was associated with LBW and marginally lower mean birth weight compared with using NG.

AB The dry spiny forest of southern Madagascar is a highly unpredictable environment in terms of the amount and distribution of rainfall. The region is also subject to marked El Nino oscillations. One of the inhabitants of the region is Microcebus griseorufus (Kollman, 1910), the reddish-grey mouse lemur. During the 4 yr of the study, the focal population underwent marked fluctuations in size and exhibited a relatively long reproductive season: September-May. Subjects used daily torpor and expressed opportunistic seasonal fattening when food availability was high. They fed mainly on gum, especially during periods of drought. The estimated sex-ratio of the population is 54% female. Young males dispersed. Females and less frequently, males, associated in same-sex pairs that sometimes joined to form larger sleeping groups. I observed both erratic and resident males, the latter sometimes associated with females in sleeping groups. Mating occurred from September to January and involved mate-guarding. Individual female home ranges (N=14) overlapped with, on average, 2.8 +/- 0.3 male home ranges (range 2-5), whereas individual male home ranges (N=12) overlapped with 4.7 +/- 0.4 female home ranges (range 2-7). Female estrus was not synchronized, even within the female pairs, allowing alloparental care. Gestation lasted 52 d in 1 female, and litter size could be as high as 3; 20 reproductive females out of 37 adult females raised only 1 or 2 young per year.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate psychological aspects of childhood asthma and the connections between the illness and behavioral disturbances in asthmatic children. Study design: We selected a group of 47 asthmatic children and a control group of 47 healthy children. The only criterion for inclusion was that the children be between 4 and 10 years of age; criteria for exclusion were neurological pathologies, cognitive retardation, and serious or chronic systemic disease. The collaboration of a psychologist and a comparative examination of questionnaires used in medical literature helped us prepare a calibrated questionnaire for our study. Results: In our study, the asthmatic children show significantly more behavioral and psychological disturbances than the children in the control group. Conclusions: Within the group of asthmatic children the boys and the children whose illness has lasted less than 4 years, are at greater risk of such disturbances; stressful situations connected to the birth or previous pregnancies can be seen more often in the group of asthmatic children than in the control group; before the onset of the illness the asthmatic children had significant sleep disturbances.

AB Recent studies on mice with mutations in the Clock gene have shown that this mutation disrupts oestrus cyclicity and interferes with successful pregnancy. In order to determine whether two other molecular components of the main clock, namely the period genes, Per1 and Per2, have an effect on the length of the oestrous cycle and the reproductive success, we used Per1- and Per2-deficient females. We show that although fecundity of young adult Per mutant females does not differ from that of wild-type females, middle-aged Per mutant mice are characterised by lower reproductive success than the control group. This may be a consequence of irregularity and acyclicity of the oestrous cycle of the middle-aged mutants. Besides, we demonstrate that Per mutant females have significantly more embryonal implantations in the uterus than successfully delivered offspring. The reproductive deficits of the middle-aged Per mutant females are comparable with those seen in aged wild-type mice. This suggests that Per1 and Per2 mutations cause an advanced ageing.

AB The purpose of this systematic review is to access the current state of knowledge concerning the role for melatonin in human pregnancy. Melatonin is a neurciendocrine hormone secreted nightly by pineal gland and regulates biological rhythms. The nighttime serum concentration of melatonin shows an incremental change toward the end of pregnancy. This small lipophilic indoleamine crosses the placenta freely without being altered. Maternal melatonin enters the fetal circulation with ease providing photoperiodic information to the fetus. Melatonin works in a variety of ways as a circadian rhythm modulator, endocrine modulator, irnmunomoclulator, direct free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant and cytoprotective agent in human pregnancy, and it appears to be essential for successful pregnancy. It also seems to be involved in correcting the pathophysiology of complications during pregnancy including those due to pre-eclampsia and fetal brain damage. The scientific evidence supporting a role for melatonin abortion, in human pregnancy is summarized. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This study re-examined the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among pregnant women in Japan based on the diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG), and to epidemiologically clarify factors associated with RLS, including sleep disorders and pregnancy status. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at 344 clinical obstetric institutions in Japan. A total of 19 441 women with a confirmed pregnancy were instructed to complete a self-administered questionnaire during the time they spent waiting for a consultation. univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used. The prevalence of RLS among the women was 2.9%. The prevalence by age group exhibited a U-shaped curve with the value for those in their thirties as the minimum. The prevalence became more than twice higher in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were stronger associations between RLS and the third trimester of pregnancy, multipara, smoking, subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, early morning awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.92, 0.76, 1.54, 1.68, 2.44, 1.80, 1.89, respectively). The prevalence of RLS among pregnant women in Japan was not as high as previously reported, similar to that for the general Japanese population. As the prevalence of RLS is lower than that in Western countries, genetic backgrounds may contribute more to the observed differences than pregnancy does. in this study, like others, the prevalence of RLS increased during the third trimester of pregnancy, and strong associations were observed between RLS and difficulty initiating sleep and between RLS and difficulty maintaining sleep.

AB Aim: To analyse the importance of mothers' smoking during pregnancy and/or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure in early childhood for children's health and well-being at the age of 3 years.
   Methods: Four groups from a population based cohort (n = 8850) were compared: children with nonsmoking mother during pregnancy and nonsmoking parents at the age of 3 years (n = 7091); children with only foetal exposure (n = 149); children exposed only postnatally (n = 895) and children exposed both pre- and postnatally (n = 595). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
   Results: Children exposed both pre- and postnatally had more wheezing (1.14; 1.07-1.21) and rhinitis (1.16; 1.06-1.26), used more cough-mixture (1.07; 1.01-1.14) and broncodilatating drugs (1.08; 1.02-1.15) and suffered more from excessive crying (1.31; 1.13-1.51) and irritability (1.27; 1.09-1.48) compared to children with nonsmoking parents. Children exposed only postnatally had more rhinitis (1.24; 1.12-1.37), used more cough-mixture (1.14; 1.05-1.29) and suffered more from poor sleep (1.26; 1.07-1.47) than children of nonsmoking parents. Children with prenatal exposure only used more broncodilatating drugs (1.45; 1.03-2.04) and suffered more from poor sleep (2.06; 1.09-3.87).

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is high among infants with chronic lung disease (CLD), and the associated pathogenic mechanisms are not clear. The relationship of symptoms to the extent or duration of acid reflux events (AREs) is not well known in preterm or term infants. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between spatial (height) and temporal (duration) characteristics of AREs (pH < 4.0) with symptoms in CLD. We tested the hypothesis that in infants with CLD, AREs into the pharynx are associated with increased symptom occurrence and delayed clearance.
   METHODS: Nine infants born at 29.8 +/- 5.5 wk gestation (mean +/- SD, range 24.7-39.0 wk) with CLD were evaluated for GER at 49.7 +/- 8.0 wk postmenstrual age (mean +/- SD, range 39.9-67.4 wk). Esophageal manometry was first performed to determine the nares-lower esophageal sphincter (LES) distance. A pH-impedance probe was placed at 87% of the nares-LES distance, and a recording was performed for about 24 h at cribside. Symptoms (respiratory, sensory, and movement) were documented by nurses that were blinded to the pH-impedance recordings. A symptom was considered associated with an ARE if it occurred 2 min before, during, or 2 min after the ARE. The proximal extent and associated clearance mechanisms were correlated with symptom sensitivity index (SSI = number of AREs with symptoms/total AREs * 100). Multiple logistic regression methods, analysis of variance (ANOVA) models, and chi(2) tests were performed. Data are described as median, mean +/- SD, or %.
   RESULTS: A total of 511 AREs, based on pH-Impedance methods, were analyzed from 203 h of recordings in the nine infants. The distal esophagus was the maximal height reached in 80% of AREs (P < 0.001, compared to other esophageal segments). Overall 33% of the AREs were associated with symptoms, and an SSI of 77% was noted with high AREs into the pharynx. The average acid clearance time was prolonged with symptomatic AREs versus nonsymptomatic AREs by 3.5-fold (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence and frequency of symptoms with AREs depend on the most proximal extent of the ARE and the acid clearance time.

AB Exposure to hostile conditions results in a series of coordinated responses aimed at enhancing the probability of survival. The activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a pivotal role in the stress response. While the short-term activation of the HPA axis allows adaptive responses to the challenge, in the long run this can be devastating for the organism. In particular, life events occurring during the perinatal period have strong long-term effects on the behavioral and neuroendocrine response to stressors. In male and female rats exposed to prenatal restraint stress (PRS), these effects include a long-lasting hyperactivation of the HPA response associated with an altered circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion. Furthermore, male animals exhibit sleep disturbances. In males, these HPA dysfunctions have been reported in infant, young, adult and aged animals, thus suggesting a permanent effect of early stress. Interestingly, after exposure to an intense inescapable footshock, female PRS rats durably exhibit a blunted corticosterone secretion response to stress. In male PRS rats exposed to an alcohol challenge, the HPA axis is similarly hyporesponsive. Rats exposed to PRS also show behavioral disturbances. Both male and female PRS rats show high anxiety levels and depression-like behavior during adulthood, although some studies suggest that female PRS rats present low anxiety levels. With ageing, male and female PRS rats exhibit memory impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks, while female PRS rats improve their memory performance during adulthood. The gender effect on behavior seems to be related to a reduction in hippocampal plasticity in male PRS rats, and an increase in female PRS rats. Despite the permanent imprinting induced by early stress, the dysfunctions observed after PRS can be reversed by environmental or pharmacological strategies such as environmental enrichment or antidepressive and neurotrophic treatments. Mechanisms underlying the effects of PRS on the offspring remain largely unknown. However, previous studies have demonstrated that maternal glucocorticoids during pregnancy play an important role in the HPA disturbances reported in male offspring. Finally, gestational stress has long-lasting effects on the HPA axis and on behavior in the dams. Alterations in maternal behavior could thus also make a strong contribution to the long-term effects of PRS, through epigenetic mechanisms. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate the prevalence and factors associated with co-sleeping and nighttime waking among the children of the Pelotas 2004 cohort at 12 months of age.
   Methods:All children born in the city of Pelotas, RS, Brazil during 2004 were enrolled on a longitudinal study. Mothers were interviewed at delivery and once more at 12 months of age to obtain information on their sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics and on their children's sleep and the environment in which their children sleep. Co-sleeping was defined as habitually sharing the bed with another person. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson regression.
   Results: The prevalence of co-sleeping at 12 months was 45.8% (95%CI 44.2-47.3). Co-sleeping was more common among mothers with low socioeconomic status, less education, younger mothers, mothers with more previous births and among children who wake at night. The prevalence of nighttime waking was 46.1% (95%CI 44.6-47.7). Nighttime waking was more common among boys and among the offspring of mothers who had had a greater number of previous pregnancies and of mothers who had been employed while pregnant.
   Conclusion: Co-sleeping and nighttime waking are common among this study population, indicating a need to continue follow-up in order to observe how long these habits persist through childhood and to investigate their consequences for child development and behavior.

AB Complications during pregnancy and birth asphyxia lead to brain injury, with devastating consequences for the neonate. In this paper we present evidence that the steroid environment during pregnancy and at birth aids in protecting the fetus and neonate from asphyxia-induced injury. Earlier studies show that the placental progesterone production has a role in the synthesis and release of neuroactive steroids or their precursors into the fetal circulation. Placental precursor support leads to remarkably high concentrations of allopregnanolone in the fetal brain and to a dramatic decline with the loss of the placenta at birth. These elevated concentrations influence the distinct behavioral states displayed by the late gestation fetus and exert a suppressive effect that maintains sleep-like behavioral states that are present for much of fetal life. This suppression reduces CNS excitability and suppresses excitotoxicity. With the availability of adequate precursors, mechanisms within the fetal brain ultimately control neurosteroid levels. These mechanisms respond to episodes of acute hypoxia by increasing expression of 5 alpha-reductase and P450scc enzymes and allopregnanolone synthesis in the brain. This allopregnanolone response, and potentially that of other neurosteroids including 5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (TH-DOC), reduces hippocampal cell death following acute asphyxia and suggests that stimulation of neurosteroid production may protect the fetal brain. Importantly, inhibition of neurosteroid synthesis in the fetal brain increases the basal cell death suggesting a role in controlling developmental processes late in gestation. Synthesis of neurosteroid precursors in the fetal adrenal such as deoxycorticosterone (DOC), and their conversion to active neurosteroids in the fetal brain may also have a role in neuroprotection. This suggests that the adrenal glands provide precursor DOC for neurosteroid synthesis after birth and this may lead to a switch from allopregnanolone alone to neuroprotection mediated by allopregnanolone and TH-DOC.

AB Research suggests that the attitude of men towards pregnancy, childbirth and child-caring is different from that of women. Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants. Fathers' attitude towards breast-feeding seemed to be ambiguous; it was a matter of necessity, but made them feel insignificant. Changing relationship towards partner was common but it was not necessarily for the worst and often resulted in a more closely united relationship. However, tiredness because of lack of sleep could result in increased irritability towards problems. Developing relationship with their child implied increasing possibilities to learn to know the infant's signals. Fathers are one of two parents, and hence are important for their child's growth and development, emotional health and cognitive development. Knowledge about first-time fathers' experiences during the early infancy of their children may bring about increased support from midwives and child health nurses.

AB Pregnancy impacts common symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as energy, appetite, weight change, and sleep and somatic complaints. However, it is not known whether the presentation of depression during pregnancy is different from that at other times in women's lives. This study compares the severity of symptoms of depression in 61 pregnant women with MDD (PD), 50 nonpregnant women with MDD (D), and 41 pregnant women without MDD (P). Despite equivalent overall depression severity, PD women had lower scores on suicidality, guilt, and early insomnia and higher scores on psychomotor retardation than D women. The severity of other depressive symptoms was similar in the two depressed groups. As expected on the basis of the selection criteria, overall depression severity and the severity of individual symptoms were significantly higher in the PD group than in the P group but effect sizes for somatic symptoms were smaller than for psychological symptoms. The results suggest that the profile of depression symptoms of women with MDD who are pregnant does not differ much from that of depressed nonpregnant women. Depressive symptoms, particularly psychological symptoms of depression, during pregnancy should be taken seriously and not be dismissed as a normal part of the pregnancy experience.

AB Objectives: We sought to determine if postpartum mood symptoms and depressive episodes exhibit familial aggregation in bipolar I pedigrees.
   Methods: A total of 1,130 women were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies as part of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Genetics Initiative Bipolar Disorder Collaborative Study and were asked whether they had ever experienced mood symptoms within four weeks postpartum. Women were also asked whether either of two major depressive episodes described in detail occurred postpartum. We examined the odds of postpartum mood symptoms in female siblings, who had previously been pregnant and had a diagnosis of bipolar I, bipolar II, or schizoaffective (bipolar type) disorders (n = 303), given one or more relatives with postpartum mood symptoms.
   Results: The odds ratio for familial aggregation of postpartum mood symptoms was 2.31 (p = 0.011) in an Any Mood Symptoms analysis (n = 304) and increased to 2.71 (p = 0.005) when manic symptoms were excluded, though this was not significantly different from the Any Mood Symptoms analysis. We also examined familial aggregation of postpartum major depressive episodes; however, the number of subjects was small.
   Conclusions: Limitations of the study include the retrospective interview, the fact that the data were collected for other purposes and the inability to control for such factors as medication use. Taken together with previous studies, these data provide support for the hypothesis that there may be a genetic basis for the trait of postpartum mood symptoms generally and postpartum depressive symptoms in particular in women with bipolar disorder. Genetic linkage and association studies incorporating this trait are warranted.

AB Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in asthma patients and can contribute to sleep disruption. The aim of the present study was to determine the time-related distribution of GER events together with their impact on sleep in asthmatic subjects with GER disease symptoms. The inclusion criteria were: 18-65 years, controlled moderate to severe asthma and GER-compatible clinical evidence. The exclusion criteria were: chronic obstructive lung disease, smoking, infections of the upper airways, use of oral corticosteroids, other co-morbidities, pregnancy, sleep-related disorders, night-time shift work, and the use of substances with impact on sleep. Asthmatic patients with nocturnal symptoms were excluded. All-night polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring were recorded simultaneously. Of the 147 subjects selected, 31 patients and 31 controls were included. Seventeen patients were classified as DeMeester positive and 14 as DeMeester negative. Both groups displayed similar outcomes when general variables were considered. Sleep stage modification one minute prior to GER was observed in the DeMeester-positive group. Awakening was the most frequent occurrence at GER onset and during the 1-min period preceding 38% of the nocturnal GER. Sleep stage 2 was also prevalent and preceded 36% of GER events. In the DeMeester-negative group, awakening was the most frequent response before and during GER. Modifications in sleep stages, arousals or awakenings were associated with 75% of the total GER events analyzed during the period of one minute before and after the fall of esophageal pH below 4 in the DeMeester-positive group. These data provide evidence that sleep modifications precede the GER events in asthmatic patients.

AB Some hibernating animals are known to reduce muscle and bone loss associated with mechanical unloading during prolonged immobilisation, compared to humans. However, here we show that wild pregnant polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are the first known animals to avoid significant bone loss altogether, despite six months of continuous hibernation. Using serum biochemical markers of bone turnover, we showed that concentrations for bone resorption are not significantly increased as a consequence of hibernation in wild polar bears. This is in sharp contrast to previous studies on other hibernating species, where for example, black bears (Ursus americanus), show a 3-4 fold increase in serum bone resorption concentrations post-hibernation, and must compensate for this loss through rapid bone recovery on remobilisation, to avoid the risk of fracture. In further contrast to black bears, serum concentrations of bone formation markers were highly significantly increased in pregnant female polar bears compared to non-pregnant, thus non-hibernating females both prior to and after hibernation. However, bone formation concentrations in new mothers were significantly reduced compared to pre-hibernation concentrations. The de-coupling of bone turnover in favour of bone formation prior to hibernation, suggests that wild polar bears may posses a unique physiological mechanism for building bone in protective preparation against expected osteopenia associated with disuse, starvation, and hormonal drives to mobilise calcium for reproduction, during hibernation. Understanding this physiological mechanism could have profound implications for a natural solution for the prevention of osteoporosis in animals subjected to captivity with inadequate space for exercise, humans subjected to prolonged bed rest while recovering from illness, or astronauts exposed to antigravity during spaceflight.

AB Objective: To simultaneously investigate the polysomnography (PSG) and nonstress test (NST) records of pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to observe NST changes during maternal desaturation and determine maternal and fetal outcomes. Methods: A prospective observational study of pregnant women assessed by questionnaire for symptoms of OSA. Women with self-reported frequent snoring or apnea were offered PSG and NST Result: OSA was diagnosed in 4 (11.4%) of the 35 pregnant women who underwent PSG. Three (75%) had fetal heart decelerations accompanying maternal desaturation. The neonates of women diagnosed with OSA had lower mean Apgar scores and birth weights compared with neonates of women without OSA. Three neonates from the women diagnosed with OSA were admitted to the newborn healthcare unit. Conclusion: OSA in pregnancy has important maternal and fetal outcomes. Pregnant women should be assessed for symptoms of OSA and suspected cases should be offered PSG. (c) 2007 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of circadian rhythm changes on fetal-placental development in pregnant rats.
   MATERIAL AN D METHOD: Pregnant rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups with 10 rats in each group. Group 1: 12 hours light 12 hours dark period (n: 10, Control Group); Group 2: 6 hours light 6 hours dark period (n: 10); Group 3: constant light group (n:10); Group 4: constant dark group (n:10). Rats were made to deliver by cesarean birth at the end of their pregnancy and their placenta, number and weight of the offspring, and placental histopathological changes were examined.
   FINDING: Fetal number in the constant dark group was found significant in comparison to constant light group (p < 0.01). Fetal weight in all groups with altered circadian rhythm was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.01). The decrease in fetal weight was more evident in the constant light group than in the constant dark group (p < 0.01). Comparison of the histopathological findings of the placenta showed that placental edema, fibrin accumulation and leukocyte infiltration were significantly higher in constant light and constant dark groups than in other groups (p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: Circadian rhythm change in pregnancy adversely affects the fetal-placental development. More detailed studies are needed to clarify this mechanism.

TI Glutaric aciduria type II and narcolepsy in pregnancy
SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

DT Article
ID DIAGNOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Glutaric aciduria type II is a rare disorder affecting the metabolism of fatty acid oxidation and several mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes. Narcolepsy and cataplexy is a disorder affecting sleep cycles and rapid eye movement activity. There is little information on outcome or management for either disorder in pregnancy.
   CASE: This is a case of a 16-year-old with glutaric aciduria type II and narcolepsy with cataplexy, treated with L-carnitine, riboflavin, fluoxetine, and modafinil during pregnancy. Intrapartum management included intravenous carnitine administration, and the patient underwent cesarean delivery at term without complication.
   CONCLUSION: This inborn error of metabolism and sleep disorder can be effectively treated during pregnancy with nutritional supplementation and stimulants. Because of the risk of cataplexy during labor, cesarean delivery is recommended to minimize the patient's risk.

AB OBJECTIVES To evaluate barriers preventing pregnant women from using insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 5 years after the launch of the national malaria strategy promoting these measures in Kenya.
   METHODS All women aged 15-49 years were interviewed during a community survey in four districts between December 2006 and January 2007. Women pregnant in the last 12 months were asked about their age, parity, education, use of nets, ITN, antenatal care (ANC) services and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) (overall and for IPT) during pregnancy. Homestead assets were recorded and used to develop a wealth index. Travel time to ANC clinics was computed using a geographic information system algorithm. Predictors of net and IPT use were defined using multivariate logistic regression.
   RESULTS Overall 68% of pregnant women used a net; 52% used an ITN; 84% attended an ANC clinic at least once and 74% at least twice. Fifty-three percent of women took at least one dose of IPT-SP, however only 22% took two or more doses. Women from the least poor homesteads (OR = 2.53, 1.36-4.68) and those who used IPT services (OR = 1.73, 1.24-2.42) were more likely to sleep under any net. Women who used IPT were more likely to use ITNs (OR 1.35, 1.03-1.77), while those who lived more than an hour from an ANC clinic were less likely (OR 0.61, 0.46-0.81) to use ITN. Women with formal education (1.47, 1.01-2.17) and those who used ITN (OR: 1.68, 1.20-2.36) were more likely to have received at least one dose of IPT-SP.
   CONCLUSION Although the use of ITN had increased 10-fold and the use of IPT fourfold since last measured in 2001, coverage remains low. Provider practices in the delivery of protective measures against malaria must change, supported by community awareness campaigns on the importance of mothers' use of IPT.

AB Life-history trade-offs between components of fitness arise because reproduction entails both gains and costs. Costs of reproduction can be divided into ecological and physiological costs. The latter have been rarely studied yet are probably a dominant component of the effect. A deeper understanding of life-history evolution will only come about once these physiological costs are better understood. Physiological costs may be direct or indirect. Direct costs include the energy and nutrient demands of the reproductive event, and the morphological changes that are necessary to facilitate achieving these demands. Indirect costs may be optional 'compensatory costs' whereby the animal chooses to reduce investment in some other aspect of its physiology to maximize the input of resource to reproduction. Such costs may be distinguished from consequential costs that are an inescapable consequence of the reproductive event. In small mammals, the direct costs of reproduction involve increased energy, protein and calcium demands during pregnancy, but most particularly during lactation. Organ remodelling is necessary to achieve the high demands of lactation and involves growth of the alimentary tract and associated organs such as the liver and pancreas. Compensatory indirect costs include reductions in thermogenesis, immune function and physical activity. Obligatory consequential costs include hyperthermia, bone loss, disruption of sleep patterns and oxidative stress. This is unlikely to be a complete list. Our knowledge of these physiological costs is currently at best described as rudimentary. For some, we do not even know whether they are compensatory or obligatory. For almost all of them, we have no idea of exact mechanisms or how these costs translate into fitness trade-offs.

AB Shorter sleep duration is linked to obesity, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. Whether sleep deprivation during the postpartum period affects maternal postpartum weight retention remains unknown. This study examined the association of sleep at 6 months postpartum with substantial postpartum weight retention (SPPWR), defined as 5 kg or more above pregravid weight at 1 year postpartum. The authors selected 940 participants in Project Viva who enrolled during early pregnancy from 1999 to 2002. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios of SPPWR for sleep categories, controlling for sociodemographic, prenatal, and behavioral attributes. Of the 940 women, 124 (13%) developed SPPWR. Sleep distributions were as follows: 114 (12%) women slept <= 5 hours/day, 280 (30%) slept 6 hours/day, 321 (34%) slept 7 hours/day, and 225 (24%) slept >= 8 hours/day. Adjusted odds ratios of SPPWR were 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.42, 6.94) for <= 5 hours/day, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.97) for 6 hours/day, and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.78) for >= 8 hours/day versus 7 hours/day (p = 0.012). The adjusted odds ratio for SPPWR of 2.05 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.78) was twofold greater (p = 0.02) for a decrease in versus no change in sleep at 1 year postpartum. Sleeping <= 5 hours/day at 6 months postpartum was strongly associated with retaining >= 5 kg at 1 year postpartum. Interventions to prevent postpartum obesity should consider strategies to attain optimal maternal sleep duration.

AB To determine the influence of lamb presence on the dairy ewes circadian system we monitored simultaneously 16 different parameters (insulin, glucose, total protein, urea, cholesterol, triglycerides, total bilirubine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, rectal temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate). Sixteen clinically healthy Sarda breed dairy ewes, divided into two groups, group A with their lambs and group B without their lambs, were used. Data collection was done at 3 hourly intervals over a 24-h period. Our results indicate that lamb presence influences ewes metabolism, inducing modifications of the acrophase and robustness of the rhythm of some physiological variables. Most variables lost the rhythmicity that they show in not pregnant and not lactating ewes. Lamb presence also influenced urea circadian rhythm: the time of urea peak was shifted from 16:00 to 12:2400:35 when ewes were housed with lambs, and on triglycerides circadian rhythm.

AB Background: The incidence of obesity has been dramatically increasing across the globe. Anesthesiologists, are increasingly faced with the care for these patients. Obesity in the pregnant woman is associated with a broad spectrum of problems, including dramatically increased risk for cesarean delivery, diabetes, hypertension and pre-eclampsia. A thorough understanding of the physiology, associated conditions and morbidity, available options for anesthesia and possible complications is therefore important for today's anesthesiologist.
   Methods: This is a personal review in which different aspects of obesity in the pregnant woman, that are relevant to the anesthesiologist, are discussed. An overview of maternal and fetal morbidity and physiologic changes associated with pregnancy and obesity is provided and different options for labor analgesia, the anesthetic management for cesarean delivery and potential post-partum complications are discussed in detail.
   Results and Conclusion: The anesthetic management of the morbidly obese parturient is associated with special hazards. The risk for difficult or failed intubation is exceedingly high. The early placement of an epidural or intrathecal catheter may overcome the need for general anesthesia, however, the high initial failure rate necessitates critical block assessment and catheter replacement when indicated.

AB Oncofertility is one of the 9 NIH Roadmap Initiatives, federal grants intended to explore previously intractable questions, and it describes a new field that exists in the liminal space between cancer treatment and its sequelae, IVF clinics and their yearning, and basic research in cell growth, biomaterials, and reproductive science and its tempting promises. Cancer diagnoses, which were once thought universally fatal, now often entail management of a chronic disease. Yet the therapies are rigorous, must start immediately, and in many cases result in premature failure of the body's reproductive ability. In women, this loss is especially poignant; unlike the routine storage of sperm, which is done in men and boys facing similar treatment decisions, freezing oocytes in anticipation of fertility loss is not possible in most cases, and creating an embryo within days of diagnosis raises significant moral, social and medical challenges. Oncofertility is the study of how to harvest ovarian tissue in women facing cancer to preserve their gametes for future use with IVF, thus allowing the decisions about childbearing to be deferred and reproductive choices to be preserved. The research endeavor uses the capacity of the ovarian follicle to produce eggs in vitro. Developing the human follicle to ovulate successfully outside the body is scientifically difficult and ethically challenging. Infertility is linked to long-standing religious and moral traditions, and is intertwined with deeply contentious social narratives about women, families, illness and birth. Is the research morally permissible? Perhaps imperative if understood as a repair from iatrogenic harms? How are considerations of justice central to the work? How will vulnerable subjects be protected? What are the moral implications of the work for women, children and families? What are the implications for society if women could store ovarian tissue as a way of stopping the biological clock? What are the moral possibilities and challenges if eggs can be produced in large quantities from a stored ovarian tissue?

AB Background: Non-dipping pattern of circadian blood pressure in preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The pathogenetic mechanisms of this relationship are still unclear. We investigated whether non-dipping in preeclampsia could relate to endothelial activation or damage. Methods: Participants, 20 women with normal pregnancy (mean age 29.9 +/- 5.7 years) and 31 women with preeclampsia (mean age 29.1 +/- 5.1 years), underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf), marker of endothelial damage and of soluble adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1), and markers of endothelial activation were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays. Results: Based on whether the nocturnal mean arterial pressure (MAP) relative to the daytime MAP declined by less than 10%, 21 women with preeclampsia were categorized as non-dippers. Compared to healthy pregnant women, patients with preeclampsia showed significantly enhanced levels of vWf (206.9 +/- 40.6 vs. 123 +/- 24 IU/dl; p < 0.01) and sVCAM-1 (2,269 +/- 426 vs. 1,159.+/- 8 340 ng/ml; p < 0.01). In addition, significantly higher levels of vWf (224.5 +/- 34.9 vs. 170 +/- 23 IU/dl; p < 0.01) and sVCAM-1 (2,405 +/- 421.4 vs. 1,983 +/- 276.7 ng/ml; p = 0.007) were determined, when women with preeclampsia and nocturnal hypertension (non-dippers) were compared to dippers. The results were similar even after adjustment for severity of preeclampsia. In contrast, neither preeclampsia nor dipping status had an effect on sICAM-1 levels. Conclusion: Nocturnal hypertension in preeclampsia is associated with elevated levels of molecules related to endothelial damage. Endothelial damage is a recognized pathogenetic factor for atherosclerosis and history of preeclampsia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In this context, possible clinical implications of our findings deserve further investigation. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objective Large population studies have shown that low back pain affects about 50% of pregnant women. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of the BellyBra((R)) in pregnant women with back pain is associated with changes in assessments of pain severity, physical activity and satisfaction with life after 3 weeks of intervention compared with tubigrip, a more generic form of support.
   Design Randomised controlled trial.
   Setting A tertiary referral hospital in Australia.
   Population Women between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy with lumbar back or posterior pelvic pain.
   Methods Participants were randomised to the BellyBra((R)) (the study device) or to tubigrip (the control) by means of computer-generated numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes.
   Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were pain severity and physical activity, and the secondary outcome was satisfaction with life.
   Results One hundred and fifteen women consented to participate in the trial. Mean visual analogue scale scores of pain severity decreased from 6.1 to 4.5 in the study device group (P = 0.001) and from 6.0 to 4.7 in the control group (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference between the groups in this outcome (P = 0.61). However, the study device group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in Likert scale assessments of the impact of back pain on sleeping (P = 0.007), getting up from a sitting position (P = 0.02) and walking (P = 0.001) than the control group. There was also a significant reduction in the use of analgesic medication in the study group (P = 0.01).
   Conclusion The BellyBra((R)) and tubigrip were both associated with a reduction in the severity of pregnancy-related low back pain. The BellyBra((R)) was more effective than tubigrip, however, in alleviating the impact of pain on a number of physical activities that constitute daily life.

   PATIENTS; INTRAVENOUS IRON DEXTRAN; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL
AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined by the presence of (i) an urge to move the legs with or without an actual paraesthesia; (ii) a worsening of symptoms with inactivity; (iii) improvement with activity; and (iv) a worsening of symptoms in the evening and at night. Patients may use a variety of semantic phrases to describe their symptoms but all must have an urge to move. Most people with RLS also have periodic limb movements during sleep, although this is not part of the clinical diagnostic criteria. RLS is very common. About 10% of all Caucasian populations have RLS, although it may be mild in the majority of cases. Women generally outnumber men by about 2 : 1. As a general rule, RLS severity worsens through the first seven to eight decades of life, but may actually lessen in old age.
   The aetiology of RLS is only partly understood. There is a strong genetic component, and several genetic linkages and three causative genes have been identified worldwide. Several medical conditions, including renal failure, systemic iron deficiency and pregnancy, and possibly neuropathy, essential tremor and some genetic ataxias, are also associated with high rates of RLS. In all cases to date, the actual CNS pathology of RLS demonstrates reduced iron stores, in a pattern that suggests that the homeostatic control of iron is altered, not just that there is not enough iron entering the brain. The relationship between reduced CNS iron levels and the clinical phenotype or treatment response to dopaminergics is not known but generates promising speculation.
   Treatment of RLS is usually rewarding. Most patients respond robustly to dopamine receptor agonists. Over time, response may lessen, or the patients may develop 'augmentation', whereby they have a worsening of symptoms, usually in the form of an earlier onset. Other treatment options include gabapentin, or similar antiepileptic drugs, and opioids. High-dose intravenous iron is a promising but still experimental approach.

   TREATMENT; PETASITES-HYBRIDUS; EFFICACY; TOPIRAMATE
AB Migraine prophylaxis is a stepwise procedure with lifestyle advice followed by consideration of medications. Patients should be advised to try to maintain a regular lifestyle, with regular sleep, meals, exercise, and management of stress, perhaps through relaxation techniques or other ways that are sensible for them. If this regimen does not adequately control their migraines, preventatives are indicated. Patients can choose between evidence-based nutraceuticals such as riboflavin, feverfew, butterbur, or coenzyme Q10, or more traditional pharmacotherapeutics. Medicine choices are somewhat limited by what is available in each country, but from the full range, the medicines of first choice are beta-adrenoceptor blockers, flunarizine, topiramate, and valproic acid. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers are particularly useful in patients also suffering from hypertension or tachycardia. Following recent studies, topiramate has become a first choice for episodic as well as chronic migraine. It is the only prophylactic drug that may lead to weight loss, but it is sometimes associated with adverse cognitive effects. Valproic acid and flunarizine also have very good prophylactic properties. However, valproic acid is often associated with adverse effects, and flunarizine is unavailable in many countries, including the United States. If sequential monotherapies are ineffective, combinations of first-line drugs should be tried before advancing to drugs of second choice, which are associated with more adverse effects or have less well-established prophylactic properties. Amitriptyline should be used carefully because of its anticholinergic effects, although it is useful in comorbid tension-type headache, depression, and sleep disorders. Methysergide is very effective, but it has been supplanted or even made unavailable in many countries because of its well-described association with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Pizolifen has a slightly better safety profile but is unavailable in the United States. Aspirin is particularly useful in patients needing platelet inhibitors for other medical conditions, but the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding must be considered. The prophylactic properties of magnesium, riboflavin, and coenzyme Q10 are low at best, but their lack of severe adverse effects makes them good treatment options. Magnesium may be particularly useful during pregnancy. Lisinopril and candesartan were shown to be effective in single trials and are preferable in patients with hypertension. Acupuncture may be another alternative; although controlled trials have failed to differentiate its effect from placebo, it is at least innocuous. Botulinum toxin A is not effective in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine.

AB The clinical features of postpartum depression and depression occurring outside of the postpartum period have rarely been compared. The 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) provides a means to assess core depressive symptoms. Item response theory and classical test theory analyses were conducted to examine differences between postpartum (n = 95) and nonpostpartum (n = 50) women using the QIDS-SR16. The two groups of females were matched on the basis of age. All met DSM-IV criteria for nonpsychotic major depressive disorder. Low energy level and restlessness/agitation were major characteristics of depression in both groups. The nonpostpartum group reported more sad mood, more suicidal ideation, and more reduced interest. In contrast, for postpartum depression sad mood was less prominent, while psychomotor symptoms (restlessness/agitation) and impaired concentration/decision-making were most prominent. These symptomatic differences between postpartum and other depressives suggest the need to include agitation/restlessness and impaired concentration/decision-making among screening questions for postpartum depression.

AB Obstetric cholestasis is an intrahepatic multifactorial disease, unique to pregnancy which presents with intense pruritis and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). It commonly presents in the third trimester and becomes more severe with advanced gestation. The prevalence of obstetric cholestasis is influenced by genetic and environmental aspects and varies in different populations. The pathogenesis appears to relate to a predisposition to the cholestatic effect of increased circulating oestrogens and progestogens. Also genetic mutations have been reported in a sub-group of women with elevated gamma-GT. There can be significant maternal morbidity due to intense pruritis and consequent sleep deprivation. There may be malabsorption with steatorrhea resulting in vitamin K deficiency, prolongation of clotting times and increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Caesarian section rate is much higher for women with obstetric cholestasis. The potential fetal risks include preterm labour and prematurity and unexplained intrauterine death. The aim of the management of obstetric cholestasis is to avoid fetal complications and to relieve maternal symptoms. A variety of drug therapies have been used to reduce maternal pruritis. Policies of active management and induction of labor before 38 weeks may improve pregnancy outcome. Obstetric cholestasis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other causes of pruritis should be excluded.

ID REFLEXES; AIRWAY; SIDS
AB In a mature organism, the contact between various liquids and the laryngeal mucosa triggers lower airway protective responses (cough, swallowing, arousal). These laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are essential for preventing aspiration. In contrast, previous studies showed that LCR are responsible for apnea and bradycardia in the neonatal mammal. Consequently, LCR, especially when triggered by acid gastrolaryngeal reflux, are deemed responsible for some apneas of prematurity and many life-threatening events of infancy and, probably, for some cases of sudden infant death syndrome. Recently, we have revisited LCR in full-term lambs during quiet sleep. Our results showed that the LCR triggered by HCl (pH 2), mimicking the acid component of an acid gastro-oesophageal reflux, were consistently like the mature LCR reported in adult mammals, without significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire 2005). These results prompted us to question whether premature birth alters LCR. Results show that LCR triggered in pre-term lambs by both saline and HCl are much more marked and clinically relevant than the ones observed in fullterm lambs. Indeed, life-threatening responses to HCl, including repetitive apneas for more than 90 seconds, severe desaturation and bradycardia, were observed in 2 lambs at postnatal day 7 (137). In addition, LCR were significantly blunted at D14. In conclusion, HCl can trigger potentially dangerous LCR in pre-term lambs at D7, suggesting that LCR in response to acid gastrolaryngeal refluxes are likely involved in some apnea/bradycardia/desaturation in pre-term infants, before they reach a post-conceptional age equivalent to full gestation.

AB Our aim was to measure the correlation between fetal electrocardiographic (FECG) recordings of low-risk pregnancies and polysomnographic (PSG) study parameters in low-risk infants born at term as a measurement of perinatal sleep-development continuity.
   We designed a short, prospective, observational follow-up of physiologic parameters between fetuses and newborns. We studied 10 fetuses from low-risk pregnant female out- patients and the same subjects as low-risk newborns delivered at term. Fetal state (FS)was defined in FECG recordings reassembling the following: fetal state I (quiet sleep or QS); fetal state II (active sleep or AS); fetal state III (quiet waking), and fetal state IV (active waking). Percentages of AS, QS, and wakefulness in PSG studies of newborns were also determined.
   Comparisons of FS I with QS showed a significant reduction in QS, while comparison of FS II with AS showed significant reduction in AS. Negative correlations were found between FS I with QS, and FS II with AS. Number of cycles in FECG recordings and PSG sleep cycles also demonstrated significant correlation.
   In conclusion our data showed partial but significant sleep function continuity from fetal to neonatal period.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY

DT Article
ID ATOPIC-DERMATITIS; CHILDREN; ITCH
AB Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is a rare itching bullous disease of pregnancy and the postpartum period. We describe the use of a new methodology for measuring the nature and intensity of itching in a 21-year-old woman with pemphigoid gestationis. At 19 weeks gestation, she developed an itchy rash over the limbs, which spread to the trunk. Blisters then appeared on the hands which subsequently also involved the feet. Intense nocturnal wrist activities in this patient, measured with a wrist monitor and defined as average acceleration in the early hours of sleep, were even higher than that in patients with severe eczema, with an average value of 181.00 +/- 43.49 (mean +/- standard error) g/min for the first three hours, versus 84.47 +/- 8.53 g/min for the group of 24 eczema subjects. Most wrist activities were slower movements at 0 to 1 Hz. This is in striking contrast to the scratching activities at 0 to 3 Hz in eczema subjects. There have been no therapeutic trials for PG. Topical steroid and oral antihistamines are usually ineffective, but worked in our patient. We also discuss the potential application of the monitor in assessing the nature of various dermatological or systemic itching disorders.

AB The aim of this component of the German Study on Sudden Infant Death was to determine (1) nicotine concentrations in hair (NCH), as a marker of long standing exposure to tobacco, (2) cotinine concentrations in pericardial fluid (CCP) and (3) cotinine concentrations in liquor cerebrospinalis (CCL), the latter measures being markers of recent exposure to tobacco in the last few hours of life. The results obtained were compared with data on parental smoking revealed from interviews. In 100 cases of sudden infant death syndrome, material was taken at autopsy to determine NCH. In 41 cases, NCH and CCP, and in 70 cases, NCH and CCL were determined. Infants of mothers who stated having smoked during pregnancy had higher NCH than infants of non-smoking mothers (p=0.008). Furthermore, there was a weak but statistically significant relationship between NCH's and the daily cigarette consumption of the mother during pregnancy (n=64, r=0.24, p=0.05). In 43% of infants, nicotine could be detected in their hair, although the mothers had said at the interview that they did not smoke during pregnancy. On the other hand, in 33% of infants whose mother stated they had smoked during pregnancy nicotine was not detectable in the infant's hair. CCP's were strongly correlated with CCL's (r=0.62, p=0.0027). For this reason, both parameters were treated as equivalent for the detection of tobacco smoke exposure in the last hours before death. The influence of breast-feeding was evaluated by comparison of the nicotine concentrations in breast fed and non-breast-fed infants from smokers and non-smokers. Fivefold higher nicotine concentrations were determined in non-breast-fed infants of parents who smoked as compared to all other groups. It can be concluded that nicotine intake by passive smoking is much more important than by breast-feeding. We conclude that both interview data and biochemical measures should be sought to understand the true exposure to tobacco smoke.

AB Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited at approximately 22 weeks gestation at prenatal clinics. Of these, 86 (20%) were diagnosed as depressed. The women were seen again at approximately 32 weeks gestation and after delivery. Chronicity of depression was evidenced by continuing high depression scores in those women diagnosed as depressed. Comorbid problems were chronically high anxiety. anger, sleep disturbance, and pain scores. Less optimal outcomes for the depressed women included lower gestational age and lower birthweight of their newborns.

DE Women perceptions; risk factors; depressive disorders
AB We all go through ups and downs in our mood. Sadness is a normal reaction to life's struggles, setbacks, and disappointments. We may feel "down in the dumps" for a short period of time, but gradually the painful feelings dissipate and we move on with our lives-often the wiser for the experience. But if these feelings of sadness don't go away or if they are so intense that they interfere with your ability to work, study eat, sleep, and enjoy life, you may be suffering from depression. We are all at risk for developing a depressive illness. People of all ages, races, and social class can become depressed. No one is completely immune to this condition. Everyone experiences feelings of unhappiness and sadness occasionally. But when these depressed feelings start to dominate everyday life and cause physical and mental deterioration, they become what are known as depressive disorders. Nearly twice as many women as men develop depression and related disorders at some point in their lives. A woman's unique biological, psychosocial and cultural factors may increase her risk of depression. Married women are more depressed. It is usually because a married woman has many responsibilities to fulfill. The present study was conducted in district Faisalabad. The purpose was to study the risk factors, prevalence and impact of depression on married women. Women were interviewed through a well-structured interviewing schedule consisting of close-ended questions. The sample size was 200 respondents. Four villages from two union councils of one rural town were selected randomly through multi stage sampling technique. This study entails with the perception of rural married women about the risk factors, prevalence and impact of depressive disorder. After a comprehensive research the factors that cause depression in married women are husband wife conflict, in-laws conflict, baradari conflict, death of a close relative, loss of children, loss of husband's job, financial difficulties, addiction in family, long term of stress at home, rented house, pregnancy, miscarriage, infertility, early motherhood, caring of children and aging parents, single parenthood and workload due to large family. On the basis of results and Findings of the study, different recommendations are proposed, focusing on preventive measures for depression and emphasizing on improving the mental health of women. The study has deeply indicate that low socio-economic status, conflict with husband and in-laws, early motherhood and heavy workload are the major risk factors of depression among women

DE folic acid; FA; positional plagiocephaly; plagiocephaly;
   pteroylmonoglutamine; PMG; skull deformation
AB The incidence of positional plagiocephaly (PP) has increased during the last 2 decades in the Netherlands. Although this is generally solely attributed to the advice to put babies on the back during their sleep, other factors might be of influence. Because the advice to take folic acid (FA) was initiated in the same period as the sleeping advice, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of FA on PP.
   It is known that a daily intake of 400 mu g of FA around the time of conception is advised in peri-conceptive women to prevent development of neural tube defects. The maximal daily dietary folate intake is considered to be 250 mg with a bioavailability of 50% to 70%. However, periconceptional women may take a multivitamin containing pteroylmonoglutamine in addition to a FA supplement (isolated pteroylmonoglutamine). Therefore, the daily intake of FA will exceed 1 mg daily, which is considered the upper limit of daily folate ingestion.
   Data from the "Maastricht Cohort and Intervention study about pregnancy related girdlepain" were used to study the amount of folate containing supplemental intake of all the 7526 women. In this study, women were prospectively questioned about their FA intake. The entire cohort, considered the control group, was compared with a subgroup of women within this cohort with children with PP, treated by a plastic surgeon, considered the PP group.
   Double use, defined as isolated FA preparations in addition to folate containing supplements (vitamins), was seen more frequently in women giving birth to children with PP. In the PP group, double use was seen in 33.3% of the women compared to 13.2% in the control group.
   Although no statistical analysis could be made because the PP group was too small, the use of too high dosages of FA might have an adverse effect in causing more PP. This article does not want to discuss the beneficial effect of FA during pregnancy. However, we observed a potential empirical relation between PP and FA double intake requiring attention in more extensive studies.

   BODY MOVEMENTS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; FOLLOW-UP; DEXAMETHASONE
AB Background. Fetal heart rate (FHR) variation and fetal movements show a diurnal rhythm, a rise in the afternoon and evening compared to morning hours. A previous study showed that reductions in fetal parameters occurring two to three days after betamethasone administration are most likely caused by suppression of the normal rise during the day. Therefore monitoring during the morning could circumvent the suppressive effects of betamethasone.
   Objective. To study the effects of betamethasone on fetal diurnal rhythms, by comparing morning and afternoon recordings over five successive days.
   Methods. This was a prospective longitudinal study of 20 women at 25-34 weeks of gestation. One-hour recordings of FHR and fetal movements were made on each of five successive days in the morning and afternoon. Betamethasone was administered on day 0 and day 1.
   Results. We found no reduction of FHR variation on days 2 and 3 in the morning. In contrast, in the afternoon a reduction of FHR variation occurred on day 2. Time courses of fetal body and breathing movements during the morning were not affected by betamethasone administration.
   Conclusions. Transient reductions in fetal movement and FHR variation after glucocorticoid administration are not observed in the morning. For fetal monitoring and especially for assessing trends in fetal heart rate variation and movements with time, morning recordings should be preferably used in the period around glucocorticoid administration.

AB Objective. We examined the impact of chronic stress on the relationship between second-trimester serum corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) concentrations and preterm delivery (PTD) in working women. Methods. Birth records from mothers of 364 PTD and 730 controls in Southern California were linked to stored mid-pregnancy maternal serum analysed for CRH. Association of CRH with stressors reported in post-partum interviews was examined in cases and controls separately. Stratified multivariable logistic regression analyses examined moderating influence of seven chronic stressors on CRH in predicting PTD. Results. Mean log CRH was lower among women with chronic stressors. Chronic stressors were not related to an increased risk of PTD, but did strengthen the association of CRH with PTD. Adjusted for confounders, the odds of PTD were 1.5-times higher per unit increase in log CRH in the overall study population, but were two-to-three times higher in subjects who reported unfulfilling jobs, little sleep or strong anger in the second trimester. Conclusion. The relation of CRH with PTD is moderated by exposure to chronic stressors during pregnancy.

AB Practice and duration of breastfeeding were examined in relation to traditional practices and modern recommendations on infant care in Sri Lanka. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 60 Sri Lankan mothers whose youngest child was 0.5-4 years. The results show that all mothers had breastfed their infants. Most respondents introduced additional foods at 4 months, as recommended by local public health services. The median age at cessation of breastfeeding was 2.9 years, in line with public health advice. Doctors were reported to oppose breastfeeding during a subsequent pregnancy. Eighty-two percent of mothers practised habitual bed-sharing with their children. Nighttime breastfeeding frequency was 4.8 times per night for infants aged 0.5-1 year and declined gradually over the next 3 years. Maternal working status did not influence the overall duration of breastfeeding. Sri Lankan mothers and infants were confronted with several factors opposing their breastfeeding relationship, notably near full-time work and the early introduction of additional foods. Even though exclusive breastfeeding was ended prematurely, the majority of mothers and infants managed to sustain a prolonged breastfeeding relationship. Mother-child bed-sharing and associated nighttime breastfeeding is proposed as an important factor supporting continued breastfeeding.

AB The present study used actigraphy to monitor rest-activity cycles in lambs. We employed an Actiwatch Activity Monitor, which was secured on the lamb's neck in 13 term lambs and six preterm lambs. Activity measurements began on the day of delivery and lasted for 7.3 +/- 0.7 days. All lambs exhibited bouts of activity, lasting from similar to 2 to 60 min, separated by periods of inactivity of about equal duration. There was a progressive increase in the frequency and intensity of activity bouts with age, and a decrease in duration. In relation to postnatal age, preterm lambs had a significantly lower frequency and intensity of activity bouts compared with term lambs and significantly longer mean active bout duration. However, in relation to post-conceptual age, preterm animals were less active at birth, but thereafter the trajectory for activity development was steeper compared with the term lambs. These differences between term and preterm lambs may be due to several factors including differences in: (1) the lengths of time the two groups spent in utero and as neonates as a proportion of the perinatal period, which could influence the rate of muscle and bone growth; (2) prenatal and postnatal hormonal profiles; and (3) maternal care. We also found differences in postnatal motility in male and female lambs, with the trajectory of activity increasing in males at Days 4-5, which could be due, in part at least, to sex differences in both prenatal and postnatal hormonal profiles.

AB Background: Physical and hormonal changes during pregnancy alter breathing patterns of pregnant women. It is possible that occult disordered breathing during sleep may be a risk factor for the development of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and preeclampsia. Objective: Our aim was to determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant women, and to investigate the relationship of snoring, obesity and neck circumference to PIH and preeclampsia. Methods: 469 pregnant women and 208 age-matched nonpregnant women were included in the study. Both groups were asked to complete a questionnaire. Maternal complications were retrieved from the medical records. Results: Habitual snoring was reported from 1.9% of nonpregnant women, 2.5% of pregnant women prior to pregnancy and 11.9% of those same women during the third trimester of pregnancy (p < 0.001). Age, smoking during pregnancy, and weight before delivery were independent risk factors for habitual snoring in pregnancy. PIH and preeclampsia developed in 20 and 10.9% of pregnant women with habitual snoring, as compared to 11 and 5.8% of non-snoring pregnant women (p = 0.045, p = 0.125, p = 0.415), respectively. In women who developed preeclampsia, weight before preg nancy, weight before delivery and neck circumference were significantly higher in univariate analysis. Neck circumference was an independent risk factor for PIH and preeclampsia according to logistic regression analysis. Conclusion: The incidence of snoring is significantly higher in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. Snoring may indicate a risk of PIH. Neck circumference was an independent risk factor for both PIH and preeclampsia. Copyright (C) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Objective: The present study was conducted to evaluate serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in newly diagnosed patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   Subjects and methods: Between April 2005 and March 2006, a total of 231 consecutive adult habitual snorers underwent polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory. Ninety-seven subjects were found suitable for hs-CRP measurement after application of the following exclusion criteria: patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, congestive cardiac failure, or smoking history, patients who were pregnant, on steroid treatment, on hormone replacement therapy, or with chronic use of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral anticoagulants and lipid-lowering drugs and patients having undergone upper airway surgery. Patients were classified as apneic [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5], obese non-apneic [body mass index (BMI) > 25, AHI < 5] and non-obese non-apneic (BMI < 25, AHI < 5). C-reactive protein levels were measured in stored sera by high-sensitivity enzyme immunoassay (Biocheck, Inc. Foster City, CA, USA). After checking normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and using a square-root transformation, Pearson's and partial correlation coefficients were calculated for identified risk factors and confounders. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify variables that were independently associated with hs-CRP.
   Results: The mean serum levels of hs-CRP were found to be 0.25 +/- 0.23, 0.58 +/- 0.55, and 0.51 +/- 0.37 mg/dl in non-obese non-apneics (n = 23), obese non-apneics (n = 45) and apneics (obese and non-obese, n 29), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient of hs-CRP with BMI was found to be 0.25 (p = 0.01), and with AHI 0.16 (p = 0.12). Partial correlation analysis showed that hs-CRP levels correlated significantly with BMI after adjustment for AHI and age (r = 0.22, p = 0.03), while correlation with disease severity as assessed by AHI after adjustment for BMI and age was not significant (r = 0.10, p = 0.33). After stepwise multiple linear regression, only BMI was found to be significantly associated with serum hs-CRP levels (beta = 0.02, p = 0.01).
   Conclusions: In this first comprehensive cross-sectional study on Indian subjects, we found that obesity, and not obstructive sleep apnea, is associated with elevated serum levels of hs-CRP. No independent correlation was found between severity of OSA and hs-CRP in the present study. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Empirical and clinical literature suggests a temporal thread running through family narratives of hereditary disease, linking past experiences to current beliefs about risk. This study asked young women with elevated risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (HBOC) how their family histories with cancer and their gene status inform meaning construction around cancer risk and family development. Twenty-three women aged 22-35 who carry a BRCA gene alteration completed illness genograms and open-ended, narrative interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using the Listening Guide, a narrative tool that emphasizes key themes, meanings, and relational structures. Data analysis revealed distinct priorities for (1) single versus partnered women and (2) women who wished to have children versus those who had completed childbearing or were not intending to have children. Findings suggest single women experience increased urgency at finding a life partner capable of handling the emotional strain of the cancer world and open to pursuing multiple paths toward parenthood. Further, participants' family experiences shaped beliefs about perceived time to achieve desired family goals, specifically having biological children, before a cancer diagnosis or the need for preventive surgery. Clinical practice and research implications are discussed.

AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with an increased incidence Cardiovascular of strokeand myocardial infarction as well as increased prothrombotic and inflammatory processes. Although erythrocyte adhesiveness/ aggregation is known to be elevated in cardiovascular diseases, it has never been evaluated in OSA. The aim of this study was to examine the possible association of OSA and erythrocyte adhesiveness /aggregation.
   Methods: The study was conducted in the Sleep Laboratory of a tertiary university-affiliated medical center in 79 patients (age 57.1 +/- 12.9 years) with a diagnosis of OSA (apnea hypopnea index 41.2 +/- 25.9). Findings were compared with data on 1079 controls without clinical symptoms of OSA, matched for sex, age, and body mass index. Overnight potysomnography and blood sampling for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, levels of fibrinogen, high -sensitivity C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte adhesion/ aggregation test consisting of measures of erythrocyte percentage and vacuum range on image analysis.
   Results: The study group had significantly higher values than controls of all three markers of inflammation (p< 0.001 for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fibrinogen; p=0.037 for C-reactive protein). Erythrocyte percentage was significantly lower in the sleep apnea group (84.05 +/- 15.97vs. 90.79 +/- 11.23%, p<0.001), andvacuum range was significantly higher (8.22 +/- 7.98 vs. 4.63 +/- 4.05 gm, p<0.001), indicating stronger erythrocyte adhesion /aggregation. Both these factors were significantly correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and to hs-CRP (percentage: r=-0.630; 0.258, p=0.005; 0.031; vacuum range: r=0.494; -0.328, p=0.001; 0.005 respectively).
   Conclusion: OSA is associated with increased erythrocyte aggregation /adhesion, which is correlated with an increase in inflammation markers. These findings might help explain the increased cardiovascular morbidity in OSA. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Course and outcome of 200 pregnancies, deliveries and post-partum periods of 127 women with the onset of epilepsy before or during pregnancy were compared to clinical form of the disease, frequency of seizures and antiepileptic therapy. in addition, 104 children born to 97 mothers with epilepsy, 85 children - from the moment of birth to 1 year old and others from 1 to 16 years old, were studied. The particular attention was focused on the early neonatal adaptation. It was shown that, along with the last weeks of pregnancy, the first 7 days period after the delivery was critical for epilepsy severity. The development of seizures at this period was related to sleep deprivation and marked hormonal changes. There were no significant changes between the body mass of newborns of mothers with epilepsy and those of healthy mothers. The period of neonatal adaptation in children of affected mothers was favorable in 46% of cases. Some peculiarities of a child's state (withdrawal syndrome, hepatitis A etc.) were mostly related to the treatment of a mother with high dosages of antiepileptic preparations, i.e. valproic acid. These disturbances vanished to the age of 1-3 years. In summary, the active supervision of women by an epileptologist during the pregnancy period allows to optimize the prognosis of the child's health and better course of epilepsy in the mother.

AB It has been suggested that sleeping problems are causally associated with obesity in early life, but most studies examining this association have been cross-sectional. The authors used a population-based birth cohort of 2,494 children who were born between 1981 and 1983 in Brisbane, Australia, to examine the prospective association between early-life sleeping problems (at ages 6 months and 2-4 years) and obesity at age 21 years. The authors compared mean body mass indices (BMIs; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) and persons in the categories of overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9) and obesity (BMI >= 30) among offspring at age 21 years according to maternally reported childhood sleeping problems. They found that young adult BMI and the prevalence of obesity were greater in offspring who had had sleeping problems at ages 2-4 years than in with those who had not had sleeping problems. These associations were robust to adjustment for a variety of potential confounders, including offspring sex, maternal mental health, and BMI, and several mediators, including adolescent dietary patterns and television-watching. These findings provide some evidence for a long-term impact of childhood sleeping problems on the later development of obesity.

AB Serum corticosterone was previously studied in numerous elasmobranch fishes (sharks, skates and rays), but the role of this steroid, widespread throughout many taxa, has yet to be defined. The goal of this study was to test whether corticosterone varied in response to acute and chronic capture stress, and across the reproductive cycle in the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, and Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina. Serum corticosterone in S. tiburo increased following capture and again 24 h post-capture, possibly caused by interference with 1 alpha-hydroxycorticosterone, the primary stress hormone in elasmobranchs. Higher serum concentrations in males compared to females were observed in both species. Variations in corticosterone also occurred during the reproductive cycle in both species. Consistent with other taxa, elevations in male bonnethead sharks and stingrays coincided with peak testicular development and mating. Elevations in female bonnethead sharks occurred from the time of mating through sperm storage into early gestation. In contrast, corticosterone levels in female stingrays were low during their protracted mating season, but elevated through late gestation and parturition. These results indicate that corticosterone has a limited role, if any, in acute and chronic stress associated with capture in S. tiburo, but likely has physiological functions associated with its glucocorticoid properties across the reproductive cycle of both species.

AB Synchrony-a construct used across multiple fields to denote the temporal relationship between events-has been applied to the study of mother-infant interaction and is suggested here as a framework for the study of interpersonal relationships. Defined as the temporal coordination of micro-level social behavior, parent-infant synchrony is charted in its development across infancy from the initial consolidation of biological rhythms during pregnancy to the emergence of symbolic exchange between parent and child. Synchrony is shown to depend on physiological mechanisms supporting bond formation in mammals-particularly physiological oscillators and neuroendocrine systems such as those involving the hormone oxytocin. Developmental outcomes of the synchrony experience are observed in the domains of self-regulation, symbol use, and the capacity for empathy across childhood and adolescence. Specific disruptions to the parameters of synchrony that may be observed in various pathological conditions, such as prematurity or maternal affective disorder, are detailed. A time-based, micro-analytic behavioral approach to the study of human relationship may offer new insights on intersubjectivity across the lifespan.

AB Ayurveda is a comprehensive natural health care system that originated in India more than 5000 years ago. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care, and interest in it is growing worldwide as well. Ayurveda has unique concepts and methodologies to address health care throughout the course of life, from pregnancy and infant care to geriatric disorders. Common spices are utilized, as well as herbs, herbal mixtures, and special preparations known as Rasayanas. Purification procedures known as Panchakarma remove toxins from the physiology. Research has been conducted worldwide on Ayurveda. There are encouraging results for its effectiveness in treating various ailments, including chronic disorders associated with the aging process. Pilot studies presented in this paper were conducted on depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. These preliminary studies yielded positive results and provide a basis for conducting larger, more rigorous clinical trials. Conducting research that compares Ayurveda's comprehensive treatment approach, Western allopathic treatment, and an integrated approach combining the Ayurvedic and allopathic treatments would shed light on which treatment approach is the most effective for the benefit of the patient.

AB Objective: To examine the extent to which maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits are associated with obesity and overweight in 5-year-old Japanese children. Research Method and Procedures: We studied 1417 mother-child pairs enrolled in Project Enzan-a prospective cohort study. The dependent variables, childhood overweight and obesity, were defined with an international cut-off value. Maternal smoking during early pregnancy and other prepregnancy lifestyle habits were used as independent variables. Results: Maternal smoking habits were associated with overweight in the 5-year-old children [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12 to 4.11]. Maternal sleep duration of >= 8 h/d negatively affected childhood overweight (adjusted OR: 0.71; 95 % CI: 0.49 to 1.04). Children whose mothers skipped breakfast were likely to become overweight (adjusted OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.77). The results of childhood obesity analysis were similar to those of childhood overweight analysis. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that there are effects of smoking during early pregnancy and other maternal lifestyle habits on the onset of childhood obesity in Japan. Therefore, interventions in maternal lifestyle habits are required to prevent childhood obesity, and these interventions should be initiated before pregnancy.

AB BACKGROUND. Although abnormal pulmonary vascular structure and function in preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may predispose infants to pulmonary artery hypertension, little is known about the characteristics and outcomes of bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary artery hypertension in the surfactant era.
   METHODS. We studied 42 premature infants ( < 32 weeks of gestation) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who were diagnosed as having pulmonary artery hypertension >= 2 months after birth, between 1998 and 2006, at a median age of 4.8 months. Pulmonary artery hypertension was graded through echocardiography for all patients; 13 patients also underwent cardiac catheterization.
   RESULTS. Eighteen ( 43%) of 42 patients had severe pulmonary artery hypertension ( systemic or suprasystemic right ventricular pressure). Among 13 patients who underwent catheterization, the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 43 +/- 8 mm Hg and the pulmonary vascular resistance index was 9.9 +/- 2.8 Wood units. In 12 patients, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance improved with 100% oxygen and 80 ppm inhaled nitric oxide but remained elevated. The pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased to 7.9 +/- 3.8 Wood units in 100% oxygen and to 6.4 +/- 3.1 Wood units with the addition of nitric oxide. Sixteen patients ( 38%) died during the follow-up period. Estimated survival rates were 64% +/- 8% at 6 months and 53% +/- 11% at 2 years after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension. In multivariate analyses, severe pulmonary artery hypertension and small birth weight for gestational age were associated with worse survival rates. Among 26 survivors ( median follow-up period: 9.8 months), pulmonary artery hypertension was improved, relative to its most severe level, in 24 patients ( 89%).
   CONCLUSION. Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and severe pulmonary artery hypertension are at high risk of death, particularly during the first 6 months after diagnosis of pulmonary artery hypertension.

AB Any plans for pregnancy must be discussed in detail with women with bipolar disorders. They must be informed about the risks related to it and the need for some precautions.
   Because of the risk of relapse during pregnancy, the risk/benefit ratio of maintaining or starting prophylactic treatment should be assessed, taking into account family history and frequency of recurrences.
   Lithium may be used during pregnancy under close monitoring. Most anticonvulsants ore contraindicated because of their teratogenicity.
   During the post-partum period, prophylaxis is required in most cases because of the high risk of relapse. If no prophylaxis was given during pregnancy it must be started quickly after delivery to be effective when the risk is at its highest, i.e., during the first two weeks after delivery.
   Women with bipolar disorders should be advised against breast-feeding to avoid exposure of the infant to psychotropic medication. Because breast-feeding con be stressful and causes sleep deprivation, it may increase the risk of relapse.
   Second-generation antipsychotic agents should not be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding because inadequate information is currently available about their safety.

AB Patients who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) present with infertility recurrent miscarriages, menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, and acne. Many also have metabolic and hormonal abnormalities that can significantly increase risk for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and endometrial carcinoma. PCOS patients should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea. Early recognition may reverse physical signs of the disease, while correcting the metabolic abnormalities that can pose significant health risk if untreated. Although lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy are used to treat PCOS, there are few long-term outcome data regarding benefits of metabolic interventional strategies. Insulin sensitizers can improve ovulatory function, lower insulin resistance, lower androgen levels, and increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant. Further studies should yield other treatment options.

AB Objective: The purpose of this paper is to summarize current knowledge about treatment of narcolepsy and other hypersomnias of central origin.
   Methods: The task force performed a systematic and comprehensive review of the relevant literature and graded the evidence using the Oxford grading system. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of the available evidence regarding treatment of these conditions, and summarizes key information about safety of these medications. Our findings provide the foundation for development of evidence-based practice parameters on this topic by the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
   Results: The majority of recent papers in this field provide information about use of modafinil or sodium oxybate for treatment of sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. Several large randomized, placebo-controlled studies indicate that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. We identified no studies that report direct comparison of these newer medications versus traditional stimulants, or that indicate what proportion of patients treated initially with these medications require transition to traditional stimulants or to combination therapy to achieve adequate alertness. As with the traditional stimulants, modafinil and sodium oxybate provide, at best, only moderate improvement in alertness rather than full restoration of alertness in patients with narcolepsy. Several large randomized placebo-controlled studies demonstrate that sodium oxybate is effective for treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy, and earlier studies provide limited data to support the effectiveness of fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of cataplexy. Our findings indicate that very few reports provide information regarding treatment of special populations such as children, older adults, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. The available literature provides a modest amount of information about improvement in quality of life in association with treatment, patient preferences among the different medications, or patient compliance.
   Conclusion: Several recent studies provide evidence that modafinil and sodium oxybate are effective for treatment of hypersomnia due to narcolepsy. No studies were identified that report direct comparison of these newer medications with traditional stimulants. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathophysiology of narcolepsy, we do not have an ideal treatment to restore full and sustained alertness. Future investigations should be directed toward development of more effective and better tolerated therapies, and primary prevention.

AB Background: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality. Significant overlap exists between the risk factors for pre-eclampsia and sleep-disordered breathing. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been proposed as therapy for pre-eclampsia. This prospective, longitudinal study was designed to characterize sleep-related breathing patterns in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia risk factors, and to describe the effects of early nasal CPAP therapy in these patients.
   Methods: Twelve pregnant women with pre-eclampsia risk factors underwent polysomnography to characterize sleep-related breathing abnormalities and baseline blood pressure determination. Patients with airflow-limitation underwent nasal CPAP titration and were treated with optimal pressures. Periodic assessments of CPAP compliance and tolerance, sleep quality, and blood pressure control were performed until delivery or pre-eclampsia onset. CPAP retitration was performed between weeks 20 and 22 of pregnancy.
   Results: Mean respiratory disturbance index was 8.5 +/- 2.6 events/h of sleep, and initial nasal CPAP pressures were 5-6 cm H2O with an increase to 6-9 cm H2O after recalibration. All subjects with chronic hypertension maintained blood pressures below 140/90 with a mean diurnal blood pressure of 122 +/- 2.5 mm Hg over 83 +/- 1.5 mm Hg. Patient characteristics of obesity and prior pre-eclampsia were associated with pregnancies complicated by spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, or pre-eclampsia.
   Conclusions: Early application of nasal CPAP in pregnant women alleviated sleep-related breathing disturbances but was not sufficient to prevent negative pregnancy outcomes. Obesity and prior pre-eclampsia appeared to be important factors and were associated with the worst complications. However, nasal positive pressure may still be beneficial to decrease severity of outcomes, particularly if individualized to patient risk factors, more particularly hypertension at pregnancy onset.

AB Objcctives: To evaluate the potential benefit of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) administration in pregnant women recognized to have hypertension early in pregnancy.
   Methods: This is a randomized study comparing the addition of nasal CPAP treatment to standard prenatal care to standard prenatal care alone in hypertensive women treated with alpha-methyl dopa during early pregnancy. Pregnant women with hypertension were recruited by their obstetricians and completed baseline sleep questionnaires and visual analogue scales on snoring and sleepiness. Subjects were then randomized to receive either CPAP with standard prenatal care (treatment group) or standard prenatal care alone (control group) with routine obstetric follow-up. Nocturnal polysomnography was performed in all patients randomized to the treatment group for initial CPAP titration. Periodic assessment of blood pressure control and CPAP compliance was performed by the same specialist at each scheduled follow-up visit.
   Results: In the control group (n = 9), a progressive rise in blood pressure with a corresponding increase in alpha-methyl dopa doses was observed, beginning at the sixth month of pregnancy. There was also an increase in the number of non-scheduled post-natal visits during the first postpartum month. Pre-eclampsia occurred in one subject; the remaining eight patients had normal pregnancies and infant deliveries. In the treatment group (n = 7), blood pressure was noted to decrease significantly as compared to the control group with associated decreases in doses of antihypertensive medications at six months of gestation. All treated patients experienced uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered infants with higher APGAR scores at one minute post-delivery compared to those of controls.
   Conclusion: In pregnant women with hypertension and chronic snoring, nasal CPAP use during the first eight weeks of pregnancy combined with standard prenatal care is associated with better blood pressure control and improved pregnancy outcomes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, including drug- and etectroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major chronotherapeutic inventions-light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain long-term improvement.

AB Mosquito net ownership is rising in sub-Saharan Africa but will substantially reduce malaria only if nets are used and the most vulnerable household members sleep under them. We used data from 9 large-scale household surveys conducted in 6 African countries from 2000 to 2004 that enumerated all household members and nets owned, analyzing only net-owning households. Across countries, women of reproductive age and children under 5 (without gender bias) were most likely to use the net; least likely were children of age 5-14 and adult males. Nets commonly covered 2-3 people. If a baby net was used, fewer people used the family net. Pregnant women were more likely to use a net in 2004 than in 2000. In several countries, a sizable minority of nets owned were not used. Understanding intra-household net-use patterns helps malaria control programs more effectively direct their efforts to increase their public health impact.

ID PREMATURE-INFANTS; AIRWAY-OBSTRUCTION; NEWBORN-INFANTS; APNEA
AB Objectives: To monitor preterm infants in a cot and a car seat and compare an observed car seat trial with polysomnography (PSG).
   Design: Non-randomised controlled trial.
   Setting: Regional neonatal unit.
   Patients: Preterm infants before discharge.
   Interventions: Nap PSG respiratory and sleep variables were measured including gastro-oesophageal pH. Nurse observations included respiratory distress, apnoea measured by apnoea alarm, oxygen saturation and heart rate. Infants were studied supine in a cot and then in a car seat. Nursing observations were compared with PSG during the car seat trial only. Criteria for failure of the PSG and observed tests were predefined.
   Main outcome measures: Difference in respiratory instability between cot and car seat. Concurrence regarding failure of the car seat trial between nurse-observed data and PSG.
   Results: 20 infants (median gestation 33 weeks (range 28-35 weeks; median postmenstrual age (PMA) at study 36.5 weeks (range 35-38 weeks)) were studied. There were sufficient car seat data on 18 infants for comparison. There were fewer central apnoeas and arousals in the cot than the car seat (p=0.047 and p = 0.024, respectively). Airway obstruction was not more common in the car seat. Younger PMA at time of study predicted failure in both car seat (p = 0.022) and cot (p = 0.022). The nurse-observed test had low sensitivity for predicting PSG failure but more accurately predicted airway obstruction on PSG.
   Conclusions: Immature infants exhibit respiratory instability in cots and car seats. A car seat test does not accurately detect all adverse events during sleep in the seat.

AB Background: Smoking is a major risk factor for cot death. Many infants smoke passively as a result of parental smoking. This paper reports on infants exposed to a smoking environment and how they accumulate metabolites of cigarette smoke, such as cotinine, which may be physiologically harmful.
   Aim: To assess cotinine levels in infants of smoking parents.
   Method: Cotinine excretion in urine was assessed in 104 infants, of whom 71 had smoking parents and 33 had non-smoking parents. All cotinine levels were measured at approximately 12 weeks of age. The subjects were selected from a database of infants in developmental physiological studies which assessed the impact of various factors on early postnatal development.
   Results: On average babies with at least one parent who was a current cigarette smoker excreted 5.58 (95% Cl 3.4 to 9.5) times as much cotinine in the urine as did the babies of non-smoking parents. Maternal smoking was the largest contributing factor. Co-sleeping (p = 0.037) and the minimum room temperature (p = 0.028) were significant contributory factors.
   Conclusion: Infants from smoking households accumulate cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, which may have a detrimental effect on the cardiorespiratory system.

AB Sympathetic neural control of cardiovascular function is essential for normal regulation of blood pressure and tissue perfusion. In the present review we discuss sympathetic neural mechanisms in human cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology, with a focus on evidence from direct recordings of sympathetic nerve activity using microneurography. Measurements of sympathetic nerve activity to skeletal muscle have provided extensive information regarding reflex control of blood pressure and blood flow in conditions ranging from rest to postural changes, exercise, and mental stress in populations ranging from healthy controls to patients with hypertension and heart failure. Measurements of skin sympathetic nerve activity have also provided important insights into neural control, but are often more difficult to interpret since the activity contains several types of nerve impulses with different functions. Although most studies have focused on group mean differences, we provide evidence that individual variability in sympathetic nerve activity is important to the ultimate understanding of these integrated physiological mechanisms.

AB The premature population reaching theoretical term suffers from a major deficit in autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, as can be seen from heart rate variability indices. Whether this autonomic function recovers in the long term is not yet established. Thus, we analyzed and compared ANS activity indices, at birth or at the time of the theoretical term, and at ages 2-3 and 6-7 years, in two populations: a group of 30 premature children and a reference group of 14 full-term age-matched newborns. Using Fourier Transform analysis, we studied 24-h ECG Holier recordings to establish heart rate variability indices: Ptot, VLF, LF, HF, ratio LF/HF, LFnu, HFnu. In the neonatal period, sympathetic and even more markedly, parasympathetic activities were very low in prematures compared to the reference full-term group. At ages 2-3 and 6-7 years, prematures had recovered and had similar ANS activity as the full-term group. These data suggest a fast ANS maturation in prematures during the two first years of life, with a higher speed of recovery for the parasympathetic arm. Furthermore, compared evolution shows a faster ANS maturation in premature. Potential mechanisms are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: It has been hypothesized that the association of pacifier use with reduced risk of sudden infant death is mediated by forward movement of the mandible and tongue that helps open the upper airway. Our aim was to examine whether the mandible is moved forward when an infant is sucking on a pacifier, and if so, whether the mandible remains advanced after the pacifier is removed.
   Methods: In sixty clinically stable premature infants (corrected gestation age 36.5 +/- 0.3 weeks, mean +/- SEM) the distance from each ear where the pinna met the cheek to the most prominent point of the chin was measured bilaterally, and the average was used as an index of mandibular position. Mandibular position was determined before and after allowing the infants to suck on a pacifier for 10-15 min, and after removing the pacifier.
   Results: There was a significant forward movement of the mandible when the infants were sucking on the pacifier (59.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 58.6 +/- 0.7 mm, p = 0.001), with no significant change after the pacifier was removed.
   Conclusions: Pacifier use in preterm infants was associated with a small significant forward displacement of the jaw. These data suggest that pacifier use may help protect the upper airway.

AB Preventing abnormal neurobehavioral and postural development requires careful nursing in preterm neonates. The purpose of this prospective study is to assess the effects of 2 different lying-position body supports for physiologic and functional positioning. Thirty preterm neonates were eligible, born between 28 and 35 weeks' gestation. A first sample experimented with a "Home-Cocoon" support made by nurses with rolled sheets, and a second sample provided a "Coconou" support, made with a specifically designed rolled pad. Assessments of body posture and of neurobehavior were administered pretest (on admission without support) and posttest (at discharge). In addition, nurses were asked to answer a questionnaire concerning motor behavior. All preterm neonates showed gains in postural development, but the "Coconou" group performed significantly better than the "Home-Cocoon" group, with fewer cranial deformities, with head positioning, arm relaxation, and better orthopedic leg position. The overall quality of behavior increased for the 2 groups, but visual pursuit was very significantly better for the "Coconou" group. Nurses' assessment was also better for the "Coconou" support. These results point to the benefits of positioning with a specifically designed support like "Coconou, "promoting optimal prophylactic neurobehavioral and postural developmental care for preterm neonates.

AB Introduction: We studied whether maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy adversely influence lung growth and development of the offspring, resulting in poor early life lung function. Methods: Infants were participants of the Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER). Lung function measurements (single occlusion technique) were performed during natural sleep. Questionnaire data were used to obtain information on maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and resistance and compliance of the respiratory system, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results: Lower values of compliance (C-rs) were found in infants of mothers with respiratory infections during pregnancy; C-rs fell by 5.5% (P=0.031). The difference in C-rs between infants of mothers with and without respiratory infections during pregnancy remained unchanged and statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounding variables. The more respiratory infections the mother experienced during pregnancy, the lower the value Of C-rs was in her offspring (P for trend= 0.016). Using Cr corrected for body weight the relationship with maternal infections was non-significant, however still showing a trend. Conclusions: The results of this study may indicate that mothers who experience respiratory infections during pregnancy have newborns with lower compliance of the respiratory system.

AB OBJECTIVE. We investigated whether very low birth weight (< 1500 g) is associated with the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in young adulthood.
   METHODS. The study was a retrospective longitudinal study of 158 young adults born with very low birth weight and 169 term-born control subjects (aged 18.5-27.1 years). The principal outcome variable was sleep-disordered breathing defined as chronic snoring.
   RESULTS. The crude prevalence of chronic snoring was similar in both groups: 15.8% for the very low birth weight group versus 13.6% for the control group. However, after controlling for the confounding variables in multivariate logistic regression models (age, gender, current smoking, parental education, height, BMI, and depression), chronic snoring was 2.2 times more likely in the very low birth weight group compared with the control group. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly and independently of very low birth weight related to risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Maternal preeclampsia, standardized birth weight, and, for very low birth weight infants, small-for-gestational-age status were not related to sleep-disordered breathing.
   CONCLUSIONS. Premature infants with very low birth weight have a twofold risk of sleep-disordered breathing as young adults. In addition, maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of sleep-disordered breathing by more than twofold.

AB Our aim was to evaluate the risk of death among healthy infants due to maltreatment, using national linked vital statistics data. The study population included all nonanomalous, full-term ( >= 37 weeks), non-low birthweight (> 2500 grams) infants born between 1995 and 2000 and their linked death certificates: 18,673,439 singleton pregnancies (36,864 deaths) and 77,800 twin pregnancies (356 pregnancies with a death). The underlying cause of death was characterized as due to maltreatment, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other causes, based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, and modeled by maternal age using multinomial logistic regression; mothers aged 25 to 29 were the reference group. The highest risk for infant mortality was among the youngest mothers for maltreatment AOR 2.45 and 1.95 for singleton mothers < 20 and aged 20 to 24, respectively; AOR 4.34 and 2.25 for twin mothers < 20 and aged 20 to 24, respectively). The risk of death overall and for each category was modeled by maternal age < 20, aged 20 to 24, and >= 25, with and without the father's age present on the birth certificate, with mothers >= 25 and father's age present as the reference group. All risks of death were significantly increased for mothers younger than age 25, with the highest risks among the youngest mothers and missing father's age. The pattern for twins was similar, with elevated risks among younger mothers with or without father's age present on the birth certificate. These results add to the body of knowledge regarding risk factors for infant mortality among healthy singletons and twins.

AB Background: Because of concerns regarding sleep deprivation, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education limits duty hours and endorses education regarding sleep loss for residents. We assessed the effectiveness of a 60- to 90-minute lecture, the Sleep, Alertness, and Fatigue Education in Residency (SAFER) program, on sleep loss and recovery sleep in residents adhering to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty hours.
   Methods: From July 1, 2003, through June 24, 2005, interns from the inpatient medicine service at the University of Chicago were asked to wear wristwatch activity monitors. In March 2005, interns received the SAFER program intervention. We used fixed-effects linear regression to estimate within-subject mean sleep per call day (on-call, pre-call, postcall, and second-day postcall sleep). These estimates were compared with recommended minimum levels of preventive (7 hours of precall) and recovery (16 hours during the 2 days after call) sleep in healthy populations using 2-tailed t tests. These analyses were repeated to test the effect of the SAFER program.
   Results: Fifty-eight of 81 interns (72%) participated for 147 intern-months (63%). Interns on call slept an average of 2.84 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.75-2.93 hours). Interns obtained less than recommended amounts of recovery sleep (14.06 hours [95% confidence interval, 13.84-14.28 hours]; P < . 001). Intern preventive sleep was also less than recommended (6.47 hours [ 95% confidence interval, 6.39-6.56 hours]; P <. 001). Interns attempted to compensate for their acute sleep loss; for each hour of on-call sleep loss, they received 18 minutes ( 95% confidence interval, 7-30 minutes) more recovery sleep (P = . 003). The SAFER program had no significant beneficial effect on intern sleep.
   Conclusions: Under the current duty-hour regulations of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, residents continue to be sleep deprived. The SAFER program has no impact on resident precall or postcall sleep.

AB A 30-year-old woman, 6 weeks postpartum, is referred by her obstetrician for possible postpartum depression. The patient noted onset of symptoms 2 days after delivery of her son; describing the onset, she said she felt as if "a curtain descended upon" her. Her symptoms include low mood, tearfulness, decreased sleep and appetite, significant weight loss, and anhedonia. She feels she cannot care for her son properly and has intrusive thoughts that some unspecified harm may come to him. She adamantly denies thoughts of hurting herself or her son but worries constantly that "something bad will happen." At night, she feels restless and frequently checks that the baby is still breathing. Her concentration is poor, and she often does not shower or take care of household duties, but she does care for her son. On examination, the patient appears sad and anxious, with psychomotor retardation. She denies a previous psychiatric history. Her family history is notable for bipolar I disorder in a paternal uncle and a grandfather. She is breastfeeding.
   A 27-year-old woman with a history of recurrent major depression since age 18 presents for a consultation during her second trimester of pregnancy. The patient has a history of nonresponse to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been hospitalized twice for severe depressive episodes. During the second hospitalization, at age 25, she required six ECT treatments. Since that time, she has been maintained with good results on 75 mg daily of nortriptyline. Her treating psychiatrist recommended that she continue taking the nortriptyline during the pregnancy, which she has done. The patient is now seeking consultation and recommendations regarding breastfeeding after delivery.

AB Richter fully appreciated the fundamental biological importance of sex differences, in particular the challenges of female reproductive function to the two classes of behavior that most engaged him, endogenous rhythms and "self-regulatory" behaviors. Indeed, his contributions in these areas justify honoring him as one of the founders of behavioral neuroendocrinology. During the 1920s Richter, together with Wang. Kinder and other students, performed elegant phenomenological and mechanistic studies of sex differences in rats spontaneous locomotor activity, nest building, and food intake. All of these behaviors display rhythms entrained to the ovarian cycle in female rats, and Richter's analyses of them formed the bases of many current areas of behavioral neuroscience. Slightly later, Richter made fundamentally important discoveries related to nutrient self-selection in pregnant and lactating rats, including changes in micronutrient and macronutrient selection. These data played a major role in the development of his concept of behavioral regulation of homeostasis. Unfortunately, some of these discoveries are rarely recalled.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a distressing urge to move the legs and sometimes other parts of the body.Diagnosis is based on clinical features that may be easily remembered with the mnemonic URGE: Urge to move, Rest induced, Gets better with activity, and Evening and night accentuatlom. RLS is common, its prevalence increases with age, and women are more frequently affected. The course is including periodic leep disruption chronic with often-severes, leg movements. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of, discomfort. Primary RLS is familial and likely restlessness and, leg discomfort to be genetic. important causes of secondary RLS are endstage renal disease, pregnancy, and iron deficiency. Every patient should be checked for iron, status with a serum ferritin measurement.

AB Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and REM sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, with the greatest decrease occurring at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 150 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, three times per day, from day E14 until parturition, and the pups allowed to mature. We analyzed (a) intrinsic membrane properties of PPN neurons in slices from pups aged 12-21 days, and (b) the sleep state-dependent PI 3 auditory evoked potential, which is generated by PPN outputs, in animals allowed to age to adolescence. We found significant changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of PPN cells in prenatally exposed animals compared to intact ones, rendering these cells more excitable. In addition, we found disturbances in the habituation to repetitive stimulation in adolescent, freely moving animals, suggestive of a deficit in the process of sensory gating. These findings could explain some of the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders.

AB Pregnant women experience disturbed sleep that varies throughout the gestational period. In clinical studies Of nonpregnant cohorts, data link disturbed sleep with increases in inflammatory markers. Emerging evidence has also found associations between increased inflammation and medical morbidity, including various pregnancy complications. The authors have previously shown a correlation between sleep disturbances and serum cytokine levels. They extend this initial observation by evaluating the relationship between sleep during mid and late pregnancy and inflammatory cytokines in both serum and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Subjective sleep during pregnancy, described by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and sleep diaries, and circulating and stimulated measures of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were evaluated in 19 pregnant women. The authors found that greater sleep complaints in late pregnancy were associated with both increased circulating and stimulated IL-6 levels. Short sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency in both mid and late pregnancy were associated with higher stimulated levels of IL-6. No relationships were observed for TNF-alpha. If These preliminary findings indicate that women who experience sleep disturbances as early as mid gestation are likely to have an increase in inflammation.

AB Study Objective: Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by passive smoking. In this study we investigated the effects of passive smoking on sleep disturbance during pregnancy.
   Design: Two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys conducted in 2002 and 2006.
   Setting: Clinical institutions specializing in obstetrics and gynecology that participated in the nationwide surveys: 260 in the 2002 survey and 344 in the 2006 survey.
   Participants: 16,396 and 19,386 pregnant women in Japan surveyed in 2002 and 2006, respectively.
   Intervention: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: Pregnant women exposed to passive smoking were likely to have sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably. Smoking pregnant women had the same sleep disturbances and also experienced excessive daytime sleepiness and early morning awakening, The prevalence of 5 types of sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating sleep, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and snoring loudly/breathing uncomfortably) among nonsmokers with environmental tobacco smoke showed a mean value intermediate between that of active smokers and that of nonsmokers without environmental tobacco smoke.
   Conclusion: Passive smoking is independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy.

AB Study objectives: Evaluate the prevalence and phenomenology of dream-associated behaviors affecting pregnant and postpartum mothers. Episodes consist of anxious dreams and nightmares about the new infant that are accompanied by complex behaviors (motor activity, speaking, expressing emotion).
   Design: Three-group design (postpartum, pregnant, null gravida), self-report, and repeated measures.
   Setting: Pregnancy and postpartum groups: completion of questionnaires in hospital room within 48 hours of giving birth and home telephone interviews; null gravida group: completion of questionnaires and interview in person or by telephone.
   Participants: Two hundred seventy-three women in 3 groups: postpartum: n = 202 (mean age = 29.7 +/- 4.94 years; 95 primiparas, 107 multiparas); pregnant: n = 50 (mean age = 31.1 +/- 5.44 years); null gravida: n = 21 (mean age = 28.5 +/- 6.34 years).
   Interventions: Subjects completed questionnaires about pregnancy and birth factors, personality, and sleep and participated in interviews concerning the prevalence of recent infant dreams and nightmares, associated behaviors, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologic factors.
   Measurements and Results: Most women in all groups recalled dreams (88%-91%). Postpartum and pregnant women recalled infant dreams and nightmares with equal prevalence, but more postpartum women reported they contained anxiety (75%) and the infant in peril (73%) than did pregnant women (59%, P < 0.05 and 42%, P < 0.0001). More postpartum (63%) than pregnant (40%) women reported dream-associated behaviors (P < 0.01), but neither group differed from null gravida women (56%). This was due to different distributions over groups of the behavior subtypes. Motor activity was present in twice as many postpartum (57%) as pregnant (24%) or null gravida (25%) women (all P < 0.0001). Expressing emotion was more prevalent among null gravida (56%) than postpartum women (27%) (P < 0.05) but was not different from pregnant women (37%). Speaking was equally prevalent among the 3 groups (12%-19%). Behaviors were associated with nightmares, dream anxiety and, among postpartum women, post-awakening anxiety (41%), confusion (51%), and a need to check on the infant (60%). Primiparas and multiparas differed in dream and nightmare recall but not in prevalence of dream-associated behaviors.
   Conclusion: The prevalent occurrence of pregnancy and postpartum infant dreams and associated behaviors may reflect the pervasive emotional influence of maternal concerns or changes instigated by severe sleep disruption, rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, and altered hormone levels.

AB The bone dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of disorders arising from intrinsic abnormality of bone and cartilage growth and function. All are genetic. Most result in extreme small stature (dwarfism). Historically, emphasis was primarily on diagnostic identification of specific disorders in infants (including differentiating lethal and non-lethal forms), and on the clinical history to be anticipated in infants and children with each of these specific processes. Even in children there is exceedingly limited information of quality and virtually no controlled studies of the effects of intervention. For the most part, information about affected adults is even less complete and even less rigorous. Presented here are a series of examples of medical and adaptive issues in adults affected by one or another of the genetic skeletal dysplasias. Topics discussed include: approach to adults with no specific diagnosis; medical issues that cross diagnostic boundaries (osteoarthritis in the "E" disorders, obstructive apnea, issues in pregnancy in women with dwarfing disorders, activities of daily living, and quality of life assessments); diagnosis-specific problems of adulthood (spinal stenosis in achondroplasia, hearing loss in osteogenesis imperfecta, and malignancy risk in multiple exostoses); adult problems that must be addressed in childhood in order to be prevented (achondroplasia and kyphosis, and cervical spine abnormalities in Morquio syndrome); survival conundrums (why some live unexpectedly and others die unexpectedly). Emphasis is placed on the difficulties intrinsic to trying to learn about needs and expectations in generally rare genetic processes. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Activity during pregnancy has health implications for mother and child. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to examine changes in activity levels during pregnancy; the influence of socioeconomic factors and well-being on activity, and the influence of activity on maternal anthropometric measures and birth outcome. Twenty-four hour activity diaries were collected for 3 d in months 4 and 7 of pregnancy in 197 volunteers. Anthropometric measures and questionnaires to determine personal details were collected at these times and 2 months post-partum. Health records were used to supply infant measures. The time spent on each activity category was calculated, and used to calculate overall daily metabolic equivalents (METs). Low socioeconomic (SES) group 24 h activity levels were significantly higher than for high SES or welfare groups (p = 0.013). Activity declined throughout pregnancy in all groups 3 = 0.002). Women with children had higher 24 h activity, spending 41 % more time walking and (or) on housework than nulliparous women) = 0.013). Reduced well-being was associated with lower levels of activity. Sleep and lying down time influenced 2 month post-partum body mass (upper quartile gained 2.54 kg, lower quartile lost 0.24 kg, p < 0.001). Mean infant gestational age increased with increasing 24 h activity (p = 0.047). No infants were born prematurely to mothers who spent more than 190 min/d walking or doing housework activities in month 4. Probability of infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) declined with time spent walking or doing housework in month 4 Q, = 0.007). Mean (SE) birth weight was 3883 ( 165) g in the 10% of women spending less than 530 min sleeping or lying down per day, compared with 3413 ( 104) g in the 10% of women spending 725 min or more sleeping or lying down. Socioeconomic factors were therefore important influences on activity levels during pregnancy. Inactivity, especially in early pregnancy, was associated with more maternal weight retention at 2 months post-partum and a greater probability of admission to NICU and premature delivery.

AB Objective: To determine the accuracy of self-reported activity by community-dwelling, lower-limb amputees.
   Design: Descriptive study.
   Setting: A regional prosthetics outpatient service.
   Participants: Seventy-seven unilateral lower-limb amputees at least 6 months after prosthetic rehabilitation.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Measured activity counts (in steps/min) and self-reported activity (rest, low, medium, high) in 15-minute intervals over 1 week were recorded for each participant.
   Results: Participants averaged 3063 +/- 1893 steps per day. Strong agreement (gamma >= 0.7) between self-reported and measured activity was found for only 34% of participants between the hours of 9:00 AM to 9:00 Pm. The measured and self-reported proportion of time spent in various states of activity also showed poor agreement (rest, r=.41; low level activity, r=.39; medium level, r=.26; high level, r=.40). There was no bias toward either over- or under-reporting.
   Conclusions: The majority of participants were unable to accurately self-report their activity levels (sleep excluded) as compared with measured activity levels. This may have important implications for prescribing appropriate prosthetics and for clinicians who provide patients with advice on promoting health.

AB Purpose: To review the effects of the long QT syndrome (LQTS) in the parturient and the current anesthetic management of patients with LQTS.
   Source: Relevant articles were obtained from a MEDLINE search spanning the years 1980-2006 and a PubMed search spanning the years 1949-2006. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for additional articles.
   Principal findings: The prevalence of LQTS in the developed world is one per 1, 100 to 3,000 of the population. Clinically, LQTS is characterized by syncope, cardiac arrest and occasionally, by a history of seizures The QT interval can also be prolonged by drugs, electrolyte imbalances, toxins and certain medical conditions. Long QT syndrome patients are at risk of torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. Medical management aims to reduce dysrhythmia frequency. The LQTS is subdivided into different groups (LQTI-6) depending on the cardiac ion channel abnormality. Torsades can be precipitated by adrenergic stimuli such as stress or pain (LQT1 and 2), sudden noises (LQT2) or whilst sleeping (LQT3). Patients with LQTS require careful anesthetic management as they are at high risk of torsades perioperatively despite minimal data on the effects of anesthetic agents on the QT interval. While information on effects of LQTS in pregnancy is limited, the incidence of dysrhythmia increases postpartum. Isolated case reports of patients with LQTS women highlight several peripartum dys-rhythmias.
   Conclusion: An understanding of LQTS and the associated risk factors contributing to dysrhythmias is important for anesthesthesiologists caring for parturients with LQTS.

AB In the present study, we administered two low protein diets (LPDs) to rats during pregnancy and lactation and determined their effect on the ontogeny of select hepatic cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms in their offspring. The L93 and LM76 LPDs were derived from the American Society of Nutrition recommended AIN93G and a modified version of the AIN76A purified control diets, respectively. The LPDs contained 8% crude protein in the form of casein, whereas the purified control diets contained 19% casein. A regular cereal-based diet (NP) was also included, and, therefore, a total of five groups were tested. Pups in all five groups were weaned onto a regular NP diet on postnatal day 28. Perinatal LPD altered the activities of a number of P450 isoforms in 28-day-old male and female offspring. However, nutritional rehabilitation abolished most of these changes as evidenced by lack of differences between the five groups in the activities of P450 isoforms in either 65- or 150-day-old offspring. Interestingly, 58-day-old female offspring in the LM76 group but not those in the L93 group exhibited shorter hexobarbital sleep time than the purified control group. However, hexobarbital hydroxylase activity and the amount of CYP2C12 protein, an important P450 isoform involved in hexobarbital metabolism in females, were unchanged. This suggests that the decrease in hexobarbital sleep time in this group is not due to an increase in the activity of hexobarbital-metabolizing enzymes. In summary, perinatal LPDs produced transient alterations in activities of select hepatic P450s and resulted in a gender- and diet-dependent long-term alteration in hexobarbital pharmacodynamics.

AB Background: Experimental animal data link prenatal stress with sleep disturbance in offspring, but the link in humans is unclear. Aims: To investigate the link between prenatal maternal anxiety and depression and infant steep disturbance from 6 to 30 months of age. Study design: Longitudinal prospective study of a large birth cohort from pregnancy to 30 months. Questionnaire measures of anxiety and depression were completed by mothers at 18 and 32 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks and 8 months postpartum. Subjects: The ALSPAC cohort, a prospective community study of women in the UK who have been followed since pregnancy. Outcome measures: Measures of total steep time, number of awakenings, and broadly defined steep problems were available on children at ages 6, 18, and 30 months. Results: Reliable measures of total steep time, nighttime awakenings, and steep problems were identified at 6, 18, and 30 months. Higher levels of prenatal maternal anxiety and depression predicted more steep problems at 18 and 30 months, after controlling for postnatal mood and obstetric and psychosocial covariates; the association was not restricted to clinical extremes. No link with total steep time was observed. Conclusions: Mood disturbance in pregnancy has persisting effects on steep problems in the child, a finding that is consistent with experimental animal research. The findings add to a growing literature showing that maternal prenatal stress, anxiety, and depression may have tasting effects on child development. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a regulator of rodent ernbryogenesis during the period of neural tube closure. VIP enhanced growth in whole cultured mouse embryos; treatment with a VIP antagonist during embryogenesis inhibited growth and development. VIP antagonist treatment during embryogenesis also had permanent effects on adult brain chemistry and impaired social recognition behavior in adult male mice. The neurological deficits of autism appear to be initiated during neural tube closure and social behavior deficits are among the key characteristics of this disorder that is more common in males and is frequently accompanied by mental retardation. The current study examined the blockage of VIP during embryogenesis as a model for the behavioral deficits of autism. Treatment of pregnant mice with a VIP antagonist during embryonic days 8 through 10 had no apparent effect on the general health or sensory or motor capabilities of adult offspring. However, male offspring exhibited reduced sociability in the social approach task and deficits in cognitive function, as assessed through cued and contextual fear conditioning. Female offspring did not show these deficiencies. These results Suggest that this paradigm has usefulness as a mouse model for aspects of autism as it selectively impairs male offspring who exhibit the reduced social behavior and cognitive dysfunction seen in autism. Furthermore, the study indicates that the foundations of some aspects of social behavior are laid down early in mouse embryogenesis, are regulated in a sex specific manner and that interference with embryonic regulators such as VIP can have permanent effects on adult social behavior.

AB Objectives: This study describes sleep patterns for mothers and fathers after the birth of their first child and compares exclusive breast-feeding families with parents who used supplementation during the evening or night at 3 months postpartum. Methods: As part of a randomized clinical trial, the study utilized infant feeding and sleep data at 3 months postpartum from 133 new mothers and fathers. Infant feeding type (breast milk or formula) was determined from parent diaries. Sleep was measured objectively using wrist actigraphy and subjectively using diaries. Lee's General Sleep Disturbance Scale was used to estimate perceived sleep disturbance. Results: Parents of infants who were breastfed in the evening and/or at night slept an average of 40-45 minutes more than parents of infants given formula. Parents of infants given formula at night also self-reported more sleep disturbance than parents of infants who were exclusively breast-fed at night. Conclusions: Parents who supplement their infant feeding with formula under the impression that they will get more sleep should be encouraged to continue breast-feeding because sleep loss of more than 30 minutes each night can begin to affect daytime functioning, particularly in those parents who return to work.

AB Objective: To complete a community based efficacy study of a SIDS risk reduction methodology.
   Methods: We utilized two community sites for this study: 1) a Native American home visiting program for pregnant and young mothers; and 2) an obstetrics department in a community hospital. Pre and posttests were used to measure learning. The risk reduction intervention was delivered by hospital nurses or the home visiting staff and required about 20 minutes. Each of the nine risk factors was discussed.
   Results: We completed paired pre and post testing with 341 women. The pre tests found substantial knowledge deficits about SIDS risk factors in both groups. The pre and posttest changes for the nine risk factors ranged from 5% to 74%. Participants from both groups demonstrated nearly equivalent rates of learning for all nine of the risk concepts.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated the efficacy of this brief intervention program. The program was effective in increasing parental knowledge of the risk factors targeted by this study in both settings. The magnitude of change supports additional research with this program in other settings and with additional populations.

AB Objective. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of smoking among pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the factors associated with their smoking behavior.
   Method. Five hundred institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these institutions, 260 participated in the survey which was conducted in February 2002. Using a self-reported anonymous questionnaire, a survey on smoking behavior, drinking behavior and sleep status was conducted on pregnant women. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the factors associated with their smoking behavior.
   Results. Data were obtained from a total of 16,414 pregnant women. The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 9.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4%, 10.4%]. The quit rate of smoking among pregnant woman was 61.9% [95% Cl 60.4%, 63.4%]. The odds ratios for smoking during pregnancy were significantly higher in women with relatively young age, less schooling, multiparous, exposure to passive smoking, short sleep duration and in women who drank.
   Conclusion. Smoking among pregnant women remains an important public health problem in Japan. It is necessary to promote antismoking measures based on the results of this study. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to describe the association between the regularity of sleep patterns for first-time Japanese mothers in the early postpartum period and the sleep and wake activity of their infants and partners. Longitudinal time-series studies of 101 healthy Japanese childbearing couples were conducted between May 2002 and January 2003. Data were obtained from couples at 32-6 weeks pregnancy and 4-5 weeks after birth. The questionnaire packet for each father and mother included a demographic questionnaire, a sleep-wake log for 7 days, a social rhythm metric for 7 days and a morningness-eveningness questionnaire. A four-stage hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed in which the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength was the dependent variable. The variance in postpartum sleep-wake rhythm strength for first-time mothers was explained by three predictor variables. Household income, the mother's chronotype during pregnancy and the father's daily social rhythm at 4-5 weeks after birth made unique contributions to the variance (24.7%) in the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5 weeks postpartum. A mother's own tendency to be a morning or evening chronotype and the regularity of the father's daily schedule of activities appear to influence first-time mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength during early postpartum recovery more than disruptions from the infant's sleep-wake activity itself. Health-care providers should counsel couples on how factors associated with the parents themselves may impact on the regularity of a mother's sleep patterns.

ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Background Mass, free distribution (Catch-up) of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) during measles vaccination campaigns achieves immediate, high and equitable coverage for both ITNs and measles vaccine. Maintaining high coverage over time requires long-term, routine access to new nets (Keep-up). In many settings, only one approach - either campaign or routine delivery - has been available and have been seen as competing methods. Relying only on campaigns achieves high coverage at the cost of lack of later access. Relying solely on routine coverage builds a delivery infrastructure but may lead to slower rates of coverage and inequities. A combined Catch-up/Keep-up approach has been a common feature of vaccination programs for many years. We assessed the 3-year effects of a one-time Catch-up campaign followed by clinic-based social marketing for routine Keep-up on ITN coverage and use.
   Methods In December 2002, ITNs were distributed to all children attending a measles vaccination campaign in a rural district of Ghana. In the 3 years following that campaign, the district began offering ITNs at a subsidized price to pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics. This Keep-up scheme did not become fully operational until 2 years after the campaign. A coverage survey was conducted 38-month post-campaign using a standard two-stage cluster sampling method.
   Results Coverage of nets was high due to the combined contributions of both Catch-up and Keep-up. There were 475 households in the survey with at least one child less than 5 years of age. Among these households, coverage was 95.6% with any net, 83.8% with a campaign net, and 73.9% with an ITN. Of all children, 95.7% slept in a household that had a net, 86.1% slept in a household that had a campaign net. Not all available nets were used as only 59.6% of children slept under an ITN. The source of the nets was 77.7% from the campaign and 20% from routine clinics. Compared to households that participated in the campaign, households with children born after the campaign had higher rates of net ownership (75.1% vs. 67.7%, P = 0.04). Equity was high as the ratio of coverage in the lowest wealth quintile to that in the highest was 0.95 for ITN ownership and 1.08 for ITN use. These coverage and use rates were similar to those previously reported 5-month post-campaign, suggesting no decrease over 3 years.
   Conclusions A high level of ITN coverage and use was achieved and sustained by sequential community-based mass campaign Catch-up and clinic-based Keep-up distribution. The campaign nets covered virtually all extant households while clinic-based distribution provided nets for the new sleeping spaces created post-campaign. Because nets can be shared, and most children are born into families that already have a net, the number of new nets needed to sustain high coverage is substantially lower than the number of newborn children. A Catch-up/Keep-up strategy combining mass campaigns for children and clinic-based distribution to pregnant women is an efficient strategy for achieving and sustaining high net coverage. Assuring proper use of nets is a remaining challenge.

AB Objective - The scope of this study is to detect whether or not the entropy (E) circadian rhythm (CR) is maintained preserved in sinusal R-R intervals (SRRI), its loss being the expression of a transition to an indeterministic chaos in heart rate variability (HRV).
   Methods - The E of SRRl was estimated in 14 type I diabetic pregnant women (DPW) in the first trimester of an apparently uncomplicated gestation (7 patients - mean age = 30.3 +/- 4.1 y - without clinical and laboratory evidence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy, and 7 patients - mean age = 30.7 +/- 3.6 y - with positive tests for a cardiac dysautonomia). The E CR was studied via the single cosinor method, and summarized via the population-mean cosinor method.
   Results - The E CR was found not to be preserved in both the investigated type I DPW, despite the occurrence of the SRRI CR.
   Conclusions - The loss of the E CR confirms that in type I DPW there is a transition to an indeterministic disorder in HRV due to the lack of an autocorrelated periodic chaos in cardiac pacing. Such an unphysiological neurovegetative regulation suggests a new silent cardiac dysautonomic syndrome, that we intend to call "minimum delirium cordis syndrome" (MDCS). Can the MDCS be regarded as a condition of cardiovascular risk? To answer this question, it seems justified to suggest that the study of the E CR should be added to the routine tests that are presently applied to clinical analysis of the Holter ECG, being the classic tests of linear analysis not methodologically suitable for detecting the indeterministic chaos of the MDCS.

AB Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a common movement disorder characterized by a circadian variation in symptoms involving an urge to move the limbs, usually the legs. Pregnant women, patients with end-stage renal disease or iron-deficiency anemia, and children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) have a significantly higher prevalence of RLS. The classic presentation includes the onset or worsening of symptoms when at rest and the circadian pattern of exacerbation of symptoms at night. These symptoms reflect a circadian fluctuation of dopamine in the substantia nigra. Patients with RLS have lower levels of dopamine in the substantia nigra and respond to iron administration. Iron, as a cofactor in dopamine production, plays a central role in the etiology of RLS. Folic acid administration has also been shown to alleviate the symptoms of RLS and may play a role in the treatment of primary (familial) RLS.

AB Background: Consultation of patients in community pharmacies (CPs) must meet standards, especially in selling over-the-counter drugs; however, there has been no information as to whether northeastern German CPs meet these standards.
   Objective: To estimate aspects of consultation quality in CPs in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, located in northeastern Germany, study factors related to consultation quality and check compliance with Pharmacy Practice Law, because not all pharmaceutical professions may legally sell drugs.
   Methods: In 2005, 6 mystery shoppers (pharmacy students) presented with a headache to 146 of 398 CPs; they requested a sleeping pill plus an antihistaminic drug and completed data collection forms. Consultation scores were calculated and effects of pharmacy/staff characteristics on consultation were modeled with linear (consultation score) and logistic regression (failure to detect a drug-drug interaction). Variables used in models were staff profession, pharmacy size (number of staff), city/town size (number of pharmacies), and day of the week in which shoppers visited the pharmacy.
   Results: Despite a high willingness of pharmacy staff to provide consultation (83% spontaneously offered advice), northeastern German CPs did not achieve their professional mission. Extreme variation was evident in their questioning of the mystery shoppers regarding use of important single items (from 1% for pregnancy/breast-feeding considerations to 56% for dosing instructions). In all cases, drugs were sold to the shoppers; most (91%) were single agents. Drug-drug interaction detection was low: 43 (30%) counselors informed mystery shoppers about the interaction. The profession of the consulting staff and the size of the pharmacy were associated with consultation quality (highest for pharmacists; lowest for small pharmacies [2-4 staff]). For interaction detection, consulting staff profession was relevant: pharmacists had OR of 3.2 for the detection compared with pharmacy engineers/assistants. In 7 pharmacies, staff illegally sold drugs to customers.
   Conclusions: Northeastern German CPs have much need and potential for improvement in consultation quality and drug-drug interaction detection. In-depth elicitation of symptoms and details of patients' situations must be improved. Relevant training should be provided, including use of software to identify drug interactions, Mystery shopper studies give valuable information for tailoring training schemes.

AB Objective: To identify and quantify frontal sharp transients found in neonatal polysomnography of healthy full term newborns in each stage of the sleep-wake cycle within the first 48 hours of life. Method: The EEG from healthy term 32 newborns, legal age of two days and with adequate monitoring during pregnancy. Frontal sharp transients (FST) were quantified, according to synchronous or asynchronous, in each stage of the sleep-wake cycle. The results were compared by Kruskal-Wallis-test. Results: FST were counted individually in each sleep phase, being present during quiet sleep (QS) in all tracings. FST bilateral and synchronous and lateralized FST were more frequent during QS (p<0.05). Conclusion: Lateralized FST were found mostly during quiet sleep. FST asynchronous in healthy full term newborns were normal and depended of FST density. FST unilateral appearance should not necessarily be considered abnormal as well.

AB Maternal behavior in rabbits has been well described in the wild, the laboratory, and the farm. Salient characteristics include: (a) the construction of a nest (inside an underground burrow or a box), composed of straw/grass and body hair and (b) the display of a single, brief (ca. 3 min) nursing bout per day. The onset and decline of nest-building in mid and late pregnancy are controlled by specific combinations of estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and prolactin. Following parturition (kindling) does can mate and become pregnant again. Management strategies have been used on the farm to enhance productivity, impinging on specific reproductive processes (e.g., use of hormones to synchronize estrus, artificial insemination at kindling, doe-litter separation on specific days of lactation to increase sexual receptivity and fertility). Knowledge about the rabbit's reproductive physiology and behavior will be enriched by integrating research coming from the laboratory (where estrus, pregnant-only, or lactating-only animals are the main categories investigated) with studies performed on the farm or research station (where pregnant-lactating rabbits are prevalent). Similarly, the high productivity demands of modem rabbit farms will benefit from the information obtained in the laboratory where specific issues in reproductive neuroendocrinology are explored with methodologies that are not amenable for farm use.

AB The circadian clock, regulating hormonal secretion and metabolisms in accordance with the environmental light-dark cycle, resides in almost all peripheral tissues as well as in the superchiasmatic nucleus. Clock gene expression has been found to be noncyclic during spermatogenesis and the diffierentiation of thyrnocytes. However, currently little is known about how cell differentiation could affect circadian clockwork. We performed this study using the in vitro real-time oscillation monitoring system to examine the clockwork in several types of differentiating cells originated from reproductive tissues of transgenic rats (constructed with Period gene 2 (Per2) promoter-destabilized luciferase reporter gene). After treatment with dexamethasone (DXM), persistent oscillation of Per2 expression was observed in both gonadotropin-induced and pregnant ovarian luteal cells, proliferative uterine strornal cells (USCs), and nondifferentiating testicular interstitial cells, with a cyclic period of similar to 24 h. In contrast to these cell types, only one cycle of oscillation was sustained in granulosa cells undergoing differentiation. Additionally, Per2 oscillation was irregular in USCS undergoing decidualization induced by rnedroxyprogesterone acetate plus N6, 2-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3 ':5 '-cyclic monophosphate. Furthermore, no oscillation of Per2 expression was evoked by DXM in Leydig cells and thyrnocytes. In conclusion, the present study characterized the oscillation of Per2 gene expression in several types of ovarian, uterine, and testicular cells, and it is strongly suggested that circadian clockwork is affected during cellular differentiation.

DE fetal presentation; maternal positioning; pregnancy
AB Aim: Approximately two-thirds of term vertex fetuses are in the left occiput position in utero. However, little is understood about the physiology of maternal-fetal positioning during pregnancy. It was hypothesized that fetal left occiput positioning is affected by maternal positioning. The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between maternal positioning in late pregnancy and fetal positioning in utero.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at Ueda Hospital, Kobe, Japan. Eligible women were limited to low-risk pregnancies ending in spontaneous vaginal delivery with singleton vertex fetuses. Information obtained from the mother included the preference of positioning during sleep in the second half of pregnancy. Fetal information recorded after delivery included fetal positioning.
   Results: Eighty-one (50.6%) of 160 evaluated women preferred left lateral positioning while 70 (43.8%) women preferred right lateral positioning in the second half of pregnancy. Seventy-seven (51.7%) of 149 evaluated fetuses were in the left occiput position while 72 (48.3%) fetuses were in the right occiput position in utero. Maternal left lateral positioning with fetal left occiput position in utero was the predominant positioning (41 of 149, 27.5%). However, there was no statistical relationship between maternal positioning and fetal occiput positioning in utero.
   Conclusion: More women prefer the left lateral position during the second half of pregnancy. More fetuses are in the left occiput in utero during the late stage of pregnancy. However, no statistical relationship was observed between maternal and fetal positioning.

AB Metastin, a 54-residue peptide, was identified as the cognate ligand of human G-protein-coupled receptor GPR54. Since metastin is a gene product of the human metastasis suppressor gene 'KiSS-1, early studies on metastin were focused on its activity as a tumor metastasis suppressor. Recently, there have been some reports that metastin is found in human plasma and is particularly abundant in the plasma of pregnant. women. Dysfunction of the GPR54 receptor causes diseases that are characterized by an insufficient release of gonadotropin and lack or delay of pubertal maturation. This information strongly suggests that metastin is involved in the regulation of reproductive endocrine functions. In order to determine the plasma levels of metastin and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) in an isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) patient, who received intermittent administrations of LHRH, we tried to establish a sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassay. The plasma LHRH levels of the patient were very high, while plasma metastin levels were at almost the same levels as circadian rhythms of healthy male humans. In the central nervous system, metastin stimulates the neuroendocrine reproductive axis. However, the effects of peripheral metastin are not known. Our result suggested that peripheral metastin had a genesis and activity different from central metastin. Copyright (c) 2007 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Cost of obesity in France
SO PRESSE MEDICALE
LA French
DT Article
AB Objective > To estimate the costs associated with obesity in France.
   Methods > we used data from the 2002 survey on health and social protection as well as health core consumption data from the EPAS sample of the national health insurance funds. After excluding those younger than 18 years, pregnant women and people diagnosed with cancer we classified subjects as underweight, normal weight, or obese and then studied two subpopulations: (P1) obese patients (body moss index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2)) and (P2) patients who were obese or overweight (BMI >= 27 kg/m(2)) and hod additional cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidemia, type, 2 diabetes myocardial infarction (present or history), transient ischemic attack, intermittent claudication or sleep apnea. The Heckman approach was used to adjust for several factors.
   Results > The study included 4651 individuals, with a mean age was 47 years. The obesity prevalence rate was estimated at 10.7% for P1; the P2 prevalence was 16.0%. Average healthcare costs for the entire study group were 1534 Euro, 1105 Euro for ambulatory core (72%) and 429 Euro (28%) for inpatient core. Costs for obese subjects (P1 and P2) overaged 2500 Euro, twice the costs for normal-weight people (1263 Euro). After taking into account age, sex, socioeconomic status, alcohol consumption and smoking, the 100% reimbursement rote for chronic diseases (all else being equol), the extra cost of obesity compared with normal weight, was estimated between 506 Eirp (P1) and 648Euro (P2).
   Conclusion > The annuol total cost of obesity was estimated to range from 2.1 to 6.2 billion euros in 2002 and account for 1.5 to 4.6% of total health expenditures in France.

AB This study presents an automatic system to predict parturition time in the crated sows. The system relies on ultrasonic transducers mounted from above along the length of the crate. Using a 40 kHz time of flight (TOF) single envelope wave, the momentary distances between the sensors are measured. Therefore, the local momentary height of the sow and the momentary posture, i.e. standing posture (SDP), kneeling posture (KP), sitting posture (STP) and lateral lying posture (LLP) are determined. Crated sows change their postures from standing to lying and vice versa which follows a characteristic pattern. As parturition approaches, sows exhibit uneasiness, restlessness and the stand up sequence (SUS, the posture transition from LLP to SDP) rate increases because of labor pains. In time series, the SUS rate demonstrates a peak and it happens approximately 0-12 h before parturition. In this paper, the basic parturition threshold value method (BPTVM) and the same hour method (SHM) are proposed for predicting parturition, both of which are based on the SUS rate. The BPTVM mainly detects the peak of the SUS rate. As the SUS rate exceeds the threshold value, the parturition becomes predictable. Moreover, the SHM calculates the difference in the SUS rates between a particular time of day and the corresponding time of the preceding day. Compared to the BPTVM, the SHM can eliminate the circadian rhythm of the SUS rate influenced by feeding behavior. Using the SHM the parturition can be approximately predicted within hours. In an attempt to define the threshold parameters of predicting parturition, a data set with 32 sows of the SUS rate are used to estimate assumable predicting probability. The results show the assumable probability of the parturition prediction within 9 h is 96.9% for the SHM and 84.4% for the BPTVM. Moreover, the SHM can even reach a 75% probability of prediction within three hours of parturition. We conclude that the SHM is more accurate and is more useful for parturition time prediction. When parturition is detected, the proposed algorithm generates a warning signal which can inform human personnel to protect the mother and newborn piglets.

AB Efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are often equivalent, hence selection of an AED is often determined by the adverse effects (AEs). The development of neurocognitive AEs is almost inevitable with use of AEDs, especially in high-risk groups. Teratogenesis with major or minor malformations is of great concern during the first trimester of pregnancy, but an increasing body of information suggests that potential neurocognitive developmental delay may also occur with use of AEDs in the latter part of pregnancy. Decreased bone mineral density has been found in adults and children receiving both enzyme-inducing AEDs and valproate, an enzyme-inhibiting drug. AEDs may influence the lipid profile, body weight, reproductive, hormonal and other endocrine functions, and sleep architecture. There are age-specific AEs related to pharmacokinetic differences that have been highlighted in this review with emphasis on the pediatric population. A classification of AEs using different parameters is also included.

AB Objectives: Maternal-infant bedsharing is a common but controversial practice. Little has been published about who bedshares in the United States. This information would be useful to inform public policy, to guide clinical practice and to help focus research. The objective was to explore the prevalence and determinants of bedsharing in Oregon.
   Methods. Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a population-based random sample of women after a live birth. Women were asked if they shared a bed with their infant "always," "almost always," "sometimes" or "never."
   Results: 1867 women completed the survey in 1998-99 (73.5% weighted response rate). Of the respondents, 20.5% reported bedsharing always, 14.7% almost always, 41.4% sometimes, and 23.4% never. In multivariable logistic regression, Hispanics (adjusted odds ratio [ORa] 1.69, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.17-2.43), blacks (ORa 3.11, 95 % CI 2.03-4.76) and Asians/Pacific Islanders (ORa 2.14, 95% CI 1.51-3.03), women who breastfed more than 4 weeks (ORa 2.65, 95% CI 1.72-4.08), had annual family incomes less than $30,000 (ORa 2.44, 95% CI 1.44-4.15), or were single (ORa 1.55, 95% CI 1.03-2.35) were more likely to bedshare frequently (always or almost always). Among Hispanic and black women, bedsharing did not vary significantly by income level. Bedsharing black, American Indian/Alaska Native and white infants were much more likely to be exposed to smoking mothers than Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander infants (p <.0001).
   Conclusions: Bedsharing is common in Oregon. The women most likely to bedshare are non-white, single, breastfeeding and low-income. Non-economic factors are also important, particularly among blacks and Hispanics. Campaigns to decrease bedsharing by providing cribs may have limited effectiveness if mothers are bedsharing because of cultural norms.

AB Objective: The present study examined the impact of both perinatal maternal depression and cocaine use on infant neurobehavior at I month of age in a large, multi-site study.
   Methods: Infant neurobehavior was examined in 1053 infants at I month of age using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS). Mothers were interviewed using The Addiction Severity Index to determine present and past psychiatric history. Four groups were derived from the total sample: 385 prenatally cocaine-exposed infants, 76 whose mothers reported current postpartum depression (DEP/COC) and 309 without current postpartum depression (nonDEP/COC); 668 infants were not exposed to cocaine, 104 whose mothers reported current postpartum depression (DEP/nonCOC), 564 without current postpartum depression (nonDEP/nonCOC). A 2x2 Analysis of Covariance was used with covariates (birthweight, maternal age, SES, nicotine, alcohol, and research site) to examine infant neurobehavior in these four conditions. Secondary analyses were conducted to examine the effects of amount and timing of prenatal cocaine exposure.
   Results: DEP group by COC exposure status interactions were significant; there was only a DEP effect in the nonCOC infants. Infants in the nonCOC/DEP group had poorer self-regulation and more stress signs, excitability, and arousal than infants in the other groups.
   Conclusions: Postpartum maternal depression has negative effects on infant neurobehavior at I month of age. Prenatal cocaine exposure may serve to suppress or buffer the effects of postpartum depression on infant neurobehavior. Maternal mood could explain some of the inconsistencies found in the prenatal cocaine exposure literature. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control in hazardous situations is important. Our hypothesis is that the prerequisite for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is impaired vestibulo-mediated cardiovascular control. Prematurity is a risk factor for SIDS, and postnatal intermittent hypoxia may contribute to this risk. We studied heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) responses in 10 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who were born at 27 +/- 2.4 (23-30) wk of gestation. Twenty healthy term infants served as controls. Cardiovascular tests were performed under polysommographic control during slow-wave sleep (SWS) at a corrected age of 12 +/- 3.5 (7-19) wk. Control infants showed biphasic HR and BP responses to side motion with an immediate increase followed by a modest decrease and return to baseline. Compared with the controls, half of the BPD infants had altered BP responses (p < 0.005) without an early increase, followed by a more prominent decrease in 13P. BPD infants also presented with a greater variability in BP responses to head-up tilts than did the controls (p < 0.001). In conclusion, these findings suggest that some BPD infants have impaired vestibular sympathoreflex-mediated cardiovascular control. This dysfunction may become critical in life-threatening situations.

AB Background: Nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly remains a diagnosis of concern in infancy. This study evaluates factors affecting the onset, treatment, and outcomes of nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review and telephone survey were performed. A posterior occipital deformation severity score was used. Factors such as demographics, behavioral and helmet therapy, feeding patterns, torticollis, multiple gestation pregnancies, prematurity, and congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly were evaluated.
   Results: One hundred five infants were identified. Of these, 95 percent were Caucasian, 93 percent were from two-parent households, and 70 percent were from households earning more than $50,000. Repositioning was attempted in 95 percent, and 45 percent progressed to helmet therapy. When comparing change in posterior occipital deformation severity score with helmet therapy to repositioning, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Forty-nine percent of patients were breast-fed, and when compared with the general population, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Twenty percent of infants had torticollis, and when compared with population norms, a difference was found (p < 0.05). Twelve percent of patients were twins, and when compared with population norms, more twinning occurred (p < 0.05). Congenital nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly was found in 10 percent of patients and did not result in an increased risk of progression to helmet therapy.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates trends that may predict additional risks for developing nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly, including torticollis, plural births, and increased socioeconomic affluence. In addition, the nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly cohort was breast-fed less than the general population, demonstrating that breast-feeding may be preventative, as breast-fed infants are repositioned more frequently and sleep for shorter periods. As in other studies, cranial molding helmet therapy was more effective in correcting nonsynostotic occipital plagiocephaly than repositioning alone.

AB The occurrence of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy is well known. However, the mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors that predispose women to have restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. A total of 146 pregnant women were included in the study. Patients were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics, complications of pregnancy, medical therapy (vitamin and iron intake), sleep disorders, muscle cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Electroneurography, routine blood biochemistry tests, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests were performed and vitamin B12, folic acid, serum iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, iron saturation, prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone were measured. Of the participants, 38 were diagnosed as having restless legs syndrome. In women with restless legs syndrome, additional medical problems, night cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness were more frequent. In women without restless legs syndrome, serum hemoglobin levels were significantly higher and the use of supplemental iron or vitamins was greater. Among the women with restless legs syndrome, progesterone levels were slightly higher but this difference was not statistically significant. In summary, in this study, lower hemoglobin levels and supplementation deficits of iron and vitamins were found be the risk factors for restless legs syndrome in pregnancy.

AB Laryngeal chemoreflexes (LCR) are triggered by the contact of liquids with the laryngeal mucosa. In the mature organism, LCR trigger lower airway protective responses (coughing, effective swallowing, and arousal) to prevent aspiration. General belief holds that LCR are responsible for apnea and bradycardia in the newborn mammal, including humans. Our laboratory has recently shown that LCR in full-term lambs are consistently analogous to the mature LCR reported in adult mammals, without significant apneas and bradycardias (St-Hilaire M, Nsegbe E, Gagnon-Gervais K, Samson N, Moreau-Bussiere F, Fortier PH, and Praud J-P. J Appl Physiol 98: 2197-2203, 2005). The aim of the present study was to assess LCR in nonsedated, newborn preterm lambs born at 132 days of gestation (term = 147 days). The preterm lambs were instrumented for recording glottal adductor electromyogram, electroencephalogram, eye movements, heart rate, respiration, and oximetry. A chronic supraglottal catheter was used for injecting 0.5 ml of saline, distilled water, and HCl (pH 2) during quiet sleep, active sleep, and wakefulness on postnatal days 7 (D7) and 14 (D14). Laryngeal stimulation by water or HCl on D7 induced significant apneas, bradycardia, and desaturation, which, at times, appeared potentially life-threatening. No significant apneas, bradycardias, or desaturation were observed on D14. No consistent effects of sleep state could be shown in the present study. In conclusion, laryngeal stimulation by liquids triggers potentially dangerous LCR in preterm lambs on D7, but not on D14. It is proposed that maturation of the LCR between D7 and D14 is partly involved in the disappearance of apneas/bradycardias of prematurity with postnatal age.

AB Sleep disturbance is a typical complaint during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Previous studies of this phenomenon have not measured sleep in the last days of pregnancy as women transition into labor. Poor sleep can have potentially adverse effects on labor and delivery. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the amount of sleep obtained in the 5 days preceding childbirth, and the relationship between sleep in this time frame and both pain and fatigue during early labor. Methods: Thirty-five nulliparous women were recruited from childbirth preparation classes. Sleep was measured with wrist actigraphy continuously until hospital admission for delivery. Participants completed self-report measures of pain and fatigue in early labor prior to hospital admission. Result and Discussion: Most women experienced spontaneous labor onset during the night. Sleep quality deteriorated progressively over the last 5 days of pregnancy, and was the lowest on the night before hospital admission. This was the case even when labor was induced (40%). Conclusion: There was a significant relationship between the amount of sleep the night before hospitalization and pain perception in women with spontaneous labor onset. Results from this study can be used to advise women in late pregnancy about expected sleep patterns and measures to optimize sleep and rest.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe sleep and fatigue during the first week of postpartum recovery, and compare women after cesarean delivery with women after vaginal delivery while their infants were hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive exploratory study involved 21 postpartum Chinese American mothers (6 after cesarean delivery and 15 after vaginal delivery). Three types of data were collected: (1) mothers' demographic data; (2) objective sleep that included total sleep time (TST) and wake after sleep onset (WASO) measured using wrist actigraphy, and (3) subjective sleep quality (General Sleep Disturbance Scale) and fatigue severity (Numerical Rating Scale-Fatigue). Results: All of the mothers experienced poor sleep while their 3- to 5-day-old infants were in the ICU. After cesarean birth, mothers averaged only about 4 hours TST with 34% WASO while still hospitalized, compared with 6.5 hours TST with 14% WASO for mothers after vaginal birth monitored in their home after hospital discharge. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances and fatigue need to be further investigated to better understand the relationship between type of delivery and maternal health outcomes. Despite infant care provided in ICUs, these new mothers could benefit from interventions to promote their own sleep, particularly when also recovering from cesarean delivery.

AB Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to learn from 20 mothers about their experience of sleep during pregnancy and the immediate months of becoming a new mother. The study was part of a larger randomized clinical trial on an intervention to improve sleep and well-being among new mothers. Methods: Semistructured, audiotaped interviews were conducted in which women were asked to describe the continuum of the sleep experience across the pregnancy and early postpartum and to describe strategies they found helpful as they established sleep patterns with their infant. Narrative analysis was used to interpret their stories, and data were managed with Atlas.ti qualitative software. Results and Conclusions: Sleep disturbances were common to all of the mothers, and sleep became a negotiated behavior as they adjusted to the mothering role. All of the mothers were surprised at the level of disturbance and exhaustion they experienced. Strategies included enlistment of partners to facilitate naps, development of a "sleep consciousness," and bed-sharing. Mercer's stages of becoming a mother are used to describe the process of incorporating sleep changes into their lives.

AB Objectives: This study describes the patterns of sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in a sample of childbearing women from the third trimester through the postpartum period. The relationship between sleep and depressive symptoms is also examined. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-report measures of sleep and depressive symptoms between women with depressive symptoms in comparison with women with minimal or no depressive symptoms in the third trimester and in the third month postpartum. Methods: This longitudinal, descriptive study followed 124 primiparous women from their last month of pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. Questionnaires on sleep and depressive symptoms were completed during the third trimester (Time 1), 1 month postpartum (Time 2), 2 months postpartum (Time 3), and during the third month postpartum (Time 4). Sleep measures in a subset of women with depressive symptoms were compared with those of women with minimal or no symptoms at Time I and Time 4. Results and Conclusions: Sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms were associated at Time 1 and Time 4. For new mothers, a complaint of trouble falling asleep (delayed sleep onset latency) may be the most relevant screening question in relation to their risk for postpartum depression.

AB Women report their sleep to be disrupted during pregnancy. Sleep deprivation has been linked to elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. No information currently addresses the sleep-immune relationship during pregnancy. This study explores the relationship between subjectively reported sleep variables and circulating serum cytokine levels.
   Pregnant women (n = 35; mean age = 31.0 +/- 3.7 years) seen once a trimester completed sleep questionnaires, gave blood and recorded their sleep on a sleep diary at home for 2 weeks. Nonpregnant women (n = 43; mean age = 28.2 +/- 15.2 years) underwent the same protocol once. Subjective sleep variables were compared to serum cytokine levels for IL-4, -6, -10 and TNF-alpha as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) determined by ELISA. Nonparametric analyses and linear regression were performed to explore relationships between the sleep and immune variables.
   Pregnant women subjectively reported their sleep to be worse than in the nonpregnant group. Serum cytokine levels differed between the two groups and varied by trimester. As anticipated, IL-10 was significantly higher in all trimesters; however CRP, an indicator of systemic inflammation, was higher in all trimesters compared to the nonpregnant sample. Subjectively reported sleep disruption was associated with increases in TNF-alpha in the pregnant sample and CRP in the nonpregnant sample.
   These data confirm that disrupted sleep experienced during pregnancy, as well as during the nonpregnant state, is related to increases in inflammatory markers. Future exploration of these relationships should include functional assessments of immunity as well as polysomnographically recorded sleep. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A convenience sample of 22 mothers and 22 fathers in the San Francisco area participated in this study. Cronbach alpha coefficients were. 85 and 81 for the English and Chinese versions, respectively. Concurrent validity was demonstrated through correlations with wrist actigraphy readings. Although results of the study indicate that the GSDS is an acceptable instrument to measure parents' sleep disturbance among the Chinese American population, a need for further work was identified.

AB Objective: To investigate risk factors for poor self-rated health (SRH) in primiparous and multiparous women 2 months and 1 year after childbirth in a nationwide Swedish sample.
   Methods: Women were recruited at their first booking visit at 593 (97%) antenatal clinics in Sweden during 3 weeks evenly spread over 1 year ( 1999 - 2000). Data were collected by questionnaires in early pregnancy, 2 months and 1 year after childbirth, and from the Medical Birth Register. In total, 2424 women filled in all the questionnaires, including a global question on SRH. The representativity of the sample was assessed by comparison with the total Swedish birth cohort of 1999. Data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Physical problems, such as tiredness, musculoskeletal symptoms, and abdominal pain, and emotional problems, such as depressive symptoms, increased the risk of poor SRH in both primiparas and multiparas at one or both time points. Infant-related risk factors in both groups were negative experience of breastfeeding ( 2 months) and infant sleeping problems ( 1 year), and prematurity was a risk factor in primiparas at 2 months. Insufficient social support increased the risk in multiparas. In primiparas, outcome of labor, such as negative birth experience after operative delivery, was associated with poor SRH at 1 year and perineal pain at 2 months.
   Conclusions: A new mother's SRH is associated with her life situation. Ongoing physical and emotional problems, lack of support, and infant factors seem more important than sociodemographic background. Mode of delivery and childbirth experience may have a long-term effect on SRH.

AB Background Mild in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment might lessen both patients' discomfort and multiple births, with their associated risks. We aimed to test the hypothesis that mild IVF treatment can achieve the same chance of a pregnancy resulting in term livebirth within 1 year compared with standard treatment, and can also reduce patients' discomfort, multiple pregnancies, and costs.
   Methods We did a randomised, non-inferiority effectiveness trial. 404 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] antagonist cotreatment combined with single embryo transfer) or a standard treatment (stimulation with a GnRH agonist long-protocol and transfer of two embryos). Primary endpoints were proportion of cumulative pregnancies leading to term livebirth within 1 year after randomisation (with a non-inferiority threshold of -12.5%), total costs per couple up to 6 weeks after expected date of delivery, and overall discomfort for patients. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial, number ISRCTN35766970.
   Findings The proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term livebirth after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment (absolute number of patients=86 for both groups). The lower limit of the one-sided 95% CI was -9.8%. The proportion of couples with multiple pregnancy outcomes was 0.5% with mild IVF treatment versus 13.1% (p<0.0001) with standard treatment, and mean total costs were E8333 and E10745, respectively (difference E2412, 95% CI 703-4131). There were no significant differences between the groups in the anxiety depression, physical discomfort, or sleep quality of the mother.
   Interpretation Over 1 year of treatment, cumulative rates of term livebirths and patients' discomfort are much the same for mild ovarian stimulation with single embryos transferred and for standard stimulation with two embryos transferred. However, a mild IVF treatment protocol can substantially reduce multiple pregnancy rates and overall costs.

AB Sleep is important for health; however, poor sleep is a growing problem in many Western societies, particularly among women. Alterations in immune function following poor sleep (defined by duration and disruption) may be linked to ill health. Not yet investigated are the possible effects on stress-induced mobilization of lymphocytes. As natural killer (NK) cells are particularly responsive to acute stress, the present study examined whether sleep period duration and percentage of time awake after sleep onset (WASO) the night before a laboratory stressor would predict reduced NK cell mobilization. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy in 39 healthy women. NK cell peripheral blood numbers were determined at baseline (post-20 min rest), 4 min into a Stroop task, immediately post-task and 30 min after task completion. Participants with high WASO had significantly less NK cell mobilization to the stressor and failed to return to baseline levels after 30 min compared to women with low WASO. No effects were found for sleep period duration. Findings raise the possibility that inadequate NK cell mobilization to, and poor recovery from acute stress may be one pathway by which sleep could impact health. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

TI Spirits among humans: Tales of jingmei (fairies) in early medieval China
SO BULLETIN OF THE INSTITUTE OF HISTORY AND PHILOLOGY ACADEMIA SINICA
LA Chinese
DT Article
DE spirits; jingmei (fairies); mei; monster; tales
AB Traditional Chinese society constructed a "spiritual" or "supernatural" world made up of "Heavenly Gods," Spirits of the Earth," and "Human Ghosts." In addition to these beings were also the so-called mei sic, which are somewhat similar to the fairies or monsters in Western civilization. This philological study of terms associated with mei reveals that the notion of mei can be traced to pre-Qin sic China (pre-221 BC). Three basic terms referring to these beings emerged during the Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220), namely chimei sic (monster), guimei sic (ghostly monster) and jingmei sic (fairy), and it was during the Han Dynasty that the meanings of these terms reached maturity and became more firmly established.
   Basically, mei refers to a type of non-human monstrous creature; Regarded as goblins" or "demons" that brought about accidents, confusion, illness, disasters, and disruption, these "beings" were seen as rare, mysterious, and strange. Yet the three concepts of chimei, guimei, and jingmei clearly differ.
   Among these distinctions, two stand out as the most significant: first, the places in which the mei appeared, and second, the physical form that the mei adopted. Chimei were originally thought to have existed in "foreign lands" or "remote places," and it was only later that they entered the mountains and rivers of "China" proper. Guimei seemed to linger in wild and remote places. Jingmei, however, were scattered about everywhere and could be found in forests, fields, cities, villages, and houses.
   These three types of mei also took on different physical forms. Chimei were "creatures" with particular forms, mostly those of animals or creatures that were half-human and half-beast. Guimei were "invisible" beings or beings capable of remaining "invisible" without adopting a particular physical shape. Jingmei could assume all kinds of forms. Every "being" (including humans) could be transformed into jingmei. In early China it was believed that non-human beings could take on human form, but later it was thought that every "being" could assume any other form and could be visible or invisible. This difference is not merely semantic but relates to the evolution of the very concept of mei. In China after the second century, the term mei gradually came to be used primarily to mean jingmei.
   Only after the second century do traditional Chinese documents present more concrete descriptions of the circumstances under which jingmei revealed their original form or changed their form, of how they attacked or endangered humans, and of the types of "beings" that could become jingmei. This article intends to explore how people in early medieval China constructed this new image of mei based principally on the tales of jingmei.
   Through an analysis of 41 jingmei tales, we discovered that in the Six Dynasties (3rd-6th centuries), people believed that anyone could encounter jingmei anywhere and at any time, regardless of gender, age, social class, and occupation. Gingmei's original physical forms included wild beasts (foxes, wild cats and deer etc.), snakes, insects (grasshoppers, scorpions), aquatic creatures (water lizards, turtles, otters, carp etc.), plants (large trees), domestic animals (pigs, chicken and dogs etc.) and commonly used objects (pillows and wooden shoes). Any living or lifeless "being" could be transformed into jingmei under certain circumstances because of their age-old existence or natural talents. Even the dead could transform themselves into jingmei. The majority of jingmei, however, took the form of wild animals.
   Most jingmei could transform into humans, and even assume the identity of a relative or partner. Some remained invisible, or could only speak a human language and eat like humans; others had human form but lacked certain body parts.
   Some people who encountered jingmei were left entirely unharmed. Others were only frightened, confused or harassed. Some victims, however, had their hair chopped off, and others were lured into having sex with jingmei. In some cases men died because of "the loss of sperm." Most women fell ill with what was generally called a "demonic illness" or a "fairy illness." However, some men had "one-night stands" with jingmei, or slept with them for several months or years, and jingmei even became pregnant and had babies. According to the stories, they seemed to have been left unharmed. It is worth noting that in the Six Dynasties, people believed that humans could have loving or sexual relationships with jingmei, gods, or ghosts who were members of the opposite sex or of a different species.
   At the same time, however, jingmei also induced much fear, since people believed that jingmei could appear anywhere and at any time to harm humans. Luckily, ordinary people could use some commonly found objects-such as mirrors, fire, dogs, knives and swords-to force the spirits reveal their original forms, and exorcise and kill them. In addition, people could also seek the help of spiritual sources such as occult art practitioners, Taoist priests, or Buddhist monks. These spiritual experts could then employ more complicated occult arts-such as divination and incantations-to determine the original forms of the jingmei and kill them. If people were harmed by jingmei and became sick, they could go to see doctors for therapy.
   An examination of the conception of jingmei in early medieval China reveals broader cultural and historical significance. People in early medieval China seemed to have a greater fear of the "extra-human" world when compared with their predecessors. They lacked confidence in their sensory experience and the world they encountered. They feared all strange and remote places, different beings, and different species. They also lived in doubt of their acquaintances and the objects around them: They believed that any living creature or lifeless being could transform into jingmei in human form. Unpredictability in everyday life increased since the threat of encountering jingmei could no longer be clearly delineated: Jingmei no longer only lurked in wild forests and strange waters, and moments of danger were no longer limited to darkness, dusk, and dawn. This change may perhaps be termed the "humanization" or "normalization" of the concept of jingmei.
   Facing the world of jingmei, people in the Six Dynasties nevertheless constructed mechanisms to defend against and resist the interference of jingmei. They believed that the power which humans wielded was greater than that of the jingmei, and that by implementing commonly used objects and methods, jingmei could be driven away, exorcised, or eliminated. Moreover, jingmei could also be eliminated by religious means. Consequently, some jingmei which had never harmed people were killed by humans. Literary sources from early medieval China indicate that people believed that the unpredictability of encountering jingmei had rendered the world more ominous than in the past. However, equipped with more advanced weapons, they remained optimistic that they could meet these new challenges and keep jingmei at bay.

AB It is important to consider the potential contribution of seasonality to postpartum depression (PPD; Hiltunen et al, 2004). A possible link between seasonality and PPD may have implications for not only choice of treatment, but also in considering pregnancy planning. The objectives of this pilot study were to examine whether women with seasonal mood changes demonstrated greater incidence of PPD, and to determine if seasonality scores were predictive of PPD.
   The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ; Rosenthal et al, 1987) was used to assess seasonality of mood. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between clinical factors, SAD diagnosis, SPAQ global seasonality score (GSS) and season of SPAQ administration and PPD.
   In our sample, twice as many women in the PPD group were found to have SAD compared to the control group. The PPD group also had a higher group GSS mean (10.44) than did the control group (8.84). However, logistic regression analysis showed that higher seasonality scores in women with PPD were not necessarily predictive of PPD. While more women in the PPD group reported increased seasonal weight fluctuation and less sleep in the spring and summer, these items alone did not predict depression after childbirth.

TI Sleep duration and quality in healthy nulliparous and multiparous women

AB Background: Longitudinal studies of sleep during normal pregnancy and post-partum are rare, and interpretation of the findings is often hampered by methodological issues. Consequentially, there is still limited information on what constitutes normal sleep quality and quantity across pregnancy and early post-partum, for both nulliparous and multiparous women.
   Aims: To quantify the change and variability in sleep duration and quality across pregnancy and post-partum for healthy nulliparous and multiparous women.
   Methods: Nineteen women (eight nulliparous and 11 multiparous) wore an actigraph and completed a sleep diary to objectively measure sleep for seven nights during the second trimester, one week prior to delivery, and at one and six weeks post-partum. Mixed model analysis of variance and logistic regression were used to investigate changes in sleep across this timeframe.
   Results: The largest changes in sleep occurred in the first week post-partum (1.5 h less sleep than during pregnancy, three times more sleep episodes in 24 h, 70% of women regularly napping during the day, and greatest day-to-day variability in sleep). Compared to multiparas, nulliparas generally had less efficient sleep, spent more time in bed and had greater wake after sleep onset in the second trimester, and spent less time in bed and had fewer sleep episodes a day at one week post-partum.
   Conclusions: These changes should be used to inform women about the extent of change in sleep, particularly early post-partum, and to help health-care providers identify women experiencing severe sleep loss and disruption and discuss possible coping strategies with them.

AB Pregnant women (N = 253) were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 22.3 weeks gestation) and assigned to depressed (N = 83) and non-depressed groups based on a SCID diagnosis of depression. They were then given self-report measures on sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety and anger, and their urine was assayed for norepinephrine and cortisol. These measures were repeated during their third trimester (M = 32.4 weeks). Their newborns were then observed during sleep. During both the second and third trimesters, the depressed women had more sleep disturbances and higher depression, anxiety and anger scores. They also had higher norepinephrine and cortisol levels. The newborns of the depressed mothers also had more sleep disturbances including less time in deep sleep and more time in indeterminate (disorganized) sleep, and they were more active and cried/fussed more.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of back pain and treatment satisfaction in a population of low-socioeconomic pregnant women.
   Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design to determine the prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy for 599 women. Women completed an author-generated musculoskeletal survey in the second trimester of their pregnancy that addressed pain history, duration, location, and intensity, as well as activities of daily living, treatment frequency, and satisfaction with treatment.
   Results: Sixty-seven percent of the total population reported musculoskeletal pain, and nearly half presented with a multi-focal pattern of pain that involved 2 or more sites. Twenty-one percent reported severe pain intensity rated on a numerical rating scale. Eighty percent of women experiencing pain slept less than 4 hours per night and 75% of these women took pain medications. Importantly, 85% of the women surveyed perceived that they had not been offered treatment for their musculoskeletal disorders.
   Conclusion: Multi-focal musculoskeletal pain in pregnancy was prevalent in this underserved patient population. The pain in this population negatively affected sleep and treatment appeared inadequate.

AB Sleep quality is integral to optimal physical functioning and mental health during pregnancy. There has, however, been little work conducted to determine the most appropriate measure of sleep quality in this clinical group, a surprising observation given the complex and dynamic psychobiology of pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was evaluated to determine the usefulness of this measure in early pregnancy. The psychometric properties of the PSQI were evaluated in women at 14 weeks of pregnancy and revealed the instrument to have good internal consistency and convergent and divergent reliability properties. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the removal of the PSQI sleeping medications sub-scale from the global sleep quality total score calculation would improve the utility of this measure in early pregnancy. Women classified as depressed on the basis of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were found to have significantly poorer sleep quality scores on the majority of PSQI sub-scales. The relationship between sleep quality and depression was found to be statistically significant and clinically relevant during early pregnancy and the PSQI would appear to be an appropriate measure to assess sleep quality in this group.

AB Maternal pregravid obesity is a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes during pregnancy. In early pregnancy there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies. in later gestation maternal metabolic manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, such as gestational hypertensive disorders and diabetes, become clinically recognized because of the increased insulin resistance in obese compared with nonobese women. In women with pregestational glucose intolerance, hypertension, central obesity, and lipid disorders, the physiologic changes in pregnancy increase the risk of problems previously not routinely encountered during pregnancy. These include chronic cardiac dysfunction, proteinuria, sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. At parturition the obese patient is at an increased risk of cesarean delivery and associated complications of anesthesia, wound disruption, infection, and deep venous thrombophlebitis. For the fetus there are short-term risks of fetal macrosomia, more specifically obesity, and long-term risks of adolescent components of the metabolic syndrome. Although preliminary results of bariatric surgery are encouraging, the procedure is expensive and not for all obese women, and we recognize that long-term follow-up data on offspring of obese women who have undergone bariatric surgery before pregnancy are lacking. In the interim, we need to encourage obese women to lose weight before conception, using lifestyle changes if possible. During pregnancy, weight gain should be limited to Institute of Medicine guidelines (currently under review) and encouragement given for physical activity.

AB The premature infant is at increased risk of cerebral white matter injury. Melatonin is neuroprotective in adult models of focal cerebral ischemia and attenuates ibotenate-induced white matter cysts in neonatal mice. Clinically, melatonin has been used to treat sleep disorders in children without major side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective and anti-inflammatory effects of melatonin in the immature brain following intrauterine asphyxia. Fetal sheep at 90 d of gestation were subjected to umbilical cord occlusion. Melatonin (20 mg/kg, n = 9) or vehicle (n = 10) was administered IV to the fetus, starting 10 min after the start of reperfusion and continued for 6 It. Melatonin treatment resulted in a slower recovery of fetal blood pressure following umbilical cord occlusion, but without changes in fetal heart rate, acid base status or mortality. The production of 8-isoprostanes following umbilical cord occlusion was attenuated and there was a reduction in the number of activated microglia cells and TUNEL-positive cells in melatonin treated fetuses, suggesting a protective effect of melatonin. In conclusion, this study shows that melatonin attenuates cell death in the fetal brain in association with a reduced inflammatory response in the blood and the brain following intrauterine asphyxia in mid-gestation fetal sheep.

AB We investigated the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) on heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) in the presence of orthostatic stress among near- and full-term neonates. PCE infants (n = 21) and controls (n = 23) were enrolled within 120 h of birth. ECG was recorded for an hour during quiet sleep, 30 min in supine position and then 30 min in an inclined position. Linear mixed models were used to analyze HR and HRV in the time domain and wavelet and power spectrum analyses in the frequency domain. PCE infants had tachyeardia both before (p = 0.091) and after tilting (p = 0.015), but with a clear interaction between PCE and orthostatic stress (p = 0.049). Compared with controls, PCE infants had a delayed and prolonged reaction to orthostatic stress. There was also a pronounced interaction with regard to log-transformed SDDRR, a measure of HRV (p = 0.049). Controls experienced an instantaneous increase in, log (SDDRR) followed by a prompt return to normal levels, while PCE infants had a gradual increase that did not dissipate quickly. Frequency-domain analyses also distinguished between the cocaine-exposed infants and the controls. Results suggest that the effects of PCE on the development of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems could lead to altered cardiovascular function.

AB Using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) we perform scaling analysis of short datasets of length 500-1500 data points. We quantify the long range correlation (exponent alpha) by computing the mean value of the local exponents alpha(L) (in the asymptotic regime). The local exponents are obtained as the (numerical) derivative of the logarithm of the fluctuation function F(s) with respect to the logarithm of the scale factor s:alpha(L) = d log(10) F(s)/d log(10) s. These local exponents display huge variations and complicate the correct quantification of the underlying correlations. We propose the use of the phase randomized Surrogate (PRS), which preserves the long range correlations of the original data, to minimize the variations in the local exponents. Using the numerically generated uncorrelated and long range correlated data, we show that performing DFA on several realizations of PRS and estimating alpha(L) from the averaged fluctuation functions (of all realizations) can minimize the variations in alpha(L). The application of this approach to the fetal cardiac data (RR intervals) is discussed and we show that there is a statistically significant correlation between alpha and the gestation age.

ID RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS; HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE
AB Objective To assess the safety of chloroquine (CQ) as prophylaxis against Plasmodium vivax infection during pregnancy.
   Method One thousand pregnant Karen women were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of chemoprophylaxis with chloroquine (500 mg phosphate (or 300 mg base) weekly). Women received a median (range) chloroquine phosphate total dose of 9500 (1500-17 500) mg. The mothers were actively followed from inclusion to delivery and their infants until 12 months of age.
   Results Chloroquine prophylaxis completely prevented P. vivax episodes; 10.1% (95%CI: 7.3-14.5) of women in the placebo group experienced at least one episode of vivax malaria but no episode occurred in women in the CQ group. By contrast, the numbers of P. falciparum episodes were similar in each group: 7.4% (95%CI: 3.7-11.1) and 5.6% (95%CI: 3.3-7.9) in the placebo and CQ groups respectively (P = 0.56). Chloroquine prophylaxis was well tolerated and there was no difference in the proportions of reported side effects between CQ treated and placebo groups except for the duration of palpitations and sleeping disorders which were more frequent in those who had received CQ. Chloroquine prophylaxis had no impact on maternal anaemia, birth weight, gestational age, development of newborns or on growth, neurological development or visual acuity in infants at 1 year of age.
   Conclusions Chloroquine is safe and effective as prophylaxis against P. vivax during pregnancy in this population.

AB Background. Snoring is common in pregnancy, but there are only a few studies that have investigated the relationship of snoring and pregnancy complications. We aimed to investigate the relationship of snoring and witnessed sleep apnoeas with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Methods. A questionnaire was administered on the day of delivery to 456 women at the Department of Obstetrics, Hospital Donacion F. Santojanni, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Pregnancy complications and blood pressure measurements were recorded from each woman's medical chart. Results. Some 156 (35%) of 447 women with singleton pregnancies who answered the questionnaire, snored at some time during their pregnancy. Snoring was related to pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia combined, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.82 (95% Cl: 1.16-2.84; p < 0.01), independent of body mass index before pregnancy, weight gain during pregnancy, neck circumference, smoking, alcohol and age. Witnessed sleep apnoeas were also related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease, with an adjusted odds ratio of 8.00 (95% CL 2.71-23.55; p < 0.001). Daytime sleepiness was more prevalent in snoring women. Conclusions. Snoring and witnessed sleep apnoeas are independently related to pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease.

AB Background. To determine the levels of oxidative stress markers in pregnant women who snore and compare with non-snoring pregnant women. Fetal outcome of these 2 groups was also evaluated. Materials and methods. Prospective, case control study. Some 40 pregnant women who snored and 43 non-snoring pregnant women were evaluated. The glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels of the 2 groups were studied. Infant birthweight, Apgar scores, and other indicators of fetal outcome were obtained. Results. The mean level of GSH-Px was significantly lower in the pregnant women who snored (p = 0.005), while the mean level of MDA was significantly higher in this group (p = 0.005). Levels of MPO were comparable between the groups (p > 0.05). The pregnant women who snored did not have infants with evidence of an increase in compromised outcome. Conclusion. Although the pregnant women who snored had high levels of MDA, they did not appear to be at increased risk for delivering infants with fetal compromise.

AB Cortisol is used in research as a biomarker of psychological stress. Logistical considerations argue for collecting as few samples as possible, balanced against diurnal rhythms and intra-individual variations. 100 pregnant women gave five saliva samples a day for 3 days, at waking, 30 min after waking, and 11:00 a.m., 5:00 p.m., and 9:00 p.m. Timing of collection was confirmed by monitors. Another sample was taken during a clinic visit. Using the 15 measures as the gold standard, correlations and mean area under the curve (AUC) were compared with subsets and the single clinic sample to evaluate alternate collection protocols. Five samples in 1 day, or protocols involving morning and night samples, had the highest correlations with mean AUC (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.82 to 0.88). Standardizing the clinic measurement to a single time of day did not substantially improve correlations with mean AUC. Correlations with measures of reported stress were also not strong.

AB Background
   Although conventional non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are effective in many people, alternative therapies such as acupuncture are still widely practiced. However, it remains unclear whether the existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use.
   Objectives
   To determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in people with insomnia.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts International, CINAHL, AMED ( the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database), TCMLARS ( Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database, the Chinese Acupuncture Trials Register, the Trials Register of the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, from inception to 2006, and the sleep bibliography, which is available at www.websciences.org/bibliosleep. We searched reference lists of retrieved articles, and contacted trial authors and experts in the field for information on ongoing/completed trials.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials evaluating any form of acupuncture involving participants of any age with any type of insomnia were included. Included trials compared acupuncture with placebo or sham or no treatment, or acupuncture plus other treatments compared with the same other treatments. Trials that compared only acupuncture methods or compared acupuncture alone against other treatments alone were excluded, since they did not yield the net effect of acupuncture.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality according to a set of criteria for risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias. Relative risk (RR) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals were used for binary and continuous outcomes respectively. Data were combined in meta-analyses ( on an intention-to-treat basis), where more than one trial without significant clinical heterogeneity presented the same outcome.
   Main results
   Seven trials met the inclusion criteria. The studies included 590 participants with insomnia, of whom 56 dropped out. Participant age ranged from 15 to 98 years, and the duration of insomnia varied from 6 months to 19 years. Co-existingmedical conditions contributing to insomnia included stroke, end-stage renal disease and pregnancy. Apart from conventional needle acupuncture, different variants of acupuncture such as acupressure, auricular magnetic and seed therapy, and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation ( TEAS) were evaluated. Meta-analysis was limited because of considerable heterogeneity between comparison groups and between outcome measures.
   Based on the findings from individual trials, the review suggested that acupuncture and acupressure may help to improve sleep quality scores when compared to placebo ( SMD = -1.08, 95% CI = -1.86 to -0.31, p=0.006) or no treatment ( SMD -0.55, 95% CI = 0.89 to -0.21, p=0.002). TEAS also resulted in better sleep quality score in one trial (SMD= -0.74, 95% CI = -1.22 to -0.26, p=0.003). However, the efficacy of acupuncture or its variants was inconsistent between studies for many sleep parameters, such as sleep onset latency, total sleep duration and wake after sleep onset. The combined result from three studies reporting subjective insomnia improvement showed that acupuncture or its variants was not more significantly effective than control (RR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.68 to -4.03) and significant statistical heterogeneity was observed. Only one study reported an adverse event, with one out of 16 patients (6.3%) withdrawing from acupuncture because of pain.
   Authors' conclusions
   The small number of randomised controlled trials, together with the poor methodological quality and significant clinical heterogeneity, means that the current evidence is not sufficiently extensive or rigorous to support the use of any form of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia. Larger high quality clinical trials employing appropriate randomisation concealment and blinding with longer follow-up are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia.

AB Background More than two-thirds of pregnant women experience back pain and almost one-fifth experience pelvic pain. The pain increases with advancing pregnancy and interferes with work, daily activities and sleep.
   Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for preventing and treating back and pelvic pain in pregnancy.
   Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group's Trials Register ( February 2006).
   Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of any treatment to prevent or reduce the incidence or severity of back or pelvic pain in pregnancy.
   Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
   Main results We found no studies dealing specifically with prevention of back or pelvic pain. We included eight studies ( 1305 participants) that examined the effects of adding various pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy, acupuncture and pillows to usual prenatal care.
   For women with low-back pain, participating in strengthening exercises, sitting pelvic tilt exercises ( standardised mean difference (SMD) -5.34; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 6.40 to - 4.27), and water gymnastics reduced pain intensity and back pain-related sick leave ( relative risk (RR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92) better than usual prenatal care alone.
   The specially-designed Ozzlo pillow was more effective than a regular one in relieving back pain (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.32 to 2.55), but is no longer commercially available. Both acupuncture and stabilising exercises relieved pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care. Acupuncture gave more relief from evening pain than exercises. For women with both pelvic and back pain, in one study, acupuncture was more effective than physiotherapy in reducing the intensity of their pain; stretching exercises resulted in more total pain relief (60%) than usual care (11%); and 60% of those who received acupuncture reported less intense pain, compared to 14% of those receiving usual prenatal care. Women who received usual prenatal care reported more use of analgesics, physical modalities and sacroiliac belts.
   Authors' conclusions All but one study had moderate to high potential for bias, so results must be viewed cautiously. Adding pregnancy-specific exercises, physiotherapy or acupuncture to usual prenatal care appears to relieve back or pelvic pain more than usual prenatal care alone, although the effects are small. We do not know if they actually prevent pain from starting in the first place. Water gymnastics appear to help women stay at work. Acupuncture shows better results compared to physiotherapy.

AB A sample of 750 women were interviewed during pregnancy on their depression and anxiety symptoms, substance use and demographic variables. A subsample was seen again at the neonatal stage (n = 152), and their infants were observed for sleep-wake behavior. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were related to caffeine use. Mothers who consumed more caffeine also smoked more often, were younger, were less educated, reported less sleep effectiveness and more obstetric complications. Their newborns were lower birthweight, they spent less time in REM sleep and they showed more stress behaviors including hiccups, tremors and jerkiness.

AB Depressed (n = 110) and nondepressed (n = 104) mothers were given a set of self-report measures, including the CES-D (depression), the STAI (anxiety), the STAXI (anger), the Perinatal Anxieties and Attitudes Scale, a questionnaire on substance use and the Feelings About Pregnancy and Delivery Scale that was designed for this study and that includes scales on coping, support, intimacy, common knowledge of depression, and cultural effects on pregnancy. During the neonatal period, the depressed mothers scored higher on the depression, anger, and anxiety scales as well as the Perinatal Anxieties and Attitudes Scale. They also reported using more substances including cigarettes, caffeine, and medications (primarily antibiotics). Their scores on the Feelings About Pregnancy and Delivery Scale were lower including the coping, support, intimacy, and cultural effects scores. In addition, they reported having more stressful situations during pregnancy, being less happy when finding out them were pregnant and their significant other being less happy when finding out about the pregnancy. A regression analysis on maternal depression suggested that 28% of the variance was explained by low support scale scores, not co-sleeping with their infant and high caffeine intake.

AB Study Objectives: To demonstrate that fetal heart rate measured by ultrasound can be successfully captured and monitored throughout the nocturnal polysomnogram.
   Methods: Fetal heart rate by ultrasound using an abdominal belt (Hewlett Packard Fetal Monitor 8040A) was measured during 1 overnight polysomnogram in volunteers in late pregnancy and added to a digitized polysomnography system (Alice 4, Respironics)
   Results: In 6 women with a single fetus in their third trimester, the fetal heart rate monitor band only infrequently needed to be readjusted. Fetal kicks and movements resulted in signal loss, usually with subsequent recapture without having to awaken the mother.
   Conclusions: Fetal heart rate, 1 of the classic signals of fetal distress, can be added to the nocturnal polysomnogram with minimal disruption of maternal sleep and with signal capture throughout the night.

   EXPRESSION
AB Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) regulates growth and development during the early postimplantation period of mouse embryogenesis. Blockage of VIP with a VIP antagonist during this period results in growth restriction, microcephaly, and developmental delays. Similar treatment of neonatal rodents also causes developmental delays and impaired diurnal rhythms, and the adult brains of these animals exhibit neuronal dystrophy and increased VIP binding. These data suggest that blockage of VIP during the development of the nervous system can result in permanent changes to the brain. In the current study, pregnant mice were treated with a VIP antagonist during embryonic days 8 through 10. The adult male offspring were examined in tests of novelty, paired activity, and social recognition. Brain tissue was examined for several measures of chemistry and gene expression of VIP and related compounds. Glial cells from the cortex of treated newborn mice were plated with neurons and examined for VIP binding and their ability to enhance neuronal survival. Treated adult male mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and deficits in social behavior. Brain tissue exhibited regionally specific changes in VIP chemistry and a trend toward increased gene expression of VIP and related compounds that reached statistical significance in the VIP receptor, VPAC-1, in the female cortex. When compared to control astrocytes, astrocytes from treated cerebral cortex produced further increases in neuronal survival with excess synaptic connections and reduced VIP binding. In conclusion, impaired VIP activity during mouse embryogenesis resulted in permanent changes to both adult brain chemistry/cell biology and behavior with aspects of autism-like social deficits.

AB Pineal melatonin regulates circadian rhythms and influences sleep. Melatonin also has protective actions against tissue damage from free-radicals and other toxins. Evidence is presented that this indoleamine is involved in pre- and postnatal brain (and ocular) development and intrauterine growth. In the absence of maternal melatonin, short gestation infants have a prolonged period of melatonin deficiency. Melatonin supplementation, which has a benign safety profile, may help reduce complications in the neonatal period that are associated with short gestation. We believe that this treatment might result in a wide range of health benefits, improved quality of life and reduced healthcare costs.

AB Objective: To study familial and nonfamilial environmental influences on attention problems and aftention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in monozygotic twins discordant and concordant-high and low for these traits. Method: Ninety-five twin pairs from The Netherlands Twin Register were selected. Longitudinal survey data were collected at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 12 years from parents, twins, and teachers. Mothers participated in a structured clinical interview when twins were between 10 and 17 years of age. Results: Affected twins from discordant pairs scored higher than unaffected cotwins on multiple measures of attention problems, ADHD, and other behavior problems according to mother, teacher, and self. Behavioral discordance was evident at age 2 and all subsequent measurements. Compared with unaffected cotwins, affected twins had lower birth weight and delayed physical growth and motor development. Differences between discordant and concordant groups were reported for maternal smoking, sleeping in different rooms, and living with only one parent. Conclusions: Significant markers of ADHD are found in infancy and include low birth weight and delayed motor development. As the knowledge of specific genetic and environmental influences on ADHD increases, future studies may focus on their complex interplay.

AB "Study of the Toxicity and Efficacy in Wistar Rats of a Phytoterapic Used as Sedative and/or Hypnotic". The phytoterapic Sonotabs((R)) composed by dry extracts of Passiflora incarnata ("maracujd"), Salix alba ("saigueiro") and Crataegus oxycantha ("crataegus") was investigated from the potential of toxicological effects when orally administered during all the pregnancy to Wistar rats, ten times the prescribed dosage to humans. The gestational, fetal and post-natal effects were evaluated. The phytoterapic efficacy was investigated by measuring both locomotor and exploratory activity in male rats, after the oral administration of the human prescribed dose, in open-field study and barbituric (sodium pentobarbital) sleeping time. The results indicated that the phytoterapic, in the tested doses and treatment duration, didn't cause any adverse effect in pregnant rats nor in the fertility. The litter size and post-natal development were not adversely affected. The efficacy evaluation shows significant reduction in ambulatory activity (34,6%) and exploratory activity (34,5%) in the phytoterapic treated group. The sleeping time induced by sodium pentobarbital was significantly increased (20%). The results indicate the efficacy of the phytoterapic as sedative and/or hypnotic.

AB The use of real-time reporters has accelerated our understanding of gene expression in vivo. This study examined the feasibility of a luciferase-based reporter to image spatiotemporal changes in fetal gene expression in utero. We chose to monitor Period1 (Per1) because it is expressed broadly in the body and plays a role in circadian rhythmicity. Using rats carrying a Per1::luc transgene, we repetitively imaged fetuses in utero throughout gestation. We found that bioluminescence was specific to transgenic pups, increased dramatically on embryonic day 10 (10 days after successful mating), and continued to increase logarithmically until birth. Diurnal fluctuations in Per1 expression were apparent several days prior to birth. These results demonstrate the feasibility of in utero imaging of mammalian gene expression, tracking of fetal gene expression from the same litter, and early detection of mammalian clock gene expression. We conclude that luciferase-based reporters can provide a sensitive, noninvasive measure of in utero gene expression.

AB The Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a heterogeneous disease. Symptomatic or secondary forms encompass iron deficiency, uremia, pregnancy, polyneuropathy, and other causes. The so-called idiopathic RLS syndrome preferentially affects patients with a younger onset before the age of 30. Here we summarize pathophysiological results along the anatomical route, beginning at the cortex and followed by the basal ganglia, thalamus, A I I neurones, substantia nigra, brainstem nuclei, and spinal cord. Genetic risk variants for RLS have recently been identified in two genes, one of them the homeobox gene MEIS 1, known to be involved in embryonic development and variants in a second locus containing the genes encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP2K5, and the transcription factor LBXCOR1. A third one, the BTBD9 gene with unknown function encodes a BTB(POZ) domain. Accordingly, new concepts on pathophysiology have to bridge conventional knowledge with possible consequences deriving from these findings. Furthermore, this may create a framework to help understand why dopamine, opioid, and some anticonvulsant therapies are effective in RLS patients. (C) 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

AB The European Restless Leas Syndrome (RLS) Study Group (EURLSSG) is an association of European RLS experts who are actively involved in RLS research. A major aim of the Study Group is the development and continuous improvement of standards for diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Several members developed study designs and evaluation methods in investigator-initiated trials early in the 1990s, and all members have since contributed to many pivotal and nonpivotal drug trials for the treatment of RLS. The recommendations on clinical investigations of pharmacological treatment of RLS patients summarize the group's expertise and knowledge acquired through clinical trials. The recommendations primarily address how to plan and conduct confirmatory, randomized clinical studies in patients with idiopathic RLS. Advice is presented for the diagnosis of RLS and clinical and polysomnographic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary and secondary endpoints for an evaluation of efficacy are based on a critical description of validated methods for both short- and long-term trials, also in special populations (children, pregnant women, elderly patients). The recommendations include the assessment of augmentation. Finally, general issues including the evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as specific neurological and cardiovascular risks and sleep attacks/daytime somnolence, are discussed. The aim of these recommendations is to support research groups or pharmaceutical companies in the design of optimized study protocols. (C) 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterised by a complaint of an almost irresistible urge to move the legs. RLS is diagnosed clinically by means of the four essential criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group. In doubtful cases, neurophysiological examinations, such as polysomnography and/or a suggested immobilisation test, can be performed to confirm a clinical suspicion of RLS. Several other conditions may present sensorimotor complaints with features similar to RLS; a careful sleep history is required to avoid a misdiagnosis. Three different scales have been validated to assess the severity of RLS. In the general population, RLS prevalence ranges from 0.1% to 11.5%, with a high number of patients affected by a primary form of the sleep disturbance (70%-80%). However, several clinical conditions have been associated with RLS, such as iron deficiency, uraemia, pregnancy and polyneuropathy. Furthermore, recent studies show that RLS may be associated also to type 2 diabetes mellitus and to multiple sclerosis. RLS has a negative impact on sleep, cognitive functions, quality of life and mental status. Higher awareness of RLS among physicians is required; it remains an underdiagnosed clinical condition.

AB This review analyses the most relevant studies in which ethanol intake was measured after prenatal exposure to the drug. Despite the variety in methodology, in most such studies this prenatal experience induced a higher consumption of ethanol. Several variables that may affect the expression of this phenomenon are discussed, such as gender, age at testing, period of ethanol exposure, ethanol dose and conditions during the test. The mechanisms proposed in all these studies to explain the increased ethanol intake effect are also discussed. Some of these mechanisms are related to the teratological effects of the drug on the neurochemical systems involved in the reinforcing effects of abuse drugs, as well as on the regulatory systems of stress response. Another explanation of this phenomenon is also proposed in terms of associative learning. Specifically, the increased ethanol intake effect may be the result of a conditioned preference for ethanol acquired by the fetus when exposed to the drug during the last days of gestation.

AB The neuroanatomical and neurophysiological development of the embryo and fetus and unique features of the physiological environment of the fetal brain, features which are lost at birth, support recent conclusions that under normal circumstances awareness ( or consciousness) is probably not exhibited by the ovine embryo-fetus before birth and that it appears for the first time only after birth. However, there has apparently been no evaluation of whether or not similar mechanisms modulate awareness-related functions in domestic chicks before and after hatching. This comparative review, in seeking to rectify this, arrived at the following conclusions.
   First, the neural apparatus of both lambs and chicks appears to be too immature to support any states resembling awareness during at least the first half of pregnancy or incubation. Second, electroencephalographic ( EEG) activity, which evolves subsequently, shows that states of sleep-like unconsciousness are likely to be continuously present in lambs until after birth, and that such states at least predominate in chicks until after hatching. Third, as in fetal lambs, epochs of so-called `wakefulness' previously reported in chick embryos do not seem likely to represent short periods of awareness in ovo. Fourth, several neurosuppressive mechanisms, with some unique features, also operate or have the potential to operate in chicks before hatching, but a dearth of published information currently hinders a full comparison with those demonstrated to operate in fetal lambs. Fifth, contradicting the intuitive perception that vocalisation pre-hatching by the chick indicates the presence of awareness, published evidence suggests that vocalisation before and during hatching occurs mostly during EEG states indicating sleep-like unconsciousness. Sixth, as seems to be the case for newborn lambs after birth, it is possible that demonstrable awareness may appear for the first time only after hatching in chicks, presumably through waning neurosuppression and burgeoning neuroactivation, but such awareness seems to take longer to manifest itself. However, additional research in chicks is recommended to further assess this suggestion. Particular attention should be given to the status of vocal interactions between hen and chick which begin several days before hatching, and to the operation of neurosuppressive and neuroactivating mechanisms throughout the last 40% of incubation and during and after hatching.

AB Problems regutating behaviour and emotions in infancy may be a risk factor for the development of psychopathology later in life. Compelling evidence from animal models suggests that one potential pathway to early dysregulation is fetal programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. According to this model, prenatal maternal stress and anxiety during sensitive periods of development can lead to enduring changes in fetal and offspring neurodevelopment and behaviour. While there is emerging evidence from human studies to suggest a link between maternal negative mood states in pregnancy and various cognitive, behavioural., and emotional disturbances in offspring, it is not yet clear whether the programming mechanism demonstrated in animal studies also applies to humans. Few studies have directly assessed HPA axis function in the infants of prenatally stressed women. Research in this area has been constrained by a number of measurement challenges unique to the assessment of cortisol in infants. This paper discusses these challenges with a view to stimulating further research in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To assess the profile of metabolic abnormalities in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
   Patients and methods: In a case-control study conducted in two years, from April 2003 to March 2005, data obtained from polysomnography study, lipid profile, fasting blood sugar, serum insulin, insulin resistance, leptin and adiponectin levels, were compared between the various groups. Included in the study were OSA subjects from a sleep laboratory and matched controls from the community. Those with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV heart failure, pregnancy, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, or who were on treatment for hyperthyroidism, on systemic steroid treatment, or on hormonal replacement therapy, were excluded from the study.
   Results: Forty apneic obese subjects (AHI = 32.19, range 13-52.75) were compared with 40 non-apneic obese controls (AHI = 1.3, range 0-2.45) and 40 normal weight control subjects (AHI = 0.7, range 0-1). No significant difference was noted in levels of fasting blood sugar, insulin resistance (obese apneics 61.9, obese controls 47.8, non-obese controls 19.1), leptin (obese apneics 10.65 mu g/L, obese controls 8.52 mu g/L, non-obese controls 2.83 mu g/L) or adiponectin (obese apneics 4959.3 ng/ml, obese controls 5706 ng/ml, non-obese controls 7412 ng/ml) in the OSA group compared to obese controls.
   Conclusions: OSA has no independent association with lipid abnormalities, insulin resistance, serum leptin and adiponectin levels. In multivariate analysis, obesity was the major determinant of metabolic abnormalities in this cohort. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The brainstem development of infants born between 33 and 38 weeks' gestation is less mature than that of a full-term infant. During late gestation, there are dramatic and nonlinear developmental changes in the brainstem. This translates into immaturity of upper airway and lung volume control, laryngeal reflexes, chemical control of breathing, and sleep mechanisms. Ten percent of late pre-term infants have significant apnea of prematurity and they frequently have delays in establishing coordination of feeding and breathing. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of clinical, physiologic, neuroanatomic, and neurochemical data in this specific group of infants. Research focused on this group of infants will not only further our understanding of brainstem maturation during this high risk period, but will help develop focused plans for their management.

AB Purpose of review
   The aim of this article is to review the clinical challenges of obesity in obstetrics from the anaesthetist's viewpoint.
   Recent findings
   The prevalence of obesity continues to increase both in the community and on the labour ward. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery are also on rise. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with hypertensive disease (chronic hypertension and preeclampsia), diabetes mellitus (pregestational and gestational), respiratory disorders (asthma and sleep apnoea), thromboembolic disease, caesarean section and infection (primarily urinary tract infections, would infections and endometritis). Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia related maternal mortality. Obese women are not only at high-risk of airway complications, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, perioperative morbidity and mortality but also pose technical challenges. Obesity also influences the fetal outcomes. Increasing use of regional techniques contributes to the reduced anaesthesia-related maternal mortality. Preconception counseling antenatal screening and anaesthetic assessment are strongly encouraged.
   Summary
   Effective communication and good teamwork between an anaesthetist and an obstetrician are essential for the care of obese parturients. A more liberalized use of regional techniques may be a means of further reducing the anaesthesia-related maternal mortality.

AB Bed-sharing among Barbadian mothers and infants was studied inrelationship to maternal and infant characteristics. This prospective study followed 226 healthy, well-nourished mother-infant dyads at birth, 7 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum. At each age, approximately half of the infants shared the same beds as their mothers. Bed-sharing was associated with demographic characteristics, especially fewer home conveniences, and also maternal characteristics, including less information seeking by the mother and younger maternal age at first pregnancy. Bed-sharing was also associated with lower infant birth weights. Maternal moods were significantly correlated with bed-sharing, such that mothers who reported having more despair and anxiety were also more likely to sleep with their infants. Bed-sharing was also significantly associated with increased breastfeeding at all infant ages, but this relationship was no longer significant once the effects of maternal moods were controlled. This study emphasizes the importance of assessing maternal moods in studies evaluating the risk and benefits of bed-sharing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. To evaluate the surgical caseload in a military obstetrics and gynecology residency program, prior to and after implementation of an 80-hour workweek.
   Methods. A retrospective cohort study evaluating data submitted to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) for cumulative resident procedures in obstetrics and gynecology for the years before ( July 2001 - June 2002) and after ( July 2002 - June 2003) 80-hour workweek implementation. Total obstetric and gynecology procedures were examined using both the Student's paired t-test and a two-way mixed factor analysis of variance.
   Results. Between July 2001 and June 2002 there were 822 gynecological cases and 3958 deliveries done by 17 OB/GYN residents; these were compared with 827 cases and 3504 deliveries done by 18 OB/GYN residents between July 2002 and June 2003 ( p = 0.189). The total numbers of obstetric and gynecology cases pre- and post-80-hour workweek intervention were similar when evaluated by month ( July through June of 2001/2 vs. 2002/3; p = 0.908). There was a significantly greater number of obstetrics cases compared with gynecological cases (p<0.001) in the pre- vs. post-80-hour workweek groups; the number of gynecological cases remained constant in the post-80-hour workweek group while the obstetric numbers dropped ( p = 0.001).
   Conclusion. The 80-hour workweek restriction resulted in similar total numbers of obstetrics and gynecology cases, although the total number of obstetric cases per resident declined after implementation.

AB A survey of the nutritional status of women in 6 villages of the Pune district of Maharashtra, India, found young women to have a significantly lower BMI than their male peers. The purpose of this study was to identify social and economic factors associated with this difference in thinness and to explore the behavior in men and women that might underlie these associations. We compared men and women in 90 families in this part of Maharashtra by taking measurements of the height and weight of the married couple of child-bearing age in each family and assessing their social and economic details, fasting practices, and oil consumption. In this agricultural community, women were thinner in joint land-owning families, where the main occupation was farming, than those in nonfarming families. This was not true of men in this type of family. Men in "cash-rich" families had higher BMI than men in families without this characteristic. There was no corresponding difference in women's BMI. We then examined the lifestyles of men and women in a subset of 45 of these families. Women were more likely to work full time in farming than men, to carry the burden of all household chores, to have less sleep, and to eat less food away from home than men. Women fasted more frequently and more strictly than men. Despite identifying significant differences in behavior between men and women in the same household, we did not find a direct link between behavior and BMI We conclude that being married into a farming family is an important factor in determining the thinness of a woman in rural Maharashtra.

AB Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, various demographic, psychological, educational, and family variables were explored as predictors of pregnancy resolution. Only 2 of the 17 variables examined were significantly associated with pregnancy resolution (risk-taking and the desire to leave home). After controlling for these variables, adolescents who aborted an unwanted pregnancy were more inclined than adolescents who delivered to seek psychological counseling and they reported more frequent problems sleeping and more frequent marijuana use. No significant differences were observed for cigarette smoking, frequency of alcohol use, and problems with parents based on alcohol use after the controls were instituted; however without controls, significant associations were observed, underscoring the importance of the use of psychological and situational controls in studies of the consequences of abortion. The information derived from this study is potentially useful to parents and professionals who provide guidance to adolescents regarding pregnancy resolution.

AB OBJECTIVE. Our aim was to quantify contemporary infant mortality risks and to evaluate the change by plurality, gestation, and race during the most recent decade.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS. The study population included live births of 20 to 43 weeks' gestation from the 1989-1991 and 1999-2001 US Birth Cohort Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Sets, including 11 317 895 and 11 181 095 live births and 89 823 and 67 129 infant deaths, respectively. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate the change in risk by plurality and gestation and to compare the change with that for singletons.
   RESULTS. Overall, the infant mortality risk decreased significantly for singletons, twins, and triplets but nonsignificantly for quadruplets and quintuplets. Compared with singletons, significantly greater reductions were experienced by twins overall and at < 37 weeks and triplets at < 29 weeks. The largest reduction was for triplets at 20 to 24 weeks and for quadruplets and quintuplets at 25 to 28 weeks. For white infants, significant reductions were achieved overall for singletons, twins, and triplets and at every gestation. For black infants, significant reductions occurred for singletons overall and at every gestation, for twins at < 37 weeks, and for triplets at 25 to 28 weeks. Compared with white infants, black infants had significantly lower risks before and higher risks after 33 weeks, although between 1989-1991 and 1999-2001 this survival advantage at earlier ages diminished, and the risk at later gestations increased.
   CONCLUSIONS. The improvements in survival were greater for multiples versus singletons and for white versus black infants. Within each plurality, at each gestation the racial disparity in mortality has widened.

AB Study Objectives: Maternal and infant sleep are significant health concerns for postpartum families. The results of previously published studies have indicated that behavioral-educational strategies promote infant sleep, but these reports relied on parental report and did not include maternal sleep. This pilot study of a maternal-infant sleep intervention evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and effects on sleep and other outcomes in the early postpartum period.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial with concealed-group allocation.
   Setting: Hospital postpartum unit with home follow-up.
   Participants: First-time mothers and their infants randomly assigned to sleep intervention (n = 15) or control group (n = 15).
   Interventions: The sleep intervention included a 45-minute meeting with a nurse to discuss sleep information and strategies, an 11-page booklet, and weekly phone contact to reinforce information and problem solve. The control group received a 10-minute meeting during which only maternal sleep hygiene and basic information about infant sleep were discussed, a 1-page pamphlet, and calls at weeks 3 and 5 to maintain contact without provision of advice.
   Measurement and Results: Questionnaires were completed at baseline and 6 weeks; sleep diaries and mother and infant actigraphy were completed at 6 weeks. The mothers in the sleep intervention group averaged 57 minutes more nighttime sleep, and fewer rated their sleep as a problem, as compared with the mothers in the control group. Infants in the sleep intervention group had fewer nighttime awakenings and had maximum lengths of nighttime sleep that were, on average, 46 minutes longer than those in the control group.
   Conclusions: A behavioral-educational intervention with first-time mothers in the early postpartum period promotes maternal and infant sleep. Further evaluation of the intervention in a larger, more diverse sample is needed.

AB The Tokyo Twin Cohort Project (ToTCoP) is a large-scale longitudinal study of 5 years based on 1619 pairs of infant twins reared together. The purpose of the study is to construct a population-based twin registry in Japan and to investigate human growth and development and twin themselves. It covers behavioral, neurological, physical and environmental variables measured by questionnaire, home visiting and brain imaging technology. The full registry contains over 47,000 multiple births collected from the Basic Resident Register, and the targeted population is 3070 probable twins of 0 to 2 years old. Preliminary analysis of the entry questionnaire data showed no serious sampling biases. Descriptive statistics of parental characteristics (parental age, gestation age, parity and placentation, maternal weight, parenting stress) and children's characteristics (body size at birth, 4 and 10 months of age, milk consumption, and sleeping and social behavior) and their correlations, genetic and environmental contributions and correlations are reported.

AB A number of fundamental milestones define the pace at which animals develop, mature, reproduce and age. These include the length of gestation, the age at weaning and at sexual maturity, the number of offspring produced over a lifetime and the length of life itself. Because a time-scale for dental development can be retrieved from the internal structure of teeth and many of these life-history variables tend to be highly correlated, we can discover more than might be imagined about fossil primates and more, in particular, about fossil hominids and our own evolutionary history. Some insights into the evolutionary processes underlying changes in dental development are emerging from a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling enamel and dentine formation. Our own 18-20-year period of growth and development probably evolved quite recently after ca 17 million years of a more ape-like life-history profile.

AB Callitrichid females are often described as energetically constrained. We examined the energy budgets of 10 female wild golden lion tamarins (GLTs, Leontopithecus rosalia) in an effort to understand how energy intake and expenditure might influence physical condition and therefore reproductive performance. We used focal animal sampling to record behavioral data and conducted energy analyses of foods consumed by GLTs to estimate intake and expenditure. We used two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare intake in the reproductive vs. nonreproductive period and expenditure in the reproductive vs. nonreproductive period. Energy intake decreased during the reproductive period compared to the nonreproductive period. While total expenditure did not vary significantly across the two periods, females spent more time and therefore expended significantly more energy engaged in energetically inexpensive behaviors (i.e., sleeping or being stationary) during the reproductive period compared to the nonreproductive period. We suggest that reproductive female GLTs may adopt a reproductive strategy that includes high intake prior to pregnancy and lactation, and energy conservation during pregnancy and lactation.

   SCANDINAVIA; ALCOHOL; INTERVENTION; POSITION
AB Objective: To compare the current prevalence of risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Sweden with a decade earlier, and assess factors associated with prone sleeping.
   Methods: The results of a cohort study (Infants of Western Sweden) and a population based case-control study (Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study) were examined. Subjects were 5600 healthy 6 month old infants born in 2003 in the Western Sweden region and 430 healthy Swedish infants born between 1991 and 1995.
   Results: Prone sleeping decreased from 31.8% to 5.6% and supine sleeping increased from 35.3% to 47.3%. Side or side/supine sleeping increased from 25.2% to 43.8%. Maternal smoking during pregnancy decreased from 23.5% to 9.5%. The risk for prone sleeping increased if the mother was unemployed (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5 to 4.0), if she was a heavy smoker in the third trimester (OR 44.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 1199.6), and if the child was irritable (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1), shared a bedroom with siblings (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.6), or never used a dummy (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.9 to 5.4).
   Conclusions: Parents have complied with advice to prevent SIDS given at infant welfare centres for the last 10 years. A change in the preferred sleeping position from side variants to exclusively supine, and reducing the number of pregnant women smoking may be beneficial. Use of a prone sleeping position was associated with maternal employment status, maternal smoking, temperament of the child, dummy use, and sharing a bedroom with siblings.

AB Objective There is limited information regarding the effects of IGF-I and/or IGFBP-3 on circulating ghrelin concentrations. To determine the effects of IGF-I on GH and ghrelin concentrations, we examined the GH and ghrelin nocturnal profiles before and after the administration of the IGF-I/-IGFBP-3 complex (Iplex (TM)) to low birth weight children.
   Design The children were studied on two separate occasions, the first under basal conditions, and the second time after the sc administration of 1 mg/kg of Iplex (TM) at 2100 h. Blood samples for determination of GH and ghrelin were obtained every 20 min between 2300 h and 0700 h, while the children were sleeping. In each patient, we calculated the mean GH and ghrelin area under the curve (GH AUC and GHR AUC), both under basal conditions and after the administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex.
   Setting The study was performed at a University Research Centre located at a General Hospital in Santiago, Chile.
   Patients Twenty prepubertal children (11 boys and 9 girls), born after a full-term pregnancy with a birth weight below 2.8 kg were studied at a mean +/- SEM age of 7.3 +/- 0.5 years (range 4-11 years). Their mean height was -1.8 +/- 0.3 standard deviation score (SDS) and their mean BMI was 0.1 +/- 0.2 SDS at the time of the study.
   Main outcome and results Mean nocturnal GH AUC exhibited a significant decrease (2903 +/- 185 vs 1860 +/- 122 ng/ml min, P < 0.01), whereas mean GHR AUC showed a significant increase after administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex (68 +/- 16 vs 288 +/- 36 ng/ml min, P < 0.01).
   Conclusions These findings indicate that the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex appears to have opposite effects on circulating GH and ghrelin concentrations in low birth weight children, suggesting that, in addition to its known negative feed-back effect on GH, IGF-I and/or IGFBP-3 may have a positive feed-back effect on ghrelin.

AB Purpose of review To evaluate recent evidence regarding gender differences in sleep.
   Recent findings Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiological periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns.
   Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder and Klein-Levin syndrome are more common in men.
   Summary Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy.

DE cesarean delivery; diabetes mellitus; bariatric; obesity; pregnancy
AB Obesity, generally defined as body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m(2) and above, is a universal growing epidemic. From a public health perspective, it represents an important modifiable risk factor for adverse health and pregnancy outcome. There is a significant association between obesity and diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders, ischemic heart disease and sleep apnea. During pregnancy, obesity is associated with fertility treatments, recurrent abortions, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus and other complications such as labor dystocia, mal-presentations, fetal macrosomia, and higher rates of cesarean deliveries. Bariatric surgery is the only effective treatment for morbidly obese patients, and these operations are performed predominantly among women. Few studies have addressed pregnancy outcome after obesity surgery. Basically, pregnancy outcome is comparable to controls of normal BMI. This review aims to present updates on the relationship between obesity and pregnancy outcomes, and the outcome of patients following bariatric surgeries.

AB In rodents, during late embryonic and early neonatal development, circadian rhythms develop in synchrony with those of their mothers, which in turn are synchronized with the environmental photoperiod.
   This paper examines the effect of maternal ganglionectomy (pineal gland sympathetic denervation) or extirpation of the pineal gland on pups' drinking rhythms, a behavior that is continuously monitored in individual animals starting after weaning and studied up to 3 weeks later. Maternal ganglionectomy or pinealectomy performed on the 7th day of gestation significantly disrupts rat pups' drinking behavior, within and among litters. In both treatments, circadian rhythm characteristics of the free-running period (tau), phase, amplitude and alpha were significantly altered compared to those of the control pups born from sham-operated mothers. With the exception of the alpha component, both maternal treatments have similar effects. When melatonin was given to the mothers instead of the endogenous pineal secretory activity for 5 days during the late period of gestation, this treatment reversed the effects of maternal ganglionectomy and pinealectomy. These observations, together with previous studies of our group, indicate that the maternal superior cervical ganglia and pineal gland are necessary components of the mechanism for maternal synchronization, and that maternal melatonin may, directly or indirectly, affect the performance of the pups' central oscillator during early pup rat development.

   Results: Literature provides a growing amount of information on changing patterns in childhood diseases.
   Conclusions: The following recommendations for action are formulated
   Immediate research on endocrine disrupters in relation to prematurity
   Diabetes: avoid Maillard Compounds in liquid baby food and in food in general: promote breastfeeding
   Asthma: avoid exposure to smoking, the use of chemical household products, dioxin and dioxin-like chemicals, and avoid air pollution with high levels of particulate matter, especially around conception, during pregnancy and in the first years of life
   Autism: more research on incidence and causes
   ADHD and learning disabilities: more research on prevalence and causes. Preventions: 1) preconception counselling to avoid potentially harmful substances; 2) controlling and further lowering levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, lead and methyl mercury
   Cancer: promote breastfeeding, carry out research into effects of foetal exposure to internal fission-product radionuclides
   Obesity: stop smoking in pregnancy, avoid parental obesity, longer night sleep
   Hearing problems: lower noise levels in discotheques, promote the day-evening-night level to avoid noise (longer night sleep).

AB We present a case of hyperexcitability syndrome observed in a neonate born to a mother who was a heavy user of cocoa and chocolate during pregnancy and lactation. The infant presented jitteriness, irritability, inconsolable crying, excessive sucking, and sleeping difficulties almost immediately after birth. The infant underwent extensive diagnostic studies, but none of the usual causes for its symptoms were identified. The symptoms resolved after the interruption of maternal chocolate consumption. We hypothesize that the heavy exposure to chocolate could be responsible for the hyperexcitability syndrome.

AB Sentience and consciousness are prerequisites of suffering. Thus, animals must have sufficiently sophisticated neural mechanisms to receive sensory information and to transduce this information into sensations, and they must also be conscious to be able to perceive those sensations. Moreover, those sensations must be sufficiently noxious or aversive to cause suffering. The neural apparatus of embryos and fetuses of farm animals is inadequate to support sentience for at least the first half of pregnancy, but the required structures and mechanisms do develop by the time of birth. Thus, although one of the preconditions for suffering is satisfied shortly before birth, the embryo and fetus are apparently never conscious for the following reasons. The embryo-fetus initially does not have brain structures that are functionally capable of supporting consciousness, and subsequently, when the fetal brain might have that capability, it displays electrical activity indicating a continuous state of sleep and therefore unconsciousness. Furthermore, the fetus is apparently actively maintained in sleep-like states by several endogenous neuroinhibitory mechanisms which involve adenosine (a potent neuroinhibitory and sleep inducing agent), allopregnanolone and pregnanolone (two neurosteroidal anaesthetics), prostaglandin D, (a potent sleep-inducing hormone), a placental neural inhibitor, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation. Consciousness evidently appears for the first time only after birth. This results from a substantial withdrawal of the neuroinhibitors, especially adenosine, and the involvement of neuroactivators including 17 beta-oestradiol (a potent neuroactive steroid with widespread excitatory effects in the brain), noradrenaline (released from excitatory locus coeruleus nerves that extend throughout the brain), and a barrage of novel sensory information associated with the newborn's first exposure to air, gravity, hard surfaces, unlimited space and, usually, to cold ambient conditions. We conclude that the embryo and fetus cannot suffer before or during birth. Furthermore, we conclude that suffering can only occur in the newborn when the onset of breathing oxygenates its tissues sufficiently to substantially reduce the dominant adenosine inhibition of brain electrical activity. The implications of these observations for managing fetuses and newborns in ways that minimise suffering are considered briefly. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the adult mammal the circadian system, which allows predictive adaptation to daily environmental changes, comprises peripheral oscillators in most tissues, commanded by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The external environment of the fetus is provided by its mother. In primates, maternal melatonin is a candidate to entrain fetal circadian rhythms, including the SCN rhythms of metabolic activity. We found in the 90% of gestation capuchin monkey fetus expression of the clock genes Bmal-1, Per-2, Cry-2, and Clock in the SCN, adrenal, pituitary, brown fat, and pineal. Bmal-1, Per-2, and the melatonin 1 receptor (MT1) showed a robust oscillatory expression in SCN and adrenal gland, whereas a circadian rhythm of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found in plasma. Maternal melatonin suppression changed the expression of Bmal-1, Per- 2, and MT1 in the fetal SCN. These effects were reversed by maternal melatonin replacement. In contrast, neither maternal melatonin suppression nor its replacement had effects on the expression of Per- 2 and Bmal-1 or MT1 in the fetal adrenal gland or the circadian rhythm of fetal plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate. Our data suggest that maternal melatonin is a Zeitgeber for the fetal SCN but probably not for the adrenal gland.

ID RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHM; SENSORY SYMPTOMS;
   EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION; DIAGNOSIS; CRITERIA
AB Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved by movement, and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day. All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features to confirm the diagnosis. Whilst many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, or in those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients' quality of life.

AB In 2003, the EFNS Task Force was set up for putting forth guidelines for the management of the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and the Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD). After determining the objectives for management and the search strategy for primary and secondary RLS and for PLMD, a review of the scientific literature up to 2004 was performed for the drug classes and interventions employed in treatment (drugs acting on the adrenoreceptor, antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines/hypnotics, dopaminergic agents, opioids, other treatments). Previous guidelines were consulted. All trials were analysed according to class of evidence, and recommendations formed according to the 2004 EFNS criteria for rating. Dopaminergic agents came out as having the best evidence for efficacy in primary RLS. Reported adverse events were usually mild and reversible; augmentation was a feature with dopaminergic agents. No controlled trials were available for RLS in children and for RLS during pregnancy. The following level A recommendations can be offered: for primary RLS, cabergoline, gabapentin, pergolide, ropinirole, levodopa and rotigotine by transdermal delivery (the latter two for short-term use) are effective in relieving the symptoms. Transdermal oestradiol is ineffective for PLMD.

AB The paper summarizes research linking long work hours to a wide range of risks to workers, families, employers, and the community. The risks are theorized to stem from less time to recover from work, longer exposure to workplace hazards, and less time to attend to non-work responsibilities. Risks to workers include sleep deprivation, poor recovery from work, decrements in neuro-cognitive and physiological functioning, illnesses, adverse reproductive outcomes, and injuries. Risks to families include delayed marriages and child bearing, and obesity in children. Risks to employers include reduced productivity and increases in workers errors. Mistakes by fatigued workers have broad reaching impacts to the community: medical errors, automobile crashes with other drivers on the road, and industrial disasters that damage the environment.

ID CHILD-CARE PRACTICE; INFANTS; SLEEP; PREGNANCY; POSITION; TRIAL
AB Objective To test the hypothesis that swaddling is an effective method to reduce crying, we compared a standardized approach of regularity and stimulus reduction with the same approach supplemented with swaddling.
   Study design Healthcare nurses coached 398 excessively crying infants up to 12 weeks of age for 3 months. Outcome measurements were crying as measured by Barr's 24-hour diary and parental perception of crying.
   Results Crying decreased by 42% in both groups after the first intervention week. Swaddling had no added benefit in the total group. Young infants (1-7 weeks of age at randomization) benefited significantly more from swaddling as shown by a larger decrease of crying over the total intervention period. Older infants (8-13 weeks of age at randomization) showed a significantly greater decrease in crying when offered the standardized approach without swaddling. The actual difference in crying time was 10 minutes.
   Conclusion For older babies, swaddling did not bring any benefit when added to regularity and stimuli reduction in baby care, although swaddling was a beneficial supplementation in excessively crying infants < 8 weeks of age.

ID POSITION
AB Study Objectives: To evaluate sleep practices regarding maternal, infant, and socioeconomic factors in an infant population and to propose a scoring scale associated with high versus low risk of sudden infant death syndrome.
   Design: Cross-sectional, population-based study.
   Setting: Passo Fundo, Brazil.
   Participants: 2,285 newborns.
   Interventions: Perinatal information was collected from the city health database, and a questionnaire regarding sleep practices was applied to the de facto mothers. The scale for classification of infant sleep practices in relation to high or low risk of sudden infant death syndrome was based on previous population studies. Cox regression, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were employed.
   Measurements and Results: Application of the score allowed detection of high-risk sleep practices in 42.4% of infants. The following variables maintained association with high-risk sleep practices: 6 or fewer visits in the antenatal clinic (p < .001), maternal age : 20 years (p < .001), smoking during pregnancy (p = .041), disease during the first 2 months of life (p = .038), low birth weight (p = .049), and low socioeconomic status (p < .001); 90% of deceased infants and 75% of suspected sudden infant death syndrome cases were regularly exposed to high-risk sleep practices.
   Conclusions: High-risk sleep practices were widely observed in the study population. The significance of this study lies in the future application of this information via public health measures targeted at high-risk populations.

AB Independently, prenatal malnutrition and psychological/physical stress have been shown to affect sleep architecture in adult rats. As malnutrition and stress commonly co-exist in malnourished human populations, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the combined effects of these two insults by examining sleep-wake parameters following a brief restraint stress in prenatally protein malnourished rats. The male offspring of rats provided with a protein deficient diet (6% casein) for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were implanted with recording electrodes beginning at postnatal day 90. Polygraph recordings were obtained to quantify sleep states during the first 4 h of the dark phase of the cycle on 2 consecutive days. The first followed a 24-h habituation session to the recording chamber (baseline). The second occurred at the same time of day but followed 20 min of restraint stress in a Plexiglas tube. During baseline, prenatally malnourished rats spent more time in rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in the first 2 h after "lights off" (block 1), and greater amounts of wakefulness (W) with a corresponding reduction in slow wave sleep (SWS) in the second two hours (block 2), as compared with controls. Following stress, the sleep architecture of both groups of rats remained unaltered in block 1 relative to their baseline day. In block 2, both groups exhibited significant reductions in SWS and REMS with significantly greater reductions being expressed in the prenatally malnourished group (most dramatically, REMS was completely eliminated). These findings suggest that sleep disturbances may be more severe in those malnourished human populations subjected to acutely stressful experiences. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose. The signs and symptoms, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, and options and guidelines for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) are reviewed.
   Summary. RLS was first described in the 17th century and further characterized in 1945. RLS is a common disorder, occurring in about 10% of the population. Patients with RLS often describe the urge to move, uncomfortable sensations, and pain, which begin or worsen during rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting. Symptoms of RLS make sleeping difficult for many patients, and significant daytime difficulties result from the condition. RLS can either be primary or arise from secondary causes that lead to iron deficiency. There is a familial component in primary RLS, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Of individuals with conditions associated with iron-deficiency states, including pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia, 25-0% may develop RLS. The goals of RLS treatment include improving its symptoms and the patient's quality of life. There are limited data on the treatment of RLS. Pharmacologic therapies include iron replacement, dopaminergic agents (e.g., levodopa), dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opi-oids, and benzodiazepines. There have been no systematic trials of nonpharmacologic therapies for RLS, but good sleep hygiene and avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may improve symptoms.
   Conclusion. RLS is a common disorder thought to involve abnormal iron metabolism and dopaminergic systems. Nonpharmacologic therapy should be suggested for all patients with RLS, but pharmacologic therapy may be required, and evidence is strongest for levodopa and dopamine agonists.

   Design: 2-group comparison of data derived from intensive within-subject data collection.
   Setting: Participants' typical daily environment.
   Participants: 38 postpartum and 20 nonpregnant nulliparous women. Mothers' infants were 4 to 10 weeks of postnatal age.
   Main Outcome Measures: Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin assayed from each voiding and corrected for volume using creatinine.
   Results: Postpartum women had significantly higher baseline, lower maximum, lower percent rise, and differing pattern of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin than nonpregnant nulliparous women.
   Conclusion: Differences in melatonin suggest possible circadian rhythm disruption in the postnatal period.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of prolonged mild hypoxemia on fetal brain electrocorticogram (ECoG) in late gestation.
   STUDY DESIGN: Fetal and maternal catheters were placed under general anesthesia and animals allocated at random to receive intratracheal maternal administration of either nitrogen (n = 8) or compressed air (n = 8). Five days after surgery (125 days' gestational age), nitrogen infusion was adjusted to reduce fetal brachial artery PO2 by 25%. The targeted decrease in fetal oxygenation was maintained for 5 days while fetal ECoG activity and fetal and maternal cardiovascular variables were continuously recorded. Data are presented as mean +/- SEM and were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-sample t test.
   RESULTS: Nitrogen infusion decreased fetal Po-2 by 26% (20.5 +/- 1.7 versus 14.3 +/- 0.8) without changing fetal PCo2 or pH. Mild fetal hypoxemia was associated with fetal tachycardia and increased fetal blood pressure (P <. 05). Fetal ECoG in hypoxic fetuses showed a significant decrease in the time spent in high voltage (HV) (P <.05) and an increase in the time spent in low voltage (LV) and in the number of low voltage events (P <. 05). Also, a significant decrease in the proportion of 1-4 Hz and an increase in the proportion of 13-20 Hz frequencies was observed in LV events without a significant change in the frequency profile of HV events (P <. 05).
   CONCLUSION: Prolonged mild hypoxemia significantly altered fetal homeostasis as reflected by the sustained tachycardia and increased blood pressure. Fetal ECoG activity was affected significantly in a qualitatively and quantitative manner by mild prolonged hypoxemia.

AB For more than two decades, prenatal care has been a cornerstone of our nation's strategy for improving pregnancy outcomes. In recent years, however, a growing recognition of the limits of prenatal care and the importance of maternal health before pregnancy has drawn increasing attention to preconception and internatal care. Internatal care refers to a package of healthcare and ancillary services provided to a woman and her family from the birth of one child to the birth of her next child. For healthy mothers, internatal care offers an opportunity for wellness promotion between pregnancies. For high-risk mothers, internatal care provides strategies for risk reduction before their next pregnancy. In this paper we begin to define the contents of internatal care. The core components of internatal care consist of risk assessment, health promotion, clinical and psychosocial interventions. We identified several priority areas, such as FINDS (family violence, infections, nutrition, depression, and stress) for risk assessment or BBEEFF (breastfeeding, back-to-sleep, exercise, exposures, family planning and folate) for health promotion. Women with chronic health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or weight problems should receive on-going care per clinical guidelines for their evaluation, treatment, and follow-up during the internatal period. For women with prior adverse outcomes such as preterm delivery, we propose an internatal care model based on known etiologic pathways, with the goal of preventing recurrence by addressing these biobehavioral pathways prior to the next pregnancy. We suggest enhancing service integration for women and families, including possibly care coordination and home visitation for selected high-risk women. The primary aim of this paper is to start a dialogue on the content of internatal care.

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE

DE infertility; age; donor egg; biological clock; US
ID DONOR INSEMINATION; OVARIAN RESERVE; CHILDREN; PARENTS; DISCLOSURE; US
AB Over the past generation, aging and female reproduction have been lodged within the gendered and gendering debates regarding women's involvement in the workforce and demographic shifts toward delayed parenting that culminate in discourses on the "biological clock". Technological solutions to the biological clock, specifically in vitro fertilization, have led to clinical attempts to assess "ovarian reserve", or qualitative and quantitative changes in the ovary that correlate with aging and with successful infertility treatment. Rupturing the longstanding historical connections between menstruation and female reproductive capacity by specifically focusing on the aging of a woman's eggs, the clinical designation of "diminished ovarian reserve" has come to imply that a woman has "old eggs". This is associated in practitioners' and patients' minds with the eclipse of a woman's reproductive potential and with hidden harbingers of menopause.
   In an ethnographic interview study of 79 couples in the US who conceived after using donor oocytes, we found that women voiced two different narratives that described their experience and attitudes when confronted with an apparent age-related decline in their fertility. The "eleventh-hour mom" narrative was voiced by women who initially tried to become pregnant with their own eggs and turned to donated oocytes as a second-choice option, whereas the "miracle mom" narrative was expressed by women who were generally older, some of whom had entered infertility treatment hoping to conceive with their own eggs, but some who knew from the outset that it was not going to be possible. Through their narratives women not only embodied and made meaningful "diminished ovarian reserve" in varying ways that connect with cultural, social, structural/organizational, symbolic and physical aspects of aging, they reproduced the sociobiological project of the biological clock, but rooted this social project in the metaphor of "old eggs" rather than menopause.

AB This review discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing brain and the potential use of derived peptides from activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) in neuroprotection against the insults of alcohol. Alcohol is known to impede the growth of the central nervous system and to induce neurodegeneration through cellular apoptosis. Sari et al. have shown that prenatal alcohol exposure reduced the fetal brain weight, the size of the brain regions and the number of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Prenatal alcohol exposure compromises neural tube midline development. Sari et al. further suggested that the timing of alcohol exposure during pregnancy is critical to the induction of deficits in 5-HT neurons, as well as other types of neurons and consequently results in deficits in neural tube development. ADNF and ADNP are glial-derived proteins discovered to be induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). These proteins are expressed during embryonic development. Functional assays and genetic manipulations have identified these proteins as highly important for neural tube closure and brain form ation/development. The peptide derivatives of ADNF, ADNF-14 (VLGGGSALLRSIPA), ADNF-9 (or SALLRSIPA = SAL) and of ADNP, NAPVSIPQ = NAP have shown neuroprotective effects and have been proven to prevent brain damage associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in animals. Here, we discuss the many aspects of alcohol-associated growth restriction in the developing brain and the potential inhibition of this severe phenotype through the use of neuroprotective peptides.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to (i) reexamine risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and (ii) describe the relationship between length of gestation and age at death from SIDS.
   METHODS: To evaluate risk factors for SIDS, we used multivariable logistic regression and included maternal demographic characteristics, maternal health and behavioral factors, and infant characteristics, including fetal growth, using US national linked birth and death files from 1996 to 1998. We used multivariable linear regression with mean postnatal age of death as the outcome of interest, controlling for the factors listed (referent length of gestation, 40 to 41 weeks).
   RESULTS: The crude SIDS rate was 0.7 deaths/1000 live births (8199 deaths). Length of gestation was a strong risk factor for SIDS, with the adjusted odds ratio (OR) greatest at shorter gestations: 28 to 32 weeks (OR, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.2). Infants with gestations of 22 to 27 and 28 to 32 weeks died at mean ages of 20.9 (SD = 0.8) and 15.3 (SD = 0.5) weeks, respectively (p <= 0.002). Term infants (40 to 41 weeks) died of SIDS at an adjusted mean age of 14.5 (SD = 0-4) weeks.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preterm birth continues to be a strong risk factor for SIDS after controlling for fetal growth. With increasing gestational age, mean age of SIDS death decreases considerably, with the postnatal age of death of very preterm infants 6 weeks later than that of term infants.

AB The current study investigated the attentional mechanisms associated with goal engagement and disengagement in a lifespan context. Women approaching the end of their childbearing years (N = 29) were compared with women who had passed that deadline (N = 28). Participants' goal engagement was measured with a goal nomination task, an incidental recall task of goal-relevant sentences, visual attention to goal-relevant vs. goal-irrelevant images, and a memory task of goal-relevant images. The attention data indicated that women approaching the deadline had a longer first fixation on baby images than women who had passed the deadline. This novel finding was supported by a replication of the previous finding that women approaching the deadline were more engaged with the goal of childbearing than women who had passed the deadline. The connection between attention and memory of goal-relevant information is explored as evidence of cognition working in the service of motivation and developmental regulation.

AB In the first part of this article, a critical review of traditional approaches used to estimate daily inhalation rates as a function of age for health risk assessment purposes shows that such rates are not totally reliable due to various biases introduced by both quantitative and qualitative deficiencies regarding certain input parameters. In the second part, the magnitude of under- and overestimations of published inhalation rates derived from each approach is described by a comparison with new sets of physiological daily inhalation rates and distribution percentile values based on total daily energy expenditures (TDEEs) measured by the doubly labeled water (DLW) method. TDEEs are derived from the analysis of deuterium (H-2) and heavy oxygen-18 (O-18) in urine samples by gas-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry during an aggregate period of over 20,000 days for unrestrained free-living normal-weight individuals aged 2.6 months to 96 years (n = 1252). Regarding physiological values based on DLW measurements, opposite tendencies have been observed between two sets of estimates using time-activity patterns both biased by conservative input data assumptions during sleep and light activities: most estimates based on the time-activity-ventilation approach are overestimated, whereas most of those using metabolic equivalent approach are underestimated. Erroneous food intakes have clearly lead to underestimated rates when used in daily food-energy intake (EFD) and Parameter A approaches. With the latter approach, overestimated basal metabolic rates (BMRs) used in EFD/BMR ratios contribute to the underestimation of inhalation values. Few mean daily inhalation rates and Monte Carlo simulation percentiles based on traditional approaches ( 57 out of 253) are close to physiological values within a gap of +/- 5% or less. Aggregate errors in all estimates ( in m(3)/day and m(3)/kg-day) vary from - 52 to + 126%. The most accurate daily inhalation rates are those based on DLW measurements with an error of about +/- 5%, as calculated in previous studies for free-living males and females aged 1 month to 96 years and pregnant and lactating adolescents and women aged 11 to 55 years during real-life situations in their normal surroundings.

AB During the estrous cycle and beginning in estrus, the mammary gland undergoes pregnancy-like development that depends on transcriptional regulation by the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR) and Pax-2 as well as the action of the growth factors Wnt-4 and RANKL. In this report, we first describe the decay and delayed expression of ER alpha, PR, and Pax-2 proteins as well as depression of Wnt-4 and RANKL mRNA coincident with the strong estrogen surge in proestrus. In time-course studies using ovariectomized mice, a single estrogen injection replicated these delays and caused an 18 h delay in Wnt-4 expression. Molecular time-delay systems are at the core of cellular cycles, most notably the circadian clock, and depend on proteasome degradation of transcriptional regulators that exhibit dedicated timing functions. The cytoplasmic dynamics of these regulators govern delay duration through negative transcription/translation feedback loops. A proteasome inhibitor, PS-341, blocked estrogen-stimulated ER alpha, PR, and Pax-2 decay and proteasome chymotryptic activity, assayed using a fluorogenic substrate, was elevated in proestrus correlating with the depletion of the transcription factors. The 18-h delay in Wnt-4 induction corresponded to the turnover time of Pax-2 protein in the cytoplasm and was eliminated in Pax-2 knockout mammary tissue, demonstrating that Pax-2 has a unique timing function. The patterns of estrogen-triggered ER alpha, PR, and Pax-2 turnover were consistent with a negative transcriptional feedback. Retarding the expression of ER alpha, PR, and Pax-2 may optimize preparations for pregnancy by coordinating expression of critical receptors and transcription factors with rising estrogen and progesterone levels in estrus. The estrogen surge in proestrus has no defined mammotropic function. This study provides the first evidence that it is a synchronizing signal triggering proteasome-dependent turnover of mammary gland ER alpha, PR, and Pax-2. We hypothesize that the delays reflect a previously unrecognized timing system, which is present in all ovarian target tissues.

AB Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been recognized in the Western world as a public health burden, but there has been no community-based study performed to assess the prevalence of the condition in India. The study was performed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of OSA in a semi-urban Indian population.
   Design: A two-stage, cross-sectional, community-based prevalence study.
   Setting: A semi-urban community in Delhi.
   Duration: Two years (2003 to 2005).
   Patients and participants: All citizens residing in the community who were 30 to 60 years of age. Exclusion criteria included those patients with recent myocardial infarction, upper airway surgery, class III/IV congestive heart failure, pregnancy, hypothyroidism on treatment, acromegaly, chronic renal failure, systemic steroid treatment, and hormone replacement therapy.
   Intervention: An OSA assessment was performed in 2,400 subjects who were screened in stage I of the study by means of a sleep questionnaire. Subjects were then divided into habitual and nonhabitual snorers. Eighty-three randomly selected habitual snorers and 80 nonhabitual snorers were invited to participate in stage 2 of the study, which consisted of in-hospital polysomnography studies.
   Observations and results: A total of 2,150 subjects returned questionnaires (response rate, 90%). Of 550 habitual snorers and 1,596 nonhabitual snorers, 77 habitual snorers and 73 nonhabitual snorers underwent polysomnography. A total of 36 habitual snorers (46.75%) and 2 nonhabitual snorers (2.73%) were found to have OSA, giving prevalence rates of 13.74% and 3.57%, respectively, for OSA and OSA syndrome (OSAS) on extrapolation. Multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, age, obesity (defined by a high body mass index), and waist/hip ratio as significant risk factors for OSAS.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the risk factors and prevalence for OSA in India are similar to those in the West, which is contrary to the findings of some previous reports, which had a strong inclusion bias.

AB The primary goal of this study was to examine sleep problems in a sample of cocaine-exposed 7-month-old infants and to determine if maternal psychopathology mediated any existing association between substance exposure and sleep behaviors. We also examined the differences in sleep behaviors of cocaine-exposed infants in parental custody and cocaine-exposed infants in nonparental custody. Participants were 65 cocaine-exposed and 53 nonexposed infants and their primary caregivers who were recruited at delivery and assessed at 7 months of infant age. As expected, women who used cocaine during pregnancy had more psychiatric symptoms than nonusers. Prenatal exposure to heavier amounts of cocaine was significantly related to more severe sleep difficulties, and maternal anxiety mediated this association. Approximately 28% of cocaine mothers lost custody of their infants by 7 months of age. Nonmaternal caregivers had significantly fewer symptoms of psychopathology than the cocaine-using women who retained custody of their children. Infants who were in nonparental care at 7 months of age also had less severe sleep problems than did infants who remained in parental care.

AB Aim: This study assessed levels of maternal knowledge of sudden infant death syndrome prevention strategies in a socio-economically disadvantaged, culturally diverse population.
   Methods: Pregnant women (n = 233) were asked to name three things they could do to reduce the risk of cot death. Answers were marked in accordance with the US National Institute of Child Health and Development guide-lines.
   Results: Of women 51.5% could correctly name two or more strategies that could reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. There was significant difference by the woman's country of birth: 68.2% of Australian-born women were able to correctly identify two or more strategies, compared with only 37.3% of those born overseas (P < 0.001). Most of the small number of Indigenous women included in the study were able to correctly identify two or more strategies. Year of arrival in Australia, number of previous children, age and level of education were not significantly related to women's knowledge.
   Conclusion: Knowledge of sudden infant death syndrome prevention strategies was poorer in overseas-born women. Practitioners working with disadvantaged, overseas-born women should give consideration to women's knowledge of sudden infant death syndrome prevention if current low rates of sudden infant death syndrome deaths are to be maintained.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine patient treatment preferences and satisfaction with an office-based procedure for early pregnancy failure and to compare resource use and cost between office and operating room management of early pregnancy failure.
   METHODS: This study was a prospective observational study of 165 women presenting for surgical management of early pregnancy failure. Participants completed a pre-operative questionnaire addressing treatment preferences and expectations and a postoperative questionnaire measuring level of pain experienced and satisfaction with care. Resource use was determined by measuring the time patients spent at the health care facility and the actual procedure time. Cost was estimated using an institutional database.
   RESULTS: One hundred fifteen women from the office and 50 from the operating room were enrolled. Patients selecting outpatient management scored "privacy," "avoiding going to sleep," and "previous experience" higher than the operating room group (P <.05). Patients who perceived that their physicians preferred one procedure over the other were more likely to select that procedure (P <.001). Satisfaction was high in both groups, and underestimating the procedure's discomfort was negatively associated with satisfaction (P <.002). Costs were greater than two-fold higher in the operating room group compared with the office group (P <.01). Complications were uncommon, but hemorrhage-related complications were four times more common in the operating room group than in the office group (P <.01).
   CONCLUSION: Office-based surgical management of early pregnancy failure is an acceptable option for many women and offers substantial resource and cost savings.

AB Sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS) continues to be the most common cause of postneonatal infant death. SIDS is a complex, multifactorial disorder, the cause of which is still not fully understood. However, much is known now about environmental risk factors, some of which are modifiable. These include maternal and antenatal risk factors such as smoking during pregnancy, as well as infant-related risk factors such as non-supine sleeping position and soft bedding. Emerging evidence also substantiates an expanding number of genetic risk factors. Interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors may be of critical importance in determining an infant's actual risk of SIDS. Although no practical way exists to identify which infants will die of SIDS, nor is there a safe and proven prevention strategy even if identification were feasible, reducing exposure to modifiable risk factors has helped to lower the incidence of SIDS. Current challenges include wider dissemination of guidelines to all people who care for infants, dissemination of guidelines in culturally appropriate ways, and surveillance of SIDS trends and other outcomes associated with implementation of these guidelines.

AB Circadian (and daily) rhythms are physiological events that oscillate with a 24-hour period. Circadian disruptions may hamper the immune response against infection and cancer. Several immune mechanisms, such as natural killer (NK) cell function, follow a daily rhythm. Although ethanol is known to be a potent toxin for many systems in the developing fetus, including the immune system, the long-term effects of fetal ethanol exposure on circadian immune function have not been explored.
   Daily rhythms of cytotoxic factors (granzyme B and perforin), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and NK cell cytotoxic activity were determined in the spleens of adult male rats obtained from mothers who were fed during pregnancy with chow food or an ethanol-containing liquid diet or pair-fed an isocaloric liquid diet.
   We found that adult rats exposed to ethanol during their fetal life showed a significant alteration in the physiological rhythms of granzyme B and IFN-gamma that was associated with decreased NK cell cytotoxic activity.
   These data suggest that fetal ethanol exposure causes a permanent alteration of specific immune rhythms that may in part underlie the immune impairment observed in children prenatally exposed to alcohol.

AB Objective: To assess whether parental psychological and physical factors and child factors measured in the first year of life were associated with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children at age 6(3)/(4) years. Method: A longitudinal cohort study (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), followed 8,272 children from pregnancy to age 6(3)/(4) years. Parental reports of child and parent functioning were gathered. Associations between parental and child functioning assessed at 6 to 8 months postpartum, and RAP measured at age 6(3)/(4) years were investigated. Results: The prevalence of RAP in this sample was 11.8%. Both maternal anxiety (adjusted odds ratio = 1.53; 95% confidence interval 1.24-1.89) and paternal anxiety (adjusted odds ratio = 1.38; 95% confidence interval 1.12-1.71) in the first year of a child's life were associated with later childhood RAP. Parent reports of child temperament features such as irregular feeding and sleeping were also associated with later RAP. Conclusions: This is the first evidence from a prospective study that anxiety in both mothers and fathers and child temperament features predate the occurrence of RAP in children. These findings highlight the potential importance of addressing parental anxiety in families in which children present with RAP, although some caution should be exercised in their interpretation because of possible reporting bias.

AB Experimental environmental enrichment (EE) is usually applied in adulthood or immediately after weaning, with robust effects on physiology and behaviour. To investigate the effects of EE earlier in life, female rats were maintained under moderate enrichment during pregnancy and, together with their pups, during lactation until weaning. A separate group of dams housed under standard conditions during pregnancy and lactation served as controls. Dams housed under EE exhibited fewer nursing episodes and were off the nest more often, but the frequency of pup ticking was not affected on postnatal days 3-5. EE effects on hypothatamus-pituitary-adrenat (HPA) axis responses to an acute stressor were determined in adult mate and female offspring with and without previous exposure to the chronic stressor of constant tight. In female offspring, chronic stress significantly increased basal corticosterone (CORT) levels, but not if rats had been exposed to early EE. Furthermore, white control females exposed to chronic stress showed a greatly reduced adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) response to an acute stressor, EE females did not display this desensitization. There was no significant effect of EE on basal ACTH and CORT levels in adult mate offspring, nor did it alter their response to acute stress. Maternal ticking frequency was moderately but significantly correlated with net corticosterone increases in response to acute stress, the direction of the correlation crucially depending on the offspring's sex and stress conditions. This study shows that EE during pregnancy and lactation has long-tasting effects on reactivity to acute and chronic stress in offspring and that these effects are dependent on the offspring's sex but not greatly on early postpartum maternal behaviour.

This is a major issue of contention in healthcare ethics. Proponents of this new technology argue that this enables women to pursue educational and career goals in their youth, so that they have greater financial security for children in later life. Nevertheless, this argument may be flawed by the reality that even if the cryopreservation of oocytes and ovarian tissue were optimized in the future, this would in no way be a guaranteed route for women to have biological children later in life. Moreover, because only a limited amount of autologous reproductive material can be cryopreserved and stored for a single healthy woman, there is a risk of material depletion before reproductive success is attained. Another prime consideration is the increased morbidity and mortality associated with clinical assisted reproduction in older women. Hence, it is imperative that delayed motherhood through the cryopreservation of oocytes and ovarian tissues be viewed with extreme caution, and mandatory counselling should be given to all patients if such a medical procedure ultimately finds approval for widespread application.

AB Epidemiological studies in restless legs syndrome (RLS) have often been limited by misdiagnosis and by the fact that affected individuals, even when their symptoms are severe, might not seek medical care. Some of these Limitations have been overcome in the last years as population studies based on face to face interviews have been carried out with new standardized diagnostic criteria. According to these studies, and in contrast to earlier views, RLS has been shown to be a common disorder with prevalences ranging between 2.5 and 10% of the population. Although few studies performed outside Europe/North America have shown a low prevalence, a number of methodological issues have been raised that might question these results.
   Furthermore, once established, RLS usually follows a chronic course, and preliminary evidence shows that it might worsen over time in some patients. Endstage renal disease, increasing age, female gender, pregnancy, frequent blood donations, iron deficiency and neuropathy are considered to be risk factors for this disorder. The association to RLS is less definitely established for other conditions, such as PD or diabetes.
   In summary, epidemiological evidence suggests that RLS is a common neurological disorder-with high impact on many aspects of the life of those affected. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   CHILDREN; NETS; MORBIDITY; PROGRAM; IMPACT
AB Background: As efforts are currently underway to roll-out insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to populations within malarious areas in Africa, there is an unprecedented need for data to measure the effectiveness of such programmes in terms of population coverage. This paper examines methodological issues to using household surveys to measure core Roll Back Malaria coverage indicators of ITN possession and use.
   Methods: ITN coverage estimates within Anseba and Gash Barka Provinces from the 2002 Eritrean Demographic and Health Survey, implemented just prior to a large-scale ITN distribution programme, are compared to estimates from the same area from a sub-national Bednet Survey implemented 18 months later in 2003 after the roll-out of the ITN programme.
   Results: Measures of bednet possession were dramatically higher in 2003 compared to 2002. In 2003, 82.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77.4 - 87.0) of households in Anseba and Gash Barka possessed at least one ITN. RBM coverage indicators for ITN use were also dramatically higher in 2003 as compared to 2002, with 76.1% ( 95% CI 69.9 - 82.2) of children under five years old and 52.4% ( 95% CI 38.2 - 66.6) of pregnant women sleeping under ITNs. The ITN distribution programme resulted in a gross increase in ITN use among children and pregnant women of 68.3% and 48% respectively.
   Conclusion: Eritrea has exceeded the Abuja targets of 60% coverage for ITN household possession and use among children under five years old within two malarious provinces. Results point to several important potential sources of bias that must be considered when interpreting data for ITN coverage over time, including: disparate survey universes and target populations that may include non-malarious areas; poor date recall of bednet procurement and treatment; and differences in timing of surveys with respect to malaria season.

AB Glucocorticoids are essential for normal hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis activity; however, recent studies warn that exposure to excess endogenous or synthetic glucocorticoid during a specific period of prenatal development adversely affects HPA axis stability. We administered dexamethasone (DEX) to pregnant rats during the last week of gestation and investigated subsequent HPA axis regulation in adult male offspring in unrestrained and restraint-stressed conditions. With the use of real-time PCR and RIA, we examined the expression of regulatory genes in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and pituitary, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), arginine vasopressin (AVP), glucocorticoid receptors (GR), mineralcorticoid receptors (MR), and 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (11 beta-HSD-1), as well as the main HPA axis hormones, adrenal corticotropic hormone ( ACTH) and corticosterone ( CORT). Our results demonstrate that the DEX- exposed group exhibited an overall change in the pattern of gene expression and hormone levels in the unrestrained animals. These changes included an upregulation of CRH in the hypothalamus, a downregulation of MR with a concomitant upregulation of 11 beta-HSD-1 in the hippocampus, and an increase in circulating levels of both ACTH and CORT relative to unrestrained control animals. Interestingly, both DEX- exposed and control rats exhibited an increase in pituitary GR mRNA levels following a 1-h recovery from restraint stress; however, the increased expression in DEX- exposed rats was significantly less and was associated with a slower return to baseline CORT compared with controls. In addition, circulating levels of ACTH and CORT as well as hypothalamic CRH and hippocampal 11 beta-HSD-1 expression levels were significantly higher in the DEX- exposed group compared with controls following restraint stress. Taken together, these data demonstrate that late-gestation DEX exposure in rats is associated with persistent changes in both the modulation of HPA axis activity and the HPA axis-mediated response to stress.

AB Objective. - Estimate the relevance of the Tuffier line, which connects both iliac crests, in analyzing the location of the puncture point for spinal anaesthesia for pregnant women.
   Study design. - Prospective.
   Patients and methods. - The age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and uterine height, (HU) of 121 patients admitted in the delivery room in July 2005, were recorded. The intersection point of the Tuffier line with the rachis was recorded in seating and sleeping positions. The corresponding vertebral level was verified by counting thorny apophyses from C7.
   Results. - The Tuffier line crossed the rachis at the expected level for 29.7% of the patients. The intersection point was below the expected in 6.6% of the cases and above in 63.7% of the cases. Only the weight and the BMI were significantly connected with stronger probability of error (P = 0.001).
   Conclusion. - The error level with this method is important and comparable to error level in the series published in patients who are not pregnant woman. The main risk is the spinal injury, since the level of ending of the spinal cord is variable. It seems safe to use another method of location, especially with patients experiencing excessive weight.

ID MERCURY; BLOOD; POPULATION; HAIR; RISK
AB Many popular varieties of commercially sold fish, including tilefish, seabass, shark, and swordfish, contain enough mercury so that eating them once or twice a month can lead to high mercury body burdens. Wisconsin has issued mercury-based sport-fish consumption advice to people of all ages since 1985. Wisconsin's advisory was revised in 2000 to address all inland waters and again in 2004 to integrate information about sport-caught fish with advice for commercially sold fish. Because of the increased popularity of fish as a source of dietary protein, a significant percentage of the US population may be at risk of methylmercury-induced health problems. Although several studies have assessed mercury exposure among children and women of child-bearing age, very little is known about mercury body burdens among men or postmenopausal women. This article describes fish consumption and mercury exposure among 14 people who consumed fish twice a week or more and 1 person who ate no fish. Steady-state blood mercury levels available for 10 adults and 1 child ranged from < 5 to 58 mu g/L and correlated well with dietary mercury intake estimates. Three of these individuals reported vague, subclinical symptoms such as mental confusion, sleep difficulty, balance problems, or visual disturbances, which improved after their mercury levels returned to normal.

AB A model of the development of L/M cone ratios in the Old World primate retina is presented. It is supposed that during gestation, the cone cycles randomly between states in which it transcribes either L or M opsin. The current state determines and increases the probability that it will transcribe the same opsin in future cycles. These assumptions are sufficient to formalize the process as a Markov chain that can be modeled as an urn containing two types of balls, L and M. Drawing one ball results in the increase of its species and the decrease of the other. Over the long run, the urn will become populated with a single type of ball. This state corresponds to the photoreceptor adopting a fixed identity for its lifetime. We investigate the effect of the number of states and the rule that regulates the advantage of transition toward one cone type or another on the relation between fetal and adult L/M cone ratios. In the range of 100 to 1000 states, small variations of the initial L/M ratio or the transition advantage can each generate large changes in the final L/M ratio, in qualitative accord with the variation seen in human adult retinas. The time course to attain stable L/M ratios also varies with these parameters. If it is believed that the cycling follows a circadian rhythm, then final L/M cone ratios would be expected to stabilize shortly after birth in the human being and the macaque.

AB The effects of sleep deprivation in pregnancy on the development of hippocampal function of the offspring have been investigated. For this purpose we compared electrophysiological characteristics in the hippocampal slices of 15-20-old-day rats of the control and two experimental groups. In the first experimental group the pups were taken from mother for weighting three times during the first postnatal week and then weekly. Another experimental group was brought up without handling. We found that CA1 population spikes developed to significantly less amplitude in experimental groups of rat pups. This phenomenon was observed at higher intensity of monosynaptic activation, although near-threshold stimuli didn't reveal any differences among groups. However, under paired-pulse stimulation (70 ms inter-pulse interval) small amplitudes in the hippocampal slices of experimental animals could facilitate up to control value, and second in pair responses didn't differ from corresponding control. Our data doesn't confirm the hypothesis about decreased connectivity in the hippocampus of experimental rats, but the efficacy of CA3-CA1 inputs seems to be lower. Besides excitatory transmission. the effectiveness of inhibition of paired-pulse facilitation at 15 ms inter-pulse interval was also significantly decreased. The observed effects of prenatal influences seem to develop under postnatal experience. We observed significant trend to more pronounced modifications upon age especially in the case of early handling and testing.

AB Objective: Previous work has demonstrated that two synthetic peptides can prevent prenatal alcohol-induced damage as assessed by prevention of learning abnormalities in adult offspring as well as improve outcome from traumatic brain damage. The Current studies were undertaken to evaluate whether these peptides Could enhance performance in a learning and memory paradigm when administered either prenatally or to aged mice.
   Study design: For prenatal treatment, C57Bl6/J mice were treated on gestational day 8 with 1 oral administration of D-NAP or D-SAL alone or D-NAP+D-SAL ora double dose of D-SAL. Control groups were same-regimen treated with vehicle alone. Learning was assessed in adult male offspring (35-50 days) by using the Morris water maze. To evaluate aged animals, 12-month-old mice were treated with D-NAP and D-SAL or vehicle alone daily and tested on the Morris water maze.
   Results: Offspring exposed prenatally to D-NAP+D-SAL learned significantly faster than controls, with an earlier onset of learning and an overall decreased latency to find the hidden platform (P <.05). Animals exposed prenatally to either D-NAP or D-SAL alone learned similar to control, with a trend toward faster latencies. Aged animals who received D-NAP+D-SAL learned significantly faster than age-matched controls, with an earlier onset of learning (P <.05).
   Conclusion: Combined D-NAP+D-SAL enhanced learning in healthy young mice and aged mice. These findings suggest potential therapeutic interventions not only during a critical developmental period, but also in aged animals. (C) 2006 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: It is unclear if it is safe for babies to bed share with adults. In Ireland 49% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases occur when the infant is bed-sharing with an adult.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of bed-sharing during the last sleep period on risk factors for SIDS in Irish infants. Design: An 8 year (1994-2001) population based case control study of 287 SIDS cases and 831 controls matched for date, place of birth, and sleep period. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by conditional logistic regression.
   Results: The risk associated with bed-sharing was three times greater for infants with low birth weight for gestation (UOR 16.28 v 4.90) and increased fourfold if the combined tog value of clothing and bedding was >= 10 (UOR 9.68 v 2.34). The unadjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 13.87 (95% CI 9.58 to 20.09) for infants whose mothers smoked and 2.09 (95% CI 0.98 to 4.39) for non-smokers. Age of death for bed-sharing and sofa-sharing infants (12.8 and 8.3 weeks, respectively) was less than for infants not sharing a sleep surface (21.0 weeks, p < 0.001) and fewer bed-sharing cases were found prone (5% v 32%; p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Risk factors for SIDS vary according to the infant's sleeping environment. The increased risk associated with maternal smoking, high tog value of clothing and bedding, and low z scores of weight for gestation at birth is augmented further by bed- sharing. These factors should be taken into account when considering sleeping arrangements for young infants.

ID FETUS
AB Four hundred and thirty pregnant women were recruited during their second trimester of pregnancy (M = 20 weeks). They were designated depressed (N = 172) or nondepressed (N = 258) on the Stuctured Clinical Interview of Depression (SCID) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). They were given a second assessment when they were approximately 32 weeks gestational age. At both assessments they were given self-report measures (CES-D, the State Anxiety Inventory, and the State Anger Inventory) and provided urine samples for assays of cortisol, catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine) and serotonin. They were also given the VITAS scale for lower back pain and leg pain and a sleep disturbance scale. The stability of mood states and biochemistry across pregnancy (20 and 32 weeks) were assessed inasmuch as mood states, and biochemistry have been noted to predict prematurity and low birthweight. Significant correlations were noted for all variables except serotonin. Relationships between mood states and biochemistry were also noted but only between cortisol and depression, cortisol and anxiety, and epinephrine and anxiety. Significant stability was noted between the 20-week measures and the 32-week measures including depression, anxiety, anger, and cortisol. These were, in turn, correlated with each other and with, low back pain, leg pain, and sleep disturbance. These data suggest the stability of mood states and cortisol across pregnancy.

AB Objective. - To investigate the frequency of main symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrom (OSAS) and their relationship with Pregnancy Induced-Hypertension (PIH) as well as Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IGR) as suggested by recent studies.
   Methodology. - Four hundred (and) thirty-eight enquiry forms completed during post-partum period were analysed, after exclusion of multiple pregnancies. Collected data were demographic characteristics, obstetrical events, sleep disorders during last trimester, screening of snoring and vigilance troubles with an Epworth score.
   Results. - Forty-five percentages of the patients reported to have habitual snoring during pregnancy. Among these, 85% were non-snorers before pregnancy. Daytime somnolence concerned 84,5% of the population with an Epworth score significatively increased (P < 0,000 1). The prevalence of PIH was found to be 4,5%, with two apparently independent risk factors: the body mass index (OR = 1, 1) and an association between snoring and increased vigilance trouble (OR = 2,6). No statistical difference was found concerning IGR.
   Conclusions. - SAS symptoms are frequent during pregnancy and snoring appears to be linked with PIH. However, polysomnographic data are not yet sufficient to explain pathophysiological mechanisms and find relevant diagnostic markers during pregnancy. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS.

AB A novel bioanalysis system based on immunochromatography was developed in connection with a nitrocellulose resin-modified micropipette tip, namely as ZipTip (R). The sandwich-type immunoassay was applied to our bioananalysis system. The first antibodies that were aspirated by the micropipette were immobilized on the immunochromatographic resin at the edge of micropipette tip. The blocking solution was also aspirated in the same fashion. The measurement operation was performed by aspirating the sample solution, and then the gold colloidal nanoparticles (Au naps) conjugated secondary antibody solution. Since this bioanalysis system utilizes a micropipette, it is possible to increase the sample volume, which would enable the detection of antigen at low concentrations. In addition, the washing procedure can also be performed easily to reduce the background level. After the antigen-antibody reaction, the color intensity of Au naps could be observed by the naked eye. For analytical evaluation, the color intensity was captured by a scanner, and processed by analysis software. We have achieved the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) and total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA), which are well-known as fundamental indicators of pregnancy and cancer. The limit of detection (LOD) for hCG was 8 ng/ml (0.8 ng/tip), which is comparable to that of other conventional systems based on immunochromatography. Moreover, the LOD for TPSA was improved over the existing systems with the application of different sample volumes, such as 5 ng/ml (1 ng/tip) in 200 mu l sample volume, and 2 ng/ml (0.6 ng/tip) in 300 mu l sample volume. Since our bioanalysis system requires a small amount of immobilized antigen, it would be greatly useful in basic research for screening the antigen-antibody reactions. Besides, our bioanalysis system can be applied to on-field screening, since its operation is simple, and the visual results can be obtained rapidly. (c) 2006 NIMS and Elsevier Ltd.

AB This review summarizes studies of steep and other biological rhythms during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and the postpartum period, focusing, where feasible, on studies in women who met DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 4th edition) criteria for a depressive disorder compared with healthy controls. The aim was to review supporting evidence for the hypothesis that disruption of the normal temporal relationship between steep and other biological rhythms such as melatonin, core body temperature, cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or prolactin occurring during times of reproductive hormonal change precipitates depressive disorders in predisposed women. Treatment strategies, designed to correct these altered phase (timing) or amplitude abnormalities, thereby improve mood. Although there may be some common features to premenstrual, pregnancy and postpartum depressive disorders (e.g. elevated protactin levels), a specific profile of steep and biological rhythms distinguishes healthy from depressed women during each reproductive epoch. Further work is needed to characterize more fully the particular abnormalities associated with each reproductive state to identify common versus distinctive features for each diagnostic group. This information could serve as the basis for developing more targeted treatment strategies. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INFANT-DEATH-SYNDROME; RISK-FACTORS; NICOTINE; PACIFIER
AB The recognition of prone sleeping and maternal smoking as modifiable risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), has drastically decreased SIDS incidence. However, during the last years other factors have become necessary to consider to further reduce the risk of SIDS. Side sleeping implies a greater risk than supine sleeping but is still common. Bed sharing may increase the risk of SIDS, while use of a pacifier seems to be protective. Replacement of maternal smoking with nicotine substitutes is not harmless.
   Conclusion: To further reduce the risk of SIDS, exclusive supine sleeping should be encouraged and side sleeping discouraged. When the breast-feeding is established, a pacifier can very well be used at bedtime. Bed sharing can increase the risk of SIDS if the infant is below 2-3 months of age, especially if the mother is a smoker. Any nicotine use should be avoided during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

AB For the first 10 days of pregnancy and the first 12 days of pseudopregnancy, the secretion of prolactin (PRL) from pituitary lactotrophs is rhythmic, with two surges/day. This rhythm can also be triggered by bolus injection of oxytocin (OT). We describe a mathematical model for the initiation, maintenance, and termination of the OT-induced PRL rhythm. In our model, the mechanism for this circadian rhythm is mutual interaction between lactotrophs and neuroendocrine dopamine (DA) neurons. This rhythm is, under normal lighting conditions, entrained by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) but persists in the absence of input from the SCN. We postulate that OT injection triggers the rhythm by activating a population of bistable hypothalamic neurons that innervate and inhibit DA neurons. The bistable nature of these neurons allows them to act as a memory device, maintaining the rhythm long after OT has been cleared from the blood. The mechanism for this memory device and the arguments supporting it are detailed with computer simulations. Finally, we consider potential targets for a rhythm- terminating factor and make predictions that may be used to determine which mechanism is operational in terminating the OT- or mating- induced PRL rhythm.

AB Mating or vaginocervical stimulation [copulatory stimulus (CS)] induces two daily surges of the hormone prolactin (PRL) in rats. This unique secretory pattern of PRL surges is characteristic for the first half of pregnancy and is also present in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Studies have shown that CS additionally provokes an acute release of the hormone oxytocin (OT). In this study, we tested whether a single injection of OT (iv) is sufficient to initiate the PRL secretion pattern of OVX/CS rats. Furthermore, we measured the 24- h profile of dopamine (DA) content in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, because DA is the major inhibitory factor of PRL secretion. The results indicated that a single injection of OT induces a PRL secretory rhythm and a DA release pattern similar to that initiated by CS. Immunocytochemical investigation showed that particular OTergic neurons in the hypothalamus express receptors for PRL, as well as for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, which indicates an involvement in generating the PRL rhythm and entraining it to the ambient photoperiod. On the basis of this study, we suggest that the PRL- DA inhibitory feedback loop between lactotrophs and DAergic neurons plays a crucial role in generating the oscillatory PRL secretion pattern in CS rats. A timing signal, likely provided by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, entrains the autonomous PRL oscillation to a particular time of day. Mathematical modeling was used to illustrate the proposed network function. The experimental results further suggest an additional feedback mechanism in which certain hypothalamic OTergic neurons are influenced by PRL.

AB The objectives of this study were a) to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among women with postpartum depression, b) examine the association between severity of depressive symptoms and level of impairment in physical and mental HRQoL and c) to identify contributors to physical and mental HRQoL. Seventy-eight women scoring >= 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale completed the questionnaires measuring: HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form SF-36). sleep quality. life stress. and social support. All women underwent a cardiovascular stress test to determine aerobic capacity. Compared to Canadian normative data, women experiencing postpartum depressed mood scored significantly lower on all SF-36 domains. as well as on the SF-36 physical and mental component summary score. Severity of depressed mood was not associated to worse physical health status, while poorer aerobic capacity emerged as a significant independent contributor of physical health status. Severity of depressed mood contributed to worse mental health status. After controlling for severity of depressed mood, the occurrence of pregnancy complications, cesarean delivery, poorer sleep quality life stress, and less social support predicted poorer mental health status.

AB Objective: To assess the prevalence of and risk factors for postnatal depressive symptoms in a cohort of mothers of Pacific Island infants in Auckland, New Zealand.
   Method: The data were gathered as part of the Pacific Island Families Study, in which 1376 mothers were interviewed when their babies were 6 weeks old. The interview included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
   Results: 16.4% of mothers were assessed as probably experiencing depression. Prevalence rates varied from 7.6% for Samoans to 30.9% for Tongans. In addition to ethnicity, risk factors identified by stepwise multiple logistic regression included low Pacific Island acculturation, first birth, stress due to insufficient food, household income less than $40 000, difficulty with transport, dissatisfaction with pregnancy, birth experience, baby's sleep patterns, partner relationship and home. A large prevalence difference between Tongans and other groups remained when the effects of other risk factors were controlled statistically.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Pacific mothers is at the upper end of the range typically reported. Focus on the overall rate, however, obscures substantial variation between groups. Risk factors are generally similar to those identified in previous research.
   Implications: The findings have implications for prevention and treatment and caution against assuming homogeneity within ethnic categories. Further research is required to explain differences in prevalence between Tongan and other Pacific Island groups.

AB Objective: To follow the development of MEG sleep patterns and auditory evoked responses (AERs) during the first six months of life.
   Methods: The subjects were 18 neonates, born at conceptional age (CA) 36-42 weeks, following uncomplicated pregnancies. During each session, several 10-min MEG recordings were acquired in the presence of auditory stimulation. The recordings were classified into three distinct MEG patterns-low amplitude irregular; high-amplitude slow; and mixed-based largely on MEG amplitude and frequency. Averaged AERs were computed for the entire recording and for each MEG pattern within the recording. The results were based on analysis of 61 recording sessions of the 10 subjects who yielded three or more sessions of usable data.
   Results: Developmental changes in the MEG sleep patterns were most pronounced at the earliest ages. By CA 48 weeks the patterns had progressed to a more mature form, characterized by the prevalence of delta wave sleep, absence of discontinuity, and development of spindling and higher amplitude delta rhythms. In contrast to the MEG patterns, the AERs did not change markedly during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) and showed a simple morphology, consisting of a prominent deflection at 250 ms (P250m) and a more diffuse one at around 750 ms (N750m). During the period CA 48-54 weeks, however, a relatively abrupt transition occurred to a more complex morphology, characterized by it double peak with peak latencies 150 ms (P150m) and 350 ms (P350m). Beyond this period the AERs continued to evolve, showing biphasic complexes and the emergence of late components arising from outside the auditory cortex.
   Conclusions: Over the age range of this study the MEG sleep patterns and AER developed in succession, rather than concurrently; i.e. development of the sleep patterns was most rapid during the first 8 weeks (CA 40-48 weeks) while major development of the AERs commenced after this time.
   Significance: This finding suggests that the brain must achieve a certain level of overall maturity, reflected in the character of the MEG sleep patterns at CA 48 weeks, before the cortex enters a phase of significant functional development, reflected in the more rapid evolution of the AER after CA 48 weeks. The results of this study affirm the efficacy of MEG for spatiotemporal characterization of neonatal brain activity. C 2005 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

AB Background: Emerging evidence on faster growth in preterm infants with higher heart rate as opposed to the classical approach calls for further research. Aims: to test whether (1) high or low heart rate and (2) heart rate during the first days of life predict greater weight gain in preterm infants.
   Methods: A retrospective study analyzing two daily measures of heart rate obtained during restful steep, total daily calorie intake and daily weight gain measured always in the morning before meat were collected from the medical files.
   Results: Analysis of 90 healthy preterm infants born at 32-36 weeks of gestation revealed that increased mean heart rate during hospitalization predicted greater weight gain even when controlling for calorie intake, birth weight, gestational age, appropriateness of birth weight for gestational age, and length of hospitalization. Mean heart rate during the first three days of life yielded the same pattern of results. Post-hoc analysis of variance between infants with mean daily heart rate <= 139 bpm vs. <= 140 bpm showed that infants with higher heart rate achieved a significantly higher weight gain.
   Conclusions: It is suggested that, contrary to adults, in neonates an anabolic activity is represented by increased sympathetic functioning within the normal range. The implications of a slower growth rate for additional developmental care and individual considerations of appropriate stimulation in preterm infants are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective.-To evaluate the frequency of menorrhagia and endometriosis in female migraineurs compared to age-matched women without headache.
   Background.-Migraine predominantly affects women of childbearing age and is often associated with the menstrual period, yet there is a paucity of data regarding the relationship of migraine and menstrual disorders.
   Methods.-Women diagnosed with migraine, using International Headache Society criteria and an age- and sex-matched control group, were administered a semistructured questionnaire regarding migraine and migraine-related disability, menstrual history, other bleeding history, vascular event history, and vascular risk factors.
   Results.-Fifty female migraineurs between the ages of 22 and 50 years and 52 age-matched women (mean age 37 years) were enrolled in the study. Similar proportions of women in each group reported using hormone contraceptives (30% vs. 33%, P= .77) and hormone replacement therapy (12% vs. 8%, P= .69). The proportions presently menstruating (64 % vs. 80%, P= .20) and status after hysterectomy were similar (24% vs. 14%, P= .84). Menorrhagia (defined as at least three consecutive heavy periods), both current and prior, was more commonly reported in migraineurs (63% vs. 37%, P= .009), with higher likelihood of staining clothes by menses (35% vs. 8%, P= .003), and significant impact of menses on activities of daily living (on a 10-point Likert scale) with work/school participation (P= .02), family activities (P < .0001), sleep (P= .003), life enjoyment (P= .001), mood (P= .02), and overall quality of life (P= .003). Endometriosis, which may be associated with menorrhagia, was also more commonly diagnosed in the migraineurs (30% vs. 4%, P= .001). The migraineurs more frequently described bruising (40% vs. 10%, P < .001) and rectal bleeding (18% vs. 2%, P= .017) but not more serious bleeding problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in the migraine group (28% vs. 12%, P= .036), and significance for increased menorrhagia, endometriosis, menstrual interference, and bruising was maintained, even when controlling for the use of NSAIDs. With logistic regression, menorrhagia was significantly associated with migraine, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.5), and with endometriosis, adjusted OR = 10.5 (95% CI 2.2 to 51.4). There were no differences in vascular events and risk factors, except for trends of increased hypertension (25% vs. 10%, P= .05), transient ischemic attack/stroke (10% vs. 2%, P= .08), and Raynaud's disease (10% vs. 2%, P= .08) in the migraineurs.
   Conclusion.-Women with migraine have a higher frequency of menorrhagia, endometriosis, and associated psychosocial consequences. These findings suggest that there should be further study of factors influencing endometriosis and menstrual blood flow, such as eicosanoids and platelet function, in migraineurs.

AB This longitudinal, year-long study compared sleep-wake state organization in two groups of infants-infants whose mothers abused substances during their pregnancies and nonexposed, typically developing, age-matched comparison infants-to determine whether differences in sleep-wake state organization existed between the two groups. Seventeen infants of mothers who were participating in a parent-infant residential treatment program for substance abuse were enrolled. Their sleep-wake state organization over the first year of life was compared to that of 17 age-matched comparison infants. The intent was to follow each infant on five occasions over the first year of life using established methods of time-lapse videosomnography to record sleep-wake state organization: however, attrition in the substance-abusing group was problematic. Some sleep-wake variables (i.e., Active Sleep%, Quiet Sleep%, Awake%, number of nighttime awakenings) were similar for both groups of infants at comparable ages across the first year. Total sleep time and the longest Sustained sleep period (sleep continuity variables) differed significantly at some of the ages measured. Although overall sleep architecture appears highly resilient and well organized, some indications of sleep fragmentation and shortened nighttime sleep periods were observed in the substance-ex posed infants. More research is needed to explain why sleep-continuity variables and not sleep-state proportion variables differed between the two groups.

AB Organic anion and cation transporters (OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs) mediate the proximal tubular secretion of numerous clinically important compounds, including various commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals. Here, we report determination of the ontogeny of these transporters and of NaP(i)2 and SGLT1, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to determine expression levels of transporter genes in rat embryonic kidneys on each day of gestation from embryonic day (ed) 13 to ed18, in cultures of induced and uninduced metanephric mesenchyme ( MM), and on each day of 1 week of whole embryonic kidney (WEK) culture. We also examined ontogeny of Oat1 protein expression in rat embryonic kidney by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we used uptake of fluorescein (FL) as a novel in vitro functional assay of OAT expression in WEK and MM. Developmental induction of OAT and OCT genes does not occur uniformly: some genes are induced early ( e. g., Oat1 and Oat3, potential early markers of proximal tubulogenesis), and others after kidney development is relatively advanced ( e. g., Oct1, a potential marker of terminal differentiation). The ontogeny of transporter genes in WEK and MM is similar to that observed in vivo, indicating that these organ culture systems may represent convenient in vitro models to study the developmental induction of OATs, OCTs, and OCTNs. Functional transport was evidenced by accumulation of FL in the developing tubule in WEK and MM organ cultures. Our findings on the renal ontogeny of OATs and OCTs could carry implications both for the development of more rational therapeutics for premature infants, as well as for our understanding of proximal tubule differentiation.

   PATHWAYS
AB Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is known to produce lasting arousal, attentional and cognitive deficits in humans. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), as the cholinergic arm of the reticular activating system (RAS), is known to modulate arousal, waking and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep decreases between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat, especially at 12-21 days. Pregnant dams were exposed to 350 ml of cigarette smoke for 15 min, 3 times per day, from day E14 until birth, and the pups allowed to mature. Intracellularly recorded PPN neurons in 12-21 day rat brainstem, slices were tested for intrinsic membrane properties, including the hyperpolarization-activated cation current I-h, which is known to drive oscillatory activity. Type II (A-current) PPN cells from 12-16 day old offspring of treated animals had a 1/2max I-h amplitude of (mean +/- SE) 4.1 +/- 0.9 mV, while 17-21 day cells had a higher 1/2max I-h, of 9.9 +/- 1.1 mV (p < 0.0001). Cells from 12-16 day old control brainstems had a 1/2max I-h of 1.3 +/- 0.1 mV, which was lower (p < 0.05) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring; while 17-21 day old cells from controls had a 1/2max/I-h of 3.3 +/- 0.3 mV, which was also lower (p < 0.01) than in cells from prenatally treated offspring. In addition, changes in resting membrane potential [control -65. +/-. 0.9 mV (n=32); exposed -55.0 +/- 1.4 mV (n=27) (p < 0.0001)], and action potential (AP) threshold [control -56.5 +/- 0.7 mV (n=32), exposed -47.0 +/- 1.4 mV (n=27) (p < 0.0001)], suggest that prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke induced marked changes in cells in the cholinergic arm of the RAS, rendefing them more excitable. Such data could partially explain the differences seen in individuals whose parents smoked during pregnancy, especially in terms of their hypervigilance and increased propensity for attentional deficits and cognitive/behavioral disorders.

AB Sleep-disordered breathing and snoring are common in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to determine whether pregnancy was associated with upper airway narrowing.
   One-hundred females in the third trimester of pregnancy were recruited and 50 agreed to be restudied 3 months after delivery. One-hundred nonpregnant females were also recruited. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection.
   Snoring was less common in nonpregnant (17%) than pregnant females (41%; odds ratio (OR) 3.34; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.65-6.74) and returned to nonpregnant levels after delivery (18%; OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.40). Pregnant females had significantly smaller upper airways than nonpregnant females at the oropharyngeal junction when seated (mean difference 0.12; 95% CI 0.008-0.25), and smaller mean pharyngeal areas in the seated (mean difference 0.14; 95% CI 0.001-0.28), supine (mean difference 0.11; 95% Cl 0.01-0.22) and lateral postures (mean difference 0.13; 95% Cl 0.02-0.24) compared with the nonpregnant females. Pregnant females had smaller mean pharyngeal areas compared with post-partum in the seated (mean difference 0.18; 95% CI 0.02-0.32), supine (mean difference 0.20; 95% Cl 0.06-0.35) and lateral postures (mean difference 0.26; 95% Cl 0.12-0.39).
   In conclusion, this study confirmed increased snoring and showed narrower upper airways during the third trimester of pregnancy.

AB Pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) may be associated with both endothelial dysfunction (ED) and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). It was hypothesised that females with PET would demonstrate both SDB and ED, and that a correlation between these two would suggest a potential causative association.
   A total of 17 females with PET and 25 matched females with uncomplicated pregnancy were studied. They underwent a nocturnal ambulatory sleep study (using Watch_PAT100) and noninvasive evaluation of endothelial function utilising the reactive hyperaemia test (using Endo-PAT 2000). A higher ratio of post- to pre-occlusion pulse-wave amplitude (endothelial function index (EFI)) indicated better endothelial function.
   Females with PET had a significantly higher respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and lower EF1 than controls (18.4+/-8.4 versus 8.3+/-1.3.h(-1), and 1.5+/-0.1 versus 1.8+/-0.1, respectively). Blood pressure significantly correlated with RDI and with EFI. EFI tended to correlate with RDI.
   In conclusion, these results suggest that both sleep-disordered breathing and endothelial dysfunction are more likely to occur in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia than in females with uncomplicated pregnancies. The current authors speculate that respiratory disturbances contribute to the functional abnormality of the blood vessels seen in females with pre-eclamptic toxaemia, although causality cannot be determined based on this study.

AB Nasal and sinus problems during pregnancy are a common event. There are few data regarding the clinical effect of the various forms of rhinitis on pregnancy outcomes; however, gestational rhinitis can have a deleterious effect on maternal well-being during pregnancy. The impact of allergic rhinitis or sinusitis adversely affects the pregnant mother's eating, sleeping, and emotional well-being, and it can aggravate coexisting gestational asthma. Therefore, rhinitis during pregnancy, whatever the cause, should be evaluated and treated to optimize pregnancy outcome. This article details the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis that is encountered during pregnancy, and lists treatment options that are available to the practicing clinician.

AB From earliest times, psychiatrists have described biological rhythm disturbances as characteristic of mood disorders. The present flourishing of circadian biology has revealed the molecular basis of 24-h rhythmicity driven by 'clock' genes, as well as the importance of zeitgebers (synchronisers). Winter depression was first modelled on regulation of animal behaviour by seasonal changes in daylength, and led to application of light as the first successful chronobiological treatment in psychiatry. Light therapy has great promise for many other disorders (e.g. sleep-wake cycle disturbances in Alzheimer's dementia, bulimia, premenstrual disorder, depression during pregnancy) and, importantly, as an adjuvant to antidepressant medication in major non-seasonal depression. The pineal hormone melatonin is also a zeitgeber for the human circadian system, in addition to possessing direct sleep-promoting effects. Chronobiology has provided efficacious non-pharmaceutical treatments for mood disorders (such as sleep deprivation or light therapy) as well as novel approaches to new drugs (e.g. agomelatine).

ID MULTIPLE PREGNANCIES
AB Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy is a rare and difficult to diagnose disorder. We describe the case of a 30-yr-old woman presenting with symptoms and signs of mild hypercortisolism, in which ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome was diagnosed. Urinary cortisol excretion was elevated and circadian rhythm of cortisol was absent. ACTH levels were low. In addition, plasma cortisol failed to suppress after a high dexamethasone dose. An abdominal computed tomography scan confirmed a left adrenal mass. While diagnosis work-up was still in progress, the patient became pregnant and wanted to carry her pregnancy to full-term. Hypercortisolism was successfully controlled with metyrapone, which was started at 8 weeks of gestation. At 16 weeks of gestation, a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed. Pathologic examination of the gland showed a benign adrenocortical adenoma. The patient developed secondary adrenal insufficiency and was discharged on 20 mg hydrocortisone daily dose. At 30 weeks of gestation, the patient had a pre-term rupture of membranes and underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery. The newborn was a normal virilized male who weighed 1280 g. No apparent metyrapone-induced teratogenic effects were observed and there was no clinical or biochemical suppression of adrenocortical function. In conclusion, in adrenal Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy, medical treatment with metyrapone as soon as the diagnosis is made, in combination with laparoscopic surgery during the second trimester, are useful in preventing complications secondary to hypercortisolism and safe both for the mother and infant.

AB We present a case of intensified therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of citalopram in mother and newborn infant after clinically observed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated symptoms 2 weeks until 2 months after delivery. The SSRI-associated symptoms observed in the infant (up to 3 weeks after delivery) were irregular breathing, sleep disorders, hypotonia, and hypertonia. We conclude that the SSRI-associated symptoms in the infant represent citalopram withdrawal effects rather than side effects caused by breastfeeding. This case illustrates the importance of a flexible TDM program and a multidisciplinary approach in a hospital setting to deal with cases of drug-associated adverse effects, such as SSRI withdrawal effects.

TI Major epidemiological changes in sudden infant death syndrome: a 20-year
   population-based study in the UK
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID SLEEPING POSITION; RISK; ENVIRONMENT; SCOTLAND; SIDS
AB Background Results of case-control studies in the past 5 years suggest that the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has changed since the 1991 UK Back to Sleep campaign. The campaign's advice that parents put babies on their back to sleep led to a fall in death rates. We used a longitudinal dataset to assess these potential changes.
   Methods Population-based data from home visits have been collected for 369 consecutive unexpected infant deaths (300 SIDS and 69 explained deaths) in Avon over 20 years (1984-2003). Data obtained between 1993 and 1996 from 1300 controls with a chosen "reference" sleep before interview have been used for comparison.
   Findings Over the past 20 years, the proportion of children who died from SIDS while co-sleeping with their parents, has risen from 12% to 50% (p<0.0001), but the actual number of SIDS deaths in the parental bed has halved (p=0.01). The proportion seems to have increased partly because the Back to Sleep campaign led to fewer deaths in infants sleeping alone-rather than because of a rise in deaths of infants who bed-shared, and partly because of an increase in the number of deaths in infants sleeping with their parents on a sofa. The proportion of deaths in families from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds has risen from 47% to 74% (p=0.003), the prevalence of maternal smoking during pregnancy from 57% to 86% (p=0.0004), and the proportion of pre-term infants from 12% to 34% (p=0.0001). Although many SIDS infants come from large families, first-born infants are now the largest group. The age of infants who bed-share is significantly smaller than that before the campaign, and fewer are breastfed.
   Interpretation Factors that contribute to SIDS have changed in their importance over the past 20 years. Although the reasons for the rise in deaths when a parent sleeps with their infant on a sofa are still unclear, we strongly recommend that parents avoid this sleeping environment. Most SIDS deaths now occur in deprived families. To better understand contributory factors and plan preventive measures we need control data from similarly deprived families, and particularly, infant sleep environments.

AB A combined time-variant analysis of nonlinear stability and parametric bispectral measures was applied to the in utero electrocorticogram (ECoG) of fetal sheep between 0.7 and 0.9 gestation to examine the maturation of sleep states and synchronization patterns of the ECoG. Cycling of the nonlinear stability of the fetal ECoG occurred already at 0.7 gestation and suggests the presence of premature sleep states. This was accompanied by cycling of the time-variant biamplitude which reflected ECoG synchronization effects during premature NR.EM sleep. Maturation of NREM sleep begun at 0.78 gestation and preceded that of REM sleep that begun at 0.85 gestation. Our results suggest that maturation of brain stem and thalarnic function precedes that of cortical function.

AB The prevalence of obesity continues to increase despite preventive strategies. Obese parturients are at increased risk of having either concurrent medical problems or superimposed antenatal diseases such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Moreover, they have a tendency to labour abnormally contributing to increased instrumental delivery and Caesarean section. Obesity is a risk factor for anaesthesia related maternal mortality. Morbidly obese women must be considered as high-risk and deserve an anaesthetic consultation during their antenatal care. The significant difficulty in administering epidural analgesia should not preclude their use in labour. A more liberalised use of regional techniques may be a means to further reduce anaesthesia-related maternal mortality in the obese population. The mother's life should not be jeopardised to save a compromised fetus. Prophylactic placement of an epidural catheter when not contraindicated in labouring morbidly obese women would potentially decrease anaesthetic and perinatal complications associated with attempts at emergency provision of regional or general anaesthesia. Early mobilisation, aggressive chest physiotherapy and adequate pain control are essential components of effective postoperative care.

AB Objective: To prospectively investigate the longitudinal changes of amplitude-integrated electroencephalographic (aEEG) activity in preterm infants < 30 weeks gestational age (GA). Methods: Infants (GA < 30 weeks) without evidence of neurological abnormalities had weekly aEEG recordings performed. The relative duration of the three aEEG patterns ( discontinuous low voltage, discontinuous high voltage and continuous) was determined and the influence of GA and postnatal age (PNA) on the occurrence of each pattern was assessed. Results: Ninety-eight infants ( median GA 26 weeks; range 23 - 29 weeks) were studied. With higher GA ( OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.33 - 2.13) and PNA ( OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.53 - 2.38), the likelihood for the occurrence of continuous activity increased. The discontinuous low-voltage pattern was less likely to occur with increasing GA ( OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 - 0.83) and PNA ( OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 - 0.81). Conclusion: Maturation of aEEG activity in preterm infants is influenced by both GA and PNA. Copyright (C) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB The present study investigates whether and how the pineal or its hormone melatonin influences female reproductive functions, namely the litter size, prenatal development of offsprings, and estrous cyclicity, especially its age-related cessation in a non-seasonal breeder, the laboratory rat. Wistar rats were maintained under a 24 h light- dark (12L:12D) cycle. Female rats were divided into 3 groups: non-operated (NO), sham-operated (SX), and pinealectomized (PX). Surgeries were performed in 35-40 day-old females. Starting at an age between 70 days and 7 months, female rats of all 3 groups were repeatedly mated with intact males. PX mothers more frequently delivered pups with malformations (e. g., taillessness, hydronephrosis, 7 out of 1263 pups) than control rats (0/1323; p < 0.007). In the first delivery at 3 months of age, but not at later ages, PX mothers delivered more pups of lower body weight than control animals (p < 0.001). Examination of vaginal smears showed that almost all female rats of the NO, SX, and PX groups had 4-day estrous cyclicity when they were young-between 60 days and 5 months of age. At an age of 17 to 18 months, most female rats of the NO and SX groups showed irregular, continuously diestrous or pseudopregnancy-like patterns, and 4-day estrous cyclicity was found in only 10% of the NO or SX animals. In contrast, about 50% of the PX rats showed 4-day estrous cyclicity at this older age (p < 0.001). Melatonin, when added to drinking water (0.4 mg/L) for 16 days during the dark phase increased the frequency of diestrous phase, except in continuously diestrous rats and very few others. This melatonin effect was strong in PX rats but relatively weak in SX rats. In conclusion, the pineal hormone appears to influence various reproductive functions and developmental processes, especially pregnancy and the timing of reproductive aging in rats. The effects of pinealectomy are more prominent at an age of 60 to 80 days (i.e., shortly after puberty) and at the beginning of the cessation of cycles in middle-aged females.

AB Mouse mammary epithelial cells (HC-11) and mammary tissues were analyzed for developmental changes in circadian clock, cellular proliferation, and differentiation marker genes. Expression of the clock genes Per1 and Bmal1 were elevated in differentiated HC-11 cells, whereas Per2 mRNA levels were higher in undifferentiated cells. This differentiation-dependent profile of clock gene expression was consistent with that observed in mouse mammary glands, as Per1 and Bmal1 mRNA levels were elevated in late pregnant and lactating mammary tissues, whereas Per2 expression was higher in proliferating virgin and early pregnant glands. In both HC-11 cells and mammary glands, elevated Per2 expression was positively correlated with c-Myc and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels, whereas Per1 and Bmal1 expression changed in conjunction with beta-casein mRNA levels. Interestingly, developmental stage had differential effects on rhythms of clock gene expression in the mammary gland. These data suggest that circadian clock genes may play a role in mouse mammary gland development and differentiation.

AB Links between neonatal biological rhythms and the emergence of interaction rhythms were examined in 3 groups (N = 71): high-risk preterms (HR; birth weight < 1,000 g), low-risk preterms (LR; birth weight = 1,700-1,850 g), and full-term (FT) infants. Once a week for premature infants and on the 2nd day for FT infants, sleep-wake cyclicity was extracted from 4-hr observations and cardiac vagal tone was measured. At term age, infant orientation was tested with the Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale. At 3 months, arousal modulation and emotion regulation were assessed, and mother-infant synchrony was computed from microanalysis of face-to-face interactions using time-series analysis. Sleep-wake amplitudes showed a developmental leap at 31 weeks gestation, followed by a shift in vagal tone at 34 weeks gestation. At term, differences among FT, LR, and HR infants were observed for biological rhythms in a linear-decline pattern. Sleep-wake cyclicity, vagal tone, newborn orientation, and arousal modulation were each uniquely predictive of mother-infant synchrony. The organization of physiological oscillators appears to lay the foundation for the infant's capacity to partake in a temporally matched social dialogue.

AB Sex hormones are implicated in the immune response, with estrogens as enhancers at least of the humoral immunity and androgens and progesterone (and glucocorticoids) as natural immune-suppressors. Several physiological, pathological, and therapeutic conditions may change the serum estrogen milieu and/or peripheral conversion rate, including the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum period, menopause, being elderly, chronic stress, altered circadian rhythms, inflammatory cytokines, and use of corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, and steroid hormonal replacements, inducing altered androgen/estrogen ratios and related effects. In particular, cortisol and melatonin circadian rhythms are altered, at least in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and partially involve sex hormone circadian synthesis and levels as well. Abnormal regulation of aromatase activity (i.e., increased activity) by inflammatory cytokine production (i.e., TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6) may partially explain the abnormalities of peripheral estrogen synthesis in RA (i.e., increased availability of 17-beta estradiol and possible metabolites in synovial fluids) and in systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as the altered serum sex-hormone levels and ratio (i.e., decreased androgens and DHEAS). In the synovial fluids of RA patients, the increased estrogen concentration is observed in both sexes and is more specifically characterized by the hydroxylated forms, in particular 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, which is a mitogenic and cell proliferative endogenous hormone. Local effects of sex hormones in autoimmune rheumatic diseases seems to consist mainly in modulation of cell proliferation and cytokine production (i.e., TNFalpha, Il-1, IL-12). In this respect, it is interesting that male patients with RA seem to profit more from anti-TNFalpha strategies than do female patients.

AB Since 1997, discount vouchers for insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) have been used in two rural districts of southern Tanzania as a way to target subsidies to children under 5 years and pregnant women. We assessed appropriate use and misuse of discount vouchers through a follow-up study of 104 randomly selected vouchers. We traced these vouchers from their original issue in mother-and-child health (MCH) clinics through to being redeemed at a sales agent. We found that all vouchers that reached the target population (100%, 56/56) were used to buy an ITN. Moreover, 94% of the ITNs bought with vouchers were used by those intended, women and children under 5 years. However, up to 48% (50/104) of the vouchers had been misused at the clinics that issued them. Nevertheless, large-scale misuse occurred only at three of 21 clinics. Although most women slept under a net while pregnant, the use of voucher-subsidized ITNs during pregnancy was low despite widespread knowledge of the scheme. Parents had apparently decided to buy the subsidized ITNs once the child was born and not during pregnancy. Importantly, in 20% of households the only existing net had been bought with a voucher. Our findings suggest that vouchers are properly used by the target population, and that to minimize voucher leakage, control measures are needed at MCH clinics and to a certain extent for commercial sales agents. Increased awareness among the whole community on the right to receive a discount voucher may also help to control misuse at health facilities.

AB BACKGROUND: Genes underlying circadian rhythm generation are expressed in many tissues. We explore a role for circadian rhythms in the timing and efficacy of mouse reproduction and development using a genetic approach. METHODS: We compare fecundity in Clock(Delta 19) mutant mice (a dominant-negative protein essential for circadian rhythm activity) and in Vipr2(-/-) null mutant mice (affecting the generation and output of the circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus) with wild type (WT) litter mates under both a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle and continuous darkness. RESULTS: Uteri from Clock(Delta 19) mice show no circadian rhythm and Vipr2(-/-) mice show a phase-advanced rhythm compared to WT uteri. In neither mutant line were homozygous or heterozygous fetuses lethal. Sexually mature adults of both mutant lines showed mildly reduced male in vivo (but not in vitro) fertility and irregular estrous cycles exacerbated by continuous darkness. However, pregnancy rates and neonatal litter sizes were not affected. The Clock(D)19 mutant line was distinguishable from the Vipr2(-/-) null mutant line in showing more peri-natal delivery problems and very poor survival of offspring to weaning. CONCLUSIONS: A fully functional central and peripheral circadian clock is not essential for reproduction and development to term, but has critical roles peri-natally and post-partum.

AB This study examined the association between maternal smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) during pregnancy and infant heart rate. Participants were 62 mother-infant dyads where mother smoked during pregnancy, 47 dyads where mother did not smoke during pregnancy but was exposed to ETS and 47 dyads where mother did not smoke and was not exposed to ETS. Average heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed at 2-4 weeks of age during sleep. Infants in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than nonexposed infants. Furthermore, boys in both exposure groups had higher HR and lower RSA than girls. These results highlight the importance of considering prenatal ETS exposure and infant gender when assessing infant outcomes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Insulin sensitivity decreases for the first time in females at the time of menarche. A much more profound decrease in insulin sensitivity is observed at the end of pregnancy. This physiological insulin resistance is not accompanied by a rise in overall sympathetic activity as reflected in plasma noradrenaline levels, but there is evidence of moderate sympathetic overactivity in muscle and the heart. Preeclampsia is characterized by increased insulin resistance, sympathetic overactivity and a particular lipid profile. Thus it is the first manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Women with a history of pre-eclampsia have persistent insulin resistance after pregnancy associated with increased sympathetic activity of the cardiovascular system, and coronary artery disease later in life. Aging is accompanied by a greater increase in sympathetic traffic in women than in men, and inflammation (measured via C-reactive protein) seems to be more strongly related to metabolic syndrome in women than in men. The clinical relevance of these observations remains to be shown. As the key factors of metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance and sympathetic overactivity, are closely inter-related, treatment should be aimed at cutting the vicious circle at many points: lifestyle modification (diet, increasing exercise) as a basis of therapy, use of insulin sensitizers (e.g. metformin) to decrease insulin resistance, central sympatholytics (e.g. moxonidine), and AT-receptor blockers; or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to overcome sympathetic overactivity, hypertension and inflammation.

AB Objective To examine the association between maternal cocaine use during pregnancy and physiological measures of regulation, which included heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Methods Potential mediators and moderators of this association were explored. Participants were 141 mother-infant dyads (77 cocaine exposed and 64 nonexposed) recruited at birth. Average infant HR and RSA was assessed at 4-8 weeks of age during a 15 minute period of sleep. Results Results indicated a dose-dependent effect of prenatal exposure to cocaine on RSA. There was no evidence that fetal growth or other prenatal exposure to substances mediated this association or that fetal growth or maternal age moderated this association. Regression analyses also indicated that birth weight (BW), but not birthlength (BL), head circumference (HC) or other substance use, mediated the association between prenatal exposure to cocaine and heart rate. Conclusions These results suggest that cocaine exposure is associated with physiological regulation at 4-8 weeks of age and highlight the importance of considering level of exposure when assessing infant outcomes.

   EXPRESSION
AB Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone are potent agonists at the GABA(A) receptor and suppress the fetal CNS activity. These steroids are synthesized in the fetal brain either from cholesterol or from circulating precursors derived from the placenta. The concentrations of allopregnanolone are remarkably high in the fetal brain and rise further in response to acute hypoxic stress, induced by constriction of the umbilical cord. This response may result from the increased 5 alpha-reductase and cytochrome P-450(SCC) expression in the brain. These observations suggest that the rise in neurosteroid concentrations in response to acute hypoxia may represent an endogenous protective mechanism that reduces excitotoxicity following hypoxic stress in the developing brain. In contrast to acute stress, chronic hypoxemia induces neurosteroidogenic enzyme expression without an increase in neurosteroid concentrations and, therefore, may pose a greater risk to the fetus. At birth, the allopregnanolone concentrations in the brain fall markedly, probably due to the loss of placental precursors; however, stressors, including hypoxia and endotoxin-induced inflammation, raise allopregnanolone concentrations in the newborn brain. This may protect the newborn brain from hypoxia-induced damage. However, the rise in allopregnanolone concentrations was also associated with increased sleep. This rise in sedative steroid levels may depress arousal and contribute to the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Our recent findings indicate that acute hypoxic stress in pregnancy initiates a neurosteroid response that may protect the fetal brain from hypoxia-induced cell death, whereas the decline in allopregnanolone levels after birth may result in greater vulnerability to brain injury in neonates.

AB Sleep disorders are linked with mood disorders and other psychiatric illnesses. Many women attribute sleep difficulties to abortion, but this self-diagnosis has not been tested using record-based evidence. Examination of records for 56,824 women with no known history of sleep disorders or sleep disturbances revealed that women were more likely to be treated for sleep disorders or disturbances following an induced abortion compared to a birth. The difference was most pronounced in the first 180 days after pregnancy resolution and was not significant after the third year.

AB We aimed to identify drinking rates in a prospectively identified cohort of pregnant women, and subsequently, to identify the drinkers of 48 g or more alcohol/day among them, by using complementary methods for verifying self/reported drinking habits. A research team of social workers and health professionals at the Maipu Clinic, located in a lower middle class neighborhood of Santiago, Chile, conducted interviews of women attending a prenatal clinic between August 1995 and July 2000. Women whose interview responses met predefined criteria (identified in the text) were further evaluated by home visits. We interviewed 9,628 of 10,917 (88%) women receiving prenatal care. By initial interview, 42.6% of women reported no drinking, 57.4% some alcohol consumption, and 3.7% consuming at least one standard drink (15 mL of absolute alcohol) per day. Of the 887 women who had home visits, 101 were identified as consuming on average at least 4 drinks/day (48 g). To determine the best home visit questionnaire items for identifying those drinking at least 4 drinks per day, 48 women who openly admitted drinking this amount were compared with 786 women who were not considered drinkers after the home visit. The 48 self-reported 48 g/day drinkers were significantly more likely to get tipsy when drinking before (p = 0.01) or during (p < 0.0001) pregnancy, to have started drinking at a younger age (p = 0.007), or to exhibit signs of low self-esteem (p < 0.0001), sleep or appetite problems (p < 0.0001), bad interpersonal relationships (p < 0.0001) or having family members with fetal alcohol syndrome features (p < 0.009). In conclusion, using complementary methods of alcohol misuse ascertainment during pregnancy, we found that at least 1% of pregnant women in a Santiago, Chile, clinic population were drinking at levels that are clearly dangerous to the fetus (48 g/day or more). We identified specific interview questions that may help screen for alcohol use of 48 g/day or more in pregnant women.

AB To give birth and become a parent is a source of many emotions and expectations. Several studies show that women experience different problems after giving birth. It can bring many physical, emotional and social changes that may alter the woman's sexual needs and impact on her relationship. The aim of this study was to elucidate how some women experienced their sexual life with their partner after giving birth.
   Twenty-seven women participated in six focus group discussions (FGDs). These discussions took place 3-24 months postdelivery. The midwives at their antenatal clinics selected them. A discussion guide with broad questions related to the subject was used and an observer took notes during the FGD.
   Four themes were identified: body image after childbirth, how sexual patterns are altered following new stresses of family life, discordance of sexual desire with the partner and the necessity for reassurance. The women did not feel comfortable with the physical changes that had taken place and their body image. Childbirth meant less sleep and less free time; consequently, instead of having sex, women wanted to sleep or have time for themselves and that led to a changed sex pattern. Discordance of sexual desire with the partner was a problem but most of the women expressed confidence that their sexual desire would return shortly. Reassurance and confirmation that they were physically alright and back to normal was essential.
   New mothers are concerned with their body image and the ability to adapt to parenting. They need sensitive, professional counselling and reassurance about their body, as well as about sexual life after childbirth. This level of professional counselling is presently not widely available to new mothers, while midwives and gynaecologists should be the key persons to provide this service.

AB In a prospective study of 247 pregnant Chinese women, the prevalence of sleep disturbances across pregnancy has been assessed using a set of validated questionnaires including the Sleep and Health Questionnaire (SHQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The frequency of self-reported snoring increased from 29.7% in the first trimester to 40.5% and 46.2% in the second and third trimesters, respectively, with an increase in the prevalence of moderate or severe snoring from 1% in the first trimester to 7.2% in the third trimester (P < 0.01). There was a higher frequency of moderate to severe snoring intensity among subjects with BMI >= 25 compared with those with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) in the third trimester (20.8%vs 5.3%, P < 0.01). Subjective sleepiness, as determined by the ESS, increased significantly from 8.6 to 9.4 and 9.6 in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively.

AB Our understanding of when the fetus can experience pain has been largely shaped by neuroanatomy. However, completion of the cortical nociceptive connections just after mid-gestation is only one part of the story. In addition to critically reviewing evidence for whether the fetus is ever awake or aware, and thus able to truly experience pain, we examine the role of endogenous neuroinhibitors, such as adenosine and pregnanolone, produced within the feto-placental unit that contribute to fetal sleep states, and thus mediate suppression of fetal awareness. The uncritical view that the nature of presumed fetal pain perception can be assessed by reference to the prematurely born infant is challenged. Rigorously controlled studies of invasive procedures and analgesia in the fetus are required to clarify the impact of fetal nociception on postnatal pain sensitivity and neural development, and the potential benefits or harm of using analgesia in this unique setting.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is clinically defined as an urge to move the legs with or without paresthesia, worsening of symptoms with rest and transient improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening and night. This is often genetic but may also occur in the setting of iron deficiency, uremia, pregnancy, neuropathy, and possibly other conditions. The pathology is probably related to central nervous system iron dysregulation. Effective treatments include dopaminergics and narcotics. Recent advances in our understanding of RLS clinical presentation, epidemiology, etiology, and treatment will be discussed.

AB Background. Pregnant women suffer from sleep disturbance, which may be aggravated by smoking and/or drinking. We investigate here the joint effect of smoking and drinking with respect to sleep disturbance during pregnancy.
   Methods. Survey of about 16,000 pregnant women in Japan, conducted in 2002 using a self-administered questionnaire.
   Results. Both smoking and drinking increased the odds of sleep disturbances, such as subjective insufficient sleep, difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep.. early-morning awakening, short sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness and restless legs syndrome. The joint odds ratios for smoking and drinking corresponded more or less to the products of the odds ratio for smoking or drinking.
   Conclusion. Smoking and drinking are independently associated with increased sleep disturbance during pregnancy, in addition to their other well-known side-effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Kenya established intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for malaria in pregnancy as national policy in 1998. We assessed the coverage of IPT among women who had recently delivered in a rural area of western Kenya with perennial malaria transmission and high coverage with insecticide treated nets (ITNs) through a cross-sectional, community-based survey in December 2002. Antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance was high (89.9% of the 635 participating women); 77.5% of attendees visited an ANC before the third trimester and 91.9% made more than one visit. Delivery of SP by the ANC was reported by 19.1% of all women but only 6.8% reported receiving more than one dose. Given the high rate of use of ANC services, if SP were given at each visit after the first trimester, the potential coverage of IPT (two doses of SP) would be 80.3% in this study population. ITNs were used by 82.4% of women during pregnancy, and almost all mothers (98.5%) who slept under an ITN shared the nets with their newborns after delivery. Women who thought malaria in pregnancy caused foetal problems were more likely to have used an ITN (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.4), and to have visited ANC more than once (AOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.7) compared to women who thought malaria in pregnancy was either not a problem or caused problems for the mother only. These findings illustrate the need for improved IPT coverage in this rural area. Identification and removal of the barriers to provision of IPT during ANC visits can help to increase coverage. In this area of Kenya, health messages stressing that foetal complications of malaria in pregnancy may occur in the absence of maternal illness may improve the demand for IPT.

AB In fluctuating environmental temperature, homeotherms are able to maintain stable their body temperature, which however reveals a rhythmic daily pattern as described in literature. Because of the importance of body temperature rhythmicity in the knowledge of thermal homeostasis and as a means to facilitate the study of biological rhythmicity in general, the aim of our study was to assess the influence of two different ambient temperature on the daily rhythmicity of body and auricle temperature in goat (Capra hircus). For our study 6 female adult Maltese goats (18 month old), not pregnant and clinically healthy were used. On each subject body and auricle temperature was recorded during two different periods, of 7 days each, every 3 hours for 24 hours from 07.00 to 04.00, at different environmental temperature (1(st) period 18.251.48 degrees C, 2(nd) period 28.252.05 degrees C). The analysis of the obtained result under two ambient temperature indicates the existence of a daily periodicity, with small differences in amplitude and acrophase between the two studied period, both in body and auricle temperature in Maltese breed goat so we can assume that environmental temperature can influence in a significant way the daily pattern of body and auricle temperature.

AB This study aimed at examining any relation between the circadian variation in blood pressure (BP) in human pregnancy and fetal growth. A prospective study included 52 pregnant women monitored during the third trimester of pregnancy, There were 33 uncomplicated pregnancies with normal fetal growth (Group 1) and 19 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation IUGR). confirmed at birth (Group 2). Ten women (five in each group) had pregnancy - induced hypertension, All women were hospitalized and followed a similar daily routine. BP was recorded with an automatic wearable device. Measurements were obtained every 20 min for 24 +/- 1 h, BP profiles were analyzed by conventional statistical methods and by cosinor, involving the least squares fit of cosine curves with an anticipated period (24 h) to the data. BP parameters, fetal outcome, demographic and obstetric characteristics were compared between the two groups, Logistic regression and multivariate analyses were used to assess factors putatively associated with fetal outcome. The circadian amplitude of diastolic BP was found to be larger in normotensive women with IUGR. As gauged by odds ratios (OR), the circadian amplitude of diastolic BP (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1. 1-2.8; P = 0.03) and hematocrit (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0- 1.9; P = 0.04) were the only variables positively and independently associated with IUGR. In the presence of maternal hypertension, the circadian amplitude of systolic BP was negatively associated with IUGR (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-1.0; P = 0.03). A larger circadian variation in diastolic BP, rather than a difference in the mean value of systolic or diastolic BP, was found to be statistically significantly associated with IUGR. This study adds another condition in which the circadian BP amplitude constitutes a harbinger of elevated risk, apart from an association with a shortened lifespan in the absence or presence of malignant hypertension and with an increased risk of stroke and nephropathy reported earlier.

AB Aim To investigate the relationship between the onset of eye movement periods and micturition in human fetuses and in neonates with the intention of clarifying the transition in relationship during the perinatal period.
   Methods Data were acquired during 14 days and/or I month (29-33 days) from 6 normal neonates born at term. Eye movements, crying, and eye open periods were observed with a video recorder until micturition occurred. In 29 term fetuses, the time lag between the onset of an eye movement period and micturition was measured by real-time ultrasound instruments.
   Results The time lag between the onset of an eye movement period and micturition in neonates (2 minutes; range, 0-57 minutes) was significantly (P= 0.027) different from the time lag for fetuses (14 minutes; range, 2-32 minutes) and the frequency of micturition occurring within 8 minutes (33%) was significantly lower (P=0.017) than that seen for term fetuses (72%).
   Conclusion The relationship between the onset of an eye movement period and micturition is different in term human fetuses and neonates of less than 1 month of age. This suggests that the neuronal relationship among brain centers for micturition, rapid-eye-movement sleep, and awakening is dramatically altered perinatally.

   RISK-FACTORS; ADULT BEDS; ENVIRONMENT; SIDS; SUFFOCATION; ASSOCIATION
AB Objective. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remains the number 1 cause of postneonatal infant death. Prone infant sleep position and maternal smoking have been established as risk factors for SIDS mortality. Some studies have found that bedsharing is associated with SIDS, but, to date, there is only strong evidence for a risk among infants of smoking mothers and some evidence of a risk among young infants of nonsmoking mothers. Despite the lack of convincing scientific evidence, bedsharing with nonsmoking mothers remains controversial. In some states, nonsmoking mothers are currently being told that they should not bedshare with their infants, and mothers of infants who died of SIDS are told that they caused the death of their infant because they bedshared. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal smoking and bedsharing among Oregon mothers to explore whether smoking mothers, in contrast to nonsmoking mothers, are getting the message that they should not bedshare.
   Methods. Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveys a stratified random sample, drawn from birth certificates, of women after a live birth. Hispanic and non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native women, and non-Hispanic white women with low birth weight infants are oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for stratified analysis. The sample then was weighted to reflect Oregon's population. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (73.5% weighted response). The median time from birth to completion of the survey was 4 months. Women were asked whether they shared a bed with their infant "always," "almost always," "sometimes," or "never." Frequent bedsharing was defined as "always" or "almost always"; infrequent was defined as "sometimes" or "never." Results. Of all new mothers, 35.2% reported bedsharing frequently (always: 20.5%; almost always: 14.7%) and 64.8% infrequently (sometimes: 41.4%; never: 23.4%). Bedsharing among postpartum smoking mothers was 18.8% always, 12.6% almost always, 45.1% sometimes, and 23.6% never; this was not statistically different from among nonsmoking mothers.
   Results for prenatal smokers were similar. When stratified by race/ethnicity, there was no association between smoking and bedsharing in any racial or ethnic group. In univariable and multivariable logistic regression, there were no statistical differences in frequent or any bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smoking mothers compared with nonsmokers; the adjusted odds ratio for postpartum smokers who frequently bedshared was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.25) and for any bedsharing was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.57-1.94). Results for prenatal smoking were similar. This is the first US population-based study to look at the prevalence of bedsharing among smoking and nonsmoking mothers. Bedsharing is common in Oregon, with 35.2% of mothers in Oregon reporting frequently bedsharing and an additional 41.4% sometimes bedsharing. There was no significant association between smoking and bedsharing for either prenatal or postpartum smokers among any racial or ethnic group. Smoking mothers were as likely to bedshare as nonsmoking mothers. The frequency of bedsharing in Oregon was similar to estimates from other sources. Our study has the advantage of being a population-based sample drawn from birth certificates, weighted for nonresponse.
   Conclusions. Although a number of case series have raised concerns about the safety of mother-infant bedsharing, even among nonsmoking mothers, this has not yet been confirmed by careful, controlled studies. There have been 9 large-scale case-control studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Three case-control studies did not stratify by maternal smoking status, but found no increased risk for SIDS. Six case control studies reported results stratified by maternal smoking status: 1 study, while asserting an association, provided an unexplained range of univariable odds ratios without CIs; 3 found no increased risk for older infants of nonsmoking mothers; and 2 found a risk only for infants < 8-11 weeks of age. Despite the preponderance of evidence that bedsharing by nonsmoking mothers does not increase the risk for SIDS among older infants, the recent specter of bedsharing as a cause of SIDS, based on uncontrolled case series and medical examiners' anecdotal experience, has led some medical examiners to label a death "suffocation" or "overlay asphyxiation" simply because the infant was bedsharing at the time of death. This "diagnostic drift" may greatly complicate future studies of the relationship between bedsharing and SIDS. Epidemiologic evidence shows that there is little or no increased risk for SIDS among infants of nonsmoking mothers but increased risk among infants of smoking mothers and younger infants of nonsmoking mothers. It seems prudent to discourage bedsharing among all infants < 3 months old. Young infants brought to bed to be breastfed should be returned to a crib when finished. It would be worthwhile for other researchers to reanalyze their previous data to evaluate the consistency of the interaction of young infant age and bedsharing. Large controlled studies that include infants who are identified as dying from SIDS, asphyxia, suffocation, and sudden unexplained infant death, analyzed separately and in combination, are needed to resolve this and other issues involving bedsharing, including the problem of diagnostic drift. Recommendations must be based on solid scientific evidence, which, to date, does not support the rejection of all bedsharing between nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Cribs should be available for those who want to use them. Nonsmoking mothers should not be pressured to abstain from bedsharing with their older infants; they should be provided with accurate, up-to-date scientific information. Infants also should not co-sleep with nonparents. In Oregon, if not elsewhere, the message that smoking mothers should not bedshare is not being disseminated effectively. Because it is not known whether the risk caused by smoking is associated with prenatal smoking, postpartum smoking, or both, bedsharing among either prenatal or postpartum smokers should be strongly discouraged. Much more public and private effort must be made to inform smoking mothers, in culturally competent ways, of the very significant risks of mixing bedsharing and smoking. Public health practitioners need to find new ways to inform mothers and providers that smoking mothers should not bedshare and that putting an infant of a nonsmoking mother to sleep in an adult bed should be delayed until 3 months of age.

TI Cortisol awakening response in pregnant women

DE salivary cortisol; pregnancy; awakening response; circadian rhythm
ID SALIVARY CORTISOL; STRESS; TIME; MEN
AB In this study, basal saliva cortisol was determined in women at 32 weeks of pregnancy and again at 9 months post-partum. During pregnancy, the cortisol levels of the 119 subjects were found to be elevated, with noon and evening levels more than twice as high as during the non-pregnant state. Despite the hypercortisolism, the cortisol awakening response was stilt present during pregnancy. Although the absolute mean increase in cortisol at 30 min post-awakening was larger during pregnancy, the relative mean increase was around 40% of the awakening level in both cases. The cortisol awakening response was not correlated between pregnancy and the post-partum, showing a lack of stability over the 11 month period. Finally, both in the pregnant and non-pregnant states, the magnitude of the cortisol awakening response was not related to time of awakening, nor to anticipation of a working vs. non-working day.
   In conclusion, the free cortisol awakening response is present during pregnancy, and is potentially a useful marker to study the association between prenatal psychosocial stress and offspring development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Although incident snoring is common in pregnant women and has been proposed as a potential risk factor for adverse maternal-fetal outcomes, the development of sleep-disordered breathing during pregnancy has not been prospectively described.
   Methods: Using the Apnea Symptom Score from the Multivariable Apnea Prediction Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, we prospectively assessed symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and daytime somnolence in 155 women to determine whether symptoms increased during pregnancy and the characteristics associated with increasing symptoms.
   Results: We found that sleep-disordered breathing symptoms (Apnea Symptom Score, 0.44 (SEM 0.58) vs 0.95 (0.09, P < .001) and the degree of daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, 8.6 (0.3) vs 10.2 (0.4), P = .0003) increased significantly during pregnancy. Women with higher baseline body mass indexes and greater increases in neck circumference during pregnancy reported higher apnea symptom scores. Of the 155 subjects, 11.4% reported an increase in Apnea Symptom Score of 2 units or more, consistent with a clinically significant increase in symptoms; these women experienced a significantly greater increase in subjective sleepiness than other subjects (P = .03). Excessive daytime somnolence (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) was prevalent throughout pregnancy (31.0%-45.5%).
   Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing increase during pregnancy and that more than 10% of our subjects may be at risk for developing sleep apnea during pregnancy. Excessive daytime somnolence was highly prevalent even early in pregnancy and became increasingly common as pregnancy progressed.

AB The purpose of this article is twofold: (a) to compare psychological distress as measured via self-reported perceived stress, sleep, and fatigue levels in lactating mothers of a term infant and mothers of a preterm infant and (b) to determine whether the addition of psychological distress to a previous model predicts milk volume at Postpartum Week 6 by gestation group. The convenience sample of 95 mothers of a preterm infant (<= 31 weeks) and 98 mothers of a term infant completed the Perceived Stress Visual Analogue Scale, Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire, and the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale. Stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue levels decreased during the 6-week study period for mothers of a term but not for mothers of a preterm infant. Perceived stress, sleep difficulty, and fatigue during the first 6 weeks postpartum were not related to milk volume; thus, the mother's perceived psychological distress had no apparent effect on lactation.

AB Few studies exist that identify a useful self-report measure of physical activity for pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to compare the self-report exercise diary with the pedometer and determine if self-report measurement provided useful physical activity measures during pregnancy. The pregnant women's sleep, parity, and related demographic factors were further analyzed for relationships to the physical activity measures. Physical activity was assessed in a sample of 94 pregnant midwestern U.S. women ages 18 to 38 years. The women wore a pedometer during all waking hours for 3 consecutive days at 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for a total of 6 days. During the same 6 days of monitoring, the women kept a diary account of the minutes they exercised per day. The pedometer and self-report exercise diary results correlated significantly (r = 49, p = .02). When examining for usefulness in measuring physical activity, a comparison of the women's occupational categories revealed no significant differences in self-reported minutes of exercise or pedometer counts per day.

ID BEHAVIORAL STATES; VIBROACOUSTIC STIMULATION; ACOUSTIC STIMULATION;

AB Four behavioural states are recognised in the human fetus and are comparable to those of the neonate: 1 F (quiet sleep), 2F (active state), 3F (quiet awake), and 4F (active awake). State 5, or crying, is not considered to have a fetal correlate. In a stud assessing the effects of exposure to tobacco and cocaine during pregnancy on fetal response and habituation to vibroacoustic stimulation, what appears to be the fetal homologue of crying was observed. These behaviours were seen on ultrasound, and have been captured on video recordings and include: an initial exhalation movement associated with mouth opening and tongue depression, followed by a series of three augmented breaths, the last breath ending in an inspiratory pause followed by an expiration and settling. This is the first report/video documenting these behaviours and suggests the possibility of a state 5F.

AB Background: Postpartum depression is a serious condition for women after childbirth. Although its etiology is unclear, one potentially important predictive variable that has received little attention is maternal sleep deprivation. The objective of this study was to examine relationships among infant sleep patterns, maternal fatigue, and the development of postpartum depression in women with no major depressive symptomatology at 1 week postpartum. Methods: As part of a population-based postpartum depression study, 505 women who had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score < 13 at 1 week postpartum completed questionnaires at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum. Results: Mothers exhibiting major depressive symptomatology (EPDS > 12) at 4 and 8 weeks were significantly more likely to report that their baby cried often, be woken up 3 times or more between 10 PM and 6 Am, have received less than 6 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period over the past week, indicate that their baby did not sleep well, and think that their baby's sleep pattern did not allow them to get a reasonable amount of sleep. Consistent with these findings, mothers with an EPDS score > 12 were significantly more likely to respond that they often felt tired. Conclusions: These results suggest that infant sleep patterns and maternal fatigue are strongly associated with a new onset of depressive symptoms in the postpartum period, and provide support for the development of postpartum depression preventive interventions designed to reduce sleep deprivation in the early weeks postpartum.

AB Factors contributing to maternal sleep when infants are 4 to 10 weeks of age were examined. Twenty-four-hour sleep-wake diaries collected from 37 mother-infant dyads in the home environment were summarized to describe total, longest, and mean sleep period; synchrony of maternal and infant sleep; and feeding frequency and duration. Regression. and post hoc analysis of variance were used to examine factors contributing to maternal and infant sleep. Maternal sleep is driven by infant sleep and feeding pattern. The minimum and maximum numbers of infant sleep episodes per day were 6 and 15, respectively, and mean infant total sleep was 13.47 hours (SD 1.73). Mean maternal total sleep was 7.18 hours (SD 1.51), with half of the mothers reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per 24 hours. Mean number of infant feedings was 11.14 (SD 3.27), with 11 infants (29.7%) receiving 13 or more feedings per 24 hours; minimum and maximum times per feeding were 15 and 41.7 minutes, respectively. Male infants had more sleep episodes, shorter sleep periods, and less sleep than females, and these gender differences resulted in shorter and more fragmented sleep for mothers. Findings suggest there is continued need for interventions to improve maternal sleep following childbearing.

AB Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal smoking, sleeping position, steep state and postnatal age on heart rate changes following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation in infants.
   Subjects: We studied healthy term infants, 13 of whom were born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Each infant was studied using daytime polysomnography on 3 occasions: (a) 2-3 weeks, (b) 2-3 months and (c) 5-6 months after birth. Nasal air-jet stimulation was presented in both active steep (AS) and quiet steep QS) when infants slept both prone and supine.
   Results: We found no difference between infants of smoking and non-smoking mothers in any of the parameters measured. Minimum HR (MinHR) following non-arousing trigeminal stimulation was significantly lower in the supine compared to the prone sleeping position at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months of age (p < 0.05) in AS, and at all 3 ages in QS (p < 0.01). MinHR was significantly tower in QS compared to AS at 2-3 months when infants slept prone and at 5-6 months when sleeping supine (p < 0.01). In QS, MinHR became lower with increasing postnatal age in both steep positions (p < 0.01). In AS, there was no maturational effect. The normalized bradycardia (Delta HR%) was significantly greater in AS than in QS at 2-3 weeks of age (p < 0.05) when infants slept supine.
   Conclusion: Our study has shown that there was a decrease in heart rate (MinHR) following trigeminal stimulation in infants up to 6 months of age and this was affected by steep position and steep state, being larger in the supine sleeping position and the QS state.

AB We report a rare case of type 1 diabetes in a woman associated with acromegaly who was treated with surgery after pregnancy. An 18-year-old woman came to our hospital in April, 1998, complaining of thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, appetite loss, body weight loss of 8 kg in a month, and amenorrhea beginning 2 months earlier. Based on laboratory data, she was diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although we suspected her of having acromegaly because of high growth hormone (GH) levels (6.9 or 8.5 ng/ml), blood levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were within normal range and the circadian rhythm of her blood GH levels was normally maintained. Her blood GH level was elevated to 12.6 ng/ml 15 minutes after a TRH administration. Blood GH levels were suppressed from 49 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml 4 hours after an oral administration of 2.5 mg of bromocriptine. A magnetic resonance images (MRIs) showed pituitary swelling, but no nodules were found in the pituitary. Therefore, we diagnosed her as having acromegaly and observed her without surgery, while prescribing diet therapy and intensive insulin therapy for diabetes. We started a treatment of oral administration of 7.5 mg of bromocriptine per day for the acromegaly from April 28, 2000, because her elevated GH was suspected of causing her diabetes to be poorly controlled. During a pregnancy from October, 2000 to September, 2001, diabetic control was improved with increased administration of insulin under a constant dose of bromocriptine. She delivered a normal full-term infant. After the bromocriptine therapy was stopped as she hoped to breastfeed, blood levels of GH and IGF-1 became elevated and her diabetic control deteriorated. As her pituitary tumor observed in pituitary MRIs became larger during the course, a transsphenoidal surgery was performed on March 8, 2002. After the surgery, blood levels of GH and IGF-1 lowered and diabetic control improved again. We concluded as follows: to rule out acromegaly in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, 1) measurements of serum GH and IGF-1 should be performed, and 2) pituitary MRIs should be performed if blood levels of GH or IGF-1 are high.

AB Objective: To investigate whether assisted conception is associated with an increased risk of admission to a residential early parenting program for treatment of maternal mood disorder or infant feeding or sleeping disordors in the postpartum year.
   Design: Systematic audit of consecutive medical records.
   Setting: Masada Private Hospital Mother Baby Unit (MPHMBU), Melbourne, Australia.
   Patient(s): Medical records of all mother-infant dyads admitted to MPHMBU between July 2000 and August 2002.
   Intervention(s): None
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Modes of conception and delivery of index infant, maternal and infant age on admission, multiplicity of birth, infant birth weight, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores.
   Result(s): A total of 745 records were audied, and mode of conception was recorded in 526 (70.6%) of records. Overall 6% (45/745) of the admitted infants had been conceived through assisted reproductive technologies compared with 1.52% in the general population (relative risk 4.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.0 - 5.4). Mothers who had conceived with assisted reproductive technologies were older and more likely to have had cesarean and multiple births than those who conceived spontaneously.
   Conclusion: Assisted conception appears to be associated with a significantly increased rate of early parenting difficulties. Women who experience assisted conception may require additional support before and after their babies are born.

AB The two principal challenges of neonatal physiologic monitoring device are: (1) the development of computational strategies that consider the rudimentary forms of neonatal sleep state especially for preterm infants and (2) any physiologic monitoring device for clinical applications in a neonatal intensive care setting must be small, portable, and user-friendly. Our multicenter neonatal sleep consortium has acquired more than 1,100 multihour EEG-sleep recordings on over 370 neonates, ranging from 24 to 44 weeks gestation. Each recording was visually-scored for state, arousals, movements, and rapid eye movements, which were used as templates when applying spectral analyses. The authors have defined a brain dysmaturity index to represent functional brain reorganization as the prenate matures to a full-term age; delayed or accelerated physiologic behaviors have been described for the preterm cohort when compared to the full-term group at the same postmenstrual age. Seven EEG-sleep measures comprise this index: quiet sleep percentage, sleep cycle length, rapid eye movements, arousals, spectral beta EEG energies, spectral EEG correlations, and a spectral measure of respiratory regularity. Linear and nonlinear computational algorithms are being developed to automate the computation of the dysmaturity index and to identify new feature types that correlate with dysmaturity. Automated neonatal sleep monitoring system can potentially improve neonatal neurointensive care by facilitating analyses of pervasive neonatal brain disorders expressed primarily as altered sleep state organization, and help predict altered developmental trajectories of children at higher risk for neurologic sequelae.

AB The restless legs syndrome is a common disorder that encompasses an idiopathic form of genetic or unknown origin and symptomatic forms associated with many causes. Symptomatic forms occur during pregnancy and are coincident with uraemia, iron depletion, polyneuropathy, spinal disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis. For the hereditary forms, at least three gene loci, located on chromosomes 12, 14, and 9, have been traced so far. Prevalence in the general population is between 3% and 9%, increases with age, and is higher in women than in men. Treatment is needed only in the moderate to severe forms of the disorder and mostly in elderly people. Pathophysiology and treatment may be closely linked to the dopaminergic system and iron metabolism. Dopaminergic treatment with levodopa and dopamine agonists is the first choice in idiopathic restless legs syndrome, but augmentation and rebound should be monitored in long-term treatment. Various other drugs, such as opioids, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines, provide alternative treatment possibilities.

AB Pregnancy and the postpartum period are recognized as times of vulnerability to mood disorders, including postpartum depression and psychosis. Recently, changes in sleep physiology and sleep deprivation have been proposed as having roles in perinatal psychiatric disorders. In this article we review what is known about changes in sleep physiology and behaviour during the perinatal period, with a focus on the relations between sleep and postpartum "blues," depression and psychosis and on sleep-based interventions for the treatment and prevention of perinatal mood disorders. The interaction between sleep and perinatal mood disorders is significant, but evidence-based research in this field is limited. Studies that measure both sleep and mood during the perinatal period, particularly those that employ objective measurement tools such as polysomnography and actigraphy, will provide important information about the causes, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to describe factors associated with actigraphic and subjective sleep quality in young women. Methods: Participants were 73 regularly menstruating women, 20-40 years old, who were not taking oral contraceptives, pregnant, or shift workers. Women contributed an average of 7 nights of actigraphy data during the luteal menstrual cycle phase, resulting in a total of 595 nights of data. Results: One night of actigraphy data was unreliable for measuring total sleep time, sleep onset, and time in bed (intraclass correlation 5.15) but was acceptable for measuring sleep efficiency and total wake time (intraclass correlation [ICC]=.52). Going to bed late, medication use, employment, increased daylight hours, longer menstrual cycle length, and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with poorer actigraphic sleep measures. Employment, age, and perceived stress were associated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusion: Multiple factors were associated with sleep quality in these young women who were sleeping at home. However, the associations differed for subjectively versus actigraphically assessed sleep quality. Actigraphy is feasible for measuring sleep, but multiple recording nights may be needed to obtain reliable estimates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: Depression during pregnancy is frequently treated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine (FX), commonly known as Prozac (Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN). FX potentiates serotoninergic neurotransmission and serotonin has been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms. We have therefore investigated the effect of chronic administration of FX on maternal and fetal circadian rhythms in sheep.
   METHODS: Following an initial bolus dose of 70 mg FX, an 8-day continuous infusion of FX (n = 11, 98.5 mu g/kg (.) d) was performed. Controls (n = 13) were treated with sterile water vehicle only. Maternal and fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations were determined every 3 hours for 24 hours and then every 6 hours for 24 hours beginning on the fourth day of infusion.
   RESULTS: FX treatment did not alter either the basal or circadian rhythms of either maternal or fetal plasma melatonin and prolactin concentrations. Fetal cardiovascular and behavioral state parameters were measured continuously. While the incidence of low-voltage (LV) electrocortical (ECOG) activity was significantly reduced in fetuses in the FX group, there was no effect of FX on the diurnal rhythms in fetal arterial pressure, heart rate, breathing movements, or behavioral state.
   CONCLUSION: These results show that maternal FX treatment does not result in significant alterations in maternal and fetal hormonal and behavioral circadian rhythms. (J Soc Gynecol Investig 2005;12: 356-64) Copyright (c) 2005 by the Society for Gynecologic lnvestigation.

AB Maternal prenatal stress has been found to be related to over-activity and/or dysregulation of the HPA-system in the offspring. These effects are more readily apparent in response to novel situations. The aim of the present report was to examine whether pregnancy stress predicted HPA-axis reactions of children to the first day of school after the summer break. Children of mothers with more prenatal stress were compared to those of mothers with less stress. Habituation was studied by comparisons between the first school day and a second school day a week later. Finally, cortisol levels at school were compared to those of a weekend day. The participants were 29 mother-child pairs (20 girls and nine boys, mean age 5.31 years, SD=0.50). The children's cortisol levels were determined in saliva. Multilevel analysis (hierarchical linear modelling) was used to analyze the data. Both prenatal cortisol and pregnancy anxiety were related to the children's cortisol levels as a reaction to the first school day. Children whose mothers had higher levels of morning cortisol during pregnancy, and more fear of bearing a handicapped child showed higher levels of cortisol on school days. In addition, the circadian rhythm of cortisol on school days appeared to have a steeper slope as compared to that of the circadian curve on a weekend day. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of pregnant women towards malaria and their association with malaria morbidity.
   METHODS Cross-sectional malaria survey of 1432 pregnant women attending six health centres, each of them situated in a specific health district in Rwanda from September to October 2002.
   RESULTS The overall prevalence of malaria infection was 13.6% and all infections but two were caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The six health districts were significantly different in terms of malaria prevalence, which varied between 11.5% and 15.4% in four and was < 5% in the other two districts. The prevalence of anaemia and splenomegaly mirrored that of malaria infection. In three districts, the prevalence of infection was significantly higher in primigravidae than in secundigravidae and multigravidae (P = 0.01), while in two others it did not vary with parity. Bed net use was low - only 13.1% of the women had at least one bed net at home and 8.3% of them slept under it - and significantly different between districts. Most women knew that malaria might have serious consequences for their pregnancy and that insecticide-treated bed nets are useful for malaria prevention. However, the bed net market price [1525 Rwandan Francs (RFr), approximately 1.6e] was much higher than that considered as affordable and acceptable (389 RFr, approximately 0.3e).
   CONCLUSION Malaria in pregnancy is a major problem in Rwanda, even in the districts of low transmission. Bed net use among pregnant women is low. The option of providing free insecticide-treated bed nets to pregnant women should be explored and possibly implemented; it could rapidly increase bed net use and earlier attendance to antenatal clinics with clear benefits for the women's health.

AB Background: The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been falling in Germany over the last decade. However, little is known about the prevalence and the importance of well-known risk factors in Germany since a local prevention campaign in 1992. Design: A 3-y, population-based, case-control study was conducted in half of Germany, consisting of 333 cases. All sudden and unexpected deaths in infancy, if they fitted the inclusion criteria, were included in the study. Parental interview was carried out soon after the death, and three living control infants, matched for age, gender, region and sleep time, were recruited. Results: The prevalence of placing infants prone to sleep was only 4% in the control group, but this was associated with a markedly increased risk of SIDS (adjusted odds ration, aOR=6.08). Other modifiable risk factors for SIDS were: maternal smoking during pregnancy, breastfeeding for less than 2 wk (aOR=1.71) and co-sleeping (aOR=2.71), while using a pacifier during the last sleep reduced the risk (aOR=0.39).
   Conclusions: Previously recognized risk factors for SIDS also occur in Germany. Despite knowledge about the major modifiable risk factors for SIDS, these factors are still present in Germany. To reduce the incidence of SIDS in Germany, a continued effort is needed to inform all parents about preventable risk factors for SIDS.

AB The initial diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in the United States was made because of the facial features common to the first cohort of patients. This article reviews the development of an FAS mouse model whose craniofacial features are remarkably similar to those of affected humans. The model is based on short-term maternal treatment with a high dosage of ethanol at stages of pregnancy that are equivalent to Weeks 3 and 4 of human gestation. At these early stages of development, alcohol's insult to the developing face is concurrent with that to the brain, eyes, and inner ear. That facial and central nervous system defects consistent with FAS can be induced by more "realistic" alcohol dosages as illustrated with data from an oral alcohol intake mouse model in which maternal blood alcohol levels do not exceed 200 mg/dl. The ethanol-induced pathogenesis involves apoptosis that occurs within 12 hrs of alcohol exposure in selected cell populations of Day 7, 8, and 9 mouse embryos. Experimental evidence from other species also shows that apoptosis underlies ethanol-induced malformations. With knowledge of sensitive and resistant cell populations at specific developmental stages, studies designed to identify the basis for these differing cellular responses and, therefore, to determine the primary mechanisms of ethanol's teratogenesis are possible. For example, microarray comparisons of sensitive and resistant embryonic cell populations have been made, as have in situ studies of gene expression patterns in the populations of interest. Studies that illustrate agents that are effective in diminishing or exacerbating ethanol's teratogenesis have also been helpful in determining mechanisms. Among these agents are antioxidants, sonic hedgehog protein, retinoids, and the peptides SAL and NAP.

AB Eighty pregnant women were assessed for depression during mid-pregnancy (Mean gestational age = 25.9 weeks) and shortly after delivery in order to assess the effects of the onset and chronicity of maternal depression on neonatal behavior. The women were classified as reporting depressive symptoms: (1) only during the prepartum assessment; (2) only during the postpartum assessment; (3) during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments; or (4) reporting no depressive symptoms at either the prepartum or the postpartum assessment. Neonates born to mothers reporting symptoms of depression at any time point exhibited greater indeterminate sleep than neonates of non-depressed mothers. Neonates born to mothers reporting prenatal depression spent more time fussing and crying and exhibited more stress behaviors than neonates born to non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression only during the postpartum assessment. Finally, neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments exhibited less optimal Brazelton neurobehavioral assessment scores than neonates of non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers who exhibited symptoms of depression during only the prepartum or only during the postpartum assessments. Taken together these findings suggest that neonatal behavior is influenced not just by the presence but also by the timing and duration of maternal depression symptoms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Evaluation of risk factors and short-term outcomes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are essential to identify infants in need of developmental intervention after discharge. This study examined risk factors with the potential to affect short-term neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes in preterm infants born at &LT; 31 weeks gestation. Data were obtained in a larger longitudinal randomized study of the effects of cycled light and continuous near darkness on health. Severity of neurological insults and caffeine use predicted poorer neurobehavioral outcomes; and severity of neurological insults, caffeine use, length of hospitalization and ventilator days were associated with altered sleep-wake state organization. There were no significant effects of environmental lighting on the short-term developmental outcomes of preterm infants. Early knowledge of an infant's neurobehavioral and sleep outcomes can provide families and health care providers with important information to target the utilization of early intervention services. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB A few cases of death worldwide during GH treatment in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been recently described. The evaluation of further cases is needed to better identify possible causal mechanism(s), as well as to suggest some additional guidelines for prevention. We report the death of 2 additional children with genetically confirmed PWS in the first months of GH therapy. Case 1: This 3.9-yr-old girl was born at 39 weeks gestation. Low GH response to two stimulation tests was observed. GH administration was started at the age of 3.5 yr (0.33 mg/kg per week), when the patient was at 130% of her ideal body weight (ibw). Hypertrophy of adenoids was previously demonstrated. Snoring and sleep apnea were present before GH treatment, and did not increase during therapy. Four months later she died at home suddenly in the morning. Case 2: This patient was a 6.3-yr-old boy. He was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. At the age of 6 yr, his weight was at 144% of his ibw. He showed reduced GH secretion during provocation tests, and GH therapy was started (0.20 mg/kg per week). The previously reported nocturnal respiratory impairment had worsened after beginning GH administration. Tonsils and adenoids hypertrophy were noted. At the age of 6.3 yr he died at home in the morning following an acute crisis of apnea. These additional cases seem to confirm that some children with PWS may be at risk of sudden death at the beginning of GH therapy. (C) 2005, Editrice Jurtis

AB Objectives: Reduction of prone infant sleep position has been the main public health effort to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Methods: Oregon Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) surveys a stratified random sample of women after a live birth. In 1998-1999, 1867 women completed the survey (64.0% unweighted response; 73.5% weighted response). Results: Overall, 9.2% of all women "usually" chose prone infant sleep position, while 24.2% chose side and 66.5% chose supine position. Women receiving care from private physicians or HMOs more often chose prone position (10.6%) than women receiving prenatal care from health department clinics (2.5%), hospital clinics (6.1 %) or other sites (8.3 %). Compared to health department prenatal clinic patients, private prenatal patients were more likely to choose prone infant sleep position, adjusted odds ratio = 4.78 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64-13.92). Conclusions: Health Department clinics have done a better job than private physicians in educating mothers about putting infants to sleep on their backs. Providers-especially private providers-should continue to stress the importance of supine sleep position for infants.

AB Evidence is accumulating for significant structural and functional changes within the central nervous system (CNS) following prenatal protein malnutrition. Included among the structures that are likely to be affected are the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) involved in the regulation of locomotor activity, sleep-wake cycle, and drinking behavior. To determine the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on the spontaneous activity rhythm, 24 h radiotelemetric measurements were recorded over an 8-day period. Male offspring of rats provided with protein-deficient (6% casein) or adequate (25% casein) diets for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy were studied. Well nourished rats displayed a rise in activity level during the first hour of the 12h light phase, whereas prenatally malnourished rats displayed this increase during the 12h dark phase, approximately 50 min before lights on, reflecting a significant phase advance in this group. In addition, cosinor analysis revealed that the alpha/rho relationship was affected in the previously malnourished group, the activity phase being shorter than in the well-nourished animals. These findings suggest changes in the regulatory systems controlling the locomotor activity rhythm as a consequence of prenatal protein malnutrition. Alterations in entrainment to the light-dark cycle, and/or in the coupling force of the circadian oscillators are all candidate mechanisms.

AB Study Objective: Changes in sleep-disordered breathing associated with late pregnancy have not previously been systematically investigated; however, a number of case reports indicate exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea in late pregnancy, often in association with maternal hypertension. We aimed to compare the severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated maternal blood-pressure responses in late pregnancy with the nonpregnant state.
   Design: Case-controlled, longitudinal study of sleep-disordered breathing during late pregnancy and postpartum.
   Study Patients: Ten women referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing during the third trimester of pregnancy.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Results: Full overnight polysomnography and continuous systemic blood pressure were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy and 3 months following delivery. Parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, including apnea hypopnea index and minimum overnight arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, were compared between antenatal and postnatal studies. An improvement in both apnea-hypopnea index and minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation occurred consistently in all subjects postnatally. In non-rapid eye movement sleep, mean apnea-hypopnea index was reduced from 63 +/- 15 per hour antenatally to 18 +/- 4 per hour postnatally (P =.03), and in rapid eye movement sleep, from 64 +/- 11 per hour to 22 +/- 4 per hour (P =.002). Minimum arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was increased from 86% +/- 2% antenatally to 91% +/- 1 % postnatally (P =.01). Arterial blood-pressure responses to apnea peaked at 170 to 180 mm Hg antenatally, while they only peaked at 130 to 140 mm Hg postnatally.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that late pregnancy may be associated with increased severity of sleep-disordered breathing and associated blood-pressure responses.

Information on its normal ontogenetic associations is therefore crucial for understanding human speech evolution as well as the developmental etiology of speech abnormalities. Of particular interest to evolutionary morphologists is the proposed structural association between the upper airway and the cranial base. The present study aims to elucidate whether cranial base angulation is linked to growth of the upper air-way during human fetal life. Forty postmortem human fetuses ranging from 10 to 29 weeks of gestation were imaged with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Measurements of basicranial angle, hyoid depth, hormion height, and pharyngeal area were taken from sagittal images. Results show a significant correlation between the internal and external basicranial angles but the correlation between relative hyoid depth and internal cranial base angle was not significant. Findings show a significant correlation between increases in the size of the oropharynx relative to the nasopharynx and increases in the internal cranial base angle (retroflexion). These findings give limited support (r(rank) = 0.46; P < 0.01) for the hypothesis that restructuring of the upper airway underlies basicranial retroflexion during prenatal life.

AB Objective: To examine how sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms of Japanese parents are related to their sleeping arrangements before and after the birth of their first child.
   Design: Prospective longitudinal, time-series methods.
   Setting: Participants' homes in four geographical areas of Japan.
   Participants: Convenience sample of 101 Japanese first-time parent couples who completed antepartum and postpartum questionnaires.
   Main Outcome Measures: 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm from 7-day logs at 32 to 36 weeks gestation and 4 to 5 weeks postpartum and daily social rhythm from Monk's Social Rhythm Metric.
   Results: Mothers' total sleep time and activity level decreased after birth. Social rhythms became less regular for mothers and more consistent and regular for fathers. Although sleeping arrangement had no effect on parents' daily social rhythms, it had a significant effect on the 24-hr sleep-wake rhythm. Regularity of sleep-wake rhythms was more prominent for fathers sleeping with mother and baby than for fathers sleeping alone.
   Conclusions: Couples having their first child face great changes in their sleep-wake cycles and social rhythms. Nurses can counsel expectant parents to think about their sleeping habits and social activities and assist them in making informed decisions about the best sleeping arrangement during transition to parenthood.

AB Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is known to be low in newborn infants, but this has not been shown to be damaging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between cerebral haernoglobin flow, blood flow, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption, venous saturation, and fractional oxygen extraction (OEF) in newborn, preterm infants. Measurements were made by near-infrared spectroscopy in 13 very preterm, extremely low birth weight infants (median gestation 25 weeks) during the first 3 days after birth. There was a negative correlation between cerebral oxygen delivery and OEF (n = 13, r= -0.5, P= 0.03), which implies that when there is a reduction in cerebral oxygen delivery in sick preterm infants, increased cerebral oxygen extraction may be responsible for maintaining oxygen availability to the brain. During the first 3 days after birth CBF (n = 13, r = 0.7, P= 0.01), oxygen delivery (n= 13, r= 0.5, P= 0.03), and oxygen consumption (n= 13, r= 0.7, P= 0.004) all increased. This increase in oxygen consumption indicates increased cerebral metabolic activity after birth, which is likely to be a normal adaptation to extrauterine life. The increases in blood flow and oxygen delivery may also be normal adaptations that facilitate this increase in metabolic activity. There was a decrease (P=0.04) in mean (+/- s.d.)cerebral OEF between day 1 (0.37 +/- 0.10) and day 2 (0.29 +/- 0.09), with no change between day 2 and day 3. Taking into account the negative correlation between OEF and oxygen delivery, this decrease in OEF may be because of increased oxygen delivery during this time.

AB Antenatal betamethasone administration to enhance fetal lung maturation is associated with transient reductions in fetal heart rate (FHR) variation, breathing, and body movements 2 d after the first dose (d 2). This study examines whether steroid administration affects the natural diurnal rhythms of fetal variables. Sixteen women at 27-32 wk of gestation received two doses of betamethasone 24 h apart. One-hour recordings of FHR, breathing, and body movements were made in the morning, afternoon, and evening of d 2, and again in the morning of d 3. Repeat recordings were obtained at 4-6 d later from 9/16 women. Maternal blood samples were obtained with each recording to determine ACTH and cortisol. No diurnal rhythm was present for FHR, FHR variation, breathing, and body movements on d 2. This resulted from suppression of the expected natural rise in body and breathing movements, and heart rate variation in the course of the day. Suppression of the diurnal rhythm of body movements depended on gestation (R = -0.89; p < 0.01). All variables showed diurnal rhythms 4-6 d later. Maternal ACTH and cortisol diurnal rhythms were completely suppressed on d 2. Four to six days later, the normal diurnal pattern was resumed, although absolute levels of ACTH and cortisol were still suppressed. We conclude that maternal betamethasone administration transiently abolishes the fetal diurnal rhythms of heart rate and its variation, breathing, and body movements.

AB A descriptive, correlational design was used to examine the associations of sleep quality and stage of illness with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HIV-infected African-American women. Participants were recruited from 12 health clinics and AIDS service organizations (ASO) in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The sample consisted of 144 African-American women who ranged in age from 20 to 48 years ( m = 34.8, SD = 6.8). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. Participants were categorized as good sleepers ( PSQI global score < 7) or poor sleepers ( PSQI global score &GE; 7) using the median global sleep quality score. Differences in HRQOL between good and poor sleepers, as measured by the SF-36, were tested using MANOVA. Good sleepers scored significantly higher ( p < 0.0001) for each SF-36 quality of life dimension and the mental and physical health summary scores. Multiple regression analysis indicated that sleep quality is associated with HRQOL, independent of the individual's stage of illness, more so with mental HRQOL than with physical HRQOL. The results suggest that treatment for poor sleep quality should be a primary concern for the treatment of HIV infection and a means for improving HRQOL.

AB Previous studies demonstrated that stimulant drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamine, administered during gestation or lactation may attenuate maternal behavior in rats. The effect of methamphetamine (MA), a drug whose usage has increased lately, on maternal behavior has not yet been investigated. The present study tested the effect of MA (5 mg/kg daily) administered prior to, during and after gestation on maternal behavior. Regularity of the estrous cycle, the incidence of impregnation, and the weight gain was compared between groups (control, saline- and MA-treated). Maternal behavior was examined using two tests: Observation test (without disturbance of the mother and pups) and Retrieval test (with short separation of pups from the mother). All tests were conducted prior to dosing each day. In the Observation test. MA decreased the blanket position of active nursing, while increasing passive nursing. There were no MA-induced changes in other maternal activities such as mother being in the nest, in contact with pups, or grooming pups. MA increased some non-maternal activities, such as drinking. eating, and sleeping, while decreasing stereotypic behavior (sniffing and rearing) when compared to controls. In the Retrieval test. MA-treated mothers were slower in retrieving the first pup, returning the first pup into the nest, and returning all pups into the nest. Interestingly, there were differences in maternal behavior also in saline-treated mothers relative to controls. Saline-treated mothers spent more time in the nest and groomed pups more than controls or MA-treated mothers. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates a novel finding that MA administered during pre-mating, gestational and lactational periods has a negative effect on maternal behavior toward pups.

AB Objective: To study the association between birth characteristics and the recurrence of otitis media with effusion (OME).
   Methods: Prospective cohort study on 136 children aged 2-7 years, who received tympanostomy tubes for bilateral otitis media with effusion. Checkups were planned 1 week after tube insertion and once every 3 months thereafter. An otologist examined the ear status to assess tube extrusion and otitis media with effusion recurrence. Outcome measure was the recurrence of otitis media with effusion within 6 months after documentation of spontaneous tube extrusion. Birth characteristics were investigated in relation with the recurrence of otitis media with effusion in 90 children with known clinical outcome.
   Results: No statistically significant associations were found between various birth characteristics and the recurrence of otitis media with effusion. Multivariate analyses showed positive but fairly weak associations between recurrence of otitis media with effusion and low birth weight (< 2500 g) and/or low gestational age (< 37 weeks) and/or a history of incubator care (odds ratio (OR) 1.95, 95% confidence interval (Cl): 0.21-18.2), mate sex (OR 1.85, 95% Cl: 0.56-6.13) and maternal medication use during pregnancy (OR 4.80, 95% Cl: 0.57-40.72). A remarkable finding was the asymmetrical distribution of certain birth characteristics within the group of children with recurrence of otitis media with effusion: children with unilateral recurrence had a relatively lower gestational age, lower birth weight, lower 'birth length to birth weight' ratio than the children with bilateral recurrence.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that determination of birth characteristics cannot help us in the treatment strategy for recurrent otitis media with effusion in childhood. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The release of activin A in response to intravenous injection of the bacterial cell-wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was investigated in an ovine model of acute inflammatory challenge in newborn and adult sheep, and in non-pregnant and pregnant ewes. Neonatal lambs (<20 days of age) showed a quantitatively similar response in terms of circulating concentrations of activin A, its binding protein follistatin and the cytokine interleukin-6 compared with adult ewes challenged with an equivalent dose (300 ng/kg bodyweight) of LPS. The fever response and plasma tumour necrosis factor-a release in response to LPS, however, were significantly (P<0.01) less in lambs than in the adult group. Pregnant ewes in the last trimester of gestation had similar responses to LPS, in all aspects measured, compared with their non-pregnant counterparts, apart from an ablated fever response. Although the adult and neonatal sheep responded to LPS, a similar response was not apparent in the fetal circulation, possibly due to a protective effect of the placenta. A 10-fold increase in the dose of LPS (from 300 ng to 3 mu g/kg bodyweight) given to neonatal lambs elicited an increase in several cytokine responses measured, with a significant (P<0.05) increase in follistatin release. In contrast, the amount of activin released by the increased dose of LPS was similar to that invoked by the lower dose. The effect of tolerance to LPS was investigated by giving a second challenge of LPS 5 days after the initial injection. In all animals studied, there was an ablated (P<0.05) response to the subsequent LPS injection, apart from a similar temperature-response profile. These data provide further evidence that activin A concentrations in the bloodstream are acutely responsive to inflammatory challenge in postnatal life and suggest that the response forms a significant component of the innate immune system.

AB Withdrawal symptoms are encountered with both the classical antidepressants, i.e. the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamineoxidase inhibitors, the modern antidepressants, i.e. the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, and the new antidepressants such as venlafaxine and mirtazapine.
   The symptoms that are reported following the withdrawal of these drugs can be classified into 8 groups: influenza-like symptoms, psychic symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disorders, equilibrium disorders, sensory disturbances, extrapyramidal symptoms and other symptoms.
   It is characteristic of these symptoms that they appear 1-4 days after reduction of the dose or the last administration of the drug. They may also appear in the infants of mothers who used an antidepressant during the last phase of the pregnancy. It is important that the patient be informed accurately and carefully at the start and termination of any treatment with an antidepressant.
   In order to prevent withdrawal symptoms, it is advisable to reduce the dosage slowly if possible when the treatment is to be terminated.

AB We investigated the role played by beta 2-containing neuronal nicotinic receptors [nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)] in mediating nicotine's side effects in the fetus and newborn. Pregnant WT and mutant mice lacking the 132 nAChR subunit were implanted with osmotic minipumps that delivered either water or a controlled dose of nicotine. Subsequently, we compared the development of the sympathoadrenal system and breathing and arousal reflexes of offspring shortly after birth, a period of increased vulnerability to nicotine exposure. Newborn WT pups exposed to nicotine exhibited all of the deficits associated with maternal tobacco and nicotine use, and linked to poor neonatal outcome: growth restriction, unstable breathing, and impaired arousal and catecholamine biosynthesis. Remarkably similar deficits were detected in pups lacking beta 2-containing nAChRs. Loss-of-function of these nAChRs consequently reproduces with astonishing fidelity many of the abnormalities caused by perinatal nicotine exposure. We propose that the underlying mechanisms of nicotine's detrimental side effects on a range of crucial defensive reflexes involve loss of function of nAChR subtypes, possibly via activity-dependent desensitization.

DT Article
ID SUDDEN-INFANT-DEATH; NEAR-MISS; APNEA; SIDS; POSITION; RISK
AB Aims: To investigate the epidemiology and risk factors of apparent life threatening events (ALTE).
   Methods: A prospective study enrolled all live-born infants in the Tyrol (1993-2001). Information on pregnancy, sociodemographic characteristics, child care practices, and infant's behaviour in the first four to six weeks of life was collected with a standardised questionnaire, and was available for,44 184 infants. ALTE was identified from hospital admission records.
   Results: During the study period 164 ALTE cases were identified, corresponding to an incidence of 2.46/ 1000 live births. In 73 of these infants no cause for the event and no comorbidity could be found (idiopathic ALTE). On average ALTE manifested ten weeks earlier than SIDS. Of various SIDS risk factors in the survey area, the prone sleeping position, smoking during pregnancy, low gestational age, profuse night sweating, and family history of infant death showed a moderate relation to the risk of overall ALTE, but only smoking maintained significance in the multivariate risk model. None of these variables was associated with idiopathic ALTE. In contrast to SIDS the frequency of ALTE did not change during the study period. None of the ALTE infants experienced SIDS later in life. Behavioural abnormalities such as feeding difficulties, episodes of pallor, cyanotic episodes, and repeated apnoea episodes were strongly associated with an increased risk of overall and idiopathic ALTE.
   Conclusions: Although there are some similarities in the clinical presentation and epidemiology of SIDS and ALTE, differences clearly predominate. Accordingly, ALTE and SIDS should not be considered different manifestations of the some disease process.

AB Continuous EEG monitoring has not been used widely in neonatal intensive care, especially in the care of extremely premature infants, probably in part because of a lack of a reliable quantitative method. The purpose of this study was to quantify the EEG of the very premature infants just after birth by using spectral analysis and to describe the characteristics of the spectral signal when infants were clinically stable. Digital EEG recordings were performed on 53 infants who were less than or equal to 30 wk gestation for 75 min each day during the first 4 d after birth. Artefact was rejected manually after visual inspection of trace. The EEG was analyzed by manual measurement of interburst interval and automatically by spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transformation. Spectral analysis generated the normal ranges of the relative power of the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-12.5 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands, spectral edge frequency, and symmetry. The median (range) relative power of the delta bamd increased significantly from 68% (62-76%) on day 1 to 81% (72-89%) on day 4 (p = 0.001). The interburst intervals became progressively shorter between days 1 [14s (10-25)] and 3 [8s (6-12)]; there were no significant differences between days 3 and 4. The relative power of the delta band seemed to be the most useful and repeatable spectral measurement for continuous long-term monitoring. However, automatic artefact rejection software needs to be developed before continuous quantitative EEG monitoring can be used in the neonatal intensive care environment.

TI Changing conclusions on secondhand smoke in a sudden infant death
   syndrome review funded by the tobacco industry
SO PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Review
DE secondhand smoke; tobacco industry; sudden infant death syndrome
ID PARENTAL SMOKING; LUNG-CANCER; RISK; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; PREGNANCY;
   SCIENCE; SIDS
AB Background. Prenatal and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke adversely affects maternal and child health. Secondhand smoke (SHS) has been linked causally with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in major health reports. In 1992, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first noted an association between SHS and SIDS, and both prenatal exposure and postnatal SHS exposure were listed as independent risk factors for SIDS in a 1997 California EPA report (republished in 1999 by the National Cancer Institute) and a 2004 US Surgeon General report.
   The tobacco industry has used scientific consultants to attack the evidence that SHS causes disease, most often lung cancer. Little is known about the industry's strategies to contest the evidence on maternal and child health. In 2001, a review was published on SIDS that acknowledged funding from the Philip Morris (PM) tobacco company. Tobacco industry documents related to this review were examined to identify the company's influence on the content and conclusions of this review.
   Methods. Tobacco industry documents include 40 million pages of internal memos and reports made available to the public as a result of litigation settlements against the tobacco industry in the United States. Between November 2003 and January 2004, we searched tobacco industry document Internet sites from the University of California Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and the Tobacco Documents Online website. Key terms included "SIDS" and names of key persons. Two authors conducted independent searches with similar key terms, reviewed the documents, and agreed on relevancy through consensus. Thirty documents were identified as relevant. Two drafts (an early version and a final version) of an industry-funded review article on SIDS were identified, and 2 authors independently compared these drafts with the final publication. Formal comments by PM executives made in response to the first draft were also reviewed. We used Science Citation Index in July 2004 to determine citation patterns for the referenced SIDS reviews.
   Results. PM executives feared that SHS and maternal and child health issues would create a powerful and emotional impetus for smoke-free areas in the home, public areas, and the workplace. In response to the 1992 US EPA report on SHS, the Science and Technology Department of PM's Switzerland subsidiary, Fabriques de Tabac Reunies, searched for "independent" consultants to publish articles addressing SHS. The first industry-funded article was a literature review focusing on smoking and SIDS, conducted by consultant Peter Lee and co-author Allison Thornton, which stated that the association between parental smoking and SIDS could have been attributable to the failure to control fully for confounders. That first review has only been cited once, in the subsequent industry-funded review.
   In 1997, PM commissioned a consultant, Frank Sullivan, to write a review, with coauthor Susan Barlow, of all possible risk factors for SIDS. The first draft concluded that prenatal and postnatal smoking exposures are both independent risk factors for SIDS. After receiving comments and meeting with PM scientific executives, Sullivan changed his original conclusions on smoking and SIDS. The final draft was changed to emphasize the effects of prenatal maternal smoking and to conclude that postnatal SHS effects were "less well established." Changes in the draft to support this new conclusion included descriptions of Peter Lee's industry-funded review, a 1999 negative but underpowered study of SIDS risk and urinary cotinine levels, and criticisms of the conclusions of the National Cancer Institute report that SHS was causally associated with SIDS. In April 2001, the Sullivan review was published in the United Kingdom journal Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, with a disclosure statement that acknowledged financial support from PM but did not acknowledge contributions from PM executives in the preparation of the review. By 2004, the Sullivan SIDS review had been cited at least 19 times in the medical literature.
   Conclusions. PM executives responded to corporate concerns about the possible adverse effects of SHS on maternal and child health by commissioning consultants to write review articles for publication in the medical literature. PM executives successfully encouraged one author to change his original conclusion that SHS is an independent risk factor for SIDS to state that the role of SHS is "less well established." These statements are consistent with PM's corporate position that active smoking causes disease but only public health officials conclude the same for SHS. The author's disclosure of industry funding did not reveal the full extent of PM's involvement in shaping the content of the article. This analysis suggests that accepting tobacco industry funds can disrupt the integrity of the scientific process. The background of this SIDS review is relevant for institutions engaged in the debate about accepting or eschewing funding from the tobacco industry. Those who support acceptance of tobacco industry funds argue that academic authors retain the right to publish their work and maintain final approval of the written product, but this argument fails to recognize that the tobacco industry funds work to ensure that messages favorable to the industry are published and disseminated.
   Clinicians, parents, and public health officials are most vulnerable to the changed conclusions of the SIDS review. The national SIDS "Back to Sleep" campaign has been very successful in reducing SIDS rates. However, estimates of SIDS risk from SHS (odds ratios range from 1.4 to 5.1) have considerable overlap with estimates of risk from prone sleep positioning (odds ratios range from 1.7 to 12.9). With the Back to Sleep campaign well underway, efforts to address parental smoking behavior in both the prenatal and postnatal periods should be intensified. The tobacco industry's disinformation campaign on SHS and maternal and child health can be counteracted within clinicians' offices.

AB Background and purpose: To examine whether snoring and sleepiness are linked in pregnancy and pre-eclampsia.
   Patients and methods: We recruited 167 healthy and 82 pre-eclamptic women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 160 non-pregnant women. Subjects and their partners completed a sleep questionnaire. Height, weight, neck circumferences and blood pressure were recorded for all.
   Results: Pregnant and pre-eclamptic women were (mean +/- SD) 36 +/- 3.6 and 36 +/- 3 weeks pregnant, respectively. Age and height did not differ significantly between groups (P > 0.2), but pre-eclamptic women were heavier than pregnant and non-pregnant women and had higher BMI than pregnant women before pregnancy (all P < 0.05). Thirty-two percent of control, 55% of pregnant and 85% of pre-eclamptic women snored (P < 0.001), but pre-pregnancy snoring rates (pre-eclamptic = 36%, healthy pregnant women = 27%) were similar to those in non-pregnant women (32%) (P > 0.7). Sleepiness was reported by 12% of non-pregnant, 23% of pregnant and 15% of pre-eclamptic women (P < 0.04), but non-pregnant women had lower mean Epworth Sleepiness scores than both pregnant and pre-eclamptic groups (P < 0.001). Snoring was correlated with (P = 0.002), but explained only < 2%, of the variance in sleepiness.
   Conclusion: Snoring and sleepiness increased in the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly in patients with pre-eclampsia. However, the study suggests that sleepiness in pregnancy is largely due to factors other than snoring or breathing pauses. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Scrotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine) is known to be an inductor of the brain development [Whitaker-Azmitia, P.M., Druse, M., Walker, P., Lauder, J.M., 1996. Serotonin as a developmental signal. Behav. Brain Res. 73, 19-29; Ugrumov, M.V., 1997. Hypothalamic monoaminergic systems in ontogenesis: development and functional significance. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 41, 809-816]. This study was aimed to test whether it provides long-lasting effects on the differentiating vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and vasopressin (VP) neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in rats. To this aim, 5-HT was depleted in fetal brain by daily injections of p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), an inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis, to pregnant rats from the 13th to the 21st day of gestation. Pregnant rats injected with saline served as controls. The offsprings (males) of pCPA-treated and control pregnant rats were maintained after birth for two months under normal laboratory conditions. Then, the SCN was processed for immunocytochemistry of VIP and VP and in situ hybridization of appropriate mRNAs. There were no differences in concentrations of VIP and VP mRNAs in the SCN in adult offsprings of the 5-HT-depleted pregnant rats compared to the controls. Moreover, 5-HT deficiency did not induce any change in size of VIP-immunoreactive (IR) and VP-IR neurons. Conversely, both the numbers of VIP- and VP-immunoreactive neurons and concentrations of the peptides in cell bodies increased significantly. It is concluded that 5-HT provides long-lasting effects on differentiating VIP and VP neurons in the SCN resulting in attenuated release rather than elevated synthesis of both peptides in adulthood.

TI Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and prenatal maternal smoking: rising
   attributed risk in the Back to Sleep era
SO BMC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Parental smoking and prone sleep positioning are recognized causal features of Sudden Infant Death. This study quantifies the relationship between prenatal smoking and infant death over the time period of the Back to Sleep campaign in the United States, which encouraged parents to use a supine sleeping position for infants.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized the Colorado Birth Registry. All singleton, normal birth weight infants born from 1989 to 1998 were identified and linked to the Colorado Infant Death registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between outcomes of interest and prenatal maternal cigarette use. Potential confounders analyzed included infant gender, gestational age, and birth year as well as maternal marital status, ethnicity, pregnancy interval, age, education, and alcohol use.
   Results: We analyzed 488,918 birth records after excluding 5835 records with missing smoking status. Smokers were more likely to be single, non-Hispanic, less educated, and to report alcohol use while pregnant (p < 0.001). The study included 598 SIDS cases of which 172 occurred in smoke-exposed infants. Smoke exposed infants were 1.9 times (95% CI 1.6 to 2.3) more likely to die of SIDS. The attributed risk associating smoking and SIDS increased during the study period from approximately 50% to 80%. During the entire study period 59% (101/172) of SIDS deaths in smoke-exposed infants were attributed to maternal smoking.
   Conclusions: Due to a decreased overall rate of SIDS likely due to changing infant sleep position, the attributed risk associating maternal smoking and SIDS has increased following the Back to Sleep campaign. Mothers should be informed of the 2-fold increased rate of SIDS associated with maternal cigarette consumption.

AB Studies based on conventional office blood pressure (BP) measurements concluded that both maternal age and parity have significant effects on BP during pregnancy. Previous results have also indicated predictable trends of BP variability with gestational age. Accordingly, we have evaluated possible differences in the circadian pattern of ambulatory BP as a function of parity, maternal age, and stage of gestation in normotensive women who were systematically studied by ambulatory BP monitoring during their pregnancies. We analyzed 1408 BP profiles obtained from 126 nulliparous and 109 inultiparous pregnant women sampled for 48 consecutive h every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery. Data were divided for comparative analysis according to parity (nulliparous versus multiparous), age (<= 25, 26-30, 31-35, and >= 36 yrs), and trimester of gestation. Circadian BP parameters established by population multiple-components analysis were compared between groups using a nonparametric test. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern described by a model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 h is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic BP for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (always p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the 24h mean among groups divided by parity at any age or stage of pregnancy. A trend of increasing BP with age was found for diastolic but not for systolic BP. Although statistically significant, differences in the 24h mean of diastolic BP among groups divided by age were always less than 2 mm Hg. Data obtained from systematic ambulatory monitoring in normotensive pregnant women indicate the lack of differences in BP according to parity. The small, although significant, increase in diastolic BP with age may have scarce influence in the proper identification of women with gestational hypertension. Reference thresholds for BP to be used in the early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy could thus be developed as a function of the rest-activity cycle and gestational age only, and independently of parity or maternal age.

AB The studyestimates the unprecictable disorder (chaos) within the 24hr pattern of sinus R-R intervals (SRRI) in clinically healthy pregnant women (CHPW) and clinically healthy non-pregnant women (CHNPW), in order to evaluate the early gestational changes in neurovegetative cardiac pacing. SRRI were provided by the 24-h Holter ECG of 10 CHPW and 10 CHNPW. SRRI were investigated by descriptive conventional statistics by means of the Time and Frequency Domain Analysis, and subsequently, in their chaotic component by means of entropy analysis. Both the SRRI and entropy were tested via the cosinor method to better decipher whether or not the periodic disorder in heart rate variability is modified in pregnancy as a result of a gestational tonic resetting of the cardiac sympatho-vagal regulation. Cosinor analysis documented that the circadian rhythm of both the SRRI and entropy were preserved in CHNPW and CHRW. However, the circadian rhythm of SRRI and entropy in CHPW exhibited a significantly decreased 24h mean. Via the analysis of the rhythmicity of entropy, this study has documented that the chaos in the 24h pattern of SRRI is less prominent in CHPW than in CHNPW. Such a reduction of level in the deterministic periodic chaos of heart rate variability provides evidence that, in early pregnancy, a tonic elevation of the sympathetic activity regulates cardiac pacing.

AB Background Neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments.
   Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opiates.
   Search strategy The previous review was updated with additional searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE ( 1966- December 2004) and EMBASE ( 1980-December 2004) supplemented by searches of conference abstracts and citation lists of published articles.
   Selection criteria Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to opiate or control. Control could include an opiate, sedative or non-pharmacological treatment.
   Data collection and analysis Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included control of symptoms, seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using relative risk ( RR), risk difference ( RD), mean difference ( MD) and weighted mean difference ( WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model.
   Main results Seven studies enrolling a total of 585 infants met inclusion criteria ( Carin 1983; Finnegan 1984; Jackson 2004; Kaltenbach 1986; Kandall 1983; Khoo 1995; Madden 1977); however, two ( Finnegan 1984; Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies; sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four studies; and imbalances in group characteristics after randomisation in one study.
   Opiate ( morphine) vs supportive care only: One study ( Khoo 1995) found no significant effect on treatment failure ( RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a significant increase in hospital stay ( MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and significant reductions in time to regain birthweight ( MD - 2.8 days, 95% - 5.3, - 0.3) and duration of supportive care ( MD - 197.2 minutes/ day, 95% CI - 274.2, - 120.3). Opiate vs phenobarbitone: Meta-analysis of four studies found no significant difference in treatment failure ( typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51, 1.11). One of these studies ( Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used only opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be interpreted with caution. One study ( Jackson 2004) reported a significant reduction in duration of treatment and admission to the nursery for infants receiving morphine compared to phenobarbitone. One study ( Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate.
   Opiate vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in treatment failure ( RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of opiate.
   No study reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group.
   Authors' conclusions Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbitone, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. One study reported a reduction in duration of treatment and nursery admission for infants on morphine. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users ( i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution.
   Synopsis An opiate such as morphine or dilute tincture of opium should probably be used as initial treatment to ameliorate withdrawal symptoms in newborn infants with an opiate withdrawal due to maternal opiate use in pregnancy.
   se of opiates ( commonly prescribed methadone or illicit heroin) by pregnant women may result in a withdrawal syndrome in their newborn infants. This may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleeping and feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments for newborn infants used to ameliorate these symptoms and reduce complications include opiates, sedatives ( phenobarbitone or diazepam) and supportive treatments ( swaddling, settling, massage, relaxation baths, pacifiers or waterbeds). Trials of opiates compared to sedatives or other non-pharmacological treatments have generally been of poor quality. Individual trials have reported that using an opiate compared to phenobarbitone may reduce the incidence of seizures, duration of treatment and nursery admission rate. However, no overall effect was found on treatment failure rate. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduced the incidence of treatment failure. Opiates such as morphine or dilute tincture of opium should probably be used as initial treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants.

AB Background Neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments.
   Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of using a sedative compared to a non-opiate control for NAS due to withdrawal from opiates, and to determine which type of sedative is most effective and safe.
   Search strategy The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This update included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE 1966- March 2005 and abstracts of conference proceedings.
   Selection criteria Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to sedative or control. Control could include another sedative or non-pharmacological treatment.
   Data collection and analysis Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included treatment failure ( failure to achieve symptom control or use of additional drug treatment), seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using ( RR), risk difference ( RD), mean difference ( MD) and weighted mean difference ( WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model.
   Main results Six studies enrolling a total of 305 patients met inclusion criteria ( Coyle 2002; Finnegan 1984; Kahn 1969; Kaltenbach 1986; Khoo 1995; Madden 1977); however, two ( Finnegan 1984; Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random allocation methods in four studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in three studies.
   Phenobarbitone compared to supportive care alone has not been shown to reduce treatment failure or time to regain birthweight ( one study). However, the duration of supportive care given to infants was significantly reduced ( MD - 162.1 mins/day, 95% CI - 249.2, - 75.1). Comparing phenobarbitone to diazepam, meta-analysis of two studies found phenobarbitone produced a significant reduction in treatment failure ( typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24, 0.62). There was no significant difference in duration of treatment or hospital stay. Comparing phenobarbitone with chlorpromazine, one study found no significant difference in treatment failure rate. No data for neurodevelopment reported by treatment group of allocation were available. No trials were eligible that assessed clonidine for NAS. In infants treated with an opiate, a small quasi-random study reported a reduced severity of withdrawal. Infants were weaned from an opiate more quickly which allowed earlier hospital discharge and reduced hospital costs. These findings may reflect the low dose of opiate used for initial treatment and the policy of discharging infants home on phenobarbitone but not morphine.
   Authors' conclusions In newborn infants with NAS, there is no evidence that phenobarbitone compared with supportive care alone reduces treatment failure; however, phenobarbitone may reduce the daily duration of supportive care needed. Phenobarbitone, compared to diazepam, reduces treatment failure. In infants treated with an opiate, the addition of phenobarbitone may reduce withdrawal severity. Further trials are required to determine if this finding is applicable when a higher initial dose of opiate is used, and determine the effects of phenobabritone on infant development. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of chlorpromazine or clonidine in newborn infants with NAS. Clonidine and chlorpromazine should only be used in the context of a randomised clinical trial. This review should be taken in conjunction with the review "Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants" ( Osborn 2002a) which indicates that an opiate is the preferred initial therapy for NAS.
   SYNOPSIS When a sedative is needed to ameliorate symptoms in newborn infants with an opiate withdrawal due to maternal opiate use in pregnancy, phenobarbitone is preferred.
   Use of opiates ( commonly prescribed methadone or illicit heroin) by pregnant women may result in a withdrawal syndrome in their newborn infants. This may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleeping and feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments for newborn infants used to ameliorate these symptoms and reduce complications include opiates, sedatives ( phenobarbitone or diazepam) and supportive treatments ( swaddling, settling, massage, relaxation baths, pacifiers or waterbeds). Trials of sedatives have generally been of poor quality. Individual studies have reported that use of phenobarbitone compared to supportive care alone reduces the amount time an infant needs supportive care, is better than diazepam at preventing treatment failure and reduces the severity of withdrawal in infants treated with a opiate. However, the long term effects of use of phenobarbitone on an infant's development have not been determined.

AB Background/Aims: Knowledge of the presence or absence of cortisol (F) circadian rhythm in preterm infants is important for the interpretation of F measurements made in samples taken for both clinical and research purposes. Little is known about its emergence in very preterm infants. This study examines circadian rhythm in F secretion in hospitalized infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. Methods: Design: Prospective longitudinal observational study. Subjects: 11 infants admitted consecutively and born before 30 completed weeks of gestation. Measurements: F was measured by highly specific radioimmunoassay on morning and evening saliva samples gathered at weekly intervals until discharged home. Circadian rhythm was defined as >= 40% reduction from morning to evening level. Results: For all data, the median salivary F was 10.3 nmol/l (range <0.5-372.8). F levels were highest in the first 3 weeks of life. No infants displayed classical circadian rhythm for 4 weeks or more prior to being discharged from hospital. The other infants showed randomly distributed morning and evening F values with a trend in 4 infants towards periods of consistently higher evening than morning values. Conclusion: Adult-type F circadian rhythm is rarely evident in hospitalized preterm infants born before 30 weeks' gestation. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB The combined impact of infant colic and maternal depression on infant, parent, and family difficulties was examined. The sample included 93 consecutive patients seen at an outpatient Colic Clinic. Most mothers had private insurance and completed high school. Infants were approximately 2 months of age. Questionnaires completed by the mother prior to treatment onset were used to measure depressive symptoms in the mothers, infant cry, sleep and temperament, characteristics, parenting stress, maternal self-esteem, social support, and family function. Moderate to severe depressive symptoms were reported by 45.2% of the mothers. More severe depressive symptoms in the mothers were related to fussy/difficult infant temperament, more parenting stress, lower parental self-esteem, and more family-functioning problems. Pediatric health care providers need to be aware that the combined effects of colic and maternal depression can be problematic for the family.

AB Intrauterine illicit drug exposure may lead to a variety of adverse neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Providing early intervention to reduce the impact of maternal substance abuse on the developing fetus may have significant benefits for the child and family. In this article, we report on 3 promising intervention programs designed to improve the well-being of parents with drug dependence and their children. The initiation of these programs spans from pregnancy through early childhood. All 3 programs are community-based, using comprehensive culturally relevant developmental models. The first program was developed to provide comprehensive care for pregnant women with drug dependence and their newborns. Project STRIVE (Support, Trust, Rehabilitation, Initiative, Values, and Education) provided substance abuse treatment, intensive center- and home-based social work, and parent education onsite at a high-risk obstetric and pediatric clinic. The second program, the Early Infant Transition Center, enrolled newborns with a history of neonatal abstinence syndrome and their mothers. Based in a renovated rowhouse in East Baltimore, one block away from a major urban hospital, the Early Infant Transition Center provided 24-hour nursing care, oncall physicians and nurse practitioners, social workers, parent education, and onsite sleeping accommodation for parents during their infant's recovery. The third program, Home-U-Go Safely, used community-based nurses to give home-based health monitoring, education, and support to new mothers with a history of cocaine and/or opiate dependence.

AB Objective: Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is known to be elevated in serum of patients with preeclampsia, but there are no data available on the significance of urinary VCAM-1 excretion in preeclampsia. The aim of our study was to uncover possible circadian rhythms of VCAM-1 plasma levels and urinary VCAM-1 excretion in uncomplicated and hypertensive pregnancies and to ascertain their relation to blood pressure.
   Study design: A total of 10 normotensive and 10 preeclamptic pregnant women were included in this study. Venous blood was collected hourly, and urine samples were taken every 2 h over a period of 24 h. VCAM-1 levels were determined by ELISA. We compared these results with the circadian blood pressure rhythm.
   Results: The median VCAM-1 plasma levels were significantly (P<0.01) increased in preeclamptic patients (851.5 ng/mL) in comparison to normotensive pregnant women (659.3 ng/mL) without any circadian rhythm being apparent; however, the urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed a typical circadian rhythm, with a higher excretion rate during daytime.
   Conclusion: For the first time we have demonstrated that urinary VCAM-1 excretion in pregnancy shows a circadian rhythm without correlation to plasma levels or the circadian blood pressure rhythm. In contrast, VCAM-1 serum levels did not show a diurnal rhythm. We assume that VCAM-1 serum levels do not correlate with systemic blood pressure or urinary excretion.

AB A huge amount of knowledge about sleep has accumulated during the last 5 decades following the discovery of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Nevertheless, there are numerous areas of considerable ignorance. One of these concerns the particularities of sleep in women. Most basic and clinical studies have been performed in male subjects, and only very recently research groups around the world have addressed women's sleep in health and disease. In this review, we summarize the present knowledge on the influence of oestrogens on the brain and on the distinctive changes of sleep across the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and menopause. In addition, studies in female rodents are reviewed as well as the knowledge on female peculiarities regarding the interactions between sleep regulation and age-related changes in circadian rhythms. We also address specific aspects of sleep loss and sleep disorders in women. Finally, very recent studies on the sociology of sleep are summarized and future directions in the field are discussed.

AB Biological processes and functions in women are well organized in time, as evidenced by the expression of ultradian (high frequency), circadian (similar to24-hour), circamensual (similar tomonthly), and circannual (similar toyearly) rhythms and by the changes that occur with menarche, reproduction, and menopause. Attributes of women's circamensual structure have been explored in depth, particularly with regard to fertility/infertility and birth control. However, the role of 24-hour and other rhythms in health, disease, and treatment has been little studied. The symptom intensity of a variety of chronic medical conditions is rhythmic, as is the risk of severe events, such as stroke and myocardial infarct (MI). Improving the safety, efficacy, and preventive qualities of medications requires the understanding of how rhythms impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The therapeutic and adverse effects of prescription and nonprescription medications widely used by women can vary markedly with the (circadian) time of administration. Circadian rhythm-dependent differences in the safety of medications are particularly relevant to pregnant women; laboratory animal studies show that the fetal toxicity of various treatments varies not only with developmental stage but also with circadian time. Rhythm-dependent differences in the actions of medications are also of great importance to perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, who are advised to ingest prescribed pharmacotherapy for osteopenia and osteoporosis in the morning to minimize the risk of adverse effects and, as a consequence, may elect to take other medications at times not recommended in the instructions for their use. Medication trials must be comprehensive and representative of women and men of different life stages, ethnicities, and likely times (morning vs. evening) of drug use.

ID HEART-RATE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; NEWBORNS
AB Respiratory vagal activity is expressed by heart rate variability (HRV) at approximately 1 month of age in premature low-birth-weight infants (PLBWI). However, the autonomic inputs into the sinus node (SAN) and atrioventricular node (AVN) in PLBWI are unclear. We evaluated the variability in PP and PR intervals at day zero (day 0) and 1 month (1 month) after birth in 16 PLBWI (gestation 32.3 +/- 1.3 weeks, birth weight 1.578 +/- 257 g). The polygraph was recorded during sleep on day 0 and at 1 month. PP and PR intervals and the number of respiratory cycles were measured, and frequency analysis was performed by auto-correlation fast Fourier transforms. Power spectral density (PSD: ms(2)) was calculated for the low frequency domain (LF: 0.036similar to0.146 Hz), high frequency domain (HF: 0.146similar to0.390 Hz), total frequency (TF: 0.036similar to2.000 Hz), and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA: frequency bandwidth of 0.3 Hz with peak respiratory frequency as median), and the PSD ratio in the PP and PR intervals (LF/HF, RSA/TF) were compared. Compared with day 0, a decrease in the LF/HF ratio and on increase in the RSA/TF ratio in PP intervals were observed at 1 month consistent with expression of respiratory vagal activity. For PR intervals, on the other hand the L ratio increased, indicative of accentuated sympathetic activity. However, the respiratory vagal input was weak, and the RSA/TF ratio remained unchanged. These observations suggest that, in PLBWI at 1 month, AVN conduction was not predominatly influenced by respiratory-related vagal activity, but was controlled by autonomic regulation, independent of the SAN.

AB The objective of this review is to provide information on current RLS treatments. Different RLS treatments are reviewed including non-pharmacologic, drug options such as benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists and opiates, iron deficiency correction and other treatments as well as treatment options for children and adolescents and in complicated RLS by augmentation, pregnancy, ADH/ADD, depression. The summary will include a treatment algorithm and open discussion.
   Objective: Review current Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) treatments, discuss treatment of adults and of children and adolescents; discuss possible complications; assess augmentation and rebound.
   Assessment Methods: The clinical evaluation of RLS is based on the patient subjective report. The symptoms described are outside the range of common sensory experience. Diagnostic methods include both subjective and objective tools and can be self or clinician administered. The frequency and severity of the symptoms can be assessed by scales such as the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLSRS), Hopkins RLS Scale, Clinical Global Index (CGI), Quality of Life Scales (QoL) and the Augmentation Severity Rating Scale. If overnight Polysomnography is performed indices of Periodic Limb Movements Sleep (PLMS) and periodic Limb Movements Wake (PLMSW) > 15/h are suggestive of RLS. On the Suggested Immobilization Test (SIT) PLMW > 40/h is indicative of RLS (Montplaisir et al 1998). The Diagnostic Criteria established by the International RLS Study Group and updated in 2003 include: 1) An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs. 2) The urge to move or the unpleasant sensations begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting. 3). The urge to move or the unpleasant sensations are partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues. 4). The urge to move or the unpleasant sensations are worse, or only occur in the evening or night.
   Therapeutic Modalities: Current RLS Treatments include behavioral approach, pharmacologic options, treatment of iron deficiency and other therapeutic options.
   Behavioral Approach: 1) Education: acknowledge, support and educational resources, genetic counseling, professional counseling 2) Regular sleep-wake cycle 3) Moderate exercise, preferably earlier in the day, stretches 4) Review of literature on instruments to measure treatment efficacy 5) Avoid caffeine, alcohol, nicotine; 6) Engage in mental alerting activities: conversation, sexual activity, crossword puzzles, knitting, video/card games; caveat: these behaviors can promote alertness and may interfere with sleep onset, 7) relaxation techniques: hot baths, leg vibration, massage, biofeedback 8) acupuncture 9) supportive socks 10) avoid antihistamines, dopamine-blocking antiemetics, antidepressants, neuroleptics.

AB Lorenz hypothesized that one can presume brain function from behavior, and we have thought how this concept might be adapted to the study of human fetuses. Investigation of the central nervous system (CNS) in developing animals has shown that anatomical function occurs in the caudal segments followed by the rostral segments in a manner similar to development of the spinal cord followed by the caudal brainstem. The human brain is highly developed at birth in terms of numerous functions, although anatomical development continues for an additional year or two. Several investigators have suggested that anatomical defects are manifested as functional defects.
   During the last 20 years, real-time ultrasound has facilitated in vivo observation of human fetal movements, and behavioral patterns in utero can be assessed as a one-to-one match between the manifestation of an individual activity and its corresponding brain function. Every fetal behavior can be seen as a manifestation of CNS activity. In this review, we focus on fetal eye movement and its ultradian rhythm, as well as its synchronization with mouthing movement as behavioral parameters of functional brain development. Fetal leaning is also a potential parameter to deduce higher brain function in the human fetus.
   If validated, we could develop a new clinical method to assess fetal brain function. However, it would still be necessary to choose appropriate parameters and develop easy and ubiquitous criteria covering higher brain function throughout gestation. Herein, we discuss behavioral parameters, including recent attempts in human fetuses to assess brain function from the view of development.
   The ontogeny of fetal behavior can be described through observations of a given movement with advances in gestational age (1, 2); this approach is based on the idea that every fetal behavior can be seen as a manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) function at that point in time (3). In this review, we focus on fetal eye movement and its ultradian rhythm, with synchronization with mouthing movement as behavioral indicators (Table 1) to assess brain development. Changes in behavior pattern with time and relationships to other behaviors give information on integration of CNS function with advancing gestational age (4, 5).

AB Women are at greatest risk of suffering from depression during the childbearing years and thus may either become pregnant while taking an antidepressant or may require a prescription for one during pregnancy. The antidepressant fluoxetine (FX) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which increases serotonin neurotransmission. Serotonin is involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological systems, including the sleep wake cycle, circadian rhythms and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Each of these systems also plays an important role in fetal development. Compared with other antidepressant drugs, the SSRIs, such as FX, have fewer side effects. Because of this, they are now frequently prescribed, especially during pregnancy. Clinical studies suggest poor neonatal outcome after exposure to FX in utero. Recent studies in the sheep fetus describe the physiological effects of in utero exposure to FX with an 8 day infusion during late gestation in the sheep. This is a useful model for determining the effects of FX on fetal physiology. The fetus can be studied for weeks in its normal intrauterine environment with serial sampling of blood, thus permitting detailed studies of drug disposition in both mother and fetus combined with monitoring of fetal behavioural state and cardiovascular function. Fluoxetine causes an acute increase in plasma serotonin levels, leading to a transient reduction in uterine blood flow. This, in turn, reduces the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, thereby presenting a mechanism for reducing growth and/or eliciting preterm delivery. Moreover, because FX crosses the placenta, the fetus is exposed directly to FX, as well as to the effects of the drug on the mother. Fluoxetine increases high-voltage/non-rapid eye movement behavioural state in the fetus after both acute and chronic exposure and, thus, may interfere with normal fetal neurodevelopment. Fluoxetine also alters hypothalamic function in the adult and increases the magnitude of the prepartum rise in fetal cortisol concentrations in sheep. Fetal FX exposure does not alter fetal circadian rhythms in melatonin or prolactin. Studies of the effects of FX exposure on fetal development in the sheep are important in defining possible physiological mechanisms that explain human clinical studies of birth outcomes after FX exposure. To date, there have been insufficient longer-term follow-up studies in any precocial species of offspring exposed to SSRIs in utero. Thus, further investigation of the long-term consequences of in utero exposure to FX and other SSRIs, as well as the mechanisms involved, are required for a complete understanding of the impact of these agents on development. This should involve studies in both humans and appropriate animal models.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ETHNOLOGIE

DT Article
DE sexuality; conception; youth; marriage; India
AB This paper presents and analyses ideas about creation and conception among the Dongria Kond in Orissa, India. Its main aim is to understand a complex cultural system in which women are ascribed A creative power while men are expected to be active in order to facilitate and uphold creation. Using analytical concepts as redefined by Carol Delaney (1986, 2001) 1 argue that Dongria Kond do not have a concept of "paternity", but of "maternity'' since they ascribe all creative powers to women. Women are seen as the sole creators, yet their role in Dongria Kond society changes markedly with marriage. Before this event, young girls sleep in dormitories where they are visited by boys from other clans. Sexual encounters between boys and girls are controlled by the girls, who should avoid becoming pregnant. With marriage, women leave their parent's village and join the village of their husbands, where they have sexual intercourse that should result in procreation. Marriage can be seen as the culturally legitimate form for men to gain control over the creative powers resting in women and it takes two forms: either through exchange of one form of "life" against the other in marriages involving bridewealth prestations, or through violence involved in cases of bride-capture. Similar ideas about men's active role and the need to appropriate fertility associated with the female earth goddess are further identified in the buffalo sacrifices regularly performed by Dongria Kond.

ID SLEEP DISTURBANCES; WOMEN; PATTERNS; FATIGUE
AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that fatigue and sleep disturbance late pregnancy are associated with labor duration and delivery type.
   Study design: In a prospective observational study of 131 women in their ninth Month of pregnancy, objective (48-hour wrist actigraphy) and subjective (Sleep logs and questionnaires) measures were used to predict labor outcomes using analysis of variance and logistic regression.
   Results: Controlling for infant birth weight, women who slept less than 6 hours at night had longer labors and were 4.5 times rnore likely to have cesarean deliveries. Women with severely disrupted sleep had longer labors and were 5.2 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Fatigue was unrelated to labor outcomes.
   Conclusion: Health care providers should prescribe S hours of bed time during pregnancy to assure adequate sleep and should include sleep quantity and quality in prenatal assessments as potential predictors of labor duration and delivery type. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Because of its multiple involvement in physiological processes, autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, a key regulator of homeostatic control, demonstrates a progressive increase during pregnancy. The profile of its maturation, mainly in the parasympathetic arm, in premature or full term infants, may help us to better understand its pathophysiological role. We prospectively evaluated ANS maturity in a group of 23 premature (PREM) infants at their theoretical term age and in 8 full term (FT) newborns. All recordings were registered close to the theoretical full term period (from 38 to 41 weeks) for the PREM group and during the first week of life for the FT newborns. Polygraphic recordings, EEG monitoring associated with visual clinical control, and Holter ECG, were performed simultaneously. ANS indices were then calculated during quiet sleep periods, using Wavelet transform of RR (beat to beat) intervals. High frequency components were found to be significantly lower in the PREM than in the FT group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, at theoretical full term age, the greater the prematurity, the lower was parasympathetic activity. Because it is easy, monitoring of parasympathetic activity may help us to understand autonomic maturation and its clinical prognostic implications.

AB Background Increasingly more First Nations (FN) people have moved from rural to urban areas. It is unknown how disparities in infant mortality among FN versus non-FN women have changed over time in urban versus rural areas.
   Methods We conducted a birth cohort-based study of all 877 925 live births (56 771 FN and 821 154 non-FN) registered in British Columbia, 1981-2000. Main outcomes included rates, risk differences, and relative risks of neonatal, postneonatal, and overall infant death.
   Results Both neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates for FN infants showed a steady decline in rural areas but a rise-and-fall pattern in urban areas. Relative risks for overall infant death among FN versus non-FN infants declined steadily from 2.75 (95% CI: 2.04, 3.72) to 1.87 (95% CI: 1.24, 2.81) in rural areas from 1981-1984 to 1997-2000, but rose from 1.59 (95% CI: 1.27, 1.99) (1981-1984) to 2.80 (2.33-3.37) (1989-92) and then fell to 1.89 (1.44-2.49) (1997-2000) in urban areas. Risk differences for neonatal death among FN versus non-FN infants declined substantially over time in rural but not urban areas. The disparities in neonatal death among FN versus non-FN were largely explained by differences in preterm birth, while the disparities in postneonatal death were not explained by observed maternal and pregnancy characteristics.
   Conclusions Reductions in disparities in infant mortality among FN versus non-FN women have been less substantial and consistent over time in urban versus rural areas of British Columbia, suggesting the need for greater attention to FN maternal and infant health in urban areas.

AB Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. About 20% of the population consumes less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg. Women, particularly, have low intakes. For example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men have inadequate intakes. Mg deficiency during pregnancy can induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric consequences that might last throughout life. Studies of gestational Mg deficiency in animals show that Mg deficiency may have marked effects on parturition and postuterine involution. It has interfered with fetal growth and development, and caused morbidity from hematological effects and disturbances in temperature regulation, to teratogenic effects. Emphasis, here, is on effects of chronic clinical gestational Mg deficiency as it affects the infant. Premature labor, contributed to by uterine hyperexcitability caused by chronic maternal Mg deficiency, that can be intensified by stress, gives rise to preterm birth. If the only cause of uterine overactivity is Mg deficiency, its supplementation constitutes nontoxic tocolytic treatment, as an adjuvant treatment, that is devoid of toxicity and enhances efficacy and safety of tocolytic drugs such as beta-2 mimetics. Evidence is considered that Mg deficiency or Mg depletion can contribute to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS may be a fetal consequence of maternal Mg deficiency through impaired control of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermoregulation mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set point. SIDS can result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. Possibly, simple nutritional Mg supplements might be preventive. Various stresses in an infant can transform simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion. For example, lying prone can be stressful for the baby, as can parental smoking. The role of chronopathological stress appears to be often neglected, as it constitutes a clinical form of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its anatomical and clinical stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (MT) and of its urinary metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (6 SMT)]. SIDS might be linked to impaired maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT. Prophylaxis of this form of SIDS should include atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for pregnant women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. Consequences of maternal primary Mg deficiency have been inadequately studied. To determine ultimate outcomes of gestational Mg deficiency in infants, a long-term multicenter placebo-controlled prospective study should undertaken on effects of maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality/morbidity in fetus, neonates, infants, children and adults, not only during pregnancy and the baby's first year, but throughout life.

AB Progressive intrahepatic cholestasis (PIHC, also known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis) is a general term encompassing a devastating group of illnesses manifest by severe morbidity and potential mortality. By definition these diseases are characterized by persistent cholestasis that is the result of intra-hepatic rather than extra-hepatic pathology. Recent scientific advances have begun to clarify the molecular basis of many of these disorders. The morbidities of these diseases are primarily the result of profound cholestasis. This cholestasis is often associated with intractable pruritus, which leads to a very poor quality of life. Normal development and sleep are not possible for the affected individual and family dynamics are sometimes irreparably damaged. The cholestasis also leads to complications of fat soluble vitamin malabsorption including osteopenia and pathologic bone fractures, xeropthalmia, and peripheral neuropathy. End-stage liver disease and all of its attendant problems may develop in affected individuals by young adulthood. Optimal therapeutic approaches to PIHC are not well established and disease-specific approaches may be required.

AB Objective. To assess whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with increased behavioral morbidity.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted of school-aged children in an urban, community-based cohort, stratified for term or preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) birth status. A total of 829 children, 8 to 11 years old (50% female, 46% black, 46% former preterm birth) were recruited from a cohort study. All children had unattended in-home overnight cardiorespiratory recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and heart rate for measurement of the apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas per hour). SDB was defined by either parent-reported habitual snoring or objectively measured OSA. Functional outcomes were assessed with 2 well-validated parent ratings of behavior problems: the Child Behavioral Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Long.
   Results. Forty (5%) children were classified as having OSA (median apnea hypopnea index: 7.1 per hour; inter-quartile range: 3.1-10.5), 122 (15%) had primary snoring without OSA, and the remaining 667 (80%) had neither snoring nor OSA. Children with SDB had significantly higher odds of elevated problem scores in the following domains: externalizing, hyperactive, emotional lability, oppositional, aggressive, internalizing, somatic complaints, and social problems.
   Conclusions. Children with relatively mild SDB, ranging from primary snoring to OSA, have a higher prevalence of problem behaviors, with the strongest, most consistent associations for externalizing, hyperactive-type behaviors.

AB Background: Cigarette smoking and cocaine use in pregnancy are common in the US and both are risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Although the cause of SIDS is not known, one postulated mechanism involves abnormalities of arousal and arousal regulation. Cigarette smoking and cocaine use may cause deficits of arousal. Many believe arousal deficits occur prenatally. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of cigarette smoke and cocaine exposure during pregnancy on measures of fetal arousal and arousal competency: 1) the fetal response to vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) and 2) habituation to VAS. Hypothesis: Maternal cigarette smoking and cocaine use in pregnancy are associated with altered arousal and arousal regulation in the fetus. Methods: Three groups of mother-fetal dyads were enrolled: 1) cigarette smokers (n = 54), 2) cocaine users (n = 30), and 3) controls (n = 60). One hundred eight fetuses were tested at 29-31 wk gestation, 119 at 32-35 wk, and 118 at 36+ wk. The fetal response to VAS was assessed using real-time ultrasound and a paradigm of arousal responsiveness. Responders were tested with repeated VAS to assess habituation. Also, the quality of fetal reactivity to repeated stimuli was assessed as a measure of arousal and arousal regulation competence (Behavioral Reactivity Scale). Results: The control group had a larger proportion of fetuses who were too active to initiate testing ("too active to test") (p = 0.013); the proportion of fetuses too active to test decreased with increasing gestational age. The majority of the fetuses who could be tested responded to the initial VAS, and there were no group differences. The proportion of fetuses that habituated and the rate of habituation did not differ between the groups. Behavioral reactivity did not differ between groups.
   Conclusions: The original hypotheses were not confirmed. However, the chosen assessment paradigms may have lacked sensitivity. The proportion of fetuses that were "too active to test" decreased with gestational age. The control group had a larger proportion of fetuses that were "too active to test" compared with the exposure groups. We speculate that these findings indicate that prenatal exposure to these neuroteratogens may have produced an acceleration of the behavioral response to vibroacoustic stimulation.

AB During pregnancy, systemic inflammatory responses induce cytokines that may stress the fetus and contribute to cardiovascular and neuroendocrine dysfunction in adulthood. We evaluated the effects of early and late prenatal exposure to IL-6 on mean systolic arterial pressure (MSAP) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation in male and female rats at 5-24 wk of age. MSAP and ACTH and corticosterone levels were measured basally and in response to a novel environment, immobilization stress, and stimulation with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and ACTH. In addition, mRNA expression and protein levels of glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, CRF receptor type 1, and CRF were estimated in brain areas thought to mediate central effects of corticosteroids on the HPA axis and on central neuroendocrine regulation of MSAP. Both early and late prenatal IL-6 exposure led to hypertension, which was evident in females at 5 wk of age. In adult rats, basal ACTH and corticosterone levels were elevated, the responses to stress and stimulation tests were of extended duration, and circadian rhythm during the light period was flattened and reversed. Mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression was reduced in the hippocampus, the CRF level was increased in the hypothalamus, and CRF receptor type 1 mRNA expression was increased in the pituitary. These findings suggest that fetal stress induced by prenatal exposure to IL-6 leads to hypertension and dysregulation of HPA axis activity during adulthood.

AB By using an improved detrended fluctuation analysis we studied the scaling behaviour of 53 long-term series of fetal heart rate fluctuations. Our results suggest that fractality begins to arise around 24 weeks of normal human gestation and that this condition, showing some additional developments, seems to be preserved during gestation. This may provide new evidence of a role played by cortical-to-subcortical pathways in the long-term fractal nature of heart rate variability data. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pregnancy in mammals is a time of considerable physical, physiological and behavioral change necessary for the continuance of the gestation. Gestating pigs are often used in behavior and welfare studies; yet, there are little published data describing how pregnancy affects normal behavior and cardiac activity patterns. The objective of this work was to describe the longitudinal dynamics of cardiac activity and behavior during pregnancy in primiparous pigs (gilts). The behavior and cardiac activity of nine gilts were recorded on eight occasions at certain fixed time points during their pregnancy: 1-2 weeks before oestrus and mating (week - 1), 14 days postmating (week 2), and days 30 (week 4), 44 (week 6), 65 (week 9), 79 (week 11), 93 (week 13) and 107 (week 15) of pregnancy. Temporal changes in behavior patterns were present in all gilts over the course of gestation. Pretest levels of general activity progressively declined between weeks - 1 and 15, as indicated by a decrease in the proportion of observations spent rooting (p<0.001), walking (p<0.001) and standing (p<0.001). There was a corresponding increase in inactivity (p<0.001), and the proportion of time spent sleeping, as opposed to lying alert, increased also (p<0.001). Apart from RR-min and its corresponding HR-max indices, all time-domain parameters were influenced by the stage of gestation. Specifically, mean HR increased (p<0.001), whereas the root-mean-square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard deviation (S.D.) decreased (p<0.001). Pregnancy further impacted the frequency domain measures of heart rate variability. From week -1 to 15, the absolute magnitude of Total power (p<0.001) decreased, HF power decreased (p<0.001) and LF power increased (p=0.004). In conclusion, pregnancy induced widespread changes in behavior and in sympathovagal regulation of cardiac activity in pigs that were reflected in both the time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability analysis.

AB Purpose The aim of the present study was to determine whether community pharmacists recommend appropriate medications and give valid information to pregnant women.
   Methods A total of 163 community pharmacists randomly selected in the Midi-Pyrenees area were interviewed by means of an open questionnaire. Ten scenarios were proposed concerning back pain, headache, coughs and sore-throats, fever, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, 'venous insufficiency', allergic rhinitis and insomnia.
   Results Out of the total, 130 pharmacists accepted to answer. Out of them 94.5% reported advising homeopathy, especially for coughs and allergy. They often advised medication for pain, fever, nose and oropharynx disorders, 'venous insufficiency', dyspepsia or constipation. By contrast, they referred the women to the general practitioner for nausea and vomiting or back pain. Advice without drug dispensation was given for gastrointestinal disorders or 'venous insufficiency'. Phytotherapy only concerned 0.5-2% of the answers except for anxiety and sleep disturbances (59%), 'venous disorders'(17%) and sore-throat (9%). Pharmacists' answers were sometimes inappropriate involving (1) pharmacologically illogical advice, (2) drugs for which neither clinical nor experimental data are available and (3) drugs potentially harmful in pregnancy.
   Conclusions The present study shows that French community pharmacists do not always give appropriate advice to pregnant women. As primary health care providers, pharmacists have to improve counselling regarding drug use in pregnancy. Copyright C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: To perform a large and detailed epidemiologic study on restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy and the puerperium. Methods: A structured clinical interview, assessing symptoms since the beginning of pregnancy, was performed to a population of 642 pregnant women at the time of delivery and at follow-up evaluation (1, 3, and 6 months after delivery). Main hematologic tests were also evaluated. A woman was considered affected if she met the International RLS Study Group criteria for RLS diagnosis. Results: Twenty-six percent of women were affected by RLS during their pregnancy. The disease was strongly related to the third trimester of pregnancy and tended to disappear reaching the time of delivery. Affected women presented lower values of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume compared with healthy subjects (both groups received the same supplemental iron and folate therapy). Conclusions: Pregnancy is associated with transient restless legs syndrome.

AB The power spectra of night sleep EEGs of 12 breast-feeding 9-13 week postpartum mothers were analyzed and compared with those of 12 non-pregnant women. The power spectra in the delta and theta frequency range during NREM sleep for breast-feeding mothers were significantly higher than those for non-pregnant women. In addition, the all-night sleep patterns of the mothers were classified into two groups - interrupted sleep due to taking care of their infants and non-interrupted sleep - in order to observe the influence of partial sleep deprivation. The power spectra in the delta and theta frequency range were not significantly different between them. This result suggests that increased delta and theta power spectra during postpartum sleep do not result from partial sleep deprivation. The role of prolactin in breast-feeding mothers' sleep is also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To compare the breathing patterns of infants born by elective caesarean section to those infants delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of labour. Methods: Healthy term infants born by caesarean section were studied. The study group (n=13) had no trial of labour, whereas infants in the control group (n=13) failed a trial of labour. Polysomnographic study was performed at 36 h of age. Heart and respiratory rate, type and duration of apnoeas, arterial oxygen saturation and lower limb movements were analysed. Results: Term infants born by elective caesarean section had a shorter duration of pregnancy and weighed less. Their heart rate was faster, they had more mixed apnoeas, and during quiet sleep they had more central apnoeas of longer duration.
   Conclusion: Cardiorespiratory patterns in infants delivered by elective caesarean section are different from those delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of labour.

AB We tested the hypothesis that estradiol modifies respiratory control in pregnant rats and participates in the development of respiratory chemoreflexes in fetuses. Pregnant rats (n = 12) received daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle (Veh, n = 6) or 4-androsten-4-ol-3,17-dioneacetate (ATD; inhibitor of estradiol synthesis; n = 6; 5 mg/day in vehicle) from gestational day 16 (G16) to delivery. Baseline ventilation ( whole body plethysmography) and metabolic rate [oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2)] were determined at G14 and G20, in pups [ on postnatal day 3 ( P3) and P20] and in adult rats ( on P70) born to Veh- or ATD-treated mothers. Hypoxic chemoreflex was assessed in P3 rats by acute exposure to 60% O-2 and in P20 or P70 rats by moderate hypoxia (12% O-2, 30 min). ATD treatment reduced circulating estradiol in pregnant dams at G20 without producing changes in the circulating level of estradiol precursors ( testosterone and androstenedione). ATD-treated dams showed impaired respiratory adjustment to late gestation. Pups born to ATD mothers had higher resting (V) over dot O-2 (+23% at P3, + 21% at P20), respiratory frequency ( + 15% at P3, + 12% at P20), and minute ventilation ( + 11% at P3, + 18% at P20) than pups from Veh mothers. Respiratory decrease during acute hyperoxic exposure at P3 was - 9.7% in Veh ( P < 0.05 vs. room air) and only - 2.6% ( P = not significant) in ATD pups. In P20 ATD rats, hypoxic ventilatory response was attenuated compared with Veh. In P20 and P70 rats, the drop of (V) over do O-2 in hypoxia ( - 31% in P70, P < 0.0001) was not observed in ATD rats. We conclude that estradiol secreted during late gestation is necessary for respiratory adjustment to pregnancy and is required for adequate development of respiratory and metabolic control in the offspring.

ID MOSQUITOS; PLACENTA; GAMBIA
AB The attractiveness of pregnant women for mosquitoes was investigated in a peri-urban site in New Halfa, eastern Sudan, in September-October 2003. For 20 nights, the mosquitoes feeding on nine pregnant and nine non-pregnant women sleeping under untreated bednets were collected. The women slept outdoors, in the yards of nine houses, each yard holding one pregnant and one non-pregnant woman. In general, each pregnant woman attracted significantly more Anopheles arabiensis (the main vector of Plasmodium falciparum in the area) than each non-pregnant women, with mean biting rates of 0.94 and 0.49 bites/woman-night, respectively (P = 0.005). In contrast, the two groups of women attracted similar numbers of the other mosquito species collected, which were all culicine. Impregnated bednets need to be used in the study area, at least by the pregnant women (who appear to be at particularly high risk of acquiring malaria).

AB In the 1960s, Dr Cameron, a Montreal; Que, psychiatrist; experimented with drug-induced sleep and electroconvulsive therapy for psychiatric patients, believing that this method "wipes them clean of harmful memories." In 1992 the government of Canada settled lawsuits by former patients of Dr Cameron, awarding them large payments. The government rejected a similar claim by Lloyd Schrier, whose mother had been treated by. Dr Cameron while she was carrying Lloyd; arguing that Lloyd was not Cameron's patient. Or was he?

AB With the use of ambulatory monitoring, a circadian blood pressure pattern has been shown to characterize normotensive as well as hypertensive pregnant women. However, the potential differences between healthy and complicated pregnancies in pulse pressure, an independent marker of cardiovascular risk in the general population, have not yet been investigated. We analyzed 2523 blood pressure series sampled for 48 hours once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit until delivery in 245 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 140 with gestational hypertension, and 49 who developed preeclampsia. Compared with uncomplicated pregnancies, a statistically significant elevation in the 24-hour mean of pulse pressure is found in complicated pregnancies in all trimesters ( P < 0.001). Results further indicate similar 24-hour mean of pulse pressure between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy ( P = 0.158). The increase in pulse pressure among women who developed preeclampsia compared with women with gestational hypertension, although small, was statistically significant in the second trimester (1.4 mm Hg; P = 0.010) and, to a larger extent, in the third trimester of pregnancy (1.8 mm Hg; P < 0.001). The differences in pulse pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies, observed already in the first trimester of gestation, are found when systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are within the accepted range of normotension. Moreover, ambulatory pulse pressure provides higher sensitivity than clinic measurements for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy.

AB Objectives: To review our management of infants discharged home receiving supplemental oxygen. Stable preterm infants receive low flow O-2 by nasal cannulae aiming for SaO(2) of greater than or equal to 95%. Oxygen-dependent infants must pass an air test (ability to maintain SaO(2) > 80% during 4 h disconnection from oxygen) before discharge home with supplemental oxygen. A sleep study is performed before nocturnal O-2 is ceased.
   Methods: Infants less than 33 weeks gestational age (GA) who were admitted January 1999-June 2001 and discharged home with supplemental oxygen were identified through the databases and medical records of the King Edward Memorial/Princess Margaret Hospitals. The data collected were compared with an audit performed a decade earlier.
   Results: Ninety-three infants were discharged home with supplemental oxygen between 1999 and 2001 (10% neonatal intensive care unit admissions less than 33 weeks GA; median GA 26 weeks (interquartile range 25-28). All infants had an air test before discharge: 63% failed the first air test and 30% at least two air tests. The median delay between the first air test and discharge was 2 weeks. The median postmenstrual age at discharge was 40 weeks gestation (interquartile range 38-41). Ninety infants had a sleep study before nocturnal oxygen was ceased and nine failed the first sleep study. Hospital readmission rate was 60%. More preterm infants (less than 33 weeks) were discharged with supplemental oxygen in 1999-2001 (10%, n = 96 in 1999-2001) than in 1987-1992 (2.5%, n = 53) and this was associated with an earlier discharge (40 vs 44 weeks postmenstrual age), lower oxygen requirements at discharge (60 vs 125 mL/min), earlier discontinuation of daytime and nocturnal oxygen (1 vs 4 months postmenstrual age and 2.5 vs 6 months postmenstrual age) and no increase in readmission rate (64% vs 60%). The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia for these infants has remained stable at 20%.
   Conclusion: Our home oxygen programme, based on an air test predischarge and a sleep study prediscontinuation of nocturnal oxygen, facilitates early discharge home. Our data suggest that over the last decade, bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with less impairment in lung function. Further evidence from randomized clinical trials is required to determine optimal target range for oxygen saturation in preterm infants.

AB Classic experiments have shown that ovulation and estrous cyclicity are under circadian control and that surgical ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) results in estrous acyclicity in rats[1-3]. Here,we characterized reproductive function in the circadian Clock mutant mouse [4,5] and found that the circadian Clock mutation both disrupts estrous cyclicity and interferes with the maintenance of pregnancy. Clock mutant females have extended, irregular estrous cycles, lack a coordinated luteinizing hormone (LH) surge on the day of proestrus, exhibit increased fetal reabsorption during pregnancy, and have a high rate of full-term pregnancy failure. Clock mutants also show an unexpected decline in progesterone levels at midpregnancy and a shortened duration of pseudopregnancy, suggesting that maternal prolactin release may be abnormal. In a second set of experiments, we interrogated the function of each level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in order to determine how the Clock mutation disrupts estrous cyclicity. We report that Clock mutants fail to show an LH surge following estradiol priming in spite of the fact that hypothalamic levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), pituitary release of LH, and serum levels of estradiol and progesterone are all normal in Clock/Clock females. These data suggest that Clock mutants lack an appropriate circadian daily-timing signal required to coordinate hypothalamic hormone secretion. Defining the mechanisms by which the Clock mutation disrupts reproductive function offers a model for understanding how circadian genes affect complex physiological systems.

AB Since poor sleep quality is associated with multiple health problems, it is important to understand factors that may affect sleep patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a continuous, 60-Hz, nighttime magnetic field exposure on sleep outcomes in young women sleeping at home. The study was a randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 muT above ambient levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy. The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 muT during the ambient period and 0.41-1.21 muT during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns, suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep of young women who sleep at home.

AB Daily variation in niche use among vertebrates is attributed to a variety of factors, including thermoregulatory, reproductive, and nutritional requirements. Lemuriform primates exhibit many behavioral and physiological adaptations related to thermoregulation and sharp, seasonal reproduction, yet they have rarely been subjects of a quantitative analysis of circadian (or daily) rhythms in niche use. In this study, I document daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use over an annual cycle in two sympatric, frugivorous lemurs, Varecia rubra and Eulemur fulvus albifrons. Data on diet, forest site, and forest height were recorded at 5-min time points on focal animals and divided into three time blocks for analysis (06:00-10:00 hr, 10:00-14:00 hr, and 14:00-18:00 hr). I employed multivariate tests of independence to examine daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use according to sex, season, and reproductive stage. Throughout the day, V. rubra is frugivorous and dwells in the upper canopy, with notable departures (especially for females) during the hot seasons, gestation, and lactation. E. f. albifrons has heterogeneous daily rhythms of food choice and microhabitat use, particularly across seasons, and both sexes are equally variable. These daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use appear related to thermoregulatory and nutritional requirements, seasonal food availability and circadian rhythms of plant (and possibly insect) palatability, predator avoidance tactics, and in the case of Varecia, to reproduction. Daily rhythms of food choice in V. rubra support two previously suggested hypotheses explaining why primates consume more nonfruit items late in the day, whereas those of E. f albifrons are too variable to lend support to these hypotheses.

AB Study objective Environmental-factor changes may largely be accountable for the dramatic increase of obesity prevalence in industrialized countries. This study investigated the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and various socioeconomic, clinical, behavioural and reproductive factors in a population from Southern France.
   Methods Using a cross-sectional study, a sample of 3127 current and former salaried workers (1658 men and 1469 women) completed a questionnaire on personal and medical histories, and had a clinical examination including height and weight measurements. Age-adjusted and multiple linear regression analyses were performed.
   Results The overall prevalence of obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2)) was 9.8% and was higher in men than in women (11.1 versus 8.3%). Multivariate analyses showed that in both sexes, low educational level, television watching, low physical activity and ex-smoking habits, were independently associated with a higher BMI. Furthermore, in women, we found independent and positive associations between BMI and the number of naps per week, short sleep duration, daily alcohol consumption, the number of pregnancies, early age at menarche or the non-use of oral contraceptives.
   Conclusions Our results reveal the complexity that exists between BMI and environmental factors and stress the need to analyse and to handle these factors simultaneously.

AB This study examined how women's experiences of domestic violence may affect their level of stress, as measured by difficult life circumstances and stressful life events for 107 women living in poverty. Results indicated that women with abusive partners reported higher levels of stress than women who had not experienced abuse. Women's perceptions of how their experiences of domestic violence impacted their health and the type of events women perceived to be most stressful were also examined. Symptoms most frequently perceived to be a result of abusive experiences were heart pounding/racing, trembling hands, headaches, and sleep problems. Implications of the findings for research and community intervention are discussed, including the importance of providing not only crisis intervention services, but also the need to create and maintain long-term support and advocacy services for women who have experienced domestic violence.

AB The aim of the present study was investigate, in young rats, the effects of malnutrition on astrocyte distribution of two hypothalamic regions, the circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the medial preoptic area WPM. Control rats were born from mothers fed on commercial diet since gestation and malnourished rats from mothers fed on multideficient diet, from the beginning of gestation (GLA group) or from the onset of lactation (LA group). After weaning, pups received ad libitum the same. diet as' their mothers, and were maintained under a 12/12h light/dark cycle. The animals were analyzed either at 30-33, or 60-63 days of life. Brain coronal sections (50 mum) were processed to visualize glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity. Compared to control rats, both malnourished groups of 30 and 60 days exhibited a reduced number of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes in the SCN. The total GFAP-immunoreactive area in the SCN of the GLA group differed from the control group at both age ranges analyzed. The GFAP expression as measured by the relative optical density (ROD) exhibited a 50-60% reduction in the MPA in both malnourished groups, compared to controls. The results suggest that malnutrition early in life leads to alterations in gliogenesis or glial cell proliferation in both nuclei, being these alterations greater in the MPA. Compensatory plasticity mechanisms in the GFAP-expression seem to be developed in the astrocyte differentiation process in the SCN, especially when the malnutrition is installed from the lactation.

This study analyzes the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin, 1985) in 588 pregnant women or in puerperium. The reliability was examined with the alpha of Cronbach, whose value was 0,82 and the analysis of the main components showed a single-factor solution accounting for 58,6% of the variance. The convergent and discriminant evidence was analyzed with the domains of COOP-WONCA Charts and The Nottinghan Health Profil: the life satisfaction obtained significant relationship with the indicators of the mental domain and it didn't show significant relation with the physical domain. The items about social domain and then those related to energy, pain and sleep showed statistically significant relations, but lower than those related to the psychological domain.

AB We present findings suggesting that photoperiod is important in determining the sensitivity of the late-pregnant rabbit uterus to oxytocin (OT). Longitudinal myometrial strips were taken from term-pregnant and estrous rabbits and mounted in an organ bath for isometric myographic recording at different times during a 16: 8-h light-dark cycle (lights on 0600-2200; n = 5/group), and the strength of contractions was registered in response to the application of OT or KCl. Strength of contractions was dose dependent and was up to 200 times greater at doses three to four orders of magnitude lower in tissue taken from pregnant animals during the light phase (0700 and 1300) than during the dark phase (2400 and 0400). Strips from nonpregnant estrous females also showed greater sensitivity and contractile force when taken in the light (0700) than in the dark (0400), although the differences were not significant. Consistent with the influence of photoperiod on uterine sensitivity to OT, strips taken from two groups of pregnant females (n = 5/group) maintained on a light-dark cycle advanced 12 h showed significantly greater sensitivity and force in response to OT during the new subjective light than during the new subjective dark phase. The photoperiod-dependent contractile response to OT was specific and not simply the result of a change in general mechanical properties of the muscle, because administration of KCl resulted in dose-dependent contractions of similar magnitude in both the light and dark phase. These results are consistent with the fact that rabbits, like other nocturnal mammals, typically give birth during the day.

AB Objective: To develop an objective and reliable method to assess drug withdrawal in newborns by quantitatively estimating the amount of movement rather than scoring individual withdrawal signs.
   Design: In this cross sectional study, a commercial portable motion detector with computer memory, similar to a wrist watch ( the actigraph) was used to measure movement. The measurements were compared with a clinical decision based on the neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) score. Movement was analysed, using non-parametric tests, in three groups: a control group of 10 infants, 13 opiate exposed newborns not treated for NAS, and 30 newborns treated for NAS ( 17 before treatment, eight within 24 hours of treatment, five when stabilised).
   Results: There were significant differences in the median activity score, expressed as counts per minute (cpm), in the pretreatment group ( 124 cpm) compared with the control ( 42 cpm, p< 0.0001), non-treated ( 74 cpm, p = 0.001), and stabilised treatment ( 75 cpm, p = 0.007) groups. The accuracy of the actigraph in the identification of newborns requiring treatment from those who did not was high compared with the clinical scores; sensitivity 94%; specificity 85%; positive and negative predictive values 88% and 92% respectively.
   Conclusions: The measure of movement is comparable to the clinical score in the identification of newborns who require treatment and in determining the severity of withdrawal. The clear advantage of this method is its objectivity, reliability, and efficiency as a simple, non-invasive, bedside measure. Further evaluation in a randomised, controlled trial would establish comparative benefits, potential harms, safety, and acceptability.

AB The postpartum is a high-risk period for the occurrence of anxious and depressive episodes. Indeed, during the first few days after delivery, mothers can present postpartum blues symptomatology: fatigue, anxiety, disordered sleeping and a changing mood. Postpartum depression is characterised by a changing mood, anxiety, irritability, depression, panic and obsessional phenomena. It occurs in approximately 10 to 20% mothers. The exact prevalence depending on the criteria used for detection. The first symptoms usually appear between the fourth and sixth week postpartum. However, postpartum depression can start from the moment of birth, or may result from depression evolving continuously since pregnancy. We can add that the intensity of postpartum blues is a risk factor that can perturb maternal development. So it is important for health professionals to dispose of predictive tools. This study is a validation of the French version of the EPDS. The aims of the study were to evaluate the postpartum depression predictive value at 3 days postpartum and to determine a cut-off score for major depression. Subjects participating in this study were met in 3 obstetrical clinics in, or in the vicinity of, Toulouse. Mothers with psychological problems, under treatment for psychological problems or mothers whose babies present serious health problems were excluded from the study. The EPDS was presented to 859 mothers (mean age = 30.3; SD = 4.5) met at one of the clinics at 3 days postpartum (period 1). They had an EPDS mean score of 6.4 (SD = 4.6); 258 (30%) mothers had an EPDS score greater than or equal to 9. 82.6% of these mothers experienced a natural childbirth and 17.3% a caesarean section; 51.5% gave birth to their first child, 36.2% to their second child and 12.3% to their third or more. All subjects were given a second EPDS with written instructions to complete the scale during the period 4 to 6 weeks postpartum and return it for analysis (period 2). Between the 4 to 6 weeks postpartum period, 722 mothers replied again to the EPDS. 131 mothers had an EPDS score 11 (mean age = 30.3; SD = 4.8). They had an EPDS mean score of 13.6 (SD = 3.3). Mothers with probable depression were interviewed and assessed, using the Mini (Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview, Lecrubieret al. 1997), the SIGH-D (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale) and the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory) in order to diagnose a major depressive episode. They had a HDRS mean score of 13.7 (SD = 5.1) and a BDI mean score of 13.6 (SD = 5). At 3 days postpartum, we observed that 258 mothers (30%) had an EPDS scores ! 9 and 164 mothers (19%) had an EPDS scores greater than or equal to11. Between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum, we observed 18.1% of postpartum depression (EPDS greater than or equal to 11) and 16.8% (EPDS greater than or equal to 12) of major postpartum depression. The analysis of the sensitivity and the specificity at 3 days postpartum provides a cut-off score of 9 (Sensibility: 0.88) (Specificity: 0.50) as predictive of postpartum depression, for this cut-off score, the type I error is low (5.85%) but the type II error is more higher (18.9%). The analysis of the sensitivity and the specificity between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum provides a cut-off score of 12 (Sensibility: 0.91) (Sensibility: 0.74) for the detection of major postpartum depression. Factor analysis shows at 3 days postpartum that the internal structure of the scale is composed of two subscales. The first factor F1, anxiety, accounts 28% of the variance and the second factor F2, depression, accounts 20% of the variance.
   Between 4 and 6 weeks postpartum, factor analysis suggests an unidimensional model in the evaluation of postpartum depression which is better than a two factor model. This factor accounts 40%. of the variance. The scale has a good predictive value, and we can observe a significant correlation with the EPDS periods 1 and 2 (r = 0. 56; p < 0.05). This result shows that the depressive mothers mood intensity predicts a future depressive risk. Furthermore, correlations between EPDS and BDI (r = 0. 68; p < 0. 05) and EPDS and HDRS (r = 0. 67; p < 0.05) show a good convergent validity. The reliability study confirms the good internal consistency of the EPDS, at 3 days postpartum and in the postpartum depression symptomatology evaluation (Cronbach's Alpha > 0.80). In conclusion, this scale demonstrates good validity and is fast and easy use in obstetrical services, allowing early detection of women who risk to develop postpartum depression and, in the first week of postpartum, of mothers who suffer from a major postpartum depression. The use of the EPDS for an early screening of the risk of postnatal depression which is essential considering the consequences that postnatal depression can have on the development of the infant, on the quality of the relationship within the couple and on other social relationships. Mothers at risk for postnatal depression should be controlled and surveyed by the health professionals in obstetrical clinics.

AB Ontogeny of arousal data constitute a vital supplement to the sparse literature on spontaneous neuronal activity. These data demonstrate that measurable infant spontaneous arousals (SAs) with an inherent oscillatory entrainment occur six times more in active sleep than in quiet sleep of the same duration and are identifiable as a human neurobiologic function. These SAs are not significantly associated with race or ethnicity, gender, total hours spent sleeping, percent time spent in active or quiet sleep, preterm status, history of a life-threatening event, having had a sibling who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or having had a mother who smoked during this pregnancy. As measurable neurophysiologic events, SAs establish parameters for research at molecular and molar levels focusing on several critical areas: (1) the neuronal control of SA related to neurotransmitters, (2) as a significant antecedent factor in clinical cardiorespiratory events occurring in infants at high epidemiologic risk for SIDS; (3) as a regulatory biologic factor underlying temperament and executive cognitive functioning, and (4) morbidity and mortality effects possibly related to therapeutic interventions that alter SA levels.

ID HYPERTENSION
AB A 25-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2, at 37 weeks gestation was evaluated and treated for preeclampsia. Overnight, the patient had a witnessed apneic episode with maternal oxygen desaturation and concurrent fetal heart rate deceleration. She subsequently delivered an infant that was small for gestational age. This is the first case described with confirmed obstructive sleep apnea by formal polysomnography and witnessed maternal desaturation with fetal heart rate decelerations. Recognizing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) early in gestation will help dictate treatment options and may prevent adverse maternal fetal outcomes. Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) seems to be a safe treatment with minimal adverse effects. Questioning of patients at the first prenatal visit and monitoring for increased snoring during gestation may help detect early signs and symptoms of OSA. Treatment of OSA with CPAP might improve perinatal outcomes.

TI Low back pain during pregnancy: Prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes
SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN; GENERAL-POPULATION; LUMBAR BACK; FOLLOW-UP; WOMEN
AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the severity of the low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy, including prevalence, risk factors, impact on daily living, and health provider management.
   METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of 36 questions was distributed to pregnant women participating in various prenatal care clinics and educational classes in New Haven County, Connecticut. A total of 950 surveys was returned from May 2002 through October 2003. At each site, a researcher was available each week to answer questions and gather surveys.
   RESULTS: Six hundred forty-five (68.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 65-72%) respondents reported expeniencing LBP during their current pregnancy. The prevalence was not affected by gestational age (P = .56). Low back pain during the current pregnancy was predicted by age (Younger women were more likely to develop it; P = .004), history of LBP without pregnancy (P = .002), during menstruation (P = .01), and during a previous pregnancy (P = .002). The majority of respondents reported that LBP during pregnancy caused sleep disturbances (58%; 95% CI 54-62%) and impaired daily living (57%; 95% CI 53-62%). Average pain was moderate in severity. Nearly 30% of respondents stopped performing at least one daily activity because of pain and reported that pain also impaired the performance of other routine tasks. Only 32% (95% CI 28-36%) of the respondents with LBP during pregnancy informed their prenatal care providers of this problem, and only 25% (95% CI 21-28%) of prenatal care providers recommended a treatment.
   CONCLUSION: Low back pain during pregnancy is a common problem that causes hardship in this population. Further studies are indicated in the areas of prevention and treatment. (C) 2004 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB Context: The precise function of sleep in animals and human beings is still unknown, and any sort of physical, social or psychological variation may change the normal sleep-wake cycle. Purpose: This research aims is to determine the sleep disorders (SD) for each of the three trimesters of the pregnancy comparing them to the pre-pregnancy state (PG). Method: SD were investigated in three hundred pregnant women 11- to 40-years-old through with a brief clinical interview based on directed questions. One hundred pregnant women were considered for each trimester. Results: The rate of pregnant women with insomnia increased by 23% in the 2(nd) trimester (p< 0.005); the rate for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) by 15% in the 1(st) trimester (p<0.003), 55% in the 2(nd) trimester (p<0.001) and by 14% in the 3(rd) trimester (p<0.002); the rate for mild sleepiness increased by 33% in the 2(nd) trimester (p<0.002) and by 48% in the 3(rd) trimester (p<0.001); the rate for specific awakenings increased by 63% in the 1(st) trimester, by 80% in the 2(nd) trimester and by 84% in the 3(rd) trimester (p<0.001). Conclusion: SD were more frequent during pregnancy comparatively to PG state, mostly at the expenses of EDS and specific awakenings.

AB Objective: To test the hypothesis that physical leisure time activities reduce the risk of developing persistent fatigue.
   Methods: The hypothesis was tested in a sample that was homogeneous with respect to sex and occupation, with a prospective cohort design. Of 6234 vocationally active, female, Norwegian nurses' aides, not on leave because of illness or pregnancy when they completed a mailed questionnaire in 1999, 5341 ( 85.7%) completed a second questionnaire 15 months later. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of persistent fatigue - that is, always or usually feeling fatigued in the daytime during the preceding 14 days.
   Results: In participants without persistent fatigue at baseline, reported engagement in physical leisure time activities for 20 minutes or more at least once a week during the three months before baseline was associated with a reduced risk of persistent fatigue at the follow up ( odds ratio = 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.89), after adjustments for age, affective symptoms, sleeping problems, musculoskeletal pain, long term health problems of any kind, smoking, marital status, tasks of a caring nature during leisure time, and work factors at baseline.
   Conclusion: The study supports the hypothesis that physical leisure time activities reduce the risk of developing persistent fatigue.

AB Previous reports identified two peptides that mimic the action of neuroprotective proteins derived from astrocytes. These peptides, NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA, prevent neuronal cell death produced by electrical blockade, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and beta-amyloid of NAPVSIPQ and SALLRSIPA were synthesized and compared respectively to the corresponding all L-amino acid peptides. In rat cerebral cortical test cultures cotreated with 1 muM tetrodotoxin, the D-amino acid peptides produced similar potency and efficacy for neuroprotection as that observed for their respective L-amino acid peptides. Since all these peptides tested individually exhibited attenuation of efficacy at concentrations of >10 pM, combinations of these peptides were tested for possible synergies. Equimolar D-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA combination treatment produced potent neuroprotection (EC50, 0.03 fM) that did not attenuate with increasing concentrations. Similarly, the combination Of L-NAPVSIPQ and D-SALLRSIPA also had high potency (EC50, 0.07 fM) without attenuation of efficacy. Combined administration of peptides was tested in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome and in a model of learning impairment: apolipoprotein E knockout mice. Intraperitoneal administration Of D-NAPVSIPQ Plus D-SALLRSIPA to pregnant mice (embryonic day 8) attenuated fetal demise after treatment with an acute high dose of alcohol. Furthermore, oral administration Of D-NAPVSIPQ Plus D-SALLRSIPA significantly increased fetal survival after maternal alcohol treatment. Apolipoprotein E knockout mice injected with D-NAPVSIPQ Plus D-SALLRSIPA showed improved performance in the Morris water maze. These studies suggest therapeutic potential for the combined administration of neuroprotective peptides that can act through a mechanism independent of chiral recognition.

   RISK; DEPRIVATION
AB Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. Around 20% of the population consumes less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg, in both genders and in women particularly: for example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men. Primary Mg deficiency may occur in fertile women. Gestational Mg deficiency is able to induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric consequences which might last throughout life.
   Experimental studies of gestational Mg deficiency show that Mg deficiency during pregnancy may have marked effects on the processes of parturition and of postuterine involution. It may interfere with fetal growth and development from teratogenic effects to morbidity: i.e. hematological effects and disturbances in temperature regulation.
   Clinical studies on the consequences of maternal primary Mg deficiency in women have been insufficiently investigated. To check the validity of the role of this frequent gestational Mg deficiency, the protocol of a long term multicentric placebo controlled prospective study on the effects of maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality and morbidity in fetus, neonates, infants, children and adults should be carried out not only during pregnancy and the first year of life, but throughout life. - Two clinical forms of chronic gestational Mg deficiency in women have been stressed:
   Premature labor when chronic maternal Mg deficiency is involved in uterine hyperexcitability,
   Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) when it is caused by either simple Mg deficiency or various forms of Mg depletion.
   Nutritional Mg treatment of premature labor. If gestational Mg deficiency is the only cause for uterine overactivity, nutritional Mg supplementation constitutes the etiopathogenic atoxic tocolytic treatment. But although it is an adjuvant factor in premature labor, it is only a useful accessory treatment, devoid of toxicity but which increases the effectiveness and safety of the associated tocolytic drugs such as beta-2 mimetics.
   SIDS due to gestational Mg deficit: Mg deficiency or various forms of Mg depletion.
   SIDS may be caused by the fetal consequences of maternal Mg deficiency through an impaired control of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermoregulation, mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set point. SIDS may result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. A possible prevention could rest on simple maternal nutritional Mg supplementation.
   Various stresses in pregnant women or in the infant may transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion: stress in baby care such as bedding in prone position, environmental factors such as parental smoking, but the role of chronopathological stress particularly appears to be too often neglected as it constitutes a clinical form of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its anatomical and clinical stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (SE arrowMT) and of its urinary metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (SE arrow6SMT)].
   SIDS might be linked to an impaired maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT. A preventive treatment of this form of SIDS should associate atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for pregnant women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. The place of Mg therapy for the infant and of MT, L Tryptophan and taurine is uncertain for the moment.

AB Objectives. To determine the relationships between maternal depressive symptoms and the use of infant health services, parenting practices, and injury-prevention measures.
   Methods. A prospective, community-based survey of women attending Philadelphia public health centers between February 2000 and November 2001 was conducted. Women were surveyed at 3 time points before and after parturition. Depressive symptoms were determined with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at each time point. We studied 6 outcomes, clustered into 3 categories: 1) infant health service use ( adequate well-child care and ever being hospitalized); 2) parenting practices (breastfeeding for greater than or equal to1 month and use of corporal punishment); and 3) injury-prevention measures ( having a smoke alarm and using the back sleep position).
   Results. The sample consisted of 774 largely single (74%), uninsured (63%), African American (65%) women, with a mean age of 24 +/- 6 years and a mean annual income of $ 8063. Forty-eight percent of women had depressive symptoms at 1 or 2 time points ( ever symptoms) and 12% had depressive symptoms at all points ( persistent symptoms). Compared with women who never had depressive symptoms ( without symptoms), women with persistent symptoms were nearly 3 times as likely to have their child ever hospitalized ( adjusted odds ratio: 2.89; 95% confidence interval: 1.61 - 5.07) and twice as likely to use corporal punishment ( adjusted odds ratio: 1.90; 95% confidence interval: 1.08 - 3.34). Mothers with persistent depressive symptoms were nearly three-quarters less likely to have smoke alarms in their homes ( adjusted odds ratio: 0.28; 95% confidence interval: 0.11 - 0.70) and one-half as likely to use the back sleep position ( adjusted odds ratio: 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.35 - 0.91), compared with women without symptoms. There was no association between maternal depressive symptoms and infant receipt of well-child care or the likelihood of breastfeeding for greater than or equal to 1 month.
   Conclusions. Maternal depressive symptoms persisting from the prepartum to postpartum periods were associated with increased risks of infant hospitalization and use of corporal punishment and with lower likelihood of having a smoke alarm and using the back sleep position. Additional efforts are needed to identify and evaluate mothers with depressive symptoms to improve the health and safety of young infants.

ID BIRTH CERTIFICATE; RISK-FACTORS; PREGNANCY
AB Alcohol is an important element in the causa I chain of risk for fetal, infant, and childhood mortality. Mortality risk is influenced by interactions of alcohol with other environmental and genetic factors and temporal periods of susceptibility. In this paper we discuss four time periods (preconceptual, gestational, infancy, and childhood) where alcohol use may create a context of risk. Alcohol use in one period increases the risk of alcohol use in subsequent periods. Gestational alcohol use can influence risk of mortality from abuse of mother/fetus, can cause other adverse outcomes, and can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In infancy alcohol use can increase risk from impairment of arousal in adults who use alcohol. Infants with gestational exposure can be behaviorally difficult with sleep disturbance, irritability, and colic. This can increase the risk of harm or death, especially during periods of caretakers' alcohol use. Caretakers' alcohol use and smoking are strongly correlated. The all-cause mortality rate in people diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is over 5%. All-cause mortality in siblings of diagnosed cases of FAS is increased 530% compared to siblings of matched controls. We recommend that a context of alcohol use be considered as a marker for multifactorial risk in all fetal, infant, and child deaths. A schema to collect data on alcohol use is provided to increase awareness of alcohol use as an environmental risk marker for mortality. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Although several structures surrounding the SCN are sensitive to the effects of gonadal steroids, similar effects in the SCN remain unclear. For example, there are conflicting data on whether the SCN is sexually differentiated. This study attempted to determine sex differences in the number of SCN cells generated during late gestation, and if testosterone mediates these differences. Pregnant female rats were treated with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) on gestational day 18 (E18), the day when aromatase activity peaks in the developing rat fetus. These animals were also given injections of oil or testosterone propionate (10 mg/0.1 mL peanut oil) from E15 until parturition. Litters were allowed to survive until adulthood and were killed on postnatal day 60 (PN60). Following fixation, brain sections containing the SCN from these rats were processed for BrdU immunocytochemistry. A second set of SCN sections was processed for immunocytochemistry detecting BrdU and some of the cell groups prevalent within the SCN. Data showed that female rats have a higher number of cells labeled with BrdU in the SCN, particularly in the medial and caudal SCN. This sex difference was abolished in animals treated with testosterone during late gestation. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that BrdU-labeled cells were neurons expressing calbindin-D28K, vasoactive intestinal peptide and, to a lesser degree, vasopressin. Our results unveiled a previously unknown effect of gonadal steroids on the developing SCN, which may contribute to the emergence of gender-specific circadian rhythms.

AB Objectives: To investigate clinical impact of 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) on the prediction of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and IUGR. Methods: A BPM was performed in 334 normotensive nonproteinuric nulliparous women at 20 weeks' gestation. Arterial blood pressure patterns were analyzed by chronobiometry. Results: Women who developed idiopathic IUGR (21) or PIH (33) showed a 24-h diastolic blood pressure mean significantly higher than the controls (69.2 +/- 1.8 mmHg and 73.5 +/- 6.2 vs. 62.2 +/- 1.5). Women with subsequent IUGR also showed a modification in BP rhythm. The most effective cut-off levels of 24-h diastolic blood pressure mean proved to be 67 for IUGR and 68 for hypertension. Conclusions: ABPM in the second trimester reliably predicts idiopathic IUGR and PIH. Both patients destined to develop gestational hypertension and those destined to develop IUGR show similar elevations in 24-h diastolic mean at 20 weeks' gestation.

AB A significant body of literature has endorsed the view that the sleep of women differs in many respects from that of men. Beyond gender differences, however, are questions about sleep within cohorts of women. For example, in adult women ages 20-45 years, there are women with regular menstrual cycles, women taking oral contraceptives, pregnant and lactating women, and women entering menopause. Given that each of these states is associated with a unique hormonal environment, it is important to determine whether there are clinically significant differences in the sleep of women in these phases of life. This article presents what is known currently about the sleep of women from adulthood through menopause and provides recommendations for evaluation and treatment.

AB Objectives: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants.
   Design: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone.
   Setting: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center.
   Participants: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study.
   Interventions: None.
   Results: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages I and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate.
   Conclusions: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

LA English
DT Article
DE dopaminergic agents; dopamine agonists; restless legs syndrome; periodic
   limb movement disorder
AB Dopaminergic agents, particularly dopamine agonists, have been used with increasing frequency in the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder. These evidence-based practice parameters are complementary to the Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, published in 1999.1 These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitor, and the dopaminergic agonists pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Other dopamine agonists (talipexole, cabergoline, piribidel, and alpha-dihydroergocryptine) and the dopaminergic agents amantadine and selegiline may be effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD, but the level of effectiveness of these medications is not currently established. Lastly, no specific recommendations can be made regarding dopaminergic treatment of children or pregnant women with RLS or PLMD.

AB Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor disorder characterized by discomfort of and urge to move the legs, primarily during rest or inactivity, partial or total relief with movement, with presence or worsening exclusively in the evening. It is a relatively common but frequently unrecognized disorder, with a prevalence ranging from 2.5 to 15% of the general population, increasing with age and with a female preponderance. The diagnosis is clinical but polysomnography is useful to determine its profound impact on sleep (difficulties in sleep onset, maintaining sleep during the night, and sleep fragmentation) and for the evidence of periodic legs movements during sleep and wake. RLS is generally idiopathic. with familial association in 40-60% of the cases, but may also be symptomatic of such associated conditions (secondary forms) as peripheral neuropathies, uremia, iron deficiency (with or without anemia), diabetes, Parkinson's disease and pregnancy. Response to dopaminergic drugs indicates that dopamine receptors are implicated, and although much progress has been made ill diagnosis and treatment in the last decade, more is needed for complete elucidation of the etiology and pathophysiology of RLS.

AB Pregnant women have at least two or three times higher risk of experiencing restless legs syndrome (RLS) than the general population. These data come from few epidemiological studies finding an 11-27% prevalence of RLS during pregnancy. Women affected by pre-existing RLS often complain of worsening symptoms during pregnancy. This is usually a benign form of RLS, with the highest degree of severity in the third trimester and a tendency to disappear around delivery. The causes of the association between RLS and pregnancy are unknown. The most debated hypotheses are: metabolic alterations, with particular regard to iron and folate deficiency; hormonal influences related to the increase of prolactin, progesterone and estrogens during late pregnancy; and the changing motor habits and psychological state of pregnant women. The importance of folate and iron supplementation during pregnancy in preventing RLS is unclear. RLS in pregnant women is frequently unrecognized; they are often worried about the symptoms and do not receive an adequate explanation by doctors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives To explore the pathophysiology of acute urinary retention in women with a retroverted gravid uterus and to suggest measures to prevent its recurrence.
   Methods In five women with a retroverted gravid uterus and acute urinary retention necessitating catheterization, the morphology of the genitourinary system was assessed by using transabdominal, transvaginal and introital sonography.
   Results In the supine resting position, the cervix was displaced superiorly and anteriorly by the impacted and retroverted uterus so that it compressed the lower bladder, leading to obstruction of the internal urethral orifice. The upper bladder extended superiorly and overlay the uterus. During straining, urethral motion was not limited and there was an average rotational angle of the bladder neck of 32degrees, ranging from 21degrees to 44degrees. Increasing abdominal pressure further compressed the lower bladder. Measures suggested to the women for the prevention of urinary retention included limiting fluid intake before sleep, changing from the supine to the prone position before getting up and avoiding a Valsalva maneuver but performing a Crede maneuver during voiding. In all except one case these measures successfully prevented recurrence.
   Conclusions Acute urinary retention secondary to a retroverted gravid uterus is caused by a displaced cervix compressing the lower bladder and interfering with drainage to the urethra. The urethra itself is not compressed or distorted. Understanding the pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract may allow maneuvers which prevent acute urinary retention. Copyright (C) 2004 ISUOG.

AB Aims. In this work we review the major publications dealing with disorders that affect the digestive system and how they are related to sleep. Development. Sleep disorders occur in 12-25% of the general population and a large percentage of these pathologies are related to disorders of the digestive system. We review the different pathologies and symptoms linked to the digestive tract that give rise to sleep disorders. The study first examined the upper digestive tract, that is, the teeth and teeth grinding, and we then went on to look at gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal motility disorders, peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis, gastric ulcer irritable bowel, proctalgia, the extent to which the disorders are related to pregnancy, disorders at the paediatric age and eating disorders. Conclusions. Digestive pains during sleep form a heterogeneous clinical picture that disrupts patients' sleep and exerts an influence on their quality of daily living, which in turn may affect sleep and favour the appearance of pains. To date these symptoms have received relatively little attention, but in the few studies that have been carried out, it has not been possible to establish with any degree of accuracy whether sleep and the digestive system share common control mechanisms or not. Research into this type of disorders could help to prevent the appearance of the complications that appear in these clinical pictures.

AB Background. Back pain during late pregnancy is a frequent clinical problem. Very little is known about the impact of this symptom on the quality of life among pregnant women with back pain.
   Objectives. To study the influence of back pain and physical ability on quality of life in late pregnancy.
   Methods. One hundred and sixty women in the 34th-37th week of pregnancy and attending two different midwife receptions, were asked to fill out questionnaires including: general questions about background factors, the Disability Rating Index (DRI) to score the physical ability, and The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) for assessing health-related quality of life. Two groups were defined, with and without back pain.
   Results. One hundred and thirty-six (85%) out of 160 screened women returned the questionnaire for evaluation. The 69 (51%) women with back pain rated significantly (p < 0.05) higher on the DRI; on NHP part I, sub scales sleep, energy, pain, physical functioning and total score; and on NHP part II, aspects occupation, ability to perform jobs around the house, social life and hobbies compared with women without back pain.
   Conclusions. Irrespective of back pain the pregnant women studied featured lower quality of life (QOL) compared with published data on healthy women. Among the women with back problems, who had the most impaired QOL, the factors affecting QOL were mostly related to physical ability.

AB Chong et al. examined risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) before and after the start of the Swedish campaign to reduce the risk of SIDS. They found that maternal smoking was the strongest risk factor for SIDS in the post-campaign compared to the pre-campaign period.
   Conclusion: After successful results of the SIDS campaigns to prevent prone sleeping, strong efforts need to be undertaken to eliminate maternal smoking during pregnancy altogether without replacing cigarette smoking with other nicotine delivery devices such as snuff, gum or patches.

AB Aim: To assess the change of risk factors that are specific to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after the initialization of a campaign to reduce the risk (RTR) of SIDS compared to non-SIDS postneonatal deaths. Methods: Data were extracted from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, 1982-1991 and 1993-1998. 1105 infants died from SIDS during the postneonatal period, 2115 postneonatal deaths were from other causes and 11050 live birth controls were selected. Risk factors previously identified to be related to SIDS were defined as high parity, prematurity, young maternal age, low Apgar score, birth during the night, single motherhood, multiple births, maternal smoking, male gender, short length standard deviation score (SDS) and small weight-to-length SDS. Results: Non-SIDS deaths were more significantly related to a low 5-min Apgar score, smaller weight-to-length SDS, and/or short length SDS values; while SIDS deaths were more closely related to mothers with higher parity or multiple births, mothers who smoked during pregnancy and single-parent (mother) families. Maternal smoking was even more prominent among SIDS deaths in the post-campaign period. The adjusted odds ratios, compared with non-SIDS deaths, increased from 1.84 (95% CI: 1.48, 2.28) in the pre-campaign period to 4.11 (95% CI: 2.72, 6.21) in the post-campaign period.
   Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy remains the most important modifiable risk factor for SIDS in the post-campaign period in comparison with non-SIDS postneonatal deaths. Other than putting babies in a supine sleeping position, maternal smoking should be the next most important issue to be considered, if there is to be a second campaign.

AB Aims: To determine whether combined pre- and postnatal nicotine exposure compared with prenatal exposure alone results in more compromised postnatal hypoxia defense mechanisms and further alteration of the postnatal breathing pattern (reduced tidal volume and increased respiratory rate). Methods: Seven lambs exposed to nicotine prenatally (pN) (approximate maternal dose: 0.5 mg/kg/d) and seven lambs exposed to nicotine pre- and postnatally (ppN) (postnatal dose: 1.6-2 mg/kg/d) were studied without sedation at an average age of 5 d and 21 d during resting (room air) conditions, during exposure to 10% O-2 and during a brief exposure to 100% O-2. Results: Resting minute ventilation, occlusion pressure, effective impedance, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were similar in the two groups during wakefulness and quiet sleep. Resting tidal volume was significantly higher in ppN than in pN lambs during wakefulness (9.4 +/- 0.7 vs 7.7 +/- 1.4 ml/kg, p < 0.05) and quiet sleep (9.8 +/- 0.6 vs 7.6 +/- 1.5 ml/kg, p < 0.01) at 5 d and also at 21 d during wakefulness (7.7 +/- 1.0 vs 6.2 +/- 1.1 ml/kg, p < 0.05). The ventilatory, heart rate and blood pressure responses to hypoxia were comparable in the two groups during both activity states. Time to arousal from quiet sleep in response to hypoxia was equivalent in the two groups. The ventilatory response to hyperoxia was not significantly different in the two groups during either activity state.
   Conclusion: Continued postnatal nicotine exposure after prenatal exposure did not further compromise hypoxia defense mechanisms after birth.

AB Objective: Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness.
   Method: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated.
   Results: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past.
   Conclusions: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

AB It has been suggested that shift work, night work in particular, affects worker's psychophysical health. However, the effects of night work on the health of pregnant women are not physiologically well elucidated. The effects of night work on the biological function of pregnant women were studied in the present study. Three pregnant and six non-pregnant nurses that engaged in fast-rotating shift system cooperated for the study. The 24-h urine samples were collected in two time frames, daytime (07:00 to 23:00) and nighttime (23:00 to 07:00) on the day shift, the night shift and the days off. Urinary concentrations of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and norepinephrine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and estriol by radioimmunoassay. The excretion profiles of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the pregnant and the non-pregnant women were altered on the night shift, which might relate the derangement of circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion. The urinary norepinephrine level during the night work was considerably higher in the pregnant women, which indicated the presence of higher physical burden in them due to the night work. The urinary estriol level was not significantly affected by shift, day/night and individual factors, and the effect of night work on urinary estriol level of the pregnant women remained uncertain. The results of the present study suggested that the night work of the pregnant shift workers should be much more relieved.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to 1) study the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among singleton births in the United States and 2) identify maternal and obstetric risk factors for SIDS.
   METHODS: A cohort of all live births in the United States from 1995 to 1998, formed the source population (n = 15,627,404). The data were obtained from the National Centers for Health Statistics Linked Births and Infant Deaths File. A nested case-control study was used to examine risk factors for SIDS. From this birth cohort, all SIDS deaths (n = 12,404) were first identified (case group). From the remaining non-SIDS births, a 4-fold larger sample (n = 49,616) was randomly selected as a control group.
   RESULTS: The overall incidence of SIDS was 81.7 per 100,000 live births. More mothers in the case group than in the control group were reported to have placenta previa (odds ratio [OR]: 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 2.33), abruptio placentae (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.24, 1.98), premature rupture of membranes (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.33, 1.66), or small for gestational age (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.30, 1.50 for the 10th percentile). SIDS cases were also more likely to be male. Mothers of cases were more likely to be younger, less educated, and nonwhite, and more of them smoked during pregnancy and did not attend prenatal care.
   CONCLUSION: This analysis confirms the importance of several well known demographic and lifestyle risk factors for SIDS. In addition, placental abnormalities were risk factors for SIDS. (C) 2004 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB Aims: To investigate the influence of analytical design on the variability of published results in studies of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Methods: The results of a prospective case-control study, of 203 cases of SIDS, and 622 control infants are presented. All variables significant on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model analysed in nine stages, starting with sociodemographic variables, then sequentially and cumulatively adding variables relating to pregnancy history, current pregnancy, birth, the interval from birth to the week prior to death, the last week, the last 48 hours, and the last sleep period. A ninth stage was created by adding placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period.
   Results: As additional variables are added, previously published SIDS risk factors emerged such as social deprivation, young maternal age, greater than or equal to3 previous live births, maternal smoking and drinking, urinary tract infection in pregnancy, reduced birth weight, and the infant having an illness, regurgitation, being sweaty, or a history of crying/colic in the interval from birth to the week before death, with co-sleeping and the lack of regular soother use important in the last sleep period. As the model progressed through stages 1-9, many significant variables became non-significant (social deprivation, young maternal age, maternal smoking and drinking) and in stage 9 the addition of placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period caused greater than or equal to3 previous live births and a reduced birth weight to become significant.
   Conclusion: The variables found to be significant in a case-control study, depend on what is included in a multivariate model.

AB We assessed the correlation between the rhythm of melatonin concentration and circadian blood pressure patterns in normal and hypertensive pregnancy. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and blood samples every 4 It were monitored in 16 primigravidae who had shown an abnormal circadian blood pressure pattern (eight pre-eclamptic and eight normotensive) in pregnancy and 6-12 months after pregnancy. The circadian rhythm was analyzed by chronobiological measures. Eight normotensive women with maintained blood pressure rhythm served as controls. During pregnancy, melatonin concentration was significantly higher in pre-eclamptic than in normotensive women (Pre-eclampsia, 29.4 +/- 1.9 pg/ml, normotensin, altered rhythm, 15.6 +/- 2.1; controls, 22.7 +/- 1.8; p < 0.001) This difference faded after pregnancy, owing to the fall observed in pre-eclampsia (11.8 +/- 3.2 pg/ml, 9.8 +/- 2.1, and 11.1 +/- 2.0, respectively; NS). ne rhythm of melatonin concentration was lost in all pregnant women with loss of blood pressure rhythm. After pregnancy, normotensive women showed a reappearance of both melatonin and blood pressure rhythm, whereas pre-eclamptic women showed a reappearance of blood pressure but not melatonin rhythm. The loss of blood pressure rhythm in pregnancy is consistent with the loss of melatonin concentration rhythm. In pre-eclamptic women, the normalization of blood pressure rhythm, while melatonin rhythm remained altered, suggests a temporal or causal priority of circadian concentration of melatonin in the determination of blood pressure trend.

AB Background. Previous studies on fatigue and pregnancy outcomes were confined to women with occupational fatigue and did not include women who did not work outside the home. Fatigue during mid- and late pregnancy has rarely been studied.
   Aims. This paper reports a study examining the associations between work factors, household factors, and fatigue among low-risk pregnant women in Taiwan and links the effects of fatigue to preterm births and caesarean deliveries.
   Methods. The participants were 633 women who were 20-36 weeks pregnant without evidence of obstetrical complications at the time of interview. Pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from the hospital records after delivery. Fatigue was measured using the Fatigue Symptom Checklist. Women were categorized into three groups according to their work status: non-working, sedentary work, and active work. Other work factors included hours worked and exposure to adverse work environments. Household factors included household work and childcare responsibilities. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression were used for the analysis.
   Results. The factors significantly associated with fatigue in the regression model were age, infection during pregnancy, bleeding after 12 weeks of pregnancy, and work status. Women who did not work outside of the home had significantly higher fatigue scores than those who did sedentary work outside the home. Younger women had higher fatigue scores than older women. Fatigue scores during pregnancy predicted caesarean deliveries, given that age and obstetrical risks were controlled in the model.
   Conclusions. Fatigue is a significant problem for pregnant women. Fatigue assessments should include morbidities during pregnancy as well as household and work-related factors. Special attention should be paid to women who do not work outside the home. Staff should elicit information about fatigue and intervene early, as this may help decrease the number of caesarean deliveries.

TI Randomized clinical trial of bright light therapy for antepartum
   depression: Preliminary findings
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PREGNANCY; DISORDERS; PARENTS; ANXIETY; BIRTH; RISK
AB Background: Bright light therapy was shown to be a promising treatment for depression during pregnancy in a recent open-label study. In an extension of this work, we report findings from a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study.
   Method: Ten pregnant women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned from April 2000 to January 2002 to a 5-week clinical trial with either a 7000 lux (active) or 500 lux (placebo) light box. At the end of the randomized controlled trial, subjects had the option of continuing in a 5-week extension phase. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version was administered to assess changes in clinical status. Salivary melatonin was used to index circadian rhythm phase for comparison with antidepressant results.
   Results: Although there was a small mean group advantage of active treatment throughout the randomized controlled trial, it was not statistically significant. However, in the longer 10-week trial, the presence of active versus placebo light produced a clear treatment effect (p = .001) with an effect size (0.43) similar to that seen in antidepressant drug trials. Successful treatment with bright light was associated with phase advances of the melatonin rhythm.
   Conclusion: These findings provide additional evidence for an active effect of bright light therapy for antepartum depression and underscore the need for an expanded randomized clinical trial.

AB Background. Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV), increased alveolar difference for oxygen and, in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related disturbances, these changes could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep.
   Objective. Because of conflicting data from respiratory sleep studies in pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 21 pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO2) in the supine and sitting positions.
   Methods. We tested 21 healthy pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation. Arterial samples were taken in the sitting position. Complete polysomnography was performed in all of the pregnant women. Before the polysomnography arterial samples were taken in the supine and sitting positions and then every 2 h until termination of the study.
   Results. We did not find any correlation between SaO(2)/PaO2 levels and apnea, hypopnea or percent of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea was significantly lower during pregnancy (5.81 +/- 2.1 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) than postpartum (12.1 +/- 2.7 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) (p < 0.001), which may be due to the raised level of progesterone. The PaO2 levels in the supine position were significantly lower than in the sitting position at 36 weeks of gestation (p < 0.001). No differences were found between PaO2 levels in the sitting and supine positions postpartum (p < 0.5).
   Conclusions. According to our results we conclude that 1) the frequency of apnea and hypopnea in pregnancy was significantly lower than postpartum, and 2) a significant difference in PaO2 levels in the sitting and supine positions was observed at 36 weeks of gestation.

AB We tested the hypothesis that in primates, maternal melatonin restrains fetal and newborn adrenal cortisol production. A functional G-protein-coupled MT1 membrane-bound melatonin receptor was detected in 90% gestation capuchin monkey fetal adrenals by (a) 2-[I-125] iodomelatonin binding (K-d, 75.7+/-6.9 pm; B-max, 2.6+/-0.4 fmol (mg protein)(-1)), (b) cDNA identification, and (c) melatonin inhibition of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)- and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH)-stimulated cortisol but not of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHAS) production in vitro. Melatonin also inhibited ACTH-induced 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase mRNA expression. To assess the physiological relevance of these findings, we next studied the effect of chronic maternal melatonin suppression (induced by exposure to constant light during the last third of gestation) on maternal plasma oestradiol during gestation and on plasma cortisol concentration in the 4- to 6-day-old newborn. Constant light suppressed maternal melatonin without affecting maternal plasma oestradiol concentration, consistent with no effect on fetal DHAS, the precursor of maternal oestradiol. However, newborns from mothers under constant light condition had twice as much plasma cortisol as newborns from mothers maintained under a normal light-dark schedule. Newborns from mothers exposed to chronic constant light and daily melatonin replacement had normal plasma cortisol concentration. Our results support a role of maternal melatonin in fetal and neonatal primate cortisol regulation.

AB We measured core body temperatures of three pregnant ewes and their fetuses by means of chronically implanted temperature-sensitive data loggers. In standard laboratory conditions (dry-bulb temperature 20-22degreesC) core body temperatures of pregnant sheep and their fetuses during the last trimester of pregnancy demonstrated a constant fetomaternal temperature gradient, and a daily thermal circadian rhythm for the mother and fetus with a small amplitude (<1degreesC). When the same pregnant ewes were transferred to a natural field habitat where dry-bulb temperature varied between 7degreesC and 27degreesC in a 24 h period, there was a marked increase in the amplitude of ewe nychthemeral temperature rhythms (similar to2degreesC). There was similarly an increase in fetal temperature rhythms, but the variations were smaller. Immediately after birth in the field, the core temperature of newborn lambs fell by up to 4.5degreesC. Thereafter, newborn lambs increased their core body temperatures and appeared to regulate core temperature and daily temperature rhythms at the same levels that they were as fetuses. Only in the second month post-birth do lamb core temperatures and temperature rhythms begin to resemble those of adult sheep. We have shown that fetal thermal protection, which is evident in ewes housed in in-door conditions, persists in natural field conditions also, where fetuses appear to be more protected from night-time falls- than daytime rises in maternal core temperature.

AB Objective. This is a prospective study of the effects of maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy on newborn neurobehavioral integrity, including systematic measures of behavioral state, sleep organization, motor activity, heart rate variability (HRV), tremulousness, and startles.
   Methods. The sample included 17 SSRI-exposed and 17 nonexposed, full-birth-weight newborn infants who had no obvious medical problems and were matched on maternal cigarette use, social class, and maternal age. SSRI exposure was determined by medical records and maternal self-report during a standard interview. Behavioral state, startles, and tremulousness were evaluated for 1 hour between feedings. Automated recordings of motor activity and HRV were also assessed during a 15-minute subset sleep period. HRV was subjected to spectral analysis to detect rhythms in autonomic regulation. Exposed and nonexposed infant groups were compared on measures of neurobehavioral development both before and after adjustment for gestational age as a covariate.
   Results. SSRI-exposed infants had a shorter mean gestational age; were more motorically active and tremulous; and showed fewer rhythms in HRV, fewer changes in behavioral state, fewer different behavioral states, and a lower peak behavioral state. SSRI-exposed infants also had significantly more rapid eye movement sleep, which was characterized by longer continuous bouts in that state and higher numbers of spontaneous startles or sudden arousals. After effects of gestational age were covaried, significant differences continued to be found in tremulousness and all measures of state and sleep organization, but effects on startles, motor activity, and rhythms in HRV were no longer significant.
   Conclusions. Results provide the first systematic evidence that women who use SSRIs during pregnancy have healthy, full-birth-weight newborn infants who show disruptions in a wide range of neurobehavioral outcomes. Effects on motor activity, startles, and HRV may be mediated through the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age. Future research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of SSRI use during pregnancy and an improved public health outcome.

AB Study Objectives: Recent studies suggest a specific association between intrauterine growth restriction that commonly occurs in preeclampsia and decreased maternal cardiac output. Sleep is associated with marked hypertension in preeclampsia. We therefore aimed to determine how sleep influences other hemodynamic parameters in preeclampsia, specifically to determine if sleep-induced exacerbation of hypertension was associated with reductions in cardiac output.
   Study Design: Randomized controlled trial of nasal continuous positive airway pressure.
   Setting: King George V, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.
   Patients: Twenty-four women with severe preeclampsia and 15 control nulliparous subjects.
   Intervention: Full polysomnography including beat-to-beat blood-pressure recording. Stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and ejection duration were derived from the blood pressure waveform. Half of the 24 preeclamptic subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure and the other half to receive no treatment.
   Measurements and Results: Heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac out-put were similar in controls and patients with preeclampsia during wakefulness, while total peripheral resistance was significantly elevated. Sleep induced marked decrements in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output in preeclamptic subjects and resulted in further increments in total peripheral resistance. Cardiac output during sleep was correlated with fetal birth weight (r(2) = 0.64, P < .001). When preeclamptic subjects were treated with continuous positive airway pressure, reductions in cardiac output were minimized, while increments in total peripheral resistance were also reduced.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that sleep is associated with adverse hemodynamic changes in women with preeclampsia. These changes are minimized with the use of continuous positive airway pressure. Reduced cardiac output during sleep may have an adverse effect on fetal development.

AB The roll back malaria (RBM) movement promotes the use of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) of malaria infection as preventive measures against the adverse effects of malaria among pregnant women in Africa. To determine the use of these preventive measures we undertook a community-based survey of recently pregnant women randomly selected from communities in four districts of Kenya in December 2001. Of the 1814 women surveyed, only 5% had slept under an ITN. More than half of the 13% of women using a bednet (treated or untreated) had bought their nets from shops or markets. Women from rural areas used bednets less than urban women (11%vs. 27%; P < 0.001), and 41% of the bednets used by rural women had been obtained free of charge from a research project in Bondo or a nationwide UNICEF donation through antenatal clinics (ANCs). Despite 96% of ANC providers being aware of IPT with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), only 5% of women interviewed had received two or more doses of SP as a presumptive treatment. The coverage of pregnant women with at least one dose of IPT with SP was 14%, though a similar percentage also had received at least a single dose as a curative treatment. The coverage of nationally recommended strategies to prevent malaria during pregnancy during 2001 was low across the diverse malaria ecology of Kenya. Rapid expansion of access to these services is required to meet international and national targets by the year 2005. The scaling up of malaria prevention programmes through ANC services should be possible with 74% of women visiting ANCs at least twice in all four districts. Issues of commodity supply and service costs to clients will be the greatest impediments to reaching RBM targets.

AB Objective To determine the relationship between umbilical venous (UV) volume flow and fetal behavioral states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) in normal pregnancies at 36-40 weeks of gestation.
   Methods Fetal behavioral states were established in 17 normal pregnancies by means of combined assessment of fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP), and fetal eye and body movements. UV vessel area (mm(2)) as obtained by tracing the inner vessel area using Labview and Imaq Vision software and UV time-averaged flow velocity (mm/s Doppler) were multiplied to calculate UV volume flow (mL/min) including flow/kg fetus. The pulsatility index (PI) in the umbilical artery was also determined. In each woman, all parameters were measured between three and five times in each behavioral state. Data are reported as mean +/-1 SD and analyzed by paired t-test.
   Results No statistically significant behavioral-state-related changes were observed for UV time-averaged velocity and UV volume flow, resulting in UV volume flow/kg fetus of 69.1 +/- 14.9 mL/min*kg at 1F and 71.6 +/- 12.1 mL/min*kg at 2F (not significant). A statistically significant increase (P = 0.02) was established for UV cross-sectional area (46.4 +/- 8.6 mm(2) VS. 49.0 +/- 10.1 mm(2)) and for fetal heart rate (FHR) from 134.2 +/- 10.3 bpm in 1F to 144.2 +/- 7 bpm in 2F. Umbilical artery PI was not significantly different between the two behavioral states.
   Conclusions On the basis of high venous vessel wall compliance, the significant increase in UV cross-sectional area during fetal behavioral state 2F may be determined by a rise in mean venous pressure. The significant rise in FHR may reflect increased fetal cardiac output during state 2F while the resistance at the hepato-ductal pathway remains relatively constant with the purpose of meeting raised energy demands during the active sleep state. This is further supported by the observed trend towards an increase in UV volume flow. Copyright (C) 2004 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Sudden unexplained infant death in 20 regions in Europe: case control

SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID SLEEPING POSITION; RISK-FACTORS; COT DEATH; SMOKING
AB Background After striking changes in rates of sudden unexplained infant death (SIDS) around 1990, four large case-control studies were set up to re-examine the epidemiology of this syndrome. The European Concerted Action on SIDS (ECAS) investigation was planned to bring together data from these and new studies to give an overview of risk factors for the syndrome in Europe.
   Methods We undertook case-control studies in 20 regions. Data for more than 60 variables were extracted from anonymised records of 745 SIDS cases and 2411 live controls. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for every factor in isolation, and to construct multivariate models.
   Findings Principal risk factors were largely independent. Multivariately significant ORs showed little evidence of intercentre heterogeneity apart from four outliers, which were eliminated. Highly significant risks were associated with prone sleeping (OR 13.1 [95% Cl 8.51-20-2]) and with turning from the side to the prone position (45.4 [23.4-87.9]). About 48% of cases were attributable to sleeping in the side or prone position. If the mother smoked, significant risks were associated with bed-sharing, especially during the first weeks of life (at 2 weeks 27.0 [13.3-54.9]). This OR was partly attributable to mother's consumption of alcohol. Mother's alcohol consumption was significant only when baby bed-shared all night (OR increased by 1.66 [1.16-2.38] per drink). For mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, OR for bed-sharing was very small (at 2 weeks 2.4 [1.2-4.6]) and only significant during the first 8 weeks of life. About 16% of cases were attributable to bed-sharing and roughly 36% to the baby sleeping in a separate room.
   Interpretation Avoidable risk factors such as those associated with inappropriate infants' sleeping position, type of bedding used, and sleeping arrangements strongly suggest a basis for further substantial reductions in SIDS incidence rates.

AB The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were addressed: (1) biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the toxic effects of alcohol; (2) alcohol and gene-environment interactions that affect the health of diverse groups; (3) alcohol pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans; (4) determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority populations; (5) consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence: (6) interaction between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep, nocturnal cytokines, and immunity: (7) disparities of brain functional reserve capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8) alcohol and pregnancy disparities; (9) role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10) ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11) postmenopausal health disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1) Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. (2) These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3) Differences between and among population groups can be critically important for the design and interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. (4) Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for these differences. (5) The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found in white Hispanic men. (6) Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the protective alleles ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 and a relatively high frequency of CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7) The incidence rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID PREGNANCY
AB Our objective was to identify stressors in women requiring prolonged hospitalization following maternal-fetal transfer to a tertiary care center. Using a modified version of the previously validated Anteparturn Hospital Stressors Inventory (AHSI), all women transferred to our university-based maternal-fetal service between May 2000 and June 2002 and hospitalized for greater than 1 month completed a semi-structured interview. The AHSI uses Likert scales to evaluate environment, health factors, communication with health care providers, family separation, self-image, and emotional and family status issues as stressors. Nine consecutive women met inclusion criteria and all agreed to participate. Median maternal age was 27 years (range 19 to 33), and gestational age at transfer was 25 weeks (range 20 to 31). Parity ranged from 0 to 3 and educational level ranged from grade 2 to graduate degrees. The women were from Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian racial-ethnic backgrounds; all were married. Median distance from transferring hospital was 20 miles (range 10 to 275 miles). All patients reported separation from family, sleeping alone, anxiety about the pregnancy and the baby's health, boredom, and eating hospital meals as the greatest stressors. Stress was relieved in all women by ultrasounds, family members staying in the room, cable television, and internet access. Routine beauty maintenance, massage, physical therapy, and continued contact with referring physician were also cited as stress alleviators. Following maternal-fetal transfer, prolonged anteparturn hospitalization is associated with stress that may be alleviated by access to the outside world via television and the internet, liberal visitation, access to health and beauty maintenance, and ongoing contact with the referring physician.

AB Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone [CRH; also known as Corticotrophin Releasing Factor (CRF)], a 41-amino-acid hormone, is one of the body's major modulators of the stress response. CRH coordinates the endocrine, autonomic, and behavioural responses to stress through actions in both the brain and the periphery activating the 'fight or flight' response. CRH is also implicated in various neurological disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and anorexia nervosa, and it has been described as a biological clock controlling the length of gestation in humans and other higher-order primates. In the past decade there has been an enormous effort expended in the design and development of new therapeutic agents targetting CRHs in the central nervous and peripheral systems. In this review, we examine the chemistry and recent developments in this exciting field.

AB Aim: To determine whether high levels of maternal physical activity ( dancing during pregnancy), influenced the offspring. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four women ( 32 of whom had continued to dance for at least 2 months after the beginning of pregnancy) filled in a questionnaire to assess the health and behavior of their offspring, now 11-15 years of age. Results: More children born from women who had continued to dance during pregnancy needed to be rocked to sleep during their first year (p < 0.05). More children in the study group played musical instruments (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding other parameters. Conclusions: The greater need to be rocked to fall asleep and the attitude to play musical instruments recorded in the children of dancers may be related to prenatal maternal movement. But they may also be due to other causes as discussed. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Background: Heart period variability provides a measure of balance between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the PNS develops during the final weeks of gestation, premature infants have an overriding SNS. Spectral power analysis of heart period variability reveals two main frequency regions, the low frequency region (LF) representing primarily SNS activity and the high frequency region (HF) representing PNS activity. Objectives: To identify the characteristics of heart period power in the LF and HF regions in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in the neonatal intensive care unit across gestational age groups and between sleep and awake states. Methods: Data were collected from 16 intubated and mechanically ventilated VLBW infants with respiratory disease. Using spectral analysis techniques, heart period power in the two main frequency regions was extracted. Results: HF power did not improve with gestational age as expected. LF power did increase with age, albeit nonsignificantly. LF and HF power were not significantly different between awake and sleep states. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study suggest that PNS tone does not improve with gestational age in VLBW infants with respiratory disease. The intensive care environment may stimulate a sympathetic response in these infants and disrupt normal PNS development. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Activity-rest behavior of 20 neonates born vaginally, 18 neonates born by medically planned Cesarean section (C-section), and 19 neonates born by medically required C-section after labor onset (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record and show time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small wristwatch-like Actiwatch((R)) actometers. Nursing/feeding times were recorded by using the actometers' integrated event marker button. Recordings in both C-section groups were performed in the hospital; for neonates born vaginally and for some born by C-section, recordings were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation. Amount of sleep time during daytime, nighttime, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during the daytime and nighttime, were compared. The majority of vaginally born neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency in their spectra. In contrast, both groups of neonates born by C-section showed significantly less distinct circadian frequencies in their spectra. All three groups showed a significant difference in amount of nighttime sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at nighttime. There were no differences in the amount of nighttime sleep, daytime sleep, and sleep time during 24h between the groups born by different delivery modes.

AB The large-amplitude circadian pattern in blood pressure of healthy subjects of both genders suggests that the constant threshold currently used to diagnose hypertension should be replaced by a time-specified reference limit reflecting the mostly predictable blood pressure variability during the 24h. Accordingly, we derived circadian time-specified reference standards for blood pressure as a function of gender. We studied 743 normotensive Caucasian volunteers (400 men and 343 women), 45.7 +/- 16.5 (mean +/-SD) years of age. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory monitoring at 20-min intervals during the day and at 30-min intervals at night for 48 consecutive hours. Data from each blood pressure series were synchronized according to the rest-activity cycle of each individual in order to avoid differences among subjects in actual times of daily activity. Data were then used to compute 90% circadian tolerance intervals for each gender separately. The method, derived on the basis of bootstrap techniques, does not need to assume normality or symmetry in the data and, therefore, it is highly appropriate to describe the circadian pattern of blood pressure variability. Results reflect expected changes in the tolerance limits as a function of gender and circadian sampling time, as well as upper blood pressure limits below the thresholds currently used for diagnosing hypertension, especially for women. The use of these time-dependent tolerance limits for the computation of a hyperbaric index as a measure of blood pressure excess has already been shown to provide a reproducible and high-sensitivity test for the diagnosis of hypertension, which can also be used to evaluate treatment efficacy.

AB Aims: To evaluate whether maternal blood cortisol acts as an entrainer of the fetus, we compared diurnal variations in the fetal heart rate (FHR) of two cases with Cushing's syndrome, under condition of glucocorticoid replacement therapy after adrenalectomy. Subjects: The Maternal cortisol concentration in Case 1 showed bimodal change, at 31 and 38 weeks' gestation, while the concentration in Case 2 was found to have an abnormally high level with no diurnal variation at 30 weeks and a monomodal pattern at 34 weeks. Results: The FHR patterns in both cases demonstrated similar developmental change: a remarkable diurnal rhythm comparable to control cases was observed at 34-38 weeks. Analysis of spectral 1/f characteristics revealed, however, that Case 1 exhibited a pattern equivalent to control cases, whereas in Case 2, FHR values did not display overt diurnal variation. Conclusions: The diurnal rhythm of FHR develops irrespective of daily variation in maternal cortisol concentration. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The benefits of breastfeeding are multiplied in twins and higher-order multiples. Mother and family of multiple births are facing unique and extraordinary physical, emotional and economic demands. They need skillful and continuous assistance during postpartum, infancy and toddler to develop breastfeeding, parenting and household management plan. Feeding and caring for each infant, care of older siblings, delegation of household tasks and rest time for the mother should all be taken into consideration. A social support network to reduce isolation, give help and protect parents' sleep is needed. Coordination and cooperation between health system, community and social support service is necessary to improve the initiation and duration of breastfeeding multiples.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of the SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure monitor among pregnant women. Methods: Patients participating in research projects involving ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pregnancy (N = 110) were asked to complete a questionnaire relating to patient satisfaction on completion of the monitoring period. The first part of the questionnaire involved rating on a visual Likert scale (0-10) whether they found the monitor heavy, noisy, cumbersome, disturbing, or embarrassing to wear. The second part of the questionnaire addressed whether cuff inflation caused significant sleep disturbance or physical discomfort. Outcome Measures: The mean (SD) and range of the Likert scores are reported. The number of patients reporting sleep disturbance or physical discomfort was calculated. Logistic regression was used to examine which factors were significant predictors of discontinuing monitoring. Results: The mean (SD) responses measured by the Liken scores were: finding the monitor heavy 3.2 (2.3); comfortable 4.8 (2.3); straightforward to use 8.8 (1.8); cumbersome 3.8 (2.3); disturbing 4.5 (2.7); noisy 1.6 (2.2); and embarrassing to wear 1.7 (2.1). Difficulty initiating steep was reported by 28.8% of patients, and a further 56.3% reported difficulty maintaining sleep due to the monitor. Sleep disturbance was found to be the strongest predictor [r = 0.52; OR 1.68 (1.23, 2.27), p = 0.0009] for the 15% of patients discontinuing the monitoring. Conclusions: While pregnant women tolerate the noise, weight, inconvenience, and disturbance associated with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) well, sleep disturbance is a major cause of dissatisfaction and noncompliance. Future studies should evaluate critically the number of nocturnal blood pressure assessments required, and should allow for a withdrawal rate of approximately 15% when performing sample size calculations for ABPM studies in pregnancy.

   EXERCISE
AB Peripheral chemoreceptors ( carotid and aortic bodies) detect changes in arterial blood oxygen and initiate reflexes that are important for maintaining homeostasis during hypoxemia. This mini-review summarizes the importance of peripheral chemoreceptor reflexes in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Carotid bodies are important for eliciting hypoxic ventilatory stimulation in humans and in experimental animals. In the absence of carotid bodies, compensatory upregulation of aortic bodies as well as other chemoreceptors contributes to the hypoxic ventilatory response. Peripheral chemoreceptors are critical for ventilatory acclimatization at high altitude. They also contribute in part to the exercise-induced hyperventilation, especially with submaximal and heavy exercise. During pregnancy, hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity increases, perhaps due to the actions of estrogen and progesterone on chemoreceptors. Augmented peripheral chemoreceptors have been implicated in early stages of recurrent apneas, congestive heart failure, and certain forms of hypertension. It is likely that chemoreceptors tend to maintain oxygen homeostasis and act as a defense mechanism to prevent the progression of the morbidity associated with these diseases. Experimental models of recurrent apneas, congestive heart failure, and hypertension offer excellent opportunities to unravel the cellular mechanisms associated with altered chemoreceptor function.

AB Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a condition that accompanies many seemingly unrelated diseases. It is commonly associated with various clinical conditions such as pregnancy, aging, pulmonary diseases, cancers, and other systemic illnesses. The condition has been attributed to various causes such as platelet abnormalities, hormonal disturbances, and cytokine dysfunction, but the exact underlying mechanism has been elusive. We propose a unifying hypothesis that activation of the adrenergic system is the common thread that links all of the disparate clinical associations of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. In diseased states, autonomic stimulation may occur as a result of chemoreceptor activation in response to acidosis, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. Examples include sleep apnea, congestive heart failure., renal failure, and. tumor-induced. hypoxia. In this setting, clinical signs of HOA may be a marker of underlying autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic stimulation may also occur as a normal part of pregnancy or as an abnormal component of aging. The exact pathway linking adrenergic excess to HOA remains to be clarified, but a plausible scenario based on current molecular evidence is offered. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effect of daily maternal methadone maintenance treatment on the quality and quantity of fetal movement. Methods: At 34-37 weeks gestation, real-time ultrasound recordings were obtained from 17 methadone treated and 17 non-opioid-dependent mothers at two time points relative to the methadone mothers' daily dose of methadone. The first observation was just prior to the mother taking her daily dose (Time A) and the second was 1-h postdose (Time B). The incidence and pattern of fetal breathing movements (FBMs), fetal trunk movements (FTMs) and total fetal activity (TFA) were obtained from these ultrasounds. Results: A time by group effect was found for measures of FBM and TFA, Fs(1,32)=6.06 and 4.94, P<0.05. At Time A and Time B for these measures t-tests showed no difference in the incidence of FBM (47.9% vs. 55.4%) and TFA (56% vs. 64%) at Time A between the methadone and comparison groups; however, at Time B the incidence of FBM (16.6% vs. 53.5%) and TFA (27% vs. 65%) was decreased for the methadone group. In addition, there was a between-group difference for two qualitative measures of fetal breathing. A slower rate of fetal breathing (40.3 vs. 47.2 breaths/min) and fewer FBMs per breathing episode (51.7 vs. 92.4) were found for the methadone group regardless of time since the mothers' daily dose. Conclusion: Taken together these results suggest that daily maternal methadone maintenance treatment altered both quantitative and qualitative measures of fetal activity that have been found to be related to normal fetal development.

AB We used linked birth/infant death records of over 23 million singletons belonging to six birth cohorts (1989-91 and 1995-97) and examined changes in race differentials in the overall and cause-specific infant mortality risks across time in the United States. Results show that infant mortality declined for all races during the time period, with disproportionately greater declines among non-Hispanic American Indians (AIs). Among the leading causes of infant death, declines in mortality from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and congenital anomalies contributed the most to the overall decline in infant mortality in the 1995-97 cohorts, compared with the 1989-91 cohorts. Disproportionately greater reductions in mortality resulting from SIDS and congenital anomalies led to more rapid mortality declines among non-Hispanic AIs than for other races. There are disturbing findings that infants of almost every race experienced increases in mortality from newborn affected by maternal complications of pregnancy (maternal complications) and that none of the race groups experienced a significant decline in mortality from disorders resulting from short gestation/low birthweight.

AB The relationship between circadian rhythmicity and rodent reproductive cyclicity is well established, but the impact of disrupted clock gene function on reproduction has not been well established. The present study evaluated the reproductive performance of mice carrying the Clock Delta(19) mutation that were either melatonin deficient ( Clock(Delta19/Delta19)) or had the capacity to synthesise melatonin reinstated ( Clock(Delta19/Delta19) + MEL). The Clock(Delta19/Delta19) mice took 2 - 3 days longer to mate, and to subsequently deliver pups, than their control line. The melatonin-competent mutants had a smaller, but still significant ( P < 0.05), delay. The Clock(&UDelta;19) mutation resulted in smaller median litter sizes compared with control lines ( seven v. eight pups; P < 0.05), whereas melatonin proficiency reversed this difference. Survival to weaning was 84% and 80% for the Clock(Delta19/Delta19) and Clock(Delta19/Delta19) + MEL lines, respectively, compared with 94 - 96% for the two control lines. The Clock(Delta19/Delta19) mutants became behaviourally arrhythmic in constant darkness but, despite this, seven of seven became pregnant when paired with males after at least 14 days of constant darkness ( five of seven within 4 days of pairing). In the Clock(Delta19/Delta19) + MEL mice, seven of 15 became arrhythmic in constant darkness but still became pregnant. The seven mice that free ran for at least 14 days in constant darkness with a period of 27.1 h also became pregnant. The present study has demonstrated that the Clock(Delta19) mutation has significant, but subtle, effects on reproductive performance. The reintroduction of melatonin competency and/ or other genes as a result of crosses with CBA mice reduced the impact of the mutation further. It would appear that redundancy in genes in the circadian system allows the reproductive cyclicity to persist in mice, albeit at a suboptimal level.

AB Objective: To investigate the tolerance, compliance and problems associated with usage of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by pregnant women with sleep disordered breathing (SDB).
   Patients and method: Twelve pregnant women diagnosed with SDB received polysomnography (PSG) at entry, CPAP titration, repeat PSG at 6 months gestation (GA) and home monitoring of cardio-respiratory variables at 8 months GA. Compliance was verified by the pressure at the mask. Results from the Epworth sleepiness scale, fatigue scale and visual analogue scales (VAS) for sleepiness, fatigue, and snoring were compared over time.
   Results: All of the subjects had full term pregnancies and healthy infants. Nightly compliance was at least 4 h initially and 6.5 h at 6 months GA. Nasal CPAP significantly improved all scales compared to entry. VAS scores remained lower at 6 months GA compared to entry. Re-adjustment of CPAP pressure was needed in six subjects at 6 months GA.
   Conclusion: Nasal CPAP is a safe and effective treatment of SDB during pregnancy. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Air passenger miles will likely double by year 2020. The altered and restrictive environment in an airliner cabin can influence haematological homeostasis in passengers and crew. Flight-related deep venous thromboemboli (DVT) have been associated with at least 577 deaths on 42 of 120 airlines from 1977 to 1984 (25 deaths/million departures), whereas many such cases go unreported. However, there are four major factors that could influence formation of possible flight-induced DVT: sleeping accommodations (via sitting immobilisation); travellers' medical history (via tissue injury); cabin environmental factors (via lower partial pressure,of oxygen and lower relative humidity); and the more encompassing chair-rest deconditioning (C-RD) syndrome. There is ample evidence that recent injury and surgery (especially in deconditioned hospitalised patients) facilitate thrombophlebitis acid formation of DVT that may be exacerbated by the immobilisation of prolonged air travel.
   In the healthy flying population, immobilisation factors associated with prolonged (>5 hours) C-RD such as total body dehydration, hypovolaemia and increased blood viscosity, and reduced venous blood flow (pooling) in the legs may facilitate formation of DVT. However, data from at least four case-controlled epidemiological studies did not confirm a direct causative relationship. between air travel and DVT, but factors such as a history of vascular thromboemboli, venous insufficiency, chronic heart failure, obesity, immobile standing position, more than three pregnancies, infectious disease, long-distance travel, muscular trauma and violent physical effort were significantly more frequent in DVT patients than in controls. Thus, there is no clear, direct evidence yet that prolonged sitting in airliner seats, or prolonged experimental chair-rest or bed-rest deconditioning. treatments cause DVT in healthy people.

DE SID; SIDS; sudden infant death; sudden infant death syndrome; prevention
AB In Germany there are several commited self-help groups as well as numerous medical authorities and specialist associations which however haven't got together yet in order to set up a systematic health education campaign. So far the knowledge of other professional fields like that of graphic designers, specialists of communication and public health scientists hasn't been sufficiently used to familiarize nearly all pregnant women, parents, grandparents and babysitters with those known medical subject matters. Hopefully paediatricians, gynaecologists, children's nurses, midwives, breast-feeding consultants, paediatric preventive assistants, consultants for pregnant women who smoke and mothers in general will soon start to get going an effective lasting and possibly nationwide preventive campaign which will be supported by the competent social ministries and financing authorities, self-help groups, graphic designers, specialists for communication and public health scientists. The aim should be to reduce the amount of sudden infant death cases to or even below the level of The Netherlands (minimum figure in 2002: 0.11 SID cases per 1.000 live births).
   Already in 1972-15 years before the beginning of the Dutch preventive campaign - in former East Germany a ministerial instruction had advised mothers not to let infants sleep on prone position. Historically, the promotion of infants sleeping on prone position seems to have been a tragic break of tradition in the western world in between 1970 and 1990, as infants had been put to sleep almost only on their back during the past centuries. If we compare East and West Germany concerning the influence on the ways of looking after infants since the 1960(th) of the last century it has become clear that the advice of medical authorities mainly effects the way of nursing regardless of the political system. More and more, paediatricians, gynaecologists, midwives and children's nurses should become aware of this responsibility.

AB In the current study, design and success of intervention programmes to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Austria are described and major future challenges indicated.
   Various prevention programmes are being carried out in the federal states of Austria and they focus on the detailed information of parents about modifiable SIDS risk factors. Relevant topics such as guidelines for home monitoring are carefully addressed in the Austrian consensus statements.
   With the introduction of the first campaigns SIDS incidence rates have gradually dropped from 1.69 (1988) to 0.51 per 1000 life births (2000). In line, there was a decline in the prevalence of risk behaviour, especially of the prone sleeping position (federal state of the Tyrol: 53.7% before the campaign (1984-1994) vs. 4.7% thereafter (1995-2001), p < 0.001). Because of this latter trend smoking during pregnancy became the most prevalent SIDS risk factor and the prevalence of the side sleeping position substantially increased.
   To maintain the current success in lowering SIDS frequency, prevention programmes ought to continue and changes in the weight of risk factors should be considered. Further efforts are required to achieve a thorough post-mortem examination in virtually all sudden unexpected deaths, to establish a country-wide SIDS data base and to continuously update SIDS risk profiles in Austria.

AB Interactions exist between progestins and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subtype A where C-21-steroids function as activators. Other interactions between progesterone and neurotransmitter systems include stimulation of dopamine release in striatal tissue, stimulation of GnRH release from hypothalamic neurons and inhibition of opioid receptor binding and activation. Cyproterone acetate increases dopaminergic responses and binds to opiate receptors independently of its classical effect on the androgen receptor. Progesterone substitution in perimenopausal women promotes length and quality of sleep. This effect seems most prominent for progesterone administered vaginally.
   Progestins also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Migraine symptoms occur predominantly during the perimenstrual stage. Women who suffer from menstrual migraine triggered by premenstrual progesterone loss often benefit from cyclic progesterone administration. This may be because progesterone and allopregnenolone reduce meningeal release of substance P and inhibit the development of neurogenic oedema. Women whose migraine symptoms subside during pregnancy, however, benefit from intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate. Progesterone, generated from pregnenolone by Schwann cells, also enhances myelin synthesis. Myelination of axons is promoted when progesterone is added to cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. No reliable data exist with respect to the effects of other progestins on demyelinating disease. Progestins promote the growth of meningioma as progesterone receptors predominate in meningioma tissue. Progesterone and synthetic progestins should therefore not be prescribed in these patients.

AB Aim: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS) in the sleeping environment of Irish infants.
   Methods: A five year population based case- control study with parental interviews conducted for each case and three controls matched for age, place of birth, and last sleep period. A total of 203 SIDS cases and 622 control infants born 1994 - 98 were studied.
   Results: In a multivariate analysis, co- sleeping significantly increased the risk of SIDS both as a usual practice ( adjusted OR 4.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 17.37) and during the last sleep period ( adjusted OR 16.47; 95% CI 3.73 to 72.75). The associated risk was dependent on maternal smoking ( OR 21.84; 95% CI 2.27 to 209.89), and was not significant for infants who were greater than or equal to 20 weeks of age ( OR 2.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 70.10) or placed back in their own cot/ bed to sleep ( OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.21 to 5.41). The use of pillows, duvets, and bedding with tog value greater than or equal to 10 were not significant risk factors when adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, including maternal smoking and social disadvantage. However, the prone sleeping position remains a significant SIDS risk factor, and among infants using soothers, the absence of soother use during the last sleep period also significantly increased the SIDS risk ( OR 5.83; CI 2.37 to 14.36).
   Conclusion: Co- sleeping should be avoided in infants who are,20 weeks of age, or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. The prone position remains a factor in some SIDS deaths, and the relation between soother use and SIDS is a complex variable requiring further study.

AB Prenatal stress (PS) can produce profound and long-lasting perturbations of individual adaptive capacities, which in turn can result in an increased proneness to behavioural disorders. Indeed, in PS rats there is evidence of impaired social play behaviour, disturbances in a variety of circadian rhythms, enhanced anxiety and increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. This study was designed to experimentally investigate the degree of reversibility of PS-induced disturbances of social play and HPA reactivity by assessing the effect of the enrichment of the physical environment on PS rats during periadolescence. PS subjects showed a reduced expression of social play behaviour and a prolonged corticosterone secretion in response to restraint stress, but both these effects were markedly reversed following environmental enrichment. Interestingly, the enrichment procedure increased social behaviour but had no effect on corticosterone secretion in nonstressed animals, indicating a differential impact of the postnatal environment as a function of prenatal background. As a whole, results clearly indicate that rats prenatally exposed to stress can benefit during periadolescence from the modulatory effects of an enriched environment. Moreover, they confirm that PS may well represent a suitable animal model for the design and testing of new therapeutic strategies for behavioural disorders produced by early insults.

AB The crude birth rate in 2002 was 13.9 births per 1000 population, the lowest ever reported for the United States. The number of births, the crude birth rate, and the fertility rate (64.8) all declined slightly ( by 1% or less) from 2001 to 2002. Fertility rates were highest for Hispanic women (94.0), followed by black (65.4), Asian or Pacific Islander (63.9), Native American (58.0), and non-Hispanic white women (57.5). Fertility rates declined slightly for all race/ethnic groups from 2001 to 2002.
   The birth rate for teen mothers continued to fall, dropping 5% from 2001 to 2002 to 42.9 births per 1000 women aged 15 to 19 years, another record low. The teen birth rate has fallen 31% since 1991; declines were more rapid for younger teens aged 15 to 17 (40%) than for older teens aged 18 to 19 (23%). The proportion of all births to unmarried women remained approximately the same at one third. Smoking during pregnancy continued to decline; smoking rates were highest among teen mothers.
   In 2002, 26.1% of births were delivered by cesarean section, up 7% since 2001 and 26% since 1996. The primary cesarean rate has risen 23% since 1996, whereas the rate of vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery has fallen 55%. The use of timely prenatal care increased slightly to 83.8% in 2002. From 1990 to 2002, the use of timely prenatal care increased by 6% ( to 88.7%) for non-Hispanic white women, by 24% ( to 75.2%) for black women, and by 28% ( to 76.8%) for Hispanic women, thus narrowing racial disparities.
   The percentage of preterm births rose to 12.0% in 2002, from 10.6% in 1990 and 9.4% in 1981. Increases were largest for non-Hispanic white women. The percentage of low birth weight ( LBW) births also increased to 7.8% in 2002, up from 6.7% in 1984. Twin and triplet/+ birth rates both increased by 3% from 2000 to 2001. Multiple births accounted for 3.2% of all births in 2001.
   The infant mortality rate (IMR) was 6.9 per 1000 live births ( provisional data) in 2002 compared with 6.8 in 2001 ( final data). The ratio of the IMR among black infants to that for white infants was 2.5 in 2001, the same as in 2000. Racial differences in infant mortality remain a major public health concern. The role of LBW in infant mortality remains a major issue. New Hampshire, Utah, and Massachusetts had the lowest IMRs. State-by-state differences in IMR reflect racial composition, the percentage of LBW, and birth weight - specific neonatal mortality rates for each state. The United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality.
   Expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 77.2 years for all sex and race groups combined in 2001. Death rates in the United States continue to decline. Between 2000 and 2001, death rates declined for the 3 leading causes of death: diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases. Death rates for children ages 1 to 19 years decreased for unintentional injuries by 3.3% in 2001; the death rate for chronic lower respiratory diseases decreased by 25% in 2001. Cancer and suicide levels did not change for children ages 1 to 19. A large proportion of childhood deaths continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

AB In the mid 1970's, a series of psychosocial studies about children and adolescents living on the street was started at the Mexican Center of Addictions (Centro Mexicano de Estudios en Farmacodependencia). These studies have been followed by different research teams for the past 25 years at the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente.
   Ever since its beginnings, this research has rendered relevant knowledge about the diversity of situations that endanger the children's mental health on the streets, as,well as of their strategies to face adversities. The information obtained has been very useful to develop intervention programs and to consult, train, and express recommendations to both governmental and non-governmental organizations in charge of caring for childhood 'on street situation'. The development of this series of studies can be divided into two broad periods.
   In the first stage, both qualitative and quantitative research were focused on understanding the problems of child sustenance on the streets. The qualitative studies intended to describe the use of inhalants among children living on the streets. Also, the study observed the children's social organization, values, and the personal characteristics needed to prevail. To that effect, a group of 23 boys and one girl that slept on the streets was observed. The group was in average 9 years old. It was found that the whole groups sniffed toluene at least 4 days a week. Almost always, their first worry as they woke up was to buy a toluene sample. The subjects in the study also noticed in themselves a higher degree of intoxication when they had to handle sad situations. Finally, It was reported that children organized among themselves to face street difficulties. Furthermore, some children became leaders with the ability to organize the actions needed for the solutions to 9 personal and collective problems.
   On the other hand, the qualitative research evaluated the use of inhalants within small samples of street children as well as the factors that encourage it. The study tried to determine the neurological and psychological consequences of inhaling solvents deliberately. In one of these studies, it was found that of 329 subjects (94% male), with an average age of 13.7 years, 27% admitted to sniff daily. The average period of inhalant use was found to be 4.5 years. The general traits associated with the use of inhalants were: male sex, low schooling and school desertion, early start of work, alcohol and/or drug consumption of mother, siblings, and friends, low or null contact with family, and migration from rural areas.
   In the second research stage, the development of studies on inhalant abuse of 'street children' was continued. The quantitative studies examined larger samples of street children in 100 cities across the country and in the Federal District. In this respect, in the Federal District report it is noted that alcohol and tobacco are the most commonly abused substances by working minors: 26% of men and 14% of women reported smoking. The most frequently used illegal drugs were inhalants, followed by marijuana and cocaine and to a lesser extent psychotropic pills. The most important factor linked to drug use,vas the minor's occupation. It was observed that minors working as packers had low indexes of consumption of illegal drugs (2.4% of those aged between 12 and 17 years has used drugs). Those minors working in public areas had higher consumption rates (8.1%), and a considerably higher rate was found among minors living on the streets (76%).
   In this period, the qualitative studies were dramatically increased. These studies started to pay much more attention to the street childrens views and opinions. This research also tried to focus on other problems of life in the streets like police violence and child prostitution. Moreover, we started identifying the protective factors that help children face the difficulties of sustenance on the streets.
   In this second stage, a new study was developed in order to understand the situation of the female adolescent inhalers on the street. It is,worth noticing that this group of subjects had not had a central role in our previous research. The research tried to get to know, from their own point of view, situations such as: the way they experience solvent sniffing; their sexual practices, pregnancy and delivery; self-attention and institutional support. The results obtained show that the so called 'street girls' experience the use of inhalants as a habit. They manifested that they frequently have unprotected sexual practices, unplanned pregnancies, violence prior to abortions, risky deliveries, etc. All this phenomena become extremely complex, hence forcing these young,women to experience them as something contradictory, confusing, mysterious, ambivalent, fatal, and paradoxical. The research show,vs that the female adolescents 'of the street' do not relate these experiences to the problems pertaining to the Mexican social structure, such as the low emphasis on family planning among adolescents, the lack of orientation and sensitivity towards young pregnant women on matters such as prenatal medical attention, the absence of programs geared toward adolescence abusing substances, etc.
   We conclude that it would be highly beneficial that any new research be focused on the children's perspective. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the children's experiences and strategies to face adversity. This would enable us to identify matters that are important for the children themselves. For instance, this approach would not only be helpful to identify particular aspects that endanger the children's mental health, but also those characteristics that enable the child to face risk situations. Furthermore, the concepts of risk and resilience could provide a thorough understanding of the children 'on street situation'. Hence, it is quite necessary to look beyond the risk variables and turn to the search of comparative and longitudinal information about the,street career' followed by these children.

AB In a wide sense, a palliative agent is a remedy that attenuates some symptoms associated with a disease, whereas a therapeutic agent is the one capable of curing a disease. Marihuana (Cannabis saliva) is a plant from Central Asia and its main active components (cannabinoids) are three: tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol and cannabidiol. They possess psychotropic and vegetative effects and, empirically, are reputed to exert some supposedly therapeutic actions involving the control of pain, vomiting, intraocular pressure and many other ailments.
   In agreement with official data from the "Consejo Nacional contra las Adicciones" (CONADIC, Mexico), during 1998-2000, the most extensively, abused substances were marihuana, cocaine and industrial solvents. The consumption of marihuana in Mexico has increased with time. The average prevalence of the use of cannabis among the urban population from 12 to 65 years of age is 5.3%. The cities with the highest consumption of marihuana are Tijuana (14.7%), Ciudad Juarez (9.2%), Guadalajara (7.5%), Mexico City (7.3%), Monterrey (4.1%) and Matamoros (3.6%), a fact that indicates that the north-central region of Mexico is the most affected. Marihuana is the main drug consumed by almost all age groups without any distinction of gender. The consumption is predominantly higher in males (13.9%) than in females (6.9%), and among children from 12 to 17 Nears old who do not live with their families. The percentage of adolescents consuming marihuana is larger among youths who are not students (4.2%) than in the student population (1.3%). Thus, marihuana consumption is a real problem of public health in Mexico.
   The existence of at least two receptors to cannabinoids is well known, as well as a group of substances synthesized by the organism itself, denominated endocannabinoids, whose pharmacological properties resemble those of the plant. These observations have caused some parliamentary discussions that have led some countries to approve the use of the synthetic cannabinoid-related substances for therapeutic purposes. In the present review, recent literature was analyzed in order to offer an objective scientific perspective about the use of marihuana. Five relevant observations are pointed out: 1) Studies with positive findings, lack adequate controls. 2) The standards of comparison used, are not the most suitable, for example, the supposed analgesic property of cannabinoids is commonly compared with codeine, and the possible antiemetic capability of cannabinoids is not compared with well-known commercial and safe drugs with verified potency, such as the 5HT(3) receptor subtype agonist, odansetron. 3) Some authors claim that the plant may acts as a whole, and therefore some of the synthetic cannabinoids approved in other countries for therapeutic uses might not produce notable effects. 4) Only a few patients experience some improvement in their symptoms; however most of them experience the psychotropic actions of cannabinoids. And, 5) there are ethical aspects to reconsider in the case of patients who never before had consumed cannabinoids.
   The following aspects of the clinical use of cannabinoids are discussed in this review. For example, diverse reports suggest that marihuana increases food intake through CB1 receptor-stimulation producing hyperphage by itself, as well as anorexia related to immunodeficiency syndrome and cancer treatment. However, these patients also experience the psychotropic side-effects of marihuana and which lead them to leave the treatment. Regarding pain, cannabinoids produce spinal analgesia in experimental animals, which might be mediated by suppression of neuronal nocyceptive activity and the activation of opioid receptors. Nevertheless, most researchers who are exploring the efficacy of cannabinoids in pain treatment employ codeine as a reference, although codeine is in disuse due to its vegetative effects and poor potency, and do not compare it with other powerful analgesics such as opioids or prostaglandin inhibitors. In the immunologic system, cannabinoids act on CB2 receptors, decreasing the function of immune T and B cells, killer cells and macrophages. Therefore, infection processes might be increased in debilitated patients. By contrast, the immunosuppressant action of cannabinoids could be useful in hyperactivity of the immunologic system, as in the case of multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, recent findings suggest that a lipid imbalance (mainly with arachidonic acid) is a primary factor in the etiology of cystic fibrosis. Since the endocannabinoids are fatty acid derivatives, it has been hypothesized that the patients who suffer cystic fibrosis can receive benefits by the administration of cannabinoids (i.e. restoring the balance between fatty acids, reducing the symptoms and increasing life expectancies). Regardind reproduction research, prenatal cannabinoid exposure has been associated with a high perinatal morbidity but the possible long-term consequences are still poorly understood. Therefore, animal models of perinatal cannabinoid exposure have provided a useful tool for examining the developmental effects of the offspring. Results show alteration in the ontogeny of spontaneous locomotor activity and exploratory behavior. Adult animals exposed during pregnancy and lactation exhibited persistent alterations of the behavioral response to novelty, social interactions and sexual behavior. However, available data regarding the long-term behavioral and cognitive effects in humans are scarce to be compared with animal results. In other studies, some endocannabinoids generated in monocytes and platelets show that they are potent vasodilators and related to hypotension following hemorrhagic shock. Thus, animals treated with anandamide reduce their survival rate. In contrast, administration of the CB1 antagonist (SR141716A) increases the arterial pressure, the respiratory frequency and the survival rate in a dose-response manner. Thus, inhibition of the endogenous cannabinoids reverts the hemorrhagic shock with notorious efficacy, similar to endogenous opioids. In this sense, some other reports suggest that cannabinoids are useful to treat glaucoma, because cannabis reduces intraocular pressure in 60% of the users, although there are other drugs lacking psychotropic effects with proved and accepted efficacy in the treatment of glaucoma. Marihuana may also have certain anticonvulsivant properties; however delta-9THC alters sleep patterns in humans and could not be recommendable. In spite of some positive reports on the treatment of partial or tonic-clonic seizures, there is a lack of controlled studies.
   An apparent positive finding is that ligands to endocannabinoids receptors are suggested to exert neuroprotective effects because endocannabinoids reduce brain ischemic-induced lesion in rats and attenuate neuronal injuries produced by hypoxia and glucose deprivation in cultured cells. Once more, controlled studies are required to support or refuse these observations.
   The discovery of endocannabinoids and their receptors opens fields for comprehension of the processes involved in the psychophysiology of affective disorders and certain aspects of motivation; and recent advances in genomic medicine might lead us to speculate on the manipulation of endocannabinoid receptors. However, endocannabinoids exert well defined actions related with feeding, Mood, sensorial perception and time sense; therefore, the genomic manipulation of these receptors, might suppress the use of marihuana in addicts, but probably also create problems concerning appetite and Mood, among other behavioral aspects.
   In consequence, it is concluded that cannabinoids are substances that possess some palliative effects rather than therapeutic, and that their administration to seriously weakened patients should be preceded by exhaustive analysis of another therapeutics choices.

AB The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was originally characterized because of its high affinity binding of 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. However, studies using AhR-null mice have demonstrated the importance of this protein in normal physiology and development. Here we demonstrate that AhR-null embryos develop cardiac enlargement, and that this phenotype is dependent, at least in part, on the maternal genotype. Neonates born to AhR-null females had increased heart weights regardless of the neonatal genotype, an outcome also observed in gestational diabetes. The cardiac hypertrophy markers, beta-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor, and the cardiac proliferative index were increased in AhR-null embryos, indicating that the cardiac enlargement is associated with myocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which begin prior to birth. Importantly, two- to three-month-old pregnant and seven-month-old nonpregnant females, but not nonpregnant three-month-old AhR-null females had significantly decreased fasting plasma insulin levels and a reduced ability to respond to exogenous insulin compared to controls. Despite these alterations in insulin regulation and responsiveness, pregnant AhR females did not have abnormal glucose tolerance tests and did not develop hyperglycemia, classic characteristics of gestational diabetes. However, twenty-three percent of seven-month-old AhR-null females did have altered glucose tolerance tests, but did not show hyperglycernia or increased hemoglobin A,c concentration under normal feeding conditions. While the ultimate cause of the neonatal phenotype remains unclear, these studies establish that the AhR is required for normal insulin regulation in pregnant and older mice and for cardiac development in embryonic mice.

TI Use of bednets given free to pregnant women in Kenya
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2001, UNICEF procured 70 000 bednets and insecticide treatments to be distributed free to pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in 35 (of 69) districts in Kenya. I year later, we interviewed 294 pregnant women who had received a free net. 267 (91%) nets had remained in the target homesteads, and only one of the nets had been sold. In a district with high malarial transmission, 93 (84%) of M women who had not previously been sleeping under a bednet had used the net while pregnant, and 97 (91%) of the 107 surviving babies were also protected; in another district, which had low transmission, 73 (58%) of 126 women used the nets during pregnancy and 91 (80%) of 114 infants were protected by the nets. These data suggest that bednets given free to pregnant women are used by recipients and their newborn children, and should be regarded as an important delivery system in increasing access to and use of insecticide-treated bednets in vulnerable groups.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct, in a randomized placebo-controlled manner, social behavior testing on mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam.
   STUDY DESIGN: A previously described, clinically relevant dose of 0.32 mg/kg of alprazolam (n = 8 mice) or a placebo (n = 9 mice) was given to gravid C57BL/6 mice by gavage on gestational day 18. Social play, sleep/ wake patterns, and male aggression of the exposed offspring were assessed during prejuvenile, juvenile, and adult periods.
   RESULTS: Alprazolam did not produce treatment differences in pregnancy outcomes or in dam-pup interactions. Compared with the placebo group, alprazolam-exposed offspring demonstrated less desire to escape (P < .01), more desire to remain alone (P < .02), and shorter periods of being awake (P < (.)03) on PND 17. Alprazolam-exposed male offspring exhibited more aggression on food restriction (P < .01) and on cage changing (P < .01).
   CONCLUSION: Mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam demonstrated more individual rather than group activities, avoidance of open areas, and aggression in males. Correlation of these findings in humans is encouraged.

AB Despite the importance of human milk fatty acids for infant growth and development, there are few reports describing infant intakes of individual fatty acids. We have measured volume, fat content and fatty acid composition of milk from each breast at each feed over a 24 h period to determine the mean daily amounts of each fatty acid delivered to the infant from breast milk at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months of lactation in five women. Daily (24 h) milk production was 336-60 (SEM 26.21) and 414.49 (SEM 28.39) ml and milk fat content was 36.06 (SEM 1.37) and 34.97 (SEM 1.50) g/l for left and right breasts respectively over the course of the first year of lactation. Fatty acid composition varied over the course of the day (mean CV 14.3 (SD 7.7)%), but did not follow a circadian rhythm. The proportions (g/100 g total fatty acids) of fatty acids differed significantly between mothers (P<0.05) and over the first year of lactation (P<0.05). However, amounts (g) of most fatty acids delivered to the infant over 24 h did not differ during the first year of lactation and only the amounts of 18:3n-3, 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 delivered differed between mothers (P<0.05). Mean amounts of 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6 and 22:6n-3 delivered to the infant per 24 h over the first year of lactation were 2.380 (SD 0.980), 0.194 (SD 0.074), 0.093 (SD 0.031) and 0.049 (SD 0.021) g respectively. These results suggest that variation in proportions of fatty acids may not translate to variation in the amount delivered and that milk production and fat content need to be considered.

DE obstructive sleep apnea
ID UPPER AIRWAY; WOMEN; APNEA; PATTERNS; FETAL; HYPERTENSION; PREECLAMPSIA;
   OBESE; ASSOCIATION; RESPONSES
AB Purpose of review
   Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy. The spectrum of association between pregnancy and sleep disturbances ranges from an increased incidence of insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, and parasomnias (especially restless legs syndrome) to snoring and excessive sleepiness. These disturbances occur as a result of physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes associated with pregnancy. Although the timing and occurrence of different sleep disorders varies, they are most prevalent during the third trimester. Despite reports of the various sleep problems, the exact nature and incidence of sleep disorders in pregnancy is not known. Given that limitation, we are presenting an up-to-date review of the current understanding of the relation between sleep and pregnancy.
   Recent findings
   Studies suggest that pregnancy affects sleep in multiple ways. There are hormonal changes, physiologic changes, physical factors, and behavioral changes in a pregnant woman-all of which may affect her sleep. They may affect the duration and quality of sleep and lead to a variety of sleep disorders. Pregnancy may also affect an existing sleep disorder. Particular attention may be given to obese pregnant women who would gain more weight during pregnancy or those who develop hypertensive conditions (eg, preeclampsia). Snoring may be more common in women with preeclampsia and the pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep may be enhanced in preeclamptic women when compared with those with obstructive sleep apnea alone. Several investigators have suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be common in pregnant women despite the presence of intrinsic mechanisms that seem to be geared towards preventing sleep apnea. However, the exact incidence and prevalence of sleep apnea in pregnant women is uncertain. In addition, it is unclear if criteria that are used to define sleep apnea in the general population should be applied to pregnant women. Further investigations are needed to determine if lower thresholds for management of OSA should be used in pregnant women to prevent harm to the fetus.
   Summary
   In conclusion, sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy though the full extent of this relation remains undefined. Large, multi-center, prospective studies are needed for better understanding.

AB The rate of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among American Indian infants in the Northern Plains is almost 6 times higher than in U.S. white infants. In a study of infant mortality among Northern Plains Indians, we tested the hypothesis that receptor binding abnormalities to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) in SIDS cases, compared with autopsied controls, occur in regions of the medulla oblongata that contain 5-HT neurons and that are critical for the regulation of cardiorespiration and central chemosensitivity during sleep, i.e. the medullary 5-HT system. Tritiated-lysergic acid diethylamide binding to 5-HT1D-D and 5-HT2 receptors was measured in 19 brainstem nuclei in 23 SIDS and 6 control infants using tissue receptor autoradiography. Binding in the arcuate nucleus, a part of the medullary 5-HT system along the ventral surface, in the SIDS infants (mean age-adjusted binding 7.1 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg tissue, n = 23) was significantly lower than in controls (mean age-adjusted binding 13.1 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg tissue, n 5) (p = 0.003). Binding also demonstrated significant diagnosis X age interactions (p < 0.04) in 4 other nuclei that are components of the 5-HT system. These data suggest that medullary 5-HT dysfunction can lead to sleep-related, sudden death in affected SIDS infants, and confirm the same binding abnormalities reported by us in a larger dataset of non-American Indian SIDS and control infants. This study also links 5-HT abnormalities in the arcuate nucleus with exposure to adverse prenatal exposures, i.e. cigarette smoking (p = 0.011) and alcohol (p = 0.075), during the periconceptional period or throughout pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke and/or alcohol may contribute to abnormal fetal medullary 5-HT development in SIDS infants.

   PLACEBO; RISK; COMORBIDITY
AB Currently, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined by symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity and impulsivity. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria, symptoms must persist for at least six months, be present before the age of seven years, and cause significant impairment in at least two areas [1]. The symptoms of inattention include trouble concentrating, distractibility, frequent careless errors in schoolwork, daydreaming, failure to complete tasks or follow instructions, poor organization, procrastination, forgetfulness, and a tendency to lose or misplace things. Symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity include fidgeting, inability to stay in a seat, running when should be walking, talking excessively, interrupting, blurting out answers to questions, being loud and noisy, having trouble waiting, and being constantly "on the go" or "driven by a motor." If the child has six or more symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, a diagnosis of ADHD, combined type, is made. If only inattention criteria are met, the diagnosis is ADHD, predominantly inattentive type, and if only hyperactivity criteria are met, ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. ADHD, combined type, is more common in elementary school-age children and in boys; ADHD, predominantly inattentive type, is more common in girls and in adolescents and adults. ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, is rare [2-4].
   The first step in differential diagnosis is the separation from normal behavior. Most people have at least some symptoms of ADHD some of the time [5]. To make a diagnosis of ADHD, symptoms should be pervasive, occur often or very often, and cause academic and social problems. The child with ADHD should have symptoms that clearly are excessive for developmental level. ADHD should be diagnosed in the child with mental handicap only when the symptoms are in excess of that seen in children of a similar developmental age. Inattention and hyperactivity are symptoms often seen in children with autistic disorder, childhood schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and anxiety. The diagnosis of childhood-onset bipolar disorder should be considered when the child has a decreased need for sleep, early emergence of sexuality, and grandiosity [6]. Children with anxiety disorders are inattentive because of excessive worries, preoccupation, and self-consciousness and are restless when stressed [7]. Children with depression may have trouble concentrating and agitation, but sadness or irritability and withdrawn behaviors suggest the appropriate diagnosis.
   Children with neurologic disorders may have symptoms of ADHD. Severe traumatic head injury with damage to the frontal lobes has been associated with impaired attention, impulsivity, and hyperactive behavior [8]. Children with epilepsy have an increased incidence of ADHD symptoms, particularly inattention. This has been found in approximately one third of children with epilepsy [9,10]. ADHD symptoms are found with regularity in several neurologic syndromes. Approximately 50% of children with Tourette syndrome have symptoms of ADHD [11]. Hyperactivity and inattention are components of fetal alcohol syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Williams syndrome, and Angelman syndrome [12-14]. Inattention symptoms are seen with sedative medications, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, and with theophylline. There is suggestive evidence that inattention and hyperactivity may be associated with lead poisoning and maternal tobacco use during pregnancy [15,16].

   MANAGEMENT; DAMAGE; WOMEN; FETUS
AB Severe maternal neurologic injury during pregnancy has the potential for fetal demise without advanced critical care support to the mother. Brain death is the unequivocal and irreversible loss of total brain function, whereas patients in a vegetative state, by contrast, have preserved brain stem function but lack cerebral function. They can appear to be awake, have sleep-wake cycles, be capable of swallowing, and have normal respiratory control, but there are no purposeful interactions. These conditions have different maternal prognoses, but both have resulted in near-normal neonatal outcomes with long latencies from maternal injury to delivery in previously published cases. This article compares and contrasts the 11 cases of brain death with 15 cases of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy. We found that the mean latency between maternal brain injury and delivery was significantly shorter in the brain-dead patients as compared with those in a vegetative state (46 days vs. 124 days, P less than or equal to.001). Correspondingly, the gestational ages at delivery (29.7 weeks vs. 33.2 weeks, Pless than or equal to.01) and the birth weights (1380 g vs. 2145 g, Pless than or equal to.01) were shorter in duration and smaller in size in the brain-dead group. We also present a case of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy at our institution with both maternal and neonatal death in the context of previously published literature with a focus on obstetric and ethical management. We hope this information will help elucidate the issues for providers confronted with these unique and challenging cases.
   Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians
   Learning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to state the difference between coma, persistent vegetative state and brain death, to describe the neurologic aspects of a patient in a persistent vegetative state, and to list the fetal effects of maternal brain injury.

AB Sleep disordered breathing can occur during pregnancy due to the development of hormonal changes and respiratory function abnormalities that perturb patency of the upper airways. Habitual snoring has been described in 25 p. 100 of the women during the third trimester of pregnancy. The incidence of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome is unknown due to the lack of longitudinal epidemiological data, and results of the main studies are in favor of upper airway resistance syndrome. However, these sleep-related breathing disorders are more frequently associated with maternal and total complications such as maternal hypertension, pre eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. This article points out the importance of such associations because of the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure on the regression of these nocturnal respiratory and vascular complications.

AB Objectives To estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use in young Australian women, determine their patterns of drug use and identify associated risk factors.
   Methods Data were collected in 2000 as part of the second survey of the youngest cohort in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (n = 9512).
   Results Among women aged 22-27 years, 58% reported having used an illicit drug at some time with most (57%) having used cannabis. Amphetamines (16%), ecstasy/designer drugs (15%) and LSD (14%) were the next three most commonly used drugs. Four different patterns of drug use were identified: past users of cannabis only (39%); current users of cannabis only (17%); past multiple drug users (13%) and current multiple drug users (31%). Living in a de-facto relationship or never being married, living with non-family members, a history of physical abuse, sexual intercourse, smoking and binge drinking were associated significantly with exclusive use of cannabis and with use of multiple drugs compared to never using illicit drugs. Living with a partner, experience of sexual or emotional abuse, pregnancy, diagnosis of depression and taking sleeping medication were associated significantly with being a multiple drug user, but not for exclusive cannabis use. Multiple drug users had, on average, used cannabis 2-3 years before using any other drug.
   Conclusions Given the strong association found between smoking, heavy drinking and drug use of varied patterns, public health initiatives targeted at preventing young women from smoking and drinking should additionally target illicit drug use.

AB The term postpartum psychosis (PP) is not a discrete nosological entity but rather, refers to a group of heterogeneous disorders that share the common features of the presence of psychosis and onset of symptoms during the postpartum period. Although there remains a debate regarding its diagnostic status, PP is generally considered as belonging to the bipolar spectrum. The prognosis for the individual episodes is considered generally favourable but it is a potentially serious illness due to the increased risk of suicide and infanticide. Furthermore, puerperal and non-puerperal recurrences are quite common. There is paucity of controlled trials in the acute and prophylactic treatment of PP and the data are limited largely to the use of lithium and oestrogen. Strategies for the clinical management of PP should include early identification of women at risk; close monitoring of mood state during pregnancy, prompt recognition of impending psychosis and aggressive pharmacotherapy. In general, treatment for PP is essentially the same as for similar non-puerperal episodes.

AB Narcolepsy is a disabling disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed nocturnal sleep. Traditionally, a wide variety of substances are used in the symptomatic pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy. Several generally more-tolerated substances have been added to the therapeutic repertoire after extensive testing in large patient populations during recent years. This review addresses the state-of-the-art knowledge about the pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy along with the personal view of the authors. The recent discovery that narcolepsy is caused by deficient hypocretin (orexin) transmission opens a perspective on causal therapy.

AB The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides, Canidae, Carnivora) is a middle-sized omnivore with excessive autumnal fattening and winter sleep. We studied adaptations of the species to boreal climate and photoperiod by following the plasma reproductive and thyroid hormone concentrations of farm-bred raccoon dogs (n=32) for 12 months. On August 16, 2000, and February 8, 2001, half of the raccoon dogs received continuous-release melatonin implants (the MEL group). The other half was sham-operated (the SHAM group). Between November 27, 2000, and January 25, 2001, half of the animals of both groups were fasted. The plasma testosterone concentrations of the MEL males peaked in February, a month earlier than in the SHAM males. Autumnal melatonin treatment also advanced the gestation period reflected by the plasma progesterone concentrations by seven weeks. Food deprivation in winter seems to accentuate the sex steroid response during the mating as the fasted males had higher testosterone concentrations than the fed males in February and March. J. Exp.

AB Puerperal psychosis is a rare but serious psychiatric disorder following delivery. Although controversy continues to surround its nosological status, puerperal psychosis is generally considered a mood episode with psychotic features occurring in the context of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Due to the close temporal association with childbirth, the etiological role of gonadal steroids, particularly estrogen, has been considered. Familial factors have also been implicated in the triggering of episodes of puerperal psychosis. Sleep deprivation arising from an array of diverse factors is a common occurrence surrounding parturition. The author suggests that sleep loss plays a pivotal role in the causation of puerperal psychosis. Clinical implications of this hypothesis are discussed. Studies on the aetiology and pathogenesis of puerperal psychosis are urgently needed not only for prevention and better treatment strategies of puerperal psychosis but also for understanding the biological underpinnings of bipolar disorder.

   Setting: 500 clinical institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of organizations identified in a survey by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Of these 500 institutions, 260 participated in the survey.
   Participants: 16,528 pregnant women living in Japan
   Interventions: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: In this survey of pregnant women, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%. An analysis was conducted on the relationship between RLS and other factors such as subjective evaluation of sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awaking, and excessive daytime sleepiness, The result of this analysis suggested that women with these sleep-related problems were more likely to have RLS than those without. In addition, RLS was more prevalent in the later stages of pregnancy.
   Conclusion: In the pregnant women in our survey, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%, which is higher than the prevalence of RLS that has been found in the general public in a previous study. This suggests that RLS-related sleep problems may be an important public health issue among pregnant women in Japan. This finding may have implications for attempts to improve sleep hygiene in this group.

AB Study Objectives: To assess potential relationships between serum iron and ferritin levels and the severity of periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS) in a pediatric population, and to evaluate the response to supplemental iron therapy,
   Design: A prospective study of all consecutively diagnosed children with PLMS (periodic limb movement index [periodic limb movements per hour of total sleep time, [PLMI] >5) who underwent overnight polysomnographic evaluation. In all patients, complete blood count and serum iron and ferritin levels were obtained. Patients with serum ferritin concentrations less than 50 mug/L were prescribed iron sulfate at 3 mg/kg of elemental iron per day for 3 months. At the end of treatment, serum iron and ferritin levels and sleep studies were repeated.
   Setting: Comprehensive Sleep Medicine Center, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, and Kosair Children's Hospital Sleep Medicine and Apnea Center.
   Patients: Twenty boys and 19 girls with PLMS with a mean age of 7.5 +/- 3.1 years.
   Intervention: Iron therapy.
   Results: Twenty-eight (71,8%) patients had ferritin levels less than 50 mug/L. There was no significant correlation between serum ferritin concentration and PLMS severity as indicated by the PLMI (r=-0.19). The PLMI in patients with serum ferritin levels less than 50 mug/L (29.9 +/- 15.5 PLM/h) was higher than in patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 50 mug/L (21.9 +/- 11.8 PLM/h); however, the difference did not achieve statistical significance (P=0.09). In contrast, serum iron was significantly correlated with PLMI (r=-0.43, P<0.01). Indeed, patients with serum iron concentrations less than 50 mug/dL had a higher PLMI compared to patients with serum iron concentrations greater than 50 pg/dL (42.8 +/- 18.3 PLM/h and 23.1 +/- 10.1 PLM/h, respectively; P=0.02). Twenty-five out of the 28 PLMS patients with serum ferritin levels less than 50 mug/L received treatment with iron sulfate, and 19 (76%) responded favorably. Among the responders to iron therapy, PLMI decreased from 27.6 +/- 14.9 PLM per hour to 12.6 +/- 5.3 PLM per hour after 3 months of iron supplements (P<0.001) and coincided with increases in serum ferritin levels (pre: 40.8 +/- 27.4 mug/L vs post: 74.1 +/- 13.0 mug/L; P<0.001).
   Conclusions: In children, the presence of PLMS is frequently associated with low serum iron and a tendency toward low serum ferritin levels. In addition, iron therapy is associated with clinical improvement in most of these patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation. Peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), related to activity-dependent neuroprotective. protein (ADNP), prevent alcohol-induced damage in a mouse model of FAS. Our objective was to characterize ADNP in this model to relate this protein to the mechanisms of damage and peptide neuroprotection.
   STUDY DESIGN: Timed, pregnant C57B16/J mice were treated on day 8. Groups were control, alcohol, peptide pretreatment, or peptide alone. Embryo and decidua were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days. To evaluate ADNP expression, real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed with results presented as the ratio of ADNP-to-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) concentration. Analysis of variance was performed for overall comparisons with P < .05 considered significant.
   RESULTS: At 6 hours, there was no difference in ADNP between alcohol-exposed embryos compared with control embryos. At 24 hours, there was an increase in ADNP in alcohol-exposed embryos compared with controls (P <.001); these findings persisted at 10 days (P < .001). In the decidua at 6 hours, there was no difference between alcohol and control. At 24 hours, there was greater ADNP in alcohol-exposed decidua compared with controls (P < .001), which did not persist at 10 days (P = .97). Peptide pretreatment did not prevent the alcohol-induced increase in ADNP in embryo or decidua.
   CONCLUSION: Alcohol increased embryonic and decidual ADNP expression at 24 hours and it persisted in the embryo for 10 days. Because ADNP is a known neuroprotectant, these findings suggest that it may be released as a protective mechanism in FAS. Changes in the embryo were persistent suggesting that the embryo is more vulnerable to alcohol-induced damage than the mother.
