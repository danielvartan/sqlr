TI  - The incidence of sleeping problems in preterm and fullterm infants discharged
      from neonatal special care units: an epidemiological longitudinal study.
PG  - 203-23
AB  - Anecdotal reports have suggested that sleeping problems are a frequent complaint 
      from parents of preterm infants. This prospective epidemiological study examined 
      the incidence and stability of sleeping problems of very preterm (< 32 weeks
      gestation at birth), preterm (32-36 weeks gestation) and fullterm infants, all
      admitted to special care baby units (SCBU) after birth, in comparison to healthy 
      term infants over the first 5 years of life. Preterm infants were found to have
      fewer and shorter night-wakings at 5 months. No differences in sleeping behaviour
      compared with healthy term children were found at 20 and 56 months of age.
      Similar significant, and moderate, stability of nightwaking from one age to the
      next were found for exSCBU-graduates and healthy fullterm infants. Parental
      interventions such as staying with the child until sleep and taking the infant
      into bed af night were related to nightwaking problems and increased parental
      distress. It is concluded that prematurity, and thus neurological immaturity and 
      special care experience are less important than caretaking behaviour in the
      development of sleeping problems in both preterm and fullterm infants.

TI  - Circadian variation of urinary albumin excretion in pregnancy.
PG  - 107-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis was tested that circadian variations in urinary albumin
      excretion of pregnant women in the third trimester of normal pregnancy are
      different from nonpregnant individuals. DESIGN: Circadian variability in urinary 
      albumin excretion was studied both in pregnant women and in nonpregnant controls 
      either during normal daily activities or in contrast during continuous bedrest
      with standardised fluid and food intake to study endogenously generated rhythm.
      SETTING: Outpatient department and metabolic ward of a university hospital. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Urinary albumin excretion during fixed time periods over the
      day and the night. RESULTS: Both ambulant pregnant and nonpregnant women have
      circadian rhythm in urinary albumin excretion but pregnant women have, firstly, a
      higher 24 h urinary albumin excretion, secondly, smaller relative day-night
      differences than nonpregnant controls and thirdly, in the metabolic ward some
      pregnant women demonstrate absence of rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: The higher albumin
      excretion during pregnancy in 24 h urine collections can largely be explained by 
      a higher excretion during the night, compared with that of nonpregnant women. The
      day-night difference in urinary albumin excretion of ambulant pregnant women is
      exogenously determined.

TI  - Maternal coordination of the daily rhythm of malate dehydrogenase activity in
      testes from young rats: effect of maternal sympathetic denervation of the pineal 
      gland and administration of melatonin.
PG  - 8-18
AB  - Chronic sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland by bilateral removal of the
      superior cervical ganglia (SCG) was performed on female rats 30 days before
      impregnation. The offspring, maintained in the dark from birth, had disruption of
      the malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythm in the testes at 25 days of age. A
      daily injection of melatonin (1 mg/kg s.c. at 10:00 or 18:00 h) to denervated
      mothers from the 14th day of pregnancy up to the 10th day postpartum produced one
      daily phase in the enzyme activity of tests in the offspring. Entrainment of
      daily enzyme activity also was obtained when the hormone was administered orally 
      to the pups during the postnatal period or when pups were reared by intact (not
      denervated) foster mothers. The results indicate the involvement of the maternal 
      pineal gland in the maternal transfer of photoperiodic information necessary for 
      the coordination of the circadian system in young rats.

TI  - Facilitated tucking: a nonpharmacologic comfort measure for pain in preterm
      neonates.
PG  - 143-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the effectiveness of "facilitated tucking," a
      nonpharmacologic nursing intervention, as a comfort measure in modulating preterm
      neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses to minor pain. DESIGN:
      Prospective, repeated measure, random sequencing, and experimental. SETTING:
      Level III neonatal intensive-care unit of a tertiary care university pediatric
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty preterm neonates, 25-35 weeks gestation.
      INTERVENTIONS: Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and sleep state were recorded 12
      minutes before, during, and 15 minutes after two heelsticks, one with and one
      without facilitated tucking. HYPOTHESIS: Premature neonates will have less
      variation in heart rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, shorter crying and
      sleep disruption times, and less fluctuation in sleep states in response to the
      painful stimulus of a heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. RESULTS:
      Neonates demonstrated a lower mean heart rate 6-10 minutes post-stick (p < 0.04),
      shorter mean crying time (p < 0.001), shorter mean sleep disruption time (p <
      0.001), and fewer sleep-state changes (p = 0.003) after heelstick with
      facilitated tucking than without. CONCLUSION: Facilitated tucking is an effective
      comfort measure in attenuating premature neonates' psychologic and behavioral
      responses to minor pain.

      at late gestation.
PG  - 411-3
AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a circadian oscillator in mammals and shows 
      day-night changes in metabolic activity. To investigate whether the fetal sheep
      SCN behaves as a circadian oscillator, day-night changes in c-fos expression, a
      marker of neuronal activity, were measured. Eight fetal sheep were sacrificed at 
      135 days gestation--four at day-time (1200 hours) and four at night-time (2400
      hours). Fetal brains were fixed, removed and cut in 40-microns serial coronal
      sections. Alternate sections were incubated with anti-Fos antibody (1:500) and
      Fos expression was revealed with extra-avidin-peroxidase and
      3,3'-diaminobenzidine or stained with cresyl violet. The number of
      Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) neurons per mm2 in the rostral, intermediate and
      caudal regions of the fetal sheep SCN was counted. Fetuses sacrificed in the
      day-time showed a higher number of Fos-ir neurons per mm2 (mean +/- s.e.; 516.7
      +/- 60.1) in the three regions of the SCN than fetuses sacrificed at night-time
      (140.5 +/- 21.8). In addition, at night-time Fos-ir neurons were mainly localized
      to the ventrolateral area of the SCN. These findings demonstrate day-night
      changes in molecular activity consistent with the presence of a circadian
      oscillator in the fetal sheep SCN.

TI  - Urinary gonadotropin peptide: collection of specimens and cutoff levels.
PG  - 230-3
AB  - A low-molecular-weight form of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), urinary
      gonadotropin peptide (UGP), has been isolated from the urine of pregnant women
      and of patients with cancer, mainly of gynecological origin. The clinical value
      of UGP measurement in gynecological diseases is under investigation but a
      preliminary study is necessary in order to ascertain whether there is a circadian
      rhythm in UGP production, to clarify the best way to express the results, and to 
      establish the cutoff and decisional values. In our work we demonstrated a
      significant correlation between the UGP output and the UGP excretion normalized
      for urinary creatinine. A very significant agreement was even found in 24-hr
      urine collections and UGP concentration of a single morning specimen from the
      same patients. No evident circadian rhythm was found, although some patients
      presented morning levels of UGP higher than in other collections. UGP
      postmenopausal levels were higher than premenopausal. The cutoff level, adopting 
      the 95.0 percentile, was 200 pmol/mol creatinine.

TI  - Loss of neonatal hypoxia tolerance after prenatal nicotine exposure: implications
      for sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - Maternal cigarette smoking has a high correlation with sudden Infant Death
      Syndrome, a condition in which cardiorespiratory failure occurs during an hypoxic
      episode, as in sleep apnea. Pregnant rats were given nicotine infusions of 2 or 6
      mg/kg/day throughout gestation, regimens that produce plasma nicotine levels
      spanning the range in smokers. The day after birth, animals in the high dose
      group displayed excessive mortality during hypoxic challenge. These animals were 
      found to be deficient in an essential response component, namely adrenomedullary 
      catecholamine release that is required to maintain neonatal cardiac rhythm during
      hypoxia; the defect was in adrenal cell function rather than in altered
      innervation or nicotinic receptor desensitization. We also examined brainstem and
      forebrain noradrenergic mechanisms that are involved in neonatal respiratory
      control. The nicotine group showed suppressed spontaneous neuronal activity, but 
      were hyperresponsive to hypoxia. As these projections are inhibitory for
      respiration, the nicotine-induced sensitization would be expected to contribute
      to respiratory arrest during hypoxia. Prenatal nicotine exposure may thus provide
      a useful animal model with which to study the physiological mechanisms that
      underlie Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, while at the same time providing a
      biological explanation for the association of the syndrome with smoking.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the physical and neurodevelopmental status of children born 
      after in vitro fertilization (IVF) as well as the family condition. DESIGN:
      Follow-up study including physical and developmental examination in available
      families, and/or interviews of parents/pediatricians/teachers/social workers.
      SETTING: The Port-Royal neonatal intensive care unit and follow-up clinic.
      SUBJECTS: From 1.1.1987 to 31.12.1992, in 32 single, 71 twin, 28 triple, and one 
      quadruple pregnancies resulting from IVF (total 132), one or more neonates were
      admitted to the Port-Royal NICU. The outcome is presented for the 99 families
      followed longer than two years (199 neonates, 166/199 born prematurely). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological sequelae (minor, moderate, major), developmental
      quotients, school level, behavioral disturbances, family conditions. RESULTS:
      From 21 singletons (2 deaths, 1 lost), 18 survivors were followed: 17 were normal
      above 2 years (10 above 3 years went to school), 1 had a severe cerebral palsy
      with low IQ. From 57 twin pregnancies (7 fetal and 9 neonatal deaths), the 98
      survivors were followed: 78 were normal above 2 years (65 above 3 years went to
      school), 20 had some neuro-developmental deficits (of 14 above 3 years, 12 went
      to school); 25 families had had or still had problems (deaths and/or anomalies (9
      cases) and/or sequelae); 3 mothers were single parents (2 divorces and one
      split). From 20 triple pregnancies (1 fetal and 3 neonatal deaths), 54 out of 56 
      survivors were normal above 2 years (33 above 3 years went to school); 3 siblings
      (1 deaf and 1 with cataract) were put in foster care after severe maternal
      beating; 2 mothers were single parents (one divorce and one split); 4 mothers had
      repeated breakdowns; one father tried suicide. From one quadruple pregnancy (one 
      fetal and one neonatal deaths), the 2 survivors were normal above 3 years and
      went to school. Most sequelae involved very low birthweight babies, in
      association with a number of sleep and behavioural disturbances. From 98 mothers,
      16 had 18 spontaneous pregnancies (11 full-term newborns, 5 miscarriages, 1
      extra-uterine pregnancy, 1 abortion) and 3 mothers had another IVF pregnancy (a
      few others had IVF failures).

TI  - Fetal behaviour in uncomplicated pregnancies after 41 weeks of gestation.
PG  - 29-38
AB  - The development of fetal behaviour and of fetal behavioural states (FBS) has been
      well defined in preterm and term fetuses. However, FBS have not yet been studied 
      after term, although this is a potentially very dangerous period and clinical
      management is controversial. We investigated fetal behaviour in normal
      pregnancies after 41 weeks of gestation (287 days, menstrual age, GA) as compared
      to control term fetuses. Furthermore, we wanted to see if the findings might have
      consequences for clinical management. Twelve healthy women with GA between 289
      and 298 days participated. All pregnancies were reliably dated and at the time of
      the study, there was a normal amount of fluid. Twelve healthy women with GA
      273-287 days served as controls. All subjects underwent a behavioural study using
      cardiotocography to record the heart rate (CTG), and two ultrasound scanners to
      observe body and eye movements, as described previously. All fetuses in both
      groups clearly exhibited FBS 1F-4F which fitted the definitions of Nijhuis et al.
      The median percentage of FBS 3F and 4F ('awake states') increased significantly
      from 6% in the term group to 21.5% in the fetuses after 41 weeks (P = 0.014). FBS
      1F ('quiet sleep') and 2F ('active sleep') decreased from 92 to 78% (P = 0.014), 
      mainly at the expense of FBS 2F which decreased from 78 to 58% (P = 0.002). This 
      indicates increasing wakefulness in utero. The fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP)
      associated with FBS 3F and 4F were impressive. For example, in FBS 4F, the FHRP
      showed large amplitude, prolonged accelerations which fused into a sustained
      tachycardia with only short periods of return to the baseline, resembling
      tachycardia with decelerations. We conclude that in normal pregnancies after 41
      weeks, the development of the fetal central nervous system continues, resulting
      in an increasing percentage of 'fetal wakefulness'. The CTG-patterns that result 
      from these behaviours can easily mimic fetal distress and one should be aware of 
      this phenomenon. Whether behavioural studies can be used to distinguish 'normal' 
      from 'abnormal' fetuses after term awaits further study.

TI  - Spinal cord injury and pregnancy: the stories of two women.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - This article describes some of the experiences encountered by two women with
      spinal cord injuries (SCI) during pregnancy. Pregnant women, with or without a
      SCI, encounter some common experiences. Common complaints of pregnancy for both
      include urinary tract infections, sleep problems, and constipation. Complaints
      specific to those women with a SCI centered around issues such as increased
      urinary incontinence, autonomic dysreflexia and delayed wound healing. The women 
      with SCI neither developed pressure areas nor experienced premature deliveries,
      major complications predicted by literature. Women with SCI have felt that they
      were victims of inadequate environmental designs that hindered their mobility and
      inhibited their independence. Many of the psychosocial aspects studied proved to 
      be common to pregnant women in general and not specific to individuals with
      spinal cord injury.

TI  - Behavioral states in the fetal baboon.
PG  - 159-75
AB  - This study was designed to characterize behavioral states in the fetal baboon.
      Automated methods were developed and validated to recognize behavioral states
      based on relationships among three physiologic variables (EEG patterns, eye
      movements, heart period variability). Data included twelve 16-h records from 3
      chronically instrumented fetal baboons at 0.8-0.9 of term. Randomly generated
      control records were used to differentiate occurrences of state from chance
      association of the variables. For 41.2 +/- 4.6% (mean +/- S.E.) of the time, the 
      physiologic variables were synchronous and formed cycles of state with a mean
      duration of 34.4 min. Components of these cycles had mean +/- S.E. durations of
      7.2 +/- 0.3 min for state 1FB (the analogue of quiet sleep in the human infant
      and state 1F in the human fetus), 20.7 +/- 1.2 min for the state 2FB (the
      analogue of active sleep in the human infant and state 2F in the human fetus),
      and 3.6 +/- 0.2 min for state transitions. For 24.6 +/- 2.4% of the time, the
      state variables exhibited coincidental, state-like agreements, that were not part
      of state cycles. Finally, for 34.3 +/- 2.7% of the time, there was no systematic 
      agreement among the three variables. These data provide convincing evidence that 
      organized behavioral states are present in the fetal baboon as early as 0.8 of
      term gestation.

PG  - 975-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the behavioural state dependency of renal artery and
      descending aorta pulsatility index and hourly fetal urinary production rate
      (HFUPR) in the normal term fetus. DESIGN: An observational study. SUBJECTS:
      Twenty-three healthy women with a normal singleton pregnancy between 36 and 40
      weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Renal artery and descending aorta
      pulsatility indices were established using pulsed Doppler ultrasound. HFUPR (ml) 
      was estimated using real-time ultrasound. Fetal behavioural states 1F (quiet
      sleep) and 2F (active sleep) were determined from combined recordings of fetal
      heart rate, eye movements and body movements. RESULTS: An inverse correlation
      between pulsatility index and fetal heart pattern was established for both the
      renal artery (r = 0.60; SD = 0.22; P = 0.0001) and the descending aorta (r =
      0.73; SD = 0.16; P = 0.0001). The difference in mean pulsatility index between
      states 1F and 2F adjusted for fetal heart pattern was 0.09 (SD 0.23) for the
      renal artery (P = 0.02) and 0.26 (SD 0.19) for the descending aorta (P = 0.0001).
      Mean HFUPR was significantly higher (44.8%, P = 0.01) in state 1F (96 ml)
      compared with state 2F (54 ml). During the urinary filling phase, a poor
      correlation existed between renal artery pulsatility index and HFUPR (r = 0.04)
      and between descending aorta pulsatility index and HFUPR (r = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      In the normal term fetus renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices
      are reduced during fetal behavioural state 2F, suggesting reduced downstream
      impedance at the fetal trunk and in particular at renal level. This behavioural
      state is, however, also associated with reduced micturition. No correlation
      exists between renal artery and descending aorta pulsatility indices and fetal
      urinary output.

TI  - [The correlation of stress and neurosis vulnerability in the structure of
      nonspecific resistance to extreme factors in intact and pregnant rats].
PG  - 1106-15
AB  - White male rats, intact and pregnant females were subjected for 3 days to
      deprivation of paradoxical sleep by the technique of Jouvet. The main resulting
      vectors of the extreme state outcome, i.e., lethality, susceptibility to stress, 
      and neurotization, made it possible to establish corresponding levels of
      resistance. A relationship of each of the levels with the ability to form
      conditioned reflexes, initial functional interhemispheric asymmetry and
      behavioural status, expression of protective reactions and paradoxical sleep
      under conditions of an insoluble conflict situation was followed. High resistance
      of pregnant rats is considered to be associated with the formation of gestational
      ambilaterality of the brain of intact animals. Such an increase in resistance is 
      selective as far as it concerns the organism of the pregnant and it does not
      ensure stability of the feto-maternal complex under extreme conditions. It was
      established that there was an inverse relationship between the expression of
      neurotic disorders of the higher nervous activity and vegeto-morphological
      features of acute stress. This gives reason to define more exactly the role of
      neurotic disorders in the pathogenesis of stress and mechanisms of resistance to 
      extreme factors.

TI  - Potential teratogenic and neurodevelopmental consequences of coffee and caffeine 
      exposure: a review on human and animal data.
PG  - 531-43
AB  - The teratogenic effect of caffeine has been clearly demonstrated in rodents. The 
      sensitivity of different animals species is variable. Malformations have been
      demonstrated in mice at 50-75 mg/kg of caffeine, whereas the lowest dose usually 
      needed to induce malformations is 80 mg/kg in rats. However, when caffeine is
      administered in fractioned amounts during the day, 330 mg/kg/day are necessary to
      reach teratogenicity in rats. In rodents, the most frequently observed
      malformations are those of the limbs and digits, ectrodactyly, craniofacial
      malformations (labial and palatal clefts) and delays in ossification of limbs,
      jaw and sternum. Nevertheless, even in rodents, caffeine can be considered as a
      weak teratogenic agent, given the quite large quantities of caffeine necessary to
      induce malformations and the small number of animals affected. In humans,
      caffeine does not present any teratogenic risk. The increased risk of the most
      common congenital malformations entailed by moderate consumption of caffeine is
      very slight. However, caffeine potentiates the teratogenic effect of other
      substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and acts synergistically with ergotamine
      and propranolol to induce materno-fetal vasoconstrictions leading to
      malformations induced by ischemia. Therefore, even though caffeine does not seem 
      to be harmful to the human fetus when intake is moderate and spread out over the 
      day, some associations, especially with alcohol, tobacco, and vasoconstrictive or
      anti-migraine medications should be avoided. Maternal consumption of caffeine
      affects brain composition, especially in case of a low-protein diet and also
      seems to interfere with zinc fixation in brain. Maternal exposure to caffeine
      induces also long-term consequences on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities,
      emotivity, and anxiety in rat offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are
      needed to ascertain long-term behavioral effects of caffeine ingestion by
      pregnant mothers.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to calculate vagal tone (V) for 17 normal human
      fetuses in quiet sleep (QS) between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. The fetal cardiac 
      electrical signal was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 
      times per second and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal
      processing techniques. Fetal R-wave interbeat intervals were converted to equally
      spaced, time-based data, and the low-frequency component was removed using a
      21-point third-order moving polynomial. The parameter V was calculated by taking 
      the natural logarithm of the sum of the power densities between 0.3 Hz and 1.3
      Hz. We found that fetal breathing was associated with an approximately 25%
      increase in V as compared to nonbreathing, 3.33 +/- 0.48 versus 2.57 +/- 0.47, p 
      < 0.0001. Furthermore, there was a significant linear relationship between the
      mean single-fetus V during spontaneous respiration and the mean single-fetus V
      during normally occurring apneic periods, r = 0.772, p < 0.002. We conclude that 
      respiratory activity is associated with a significant increase in vagal tone for 
      normal human fetuses in QS.

TI  - Changes in sleep and sleep electroencephalogram during pregnancy.
PG  - 576-82
AB  - The impairment of sleep quality is a common complaint during pregnancy. To
      investigate the changes in sleep in the course of pregnancy, the sleep
      electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded and analyzed in nine healthy women on 2
      consecutive nights during each trimester of pregnancy. Waking after sleep onset
      increased from the second (TR2) to the third (TR3) trimester, whereas rapid eye
      movement (REM) sleep decreased from the first trimester (TR1) to TR2. Spectral
      analysis of the EEG in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep revealed a progressive 
      reduction of power density in the course of pregnancy. In comparison to TR1, the 
      values in TR2 were significantly lower in the 10.25-11.0-Hz and 14.25-17.0-Hz
      bands. In TR3, the significant reduction extended over the ranges of 1.25-12.0 Hz
      and 13.25-16.0 Hz. The largest decrease (30%) occurred in the 14.25-15.0-Hz band.
      In REM sleep, the spindle frequency range was not affected, and a minor reduction
      of power density in some frequency bins below 12 Hz was present only in TR3. The 
      study documents major alterations of the sleep EEG that are not evident from the 
      sleep scores and that may be associated with the characteristic hormonal changes 
      occurring during pregnancy.

TI  - Doppler colour flow imaging of fetal intracerebral arteries relative to fetal
      behavioural states in normal pregnancy.
PG  - 49-56
AB  - In 14 normally developing term fetuses, the relationship between the blood flow
      velocity waveforms at cerebral arterial level (internal carotid artery, anterior,
      middle and posterior cerebral artery) and fetal behavioural states was studied
      using Doppler colour flow imaging. Behavioural state dependent changes in
      absolute flow velocities occurred in all vessels, except for the middle cerebral 
      artery. These changes suggest preferential blood flow to the left heart resulting
      in increased flow to the cerebrum during fetal behavioural state 2F (active
      sleep) when compared with fetal behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep). The middle
      cerebral artery supplies the neocerebrum. This developing part of the cerebrum
      does not seem to take part in the regulation of fetal behaviour. In the internal 
      carotid artery, an inverse relationship between peak systolic velocity and fetal 
      heart rate could be established, which can be explained by a shorter rapid
      filling phase at raised fetal heart rate according to the Frank-Starling Law.

TI  - Entrainment of the fetal hamster circadian pacemaker by prenatal injections of
      the dopamine agonist SKF 38393.
PG  - 5393-8
AB  - Prenatal treatment with the D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 or cocaine
      induces expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos in the fetal rat
      suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (Weaver et al., 1992). Because the induction of
      c-fos gene expression in the SCN has been implicated in the entrainment of
      circadian rhythms by light in mature animals, the present study investigated
      whether prenatal dopaminergic activation entrains the fetal circadian pacemaker. 
      Injections of SKF 38393 (8 mg/kg) were given to pregnant, SCN-lesioned hamsters
      during the last 5 d of gestation and the phases of the offspring's wheel-running 
      activity rhythms were measured on postnatal day 20. Pregnant hamsters were each
      given two injections/day 12 hr apart, but only one of the injections each day
      contained SKF 38393. One group of hamsters received the drug at 0800 hr while
      another group received the drug at 2000 hr. The offspring from these treatment
      groups showed average phases that differed by 11.3 hr, demonstrating that
      prenatal SKF 38393 set the phase of the offspring's circadian rhythms. These
      results suggest that the fetal circadian pacemaker can be entrained by
      dopaminergic activation. In situ hybridization using cRNA probes demonstrated
      that a single injection of SKF 38393 on the last day of gestation induced c-fos
      gene expression in the fetal hamster SCN and that mRNA for the D1-dopamine
      receptor was present in the SCN at that time. It is possible that maternal
      entrainment of the fetal circadian pacemaker, which normally occurs during
      development, is mediated by dopaminergic activation within the fetal
      hypothalamus.

TI  - The psychological effects of counting fetal movements.
PG  - 135-40
AB  - By identifying a change in fetal activity state, fetal movement counting may help
      to reduce the possibility of stillbirth. Concern has arisen that such a focus on 
      fetal activity may cause undue maternal anxiety. A prospective, controlled trial 
      was conducted to determine whether fetal movement counting induced anxiety or
      other deleterious psychological effects in low-risk primigravidas. A sample of
      613 healthy pregnant women was randomly assigned at 28 weeks' gestation to fetal 
      movement counting, sleep recording, or a nonrecording control group. State and
      trait of anxiety, belief in sources of personal control, and attitudes toward
      pregnancy and infant were assessed at 28 and 37 weeks' gestation. Participation
      rates were high (91.4%) across all groups. Most women (90%) assigned to count
      fetal movements did so on a daily basis (95% of days). No significant changes in 
      psychological status occurred in the three groups as a result of self-monitoring 
      conditions. Independent of group assignment, all women showed a slight increase
      in transient state and decrease in trait of anxiety from 28 to 37 weeks. Internal
      locus of control and positive attitudes toward the infant increased slightly, and
      feelings of well-being decreased slightly for all women. It was concluded that
      women are willing to record fetal activity, and that fetal movement counting does
      not cause deleterious psychological effects in low-risk pregnant women.

TI  - Administration of human chorionic gonadotropin affects sleep-wake phases and
      other associated behaviors in cycling female rats.
PG  - 181-90
AB  - We investigated the possible effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on
      sleep-wake phases and other associated behaviors controlled by the medial
      preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic epidural
      electroencephalographic (EEG) and temporal muscle electromyographic (EMG)
      electrodes were placed in cycling female rats. After a week of recovery, rats
      were injected intraperitoneally at 3.00 pm on the day of proestrus with either
      saline or highly purified hCG or indomethacin or hCG plus indomethacin. Three
      hours after injection, EEG, EMG and behavioral activities were recorded for 3.5
      h. The administration of hCG increased high and low amplitude sleep, resting
      phase and decreased active awake phase, walking, sniffing and chewing as compared
      to the controls. While the administration of indomethacin alone had no effect,
      coadministration inhibited hCG effects. Medial preoptic area, cerebral cortex and
      hippocampus contain immunostaining for LH/hCG receptors. The administration of
      hCG resulted in an increase of immunoreactive PGD2 and a decrease of PGE2 in
      median preoptic area, cerebral cortex and hippocampus as compared to the
      controls. In summary, hCG administration affects sleep-wake phases and other
      associated behaviors in rats which can collectively be described as decreased
      activity. These effects are probably mediated by increasing PGD2 and decreasing
      PGE2 in areas of brain which control these activities. The above findings may be 
      relevant to pregnant women who experience decreased activity when hCG is present 
      in the circulation and cerebrospinal fluid.

TI  - Sleep: what is normal at six months?
PG  - 166-7
AB  - Health visitors and general practitioners are often asked for help because of
      what parents perceive as a baby's sleeping problem. Many parents expect that the 
      baby will be sleeping continuously through the night from a given age, often as
      early as six weeks old. The conflict between the parents' expectations and the
      baby's behaviour leads the parents to seek help. Analysis of the first 640
      questionnaires received from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and
      Childhood (ALSPAC). Study show that many six-month-old babies have broken nights.
      Only 16% slept through the night at six months old. Half woke occasionally, 9%
      woke most nights, 5% woke once every night and a further 17% woke more than once 
      per night, ranging from twice to eight times. For 16% of six-month-olds there was
      no regular sleeping pattern. Parents use a variety of strategies when the baby
      wakes at night, including rocking or cuddling, giving a dummy or feeding with
      milk or another drink. By six months old, 61% of babies slept in a room on their 
      own, but 15% were always or usually brought into the parents' bed if they woke,
      and 34% sometimes 28% of babies aged six months routinely slept in the parents'
      bedroom. Knowing that their baby's behaviour pattern is "normal" and shared by
      many other babies of the same age is often reassuring to parents.

TI  - Hyperbaric oxygenation increases arousal and breathing movements in fetal lambs.
PG  - 902-11
AB  - Oxygenation produced by distending the lungs with 100% O2 increases the
      occurrence of arousal and fetal breathing movements (FBM), particularly during
      non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, in fetal sheep of > or = 135 days of
      gestation. We studied the breathing and behavioral responses to a rise in
      arterial PO2 (PaO2) without lung distension in fetuses between 128 and 132 days
      of gestation. Twelve fetuses were chronically instrumented to record FBM,
      behavioral state, blood pressure, arterial blood gas tensions, and pH. Fetal PaO2
      was raised by having the ewe breathe 100% O2 at 3 atmosphere absolute pressure
      spontaneously (group 1, n = 5, 129 +/- 1 days of gestation) or with mechanical
      ventilation to control fetal arterial PCO2 (group 2, n = 7, 131 +/- 1 days of
      gestation). Hyperbaric oxygenation raised fetal PaO2 by 20 Torr in both groups.
      During hyperbaric oxygenation, the occurrence of arousal increased severalfold in
      both groups. The occurrence of FBM increased during arousal in both groups,
      during rapid-eye-movement sleep in group 1, and during NREM sleep in group 2. The
      timing of diaphragmatic activity during arousal and the variability of
      diaphragmatic activity during NREM sleep were different than those in
      rapid-eye-movement sleep. We conclude that oxygenation without lung distension
      increases the occurrence of arousal and of FBM, principally during arousal and
      NREM sleep, in fetuses of < or = 135 days of gestation.

TI  - A prospective study of proneness to acute respiratory illness in the first two
      years of life.
PG  - 818-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study sought explanations for the proneness to respiratory
      events in young Australian children. METHODS: Prospective respiratory symptom
      diaries on 836 children collected data on respiratory symptoms and episodes.
      Questionnaires to mothers and birth and pregnancy records provided 56 known and
      possible predictors which were tested against two summary respiratory outcomes in
      each of the first and second years of life. RESULTS: The two summary respiratory 
      variables recorded for first and second year of life give four outcome variables.
      In fitting multivariate regression models to predict outcomes, use of child care 
      in early childhood and mothers' experience of respiratory illness in the 12
      months before birth were significant predictors for all four outcomes. Number of 
      siblings was a predictor for three of the four outcomes. Sleep difficulty during 
      pregnancy in the mother, and respiratory hospitalization of the infant in the
      first year, were significant predictors for both first-year outcomes. Unexpected 
      and unexplained findings emerged for alcohol intake during pregnancy, passive
      smoking and breastfeeding in relation to the second year respiratory outcomes.
      Less than 9% of variance in outcome scores was explained in any of the four
      multiple regression models but this rose to between 24% and 31% when a
      corresponding score from the other year was added to the model. CONCLUSIONS:
      Proneness to respiratory illness is an important entity; its determinants are
      largely unknown and events in pregnancy or the perinatal period explain only a
      small proportion of the between-infant variability.

TI  - Patterns of fetal breathing in the baboon vary with EEG sleep state.
PG  - 11-26
AB  - This report examines the hypothesis that the characteristics of breathing
      activity of the fetal baboon are modulated with respect to sleep state in a
      fashion similar to that observed in the human fetus. The pattern of fetal
      breathing activity was examined in relationship to electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      sleep state in studies of six fetuses of chronically monitored pregnant baboons
      at 143-148 days of gestation (term, 175-180 days). Fetal breaths were defined by 
      fluctuations of tracheal fluid pressure. EEG sleep states were defined with an
      automated method for discrimination of EEG patterns that are standard indices of 
      quiet and active sleep in immature primates. During more than 250 h of recorded
      data, the fetuses spent on average 33.3 +/- 3.9% of time in EEG quiet sleep. In
      comparisons across state the fetuses spent significantly (P = 0.001) less time
      breathing during quiet than active sleep (49.5 +/- 6.8 vs. 69.0 +/- 3.8%). The
      inspiratory and expiratory time intervals of fetal breaths were not
      differentiated by EEG state but, the mean breath to breath interval was
      significantly (P < 0.001) longer in EEG quiet sleep. In addition to these
      differences in incidence and time interval of breaths, during epochs of
      breathing, there was a significantly slower rate, lower amplitude, and lower
      variability of rate of breathing in quiet sleep (all P-values < 0.02). Thus,
      periodic breathing activity in the fetal baboon is present in both quiet and
      active EEG sleep states. Sleep states have a powerful influence on patterns of
      fetal breathing in the non-human primate, directly comparable to the human fetus.

TI  - Spectral analysis of heart rate variability during quiet sleep in normal human
      fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks of gestation.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a clinical manifestation of the
      parasympathetic nervous system which can be identified in the high-frequency
      region of the heart rate variability (HRV) power spectrum. The purpose of this
      study was to determine the relative contribution of RSA to overall HRV for human 
      fetuses in quiet sleep. The study population consisted of 13 normal human fetuses
      between 36 and 40 weeks of gestation for whom data were collected during
      spontaneous breathing and normally occurring apneic periods. Fetal breathing was 
      monitored continuously using real-time sonography. The fetal electrocardiogram
      was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 Hz and fetal
      R-waves were extracted from the raw signal using adaptive signal processing
      techniques. Fetal behavioral state was determined at the beginning and end of
      each 3-min data collection period. The fetal R-wave interbeat intervals (IBIs)
      were converted to equally-spaced, time-based data, and linear detrending of the
      time series was accomplished by subtracting the mean heart period from each
      weighted IBI. Total power (TP, 0.0-2.5 Hz) was divided into RSA (0.4-1.0 Hz),
      high-frequency (HF, 0.2-2.5 Hz), low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.2 Hz), and
      very-low-frequency (VLF, 0.0-0.04 Hz) regions, and the power densities were
      summed to determine the absolute power for each frequency component. A total of
      81 3-min blocks (mean per subject 6.3, range 2-14) were available for analysis.
      Eleven (85%) of 13 fetuses demonstrated a HF peak during fetal breathing, and RSA
      accounted for approximately 20% of the TP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Early heart rate response of normal human term fetuses to vibroacoustic
      stimulation.
PG  - 273-8
AB  - We examined cardiac reactivity in the first 45 seconds following a single 1
      second vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) to determine if the prestimulus fetal heart
      rate (FHR) pattern was predictive of the immediate post-VAS heart rate response. 
      Forty-nine normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation were
      observed to enter quiet sleep and remain in that state for 3 to 5 minutes before 
      testing. In general, VAS elicited an initial acceleratory response of
      approximately 20 beats/min above the mean prestimulus heart rate followed by a
      deceleratory response to an average of approximately 4 beats/min below baseline
      values. Fetuses with different average prestimulus heart rate patterns generally 
      differed in their early cardiac response to VAS: when compared to a high baseline
      FHR, a low resting heart rate was associated with a greater increase in heart
      rate above baseline (r = -0.401; P = 0.03), a greater decrease below prestimulus 
      values (r = -0.312; P = 0.03), and a greater difference between maximum and
      minimum heart rates (r = -0.465; P = 0.001). Higher baseline heart rates were
      associated with lower FHR variability in the prestimulus period (r = -0.422; P = 
      0.009). When we examined the time course of the early response, we found that
      fetuses that achieved a maximum heart rate quickly exhibited less of an increase 
      above prestimulus values (r = 0.894; P = 0.005), displayed a greater decrease
      below baseline (r = 0.507; P = 0.0002), and reached the minimum heart rate faster
      (r = 0.575; P = 0.0001) than fetuses that required longer to achieve a maximum
      cardiac response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Heart rate and blood pressure chronomes during and after pregnancy.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - Whereas conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure and
      heart rate may mislead, influenced as they are, among other factors, by the
      individual's emotional state, position, diet and external stimuli generally, the 
      chronobiologic evaluation of predictable variability in these physiologic
      variables assesses early cardiovascular disease risk in pregnancy by (a) the use 
      of fully ambulatory devices and (b) the proper processing of the time series thus
      obtained. We have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-h synchronized
      circadian characteristics of cardiovascular variables in two consecutive
      pregnancies of a clinically healthy woman. The results were then compared with
      those obtained from data sampled after the second pregnancy. Blood pressure and
      heart rate were automatically monitored, at 1-h intervals, each time for at least
      48 consecutive hours, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy.
      Circadian parameters of those circulatory variables were computed for each 48-h
      profile of measurements by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve.
      Regression analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of
      circadian rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. In both
      pregnancies, the predictable variability of the circadian rhythm-adjusted mean of
      blood pressure can be approximated by a second-order polynomial model on
      gestational age: a steady linear decrease in systolic, mean arterial and
      diastolic blood pressures up to the 22nd week of pregnancy is followed by an
      increase up to the day of delivery. This pattern of variation is not found for
      data similarly sampled during non-pregnancy on the same woman. This longitudinal 
      study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable
      pregnancy-associated variability in blood pressure and heart rate and also allows
      the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular
      parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

TI  - Prolactin and beta-hCG in pregnancy: 24 hour hormone profiles during preterm
      labour and the last 6 hours up to delivery.
PG  - 343-6
AB  - We examined the 24 hour plasma profiles of prolactin and beta-hCG in 7 women with
      preterm labour between the 30th and 34th week of gestation. The results showed
      that, despite preterm labour, the circadian rhythm of prolactin was maintained.
      The beta-hCG levels showed a wide scattering in the normal range which is also
      characteristic of pregnancy with no complications. In addition we examined the
      prolactin and beta-hCG levels during the last 6 hours preceding delivery. Here we
      found significant higher hormone concentrations of hCG in the mothers delivered
      of female babies than in the mothers of males. This higher hormone level declined
      continuously during the delivery, however, without significance. We also observed
      concordant secretion patterns of prolactin and beta-hCG in these cases. Normal
      hCG and prolactin values were found in mothers delivered of male babies.

TI  - Primate parturition and the role of the maternal circadian system.
PG  - 193-203
AB  - Several 24-h rhythms have been observed in the mother and in the fetus during
      primate gestation. In the mother, 24-h rhythms occur in biophysical variables,
      pregnancy-associated plasma hormones and preparturient myometrial activity. In
      addition, both pregnant non-human primates and pregnant women deliver
      preferentially during the night and early morning hours. A crucial question
      pertaining circadian rhythms is whether 24-h rhythms that may be observed during 
      pregnancy are endogenous in nature and entrained by the light-dark cycle or
      whether the daily photoperiod is a causal stimulus. Our work has addressed the
      role of the maternal and fetal circadian system for 24-h rhythms in
      pregnancy-associated maternal plasma hormones, preparturient myometrial activity 
      and parturition in human and non-human primate pregnancy. In the present review, 
      the results of some of our studies are being discussed in combination with data
      available from the literature. It is apparent that 24-h rhythms that may be
      observed during primate pregnancy are determined by the maternal circadian
      system, suggesting that the developing fetus receives information about the
      ambient time of the day via the mother. Fetal entrainment by the mother may
      ensure fetal cooperation so that parturition occurs at the most favorable time of
      the day. We conclude that the functioning of the maternal circadian system is
      integral to the pregnant state. Thus, proper care and management of pregnant
      women and the ultimate outcome of obstetrics may benefit from more timely
      methodologies. A chronopharmacological attitude towards the prevention of
      premature labor and the induction and augmentation of labor at term may yield new
      therapeutic strategies. Such an approach will enable delivery to take place under
      optimal conditions for mother and child.

TI  - Practice parameters for the use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy.
      Standards of Practice Committee of the American Sleep Disorders Association.
PG  - 348-51
AB  - Narcolepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system characterized by excessive
      sleepiness, cataplexy, and other rapid-eye-movement (REM)-sleep phenomena such as
      sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. Although stimulants are the only
      effective treatment for the sleepiness of narcolepsy, no clinical guidelines on
      the use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy have been published that
      address the following factors: appropriate doses; development of tolerance;
      potential for side effects, adverse reactions and abuse; and use in children and 
      pregnant or breast-feeding women. These practice parameters from the American
      Sleep Disorders Association provide the first clinical guidelines on the
      appropriate use of stimulants in the treatment of narcolepsy.

OAB - Family planning policy in Burkina Faso aims to improve maternal and child health.
      Family planning services are oriented towards modern contraceptives and tend to
      target women. Yet, the man has a large responsibility in the life of the family. 
      He makes the important decisions on sexual relations and, therefore, on family
      planning. Family planning in terms of spacing of births interests many men. If
      family planning is presented as birth spacing, men would be in favor of it.
      Services adapted to men's needs will prove useful. Some men even want to limit
      the number of their children. A man from Burkina Faso believes that having many
      children is not a sign of affluence but of poverty. In rural areas, despite the
      lack of sanitation, weak means and methods of contraception, the people have
      information on family planning. Dispensaries are centers of distribution of such 
      messages. The messages of the mass media are often misunderstood. A father of 6
      who was older than 60 was unaware of methods to limit fertility. Sexual
      abstinence is no longer a rule in rural areas, at least among the youth. In the
      villages, young couples often face the many problems of too close pregnancies.
      Male violence is equally responsible for some situations. The drunk husband
      enters the home while falling and making his wife sleep with him. This violence
      is an obstacle to freedom in matters of production. It is not easy to change
      their attitude. One has simply ignored the influential role of men. Men are even 
      forgotten in conception programs. Since 1981 in Mauritania, the family health
      program has had a fathers' school which sensitizes men to the problems of women, 
      children, and family planning. The Ghanian Family Planning Association sponsors
      Dads' Clubs.

TI  - Prenatal exposure to cigarettes in infants with obstructive sleep apneas.
PG  - 778-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of prenatal smoking on infant respiratory
      behavior during sleep. METHODS: A questionnaire concerning family habits and
      infants' history was completed for 550 healthy infants before a 9-hour night
      polysomnographic study. Because the data for 41 infants were not available for
      analysis, 509 subjects were studied: 115 were newborns evaluated within 1 week
      after birth, and 394 were healthy infants admitted at 11 weeks of life (range 5
      to 29 weeks) after various research protocols. RESULTS: According to the smoking 
      frequency of the mothers during pregnancy, the subjects were defined as
      "nonsmokers" (no cigarette smoked during pregnancy; n = 400), "light smokers" (1 
      to 9 cigarettes per day; n = 37), or "smokers" (10 or more cigarettes per day; n 
      = 72). Compared with nonsmokers and light smokers, "smoking" mothers had a
      significant increase in the number of episodes of uterine bleeding during the
      pregnancy. Their infants had lower birth weights and more frequent episodes of
      profuse sweating during sleep. Infants of smokers also had more frequent and
      longer obstructive sleep apneas than those of the two other groups. For infants
      of smokers the relative risk for obstructive apneas was 2.76 (95% confidence
      interval: 1.63 to 4.69; P = .001). The relation between prenatal smoking and
      postnatal manifestation of obstructive sleep apneas demonstrated a dose-response 
      pattern. Paternal smoking during pregnancy increased the risk of obstructive
      apneas only in the infants of smoking mothers, but not in those of the two other 
      groups. Maternal smoking after birth did not add significantly to the risk of
      obstructive apneas. The effect of smoking was seen in older infants, as well as
      in the newborn not yet exposed to ambient cigarette smoke. A stepwise logistic
      regression, using obstructive sleep apneas as the dependent variable identified
      three significant independent variables: smoking during pregnancy (P = .001),
      profuse sweating during sleep (P = .001), and birth weight (P = .010). No
      explanation was found for the effect of prenatal smoking on obstructive sleep
      apneas. CONCLUSION: Prenatal smoking by mothers correlated with an increase in
      frequency and length of obstructive apneas and a decrease in birth weight of
      their infants. The infants were under greater risk for obstructive apnea if both 
      parents smoked. Explanations for our results are unknown to us, but these
      findings may be of interest in the study of infant breathing behavior and
      epidemiological characteristics of sudden infant death syndrome.

TI  - Childbearing in women with and without a history of affective disorder. II.
      Electroencephalographic sleep.
PG  - 215-24
AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep was examined longitudinally in 34
      obstetrically healthy volunteers recruited early in pregnancy. All women were
      free of current psychiatric disorder. Fourteen women had a personal history of
      affective disorder, and 20 had no history of any psychiatric disorder. EEG sleep 
      was recorded in subjects' homes at specified points from 12 weeks' gestation
      through 8 months' postpartum to examine the impact of childbearing on sleep and
      psychiatric symptoms in women with a history of affective disorder. EEG sleep
      measurements, as well as clinical ratings of sleep, indicated that sleep
      disturbances were most pronounced over the first 2 to 3 months' postpartum and
      were characterized primarily by interrupted sleep. The obstetrical course of
      these women was uneventful, and the outcome with respect to affective
      disturbances was highly favorable. Nevertheless, childbearing was associated with
      greater changes in total sleep time and with rapid eye movement (REM) latency
      reduction in women with a history of affective disorder, even in the absence of
      clinically significant mood changes. Findings suggest that the sleep system of
      women with a history of affective disorder may be more sensitive to the
      psychobiological changes associated with childbearing, as evidenced by earlier
      onset of sleep disruption over the childbearing course and a reduction in REM
      latency in the final trimester that persisted throughout the eighth postpartum
      month.

TI  - Ductus venosus flow velocity waveforms in relation to fetal behavioural states.
PG  - 220-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish the reproducibility of flow velocity waveforms in the
      human ductus venosus and to assess the influence of fetal behavioural states on
      these waveforms in normal term fetuses. DESIGN: Reproducibility of Doppler
      waveform recording and analysis was studied in 10 normal pregnancies. The
      relation between ductus venosus flow velocities and behavioural states was
      investigated in 19 other term fetuses. Time-averaged, peak systolic, peak
      diastolic velocity, peak systolic/diastolic ratio and period time were calculated
      in both cross sectional studies. SETTING: Outpatient clinic, department of
      obstetrics (prenatal diagnosis section), Academic Hospital, Rotterdam--Dijkzigt. 
      SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine women with normal singleton pregnancies at 36 to 39 weeks
      of gestation, resulting in uncomplicated births of healthy infants. RESULTS:
      Within-patient coefficients of variation, ductus venosus waveform recordings were
      approximately 8 to 10% except for the peak systolic/diastolic ratio (4.3%). A
      decrease of approximately 30% was established for peak systolic, peak diastolic
      velocity and time-averaged velocity during behavioural state 1F (quiet sleep) as 
      compared with state 2F (active sleep). CONCLUSIONS: Flow velocity waveform
      recording in the ductus venosus demonstrates acceptable reproducibility. Fetal
      behavioural state-dependent changes were observed, suggesting a redistribution of
      umbilical venous blood through the ductus venosus shunt during the quiet sleep
      state.

AB  - The position adopted during sleep by 52 pregnant women and 31 age-matched
      nonpregnant control subjects was studied. The pregnant group were all beyond the 
      30th week of gestation. In the pregnant group, 40 (77%) adopted a left tilt, 11
      (21%) a right tilt and one (2%) was supine. In the control group, eight (26%)
      adopted a left tilt, 10 (32%) a right tilt, 12 (39%) were supine and one (3%) was
      prone. Closer analysis of the position adopted by the pregnant group showed: 33
      adopted a full left 90 degrees tilt, five a left 60 degrees tilt, two a left 30
      degrees tilt, 11 adopted a full 90 degrees right tilt and only one was supine.
      There was a significant difference between the sleeping positions of the pregnant
      and the control groups (p < 0.001). The majority of the pregnant group adopted a 
      sleeping position that reduced the likelihood of aortocaval compression syndrome.

TI  - [Changes in sleep parameters of young women from late pregnancy to postpartum].
PG  - 38-47
AB  - Mothers in postpartum periods are forced to be awake at night in order to take
      care of their babies. It is important to investigate relationships between the
      sleep patterns of postpartum mothers and their babies' activities under
      conditions in daily life to determine effects on their health. In this study,
      changes in sleep parameters of young women from late pregnancy to the 6th
      postpartum week were studied using the ambulatory EEG monitoring system. Subjects
      were 10 primiparae, aged 23-31 yrs (mean age of 26.8 yrs), who had a normal
      course of pregnancy and delivery. EEG, EMG, EOG and ECG of the mothers and their 
      babies' actigrams from legs during sleep were simultaneously recorded using
      Medilog 9000 at home at four points: during late pregnancy (36 weeks), and the
      1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. In the late pregnancy period, mean sleep
      efficiency for the 10 subjects was 94.5%, and mean total sleep time was 368.8
      min. We compared the sleep parameters of four points using a two-way analysis of 
      variance (point x subject). Total sleep time showed no significant differences
      among the four points (postpartum 1st week: 336.8 min, 3rd: 314.2 min, 6th:312.6 
      min.). Percent of waking time after sleep onset in the 1st postpartum week
      (21.1%) significantly increased compared with late pregnancy (5.4%), but did not 
      change through the 3rd (19.7%) and 6th week (20.7%). The percent of stage 3 + 4
      and stage REM did not change across the four points, but the percent of stage 2
      in the postpartum period (1st week: 39.7%, 3rd: 41.2%, 6th: 41.0%) significantly 
      decreased compared with late pregnancy (59.6%). There were no significant
      differences in the number of awakening among the four points. In conclusion,
      wakefulness after sleep onset during postpartum period increased compared with
      late pregnancy. The mothers' sleep pattern did not change through the 1st, 3rd
      and 6th postpartum weeks. These findings suggested strongly that their sleep was 
      interrupted by their babies' activities, as shown in another abstract.

PG  - 19-26
AB  - Although sleep disturbance is commonly reported in pregnancy, there have been few
      studies on sleep characteristics in pregnancy. In this study, all women attending
      the antenatal clinic at Sapporo Medical College Hospital for 1 month during
      autumn and 3 months during winter were surveyed with a questionnaire and sleep
      log. Of the 192 patients, 169 (88.0%) stated that sleep was altered from their
      usual experience. A principal components analysis identified three sleep factors 
      from the ten items in the measure of sleep used (Sleep Log). The three factors
      were: Sleep Duration and Quality, Insomnia and Daytime Alertness. Although no
      significant differences across trimesters were found on the three sleep factors, 
      Sleep Duration and Quality, and Insomnia were worst during the first trimester.
      Sleep normalized in the second trimester, but the third trimester was
      characterized by increased Insomnia and decreased Daytime Alertness. The most
      frequent reasons cited by women for sleep alterations were urinary frequency,
      backache or ache in the hips and fetal movement. Contingency X2 analyses were
      used to investigate a relationship between the frequency of reporting the reasons
      and the trimester of pregnancy. Significant increases were found in reporting as 
      the reasons for sleep difficulties, fetal movement in the third trimester, and
      heartburn, nausea and vomiting in the first trimester. The description of sleep
      patterns during pregnancy has clinical relevance as sleep alterations in
      pregnancy are common.

TI  - The pros and cons of transdermal nicotine therapy.
PG  - 152-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review current knowledge of the efficacy, safety and cost of
      transdermal nicotine therapy for smoking cessation. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY
      SELECTION: 1. Published and unpublished reports of randomised, double-blind
      trials of at least 12 weeks' duration, in smokers motivated to cease smoking,
      identified by a search of the MEDLINE database, article and book bibliographies, 
      Current contents, and by a request to the Medical Department of Ciba-Geigy
      (Australia) Ltd. 2. A clinical trial of 1500 smokers using transdermal nicotine
      (S Gourlay, unpublished data). DATA SYNTHESIS: Transdermal nicotine more than
      doubles the success rates of smoking cessation attempts in motivated subjects who
      smoke at least 10-15 cigarettes per day (odds ratio 12 months after quitting,
      2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.4). Application site reactions are not
      uncommon (erythema or burning < or = 16%, transient itch < or = 50%) and cause
      discontinuation of therapy in up to 10% of subjects. Sleep disturbance due to
      nocturnal nicotine absorption occurs in up to 13% of subjects when patches are
      worn overnight. Smoking or nicotine chewing gum used concurrently with
      transdermal nicotine could raise peak nicotine levels but is unlikely to
      adversely affect individuals with established tolerance to nicotine. Smoking and 
      (theoretically) nicotine replacement therapies should be avoided in pregnancy or 
      patients with unstable coronary artery disease. In such patients, the
      risk-benefit ratio of nicotine replacement therapies may be favourable for
      nicotine-dependent smokers unable to cease smoking by alternative methods.
      CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal nicotine is an effective smoking cessation therapy for
      motivated, nicotine-dependent smokers. As most smokers can cease smoking on their
      own, and the patches are costly, they should be recommended only for smokers who 
      are unable to quit by simpler means and those likely to suffer severe nicotine
      withdrawal symptoms.

TI  - Comparisons of EEG sleep state-specific spectral values between healthy full-term
      and preterm infants at comparable postconceptional ages.
PG  - 47-51
AB  - Differences in state-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral values are
      described between groups of preterm and full-term neonates at comparable
      postconceptional term ages. Eighteen healthy preterm neonates of < or = 32 weeks 
      gestation were selected from an inborn population of a neonatal intensive care
      unit. Twenty-four-channel recordings were obtained at a full-term age and
      compared with studies of 22 healthy full-term neonates. The initial three hours
      of each 12-hour study were recorded on paper from which EEG sleep state scores
      per minute were visually assessed. Six mean spectral values (i.e. total EEG,
      electromyogram, delta, theta, alpha and beta energies) were calculated from each 
      corresponding minute of digitized data, which was also assigned one of six EEG
      sleep states. Each neonatal group displayed statistically significant differences
      among sleep-state segments for all spectral values. The alpha- and beta-range
      spectral values of the preterm group, compared to the full-term control group,
      were lower during all sleep state segments. Spectral values for the theta band
      were lower during both quiet sleep segments only, whereas spectral values for
      delta were lower during all sleep stages, except trace-alternant quiet sleep.
      Significant differences in EEG spectral values were noted among states of sleep
      for both preterm and full-term infants of similar postconceptional term ages.
      These data also suggest differences in central nervous system maturation between 
      neonatal populations. These findings strengthen our previously stated contention 
      that there is a functional alteration in brain development of the preterm infant 
      as reflected in sleep organization that results from a prolonged extrauterine
      experience and/or prematurity.

TI  - Consequences on the newborn of chronic maternal consumption of coffee during
      gestation and lactation: a review.
PG  - 6-21
AB  - The present review is devoted to effects on the newborn of maternal ingestion of 
      caffeine during gestation and lactation. In rodents, caffeine is able to induce
      malformations, but usually at high doses never encountered in humans; indeed,
      when caffeine is administered in fractioned quantities during the day, as it is
      the case with human caffeine intake, caffeine is no longer a teratogen in
      rodents. Caffeine ingested during gestation induces a dose-dependent decrease in 
      body weight, but only for large doses (> 7 cups/day of coffee), whereas it has no
      effect at moderate doses. Maternal caffeine consumption during gestation affects 
      hematologic parameters in both rat and human infants and induces long-term
      effects on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity and anxiety in rodent
      offspring, whereas in humans, more studies are needed to determine the
      consequences of early caffeine exposure on behavior. Investigators do not agree
      on the quantities of the methylxanthine found in breast milk, but caffeine does
      not change breast milk composition, and rather, stimulates milk production. We
      conclude in this review that maternal caffeine consumption in moderate amounts
      during gestation and lactation has no measurable consequences on the fetus and
      newborn infant. Pregnant mothers, however, should be advised to consume coffee
      and caffeinated beverages in moderation, especially because of the prolonged
      half-life of caffeine both during the last trimester of pregnancy and in the
      newborn infant.

TI  - Discordant twin pairs: the relation between gestational age and neonatal
      temperament differences in cotwins.
PG  - 165-73
AB  - Temperament differences between cotwins at least 15% discordant for birth-weight 
      were compared for a group of 66 preterm twin pairs and a group of 70 fullterm
      twin pairs, assessed in the neonatal period. The assessment focused on
      irritability, resistance to soothing, activity, reactivity, and reinforcement
      value. For the most part, significant differences were not obtained between
      discordant preterm cotwins. Previous research [10] had demonstrated that the
      larger fullterm twin of discordant pairs was more irritable, more difficult to
      soothe, more active while awake and during sleep, less reactive to visual and
      auditory stimuli, and less reinforcing to the examiner than the smaller cotwin.
      It was concluded that, for the behavioral variables measured, the fullterm group 
      is at higher risk than the preterm group, and that both the lighter and the
      heavier discordant twins displayed signs of early behavioral risk. The findings
      suggested that the continued gestation for cotwins discordant in weight may be a 
      risk period for early temperament development of the twins.

TI  - Mothers' health after the birth of the first child: the case of employed women in
      an Italian city.
PG  - 1-22
AB  - While the number of mothers resuming employment soon after the birth of a child
      is growing, knowledge about the effect that having both a baby and a job has on
      mental and physical health is still scarce. In this paper, we studied the health 
      of 141 Italian first-time mothers, who were all employed during pregnancy. When
      their child was 15 months old, 84% were back at work; 24-36% suffered from lack
      of sleep, extreme tiredness and backache; more than half had experienced some
      feelings of depression since the birth. Considering the whole sample, poorly
      educated and unmarried mothers reported more physical health problems. Being
      employed per se showed no influence, but poorly educated mothers and those with a
      less qualified job reported more problems. On the basis of our results, we
      suggest that future research on new mothers, work and health should
      systematically include "domestic" variables and the characteristics of the paid
      job; and should analyze more thoroughly the influence of marriage status and
      educational level on health.

TI  - [Effects of coffee and caffeine on fertility, reproduction, lactation, and
      development. Review of human and animal data].
PG  - 241-56
AB  - In the present review, we have examined the effects of coffee ingestion on
      fertility, reproduction, lactation and development. The potential effects of
      coffee consumption on fertility, spontaneous abortion and prematurity are not
      clearly established but appear to be quite limited. In rodents, caffeine can
      induce malformations but this effect appears in general at doses never
      encountered in humans. Indeed, as soon as the quantity of caffeine is divided
      over the day, as is the case for human consumption, the teratogenic effect of
      caffeine disappears in rodents. Coffee ingested during gestation induces a
      dose-dependent decrease in birth weight, but usually only when ingested amounts
      are high (i.e. more than 7 cups/day), whereas coffee has no effect at moderate
      doses. Caffeine consumption during gestation affects hematologic parameters of
      the new-born infant or rat. In animals, caffeine induces long-term consequences
      on sleep, locomotion, learning abilities, emotivity and anxiety, whereas, in
      children, the effects of early exposure to coffee and caffeine on behavior are
      not clearly established. The quantities of caffeine found in maternal milk vary
      with authors, but it appears clearly that caffeine does not change maternal milk 
      composition and has a tendency to stimule milk production. In conclusion to this 
      review, it appears that maternal coffee or caffeine consumption during gestation 
      and/or lactation does not seem to have measurable consequences on the fetus of
      the newborn, as long as ingested quantities remain moderate. Therefore, pregnant 
      mothers should be advised to limit their coffee and caffeine intake to 300 mg
      caffeine/day (i.e. 2-3 cups of coffee or 2.5-3 l of coke) especially because of
      the increase of caffeine half-life during the third trimester of pregnancy and in
      the neonate.

AB  - Spontaneous breathing movements are present during fetal life and they are
      important for normal development of the lung. Early in gestation they seem to
      represent free-running activity of the respiratory centers, not controlled by
      peripheral mechanisms but probably dependent on a tonic CO2 drive. Maturation of 
      sleep states brings into play powerful brainstem inhibitory mechanisms which
      control FBM. At birth these mechanisms must be overridden to allow the
      establishment of continuous breathing.

      subcellular distribution of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) were
      investigated in blood and/or smear samples from 18 women aged 23-46 years (mean
      32.5 years) with trisomy 21 fetuses (17-21 weeks) and 28 women aged 20-42 years
      (mean 31 years) with normal fetuses (17-22 weeks). Immunochemical NAP
      investigations were carried out in 8 pathological and 8 normal pregnancies;
      cytochemical and immunocytochemical procedures were carried out in 18 pregnant
      women with trisomy 21 fetuses and 28 controls. NAP from women with trisomy 21
      fetuses is characterized by: (1) a significant decrease in reactivity with
      anti-liver-type alkaline phosphatase (AP) and anti-NAP antisera; (2) low or very 
      slight reactivity with antiplacental or anti-intestinal antibodies; (3) marked
      dispersion of NAP lead citrate reaction products or anti-NAP antibody colloidal
      gold-labelling in neutrophil cytoplasms, as detected by electron microscopy. This
      subcellular AP distribution (extramembranous) is different from that of normal
      NAP sites associated with plasma membrane, nuclear membrane and secretory
      vesicles. The NAP immunochemical and cytochemical characteristics suggest that
      neutrophils of a woman with a trisomy 21 fetus contain two AP isoenzymes: the
      liver/bone type and an atypical AP.

      medication during the lying in period following childbirth.
PG  - 273-9
AB  - The awareness of the inherent risks attached to medication use during pregnancy
      is increasing. There is, however, a paucity of available following childbirth. We
      have conducted a prospective study in women who gave birth in hospital with the
      objective of analysing the use of medication in this lying in period. The results
      show that, in addition to the vitamins and minerals routinely prescribed for
      every young mother and the antipyretics administered as required, the following
      medicaments were most often used: analgesics (by approx. 9%), anti-inflammatory
      agents (49%) and antibiotics (38%). The antibiotics were either used
      prophylactically or, in cases of proven infection, administered therapeutically. 
      The use of antibiotics appears more intensive compared to western countries,
      presumably due to the greater risk of infection in this group in India. On the
      other hand, the use of sleep inducing medication and tranquillizers during the
      lying in period appears, in comparison to other studies, almost negligible. The
      majority of the women were unaware of the potential side-effects of medication
      during breastfeeding.

OAB - A prospective analysis was conducted on 539 women, 18-40 years old, admitted to
      the postpartum unit at the Christian Medical College Hospital in Vellore, India, 
      during June-September 1989 to learn prescribing patterns during the puerperium
      and the side effects of the drugs in the mother and the breast fed infant and to 
      examine the attitudes of the mothers to drug use during breast feeding and their 
      knowledge of possible side effects. 95.7% breast fed their newborns. 68.5%
      received at least three drugs. All the mothers received a combination of iron and
      folic acid and calcium lactate. The next most commonly prescribed drug category
      was antipyretics (53.1%) followed by anti-inflammatory drugs (49.2%), antibiotics
      (37.8%), and analgesics (13.9%). 0.2% of all the mothers received sedatives.
      96.4% of women who underwent assisted delivery (forceps and vacuum extraction)
      and 80% who underwent cesarean section (CS) received antipyretics. Most CS
      patients also received antibiotics (96%) and analgesics (70%). Among the women
      receiving antibiotics, 73.5% received it for prophylactic reasons and 26.5% for
      therapeutic reasons. 20.8% of women who had a normal delivery received
      antibiotics. 37.8% of mothers who chose to breast feed received antibiotics, even
      metronidazole, which is contraindicated in the newborn. Only four of all the
      physicians knew that drug use during lactation should be avoided. 16.3% of
      mothers knew that drug use during lactation would affect their newborn. Almost
      all these mothers knew that drugs are secreted in breast milk. 29.7% of the
      mothers who had delivered before the index delivery could name drugs prescribed
      during previous deliveries. None had noted any side effects either in themselves 
      or in their infants.

TI  - Protein malnutrition on suprachiasmatic nucleus cells in rats of three ages.
PG  - 11-9
AB  - The effects of prenatal and postnatal protein malnutrition on the major and minor
      somatic axes of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) cells of the rat were
      investigated. Female rats were fed either 6%, 8% or 25% casein diet 5 weeks
      before mating, during gestation and lactation. After weaning the pups were
      maintained on the same diet until sacrifice at 30, 90 or 220 days of age. The
      major and minor axes in fusiform, multipolar and ovoid cells were measured in
      Nissl-stained SCN slices. Although the 8% diet group displayed significant
      reductions in fusiform and ovoid cells, the 6% diet group showed the most intense
      reductions in cell size of the three cell types. In the 6% diet group, cell size 
      was significantly lower at 30 days but the difference with the other nutritional 
      groups ameliorated at 90 days and almost reached control values at 220 days.
      These data suggest that malnutrition maintained during gestation and postnatal
      life reduces the somatic size of SCN cells. This alteration may be a
      morphological substrate underlying sleep and behavioral circadian alterations
      observed in malnourished rats.

TI  - Effects of ozone exposure during pregnancy on ontogeny of sleep in rats.
PG  - 67-70
AB  - Few studies regarding the effects of ozone exposure in the central nervous system
      (CNS), during the early stages of development have been reported. The study of
      sleep on newborn rats represents a model to understand the effects of this gas on
      the CNS. We studied the sleep organization in rats whose mothers were exposed to 
      1 part per million (ppm) ozone during pregnancy. We found severe sleep
      disturbances such as a decrease in paradoxical sleep duration and inversion of
      the light-dark cycle or a circadian phase-shift of vigilance states. These
      results suggest that ozone exposure during pregnancy may affect the generating
      mechanisms of paradoxical sleep, and the regulation of circadian rhythms in rats.

TI  - Prenatal development of the retinohypothalamic pathway and the suprachiasmatic
      nucleus in the sheep.
PG  - 304-16
AB  - Circadian rhythms are present during fetal life in several mammalian species. To 
      characterize the ontogeny of the neural mechanisms that account for circadian
      rhythmicity in a precocious species, we studied the prenatal development of the
      retinohypothalamic pathway in lambs (gestation period of 147 days), using
      horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin as anterograde tracers. The
      suprachiasmatic nucleus was present as early as embryonic day 52 (E52). After
      E58, the suprachiasmatic nucleus reached its full number of neurons, estimated by
      the disector method in about 160,000 cells per nucleus at E62. The
      retinohypothalamic axons invaded the suprachiasmatic nucleus from E58, while
      neuroblasts were still migrating to the nucleus. At E62, there was a strong
      retinal projection that evolved until E121, when the retinal afferents
      established their definitive pattern of distribution in the ventral and central
      regions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and adjacent hypothalamic structures. The
      development of the retinohypothalamic pathway was delayed by about a week
      relative to the innervation of other subcortical visual centers. The present
      findings demonstrated an early prenatal development of the visual pathways in
      lambs, including the retinohypothalamic pathway, suggesting that the mechanisms
      for the visual entrainment of circadian rhythms in lambs may be functioning
      several weeks before birth.

TI  - Comparison of peripheral chemoreceptor responses in monozygotic and dizygotic
      twin infants.
PG  - 1605-9
AB  - The peripheral chemoresponses of infant twin pairs were determined using a
      single-breath hyperoxic stimulus. A total of 43 twin pairs of comparable
      gestation and birth weight were studied during sleep at a mean (SD) age of 8 wk
      (1.4) while alternately breathing either air or 16% oxygen in nitrogen. Infants
      responded to a single breath of 100% oxygen by a reduction in ventilation; the
      mean (SEM) reduction in air was 273 ml/min (10.6) and in 16% oxygen 560 ml/min
      (18.4). Within-pair variances were compared in 14 monozygotic and 28 dizygotic
      pairs utilizing combined responses (air + 16% oxygen) computed for measurements
      made in behavioral quiet sleep and in 9 monozygotic and 20 dizygotic pairs for
      whom data were complete in polygraphically confirmed quiet sleep. The variance of
      responses within dizygotic twin pairs was greater than in monozygotic pairs when 
      expressed in ml/min: F ratio 4.11 (p = 0.005) for all data and F ratio 7.67 (p = 
      0.003) in quiet sleep. Expressed in ml/min/kg the difference was less
      significant: F ratio 1.83 (p = 0.126) for all data and F ratio 3.46 (p = 0.039)
      in quiet sleep. Gender, birth weight, and birth order had no effect on these
      findings. This closer similarity of response in monozygotic twin pairs is
      explained by proposing a high degree of heritability for the response.

TI  - Effect of sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland on maternal co-ordination
      of the circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase in parotid gland from young rats.
PG  - 1121-5
AB  - Twenty-five-day-old rats maintained in constant darkness since birth and born
      from mothers kept in the dark since the 14th day of pregnancy showed a circadian 
      rhythm of alpha-amylase content in parotid glands, which may be explained by a
      mechanism of maternal co-ordination. Rats in the same conditions, except that
      their mothers had been submitted to bilateral excision of the superior cervical
      ganglia 30 days before mating, did not show diurnal variations of alpha-amylase
      activity in the parotid glands. When ganglionectomized mothers were treated with 
      a daily dose of melatonin (1 mg/kg) from the 14th day of gestation up to the 10th
      day of lactation, their litters showed significant diurnal variations of amylase 
      in the parotid glands, suggesting a role of the maternal pineal gland in the
      maternal-fetal and/or maternal-neonatal transfer of photoperiodic information.

      within 6 weeks after parturition, were investigated regarding sociodemographic
      and gynaecological parameters, time of onset and initial symptomatology,
      psychopathological symptoms during hospitalisation, treatment and short-term
      outcome of the illness. The majority of patients became ill after the first
      (75%), full-term normal (63%) delivery and within the first two postpartum weeks 
      (78%). The most frequent initial symptoms were anxiety, restlessness, depressive 
      mood, sleep disturbances, behaviour disturbances, catatonic excitement, delusions
      and hallucinations. By the time of follow-up investigation, 16 women had died; 61
      women were investigated on average 25.6 years after onset (minimum 12, maximum 41
      years), using standardised instruments of evaluation. Nearly two-thirds of the
      patients had suffered re-manifestation of psychotic disorder during a long-term
      course (64%). The frequency of re-manifestations of illness after additional
      pregnancies and deliveries was found to be 1:4, which is also known to be the
      expected frequency during the course of other psychotic disorders. These results 
      do not justify the global recommendation to avoid additional pregnancies or carry
      out an interruption of pregnancy, if the patient has a history of postpartum
      psychosis. The climacteric period also seems to be a vulnerable phase for the
      re-manifestation of illness. Nearly 3/4 of the investigated women displayed no
      disturbances in any of the evaluated dimensions (psychopathological,
      psychological, psychosocial status) at the time of follow-up.

TI  - Abnormal twenty-four hour pattern of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion and 
      the response to naloxone in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea.
PG  - 599-606
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is associated with disturbances of
      pulsatile gonadotrophin secretion. The underlying mechanism remains unclear and
      the aim of this study was to investigate the 24-hour secretory pattern of
      gonadotrophins in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea. The effect of
      opioid blockade using naloxone infusion on LH secretory pattern was also studied.
      DESIGN: The secretory patterns of LH, FSH, PRL and their responses to naloxone
      infusion were studied by serial blood samples collected at 10-minute intervals
      for 24 hours. On the following day, naloxone was infused at a dose of 1.6 mg per 
      hour for 4 hours. PATIENTS: Eight women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea, two
      women hyperprolactinaemic but with normal ovarian cycles, and nine control
      subjects in the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle. MEASUREMENTS:
      Concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL were measured in plasma samples obtained at
      10-minute intervals for 24 hours. In one woman, concentrations of urinary
      oestrone glucuronide were measured daily during treatment with pulsatile GnRH.
      RESULTS: The number of LH pulses per 24 hours was significantly fewer in women
      with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea than in those with hyperprolactinaemia with 
      normal cycles or control subjects (mean +/- SEM 4.5 +/- 2.4 vs 13.5 +/- 2.5 vs
      17.3 +/- 0.8, P < 0.001). The magnitude of each episode of secretion was
      significantly higher in the hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic women (P < 0.05) so 
      the overall mean concentrations of LH throughout the 24-hour period was similar
      in the three groups (5.2 +/- 1.1, 4.8 +/- 0.8 and 5.2 +/- 0.4 U/l respectively). 
      In women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea there was no significant change in 
      the pattern of LH secretion during sleep in contrast to the control women in whom
      there was a slowing in the LH pulse frequency during the night. There was no
      significant change in the mean concentrations of LH, FSH and PRL during the
      naloxone infusion. There were also no significant changes in the LH pulse
      frequency in response to naloxone infusion when compared with an equivalent
      period of time in the previous 24 hours. In one hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoeic 
      woman, follicular development, ovulation and pregnancy were induced when
      gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) was infused in a pulsatile manner at a
      dose of 5 micrograms every 90 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The suppression of normal
      ovarian cycles in women with hyperprolactinaemic amenorrhoea is due to a
      significant reduction in frequency of LH (GnRH) secretion which is not due to an 
      increase in hypothalamic opioid activity. As normal ovarian cycles can occur or
      be induced by exogenous GnRH in hyperprolactinaemia, it is unlikely that a high
      level of prolactin by itself inhibits follicular development and ovulation.

TI  - Melatonin and hormonal changes in disturbed sleep during late pregnancy.
PG  - 191-8
AB  - Although sleep disturbance is commonly reported in pregnancy, there have been
      surprisingly few studies on the etiology of this condition. Since most hormones
      show circadian rhythmicity and maintain specific phase relationships with that of
      the sleep-wake cycle, it was of interest to establish whether sleep disturbances 
      covaried with endocrine changes. This overnight study of pregnant women compared 
      melatonin, cortisol, and prolactin secretion rhythms in six good sleepers and six
      poor sleepers. The groups were compared by ratios of the areas under the various 
      hormonal curves. Significant differences in the cortisol/melatonin ratio were
      found between the poor sleeper group (lower values) and the good sleeper group
      (higher values). Nonsignificant trends, which might be expected to become
      significant with larger sample sizes, were found for decreased amplitude in the
      cortisol rhythm and increased amplitude in the melatonin rhythm in poor sleepers.
      The decreased amplitude of the cortisol rhythm in poor sleepers appeared to be
      due to a suppression of the early morning (0500-0800) rise. Prolactin levels were
      high and showed no rhythmicity in both groups. These differences may reflect
      changes in the circadian pacemaker system of poor sleepers, with increases in
      melatonin release being a response to counteract poor sleep.

TI  - [Sodium oxybutyrate normalizes the central nervous system functions in the
      progeny of rats subjected to hypobaric hypoxia during pregnancy].
PG  - 8-11
AB  - Two-hour hypobaric hypoxia of rats on day 15 of their pregnancy led to a
      reduction in weight gain of pups within 20 days after birth, disturbed memory in 
      active and passive paradigms, changed adaptive behavior in the extrapolatory
      water avoidance test, and impaired sleep in adult animals. Postnatal treatment
      with sodium hydroxybutyrate given in a dose of 50 mg/kg/day on days 8 to 20 of
      life normalized mnestic functions of the brain, the process of falling asleep,
      and physical development which had been impaired by intrauterine hypoxia.

      (HFUPR) and behavioural states 1F and 2F (corresponding to quiet and active
      sleep, respectively) in normal near term fetuses. DESIGN: An observational study.
      SETTING: A clinic for antenatal care at a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Nineteen
      healthy pregnant women examined at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Fetal behavioural states (1F and 2F) were assessed by means of fetal
      heart rate patterns (FHR A and FHR B). Using real time ultrasonography, HFUPR
      (ml/h) was estimated during behavioural states 1F and 2F. RESULTS: During
      behavioural state 1F, HFUPR was significantly higher than during state 2F (P <
      0.01). HFUPR falls by 47% from 50.8 +/- 24.4 ml/h in state 1F to 25.7 +/- 15.0
      ml/h in state 2F. CONCLUSIONS: During active sleep (state 2F) hourly fetal urine 
      production rate is considerably reduced as compared to quiet sleep (state 1F).

TI  - Second trimester ambulatory blood pressure in nulliparous pregnancy: a useful
      screening test for pre-eclampsia?
PG  - 914-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of second trimester 24-hour ambulatory
      blood pressure measurement as a screening test for pre-eclampsia. DESIGN:
      Prospective interventional study. SETTING: John Radcliffe Maternity Hospital,
      Oxford, and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London. SUBJECTS: One hundred
      and sixty-two normotensive nulliparous women recruited at hospital booking
      clinics. INTERVENTION: Ambulatory blood pressure was measured at 18 and 28 weeks 
      gestation using the TM2420 monitor. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The development of
      pre-eclampsia. RESULTS: Awake systolic and mean arterial pressures were
      significantly increased (P < 0.02) at 18 weeks in those who later developed
      pre-eclampsia. Those differences were more apparent at 28 weeks at which time the
      diastolic pressure was also increased (P < 0.01). At both stages of gestation the
      higher readings were sustained during sleep so that the awake-sleep differences
      were similar in relation to each outcome. The group with incipient pre-eclampsia 
      had a significantly faster heart rate at both 18 and 28 weeks (P < 0.002) The
      sensitivity in predicting pre-eclampsia for a mean arterial pressure of 85 mmHg
      or greater at 28 weeks was 65%, with a positive predictive value of 31%. The
      sensitivity and positive predictive value for a test combining a mean arterial
      pressure of 85 mmHg or greater and a heart rate of 90 bpm or greater were 53% and
      45%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although second trimester ambulatory blood
      pressure is significantly increased in women who later develop pre-eclampsia, the
      predictive values for blood pressure alone are low. The efficiency of the test is
      increased by combining the awake ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure
      measurement together. If an effective method for preventing pre-eclampsia becomes
      available (commencing at 28 weeks gestation), then awake ambulatory blood
      pressure and heart rate may have some clinical value as a screening test.

TI  - A comparison of self-reported self-care practices of pregnant adolescents.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - Recent research has suggested that effective prenatal care is significantly
      related to positive outcomes for the teen mother and her infant. One aspect of
      prenatal care is the efforts of the pregnant teen to care for herself, often
      called self-care practices. The purpose of this article is to compare the
      self-reported self-care activities of pregnant teenagers who sought prenatal care
      during the first trimester of their pregnancies with those of pregnant teens who 
      delayed prenatal care until the third trimester. The subjects were adolescent
      girls who were enrolled in prenatal care programs or who had recently delivered
      in Florida. Interview analysis suggested that both groups had an adequate
      knowledge level regarding diet, exercise, and other topics related to self-care
      during pregnancy. Although pregnant teens practice similar self-care behaviors
      regardless of when they enter prenatal care, there are many problems that may
      lead to poor pregnancy outcomes and can remain undetected when prenatal care is
      delayed.

OAB - Nurse practitioners interviewed 48 adolescents who were either pregnant or had
      just delivered to learn how they cared for themselves. The teens were attending
      or had attended prenatal clinics in Florida. They were divided into 2 groups: 34 
      teens who began prenatal care in the 1st trimester and 12 teens who did in the
      3rd trimester. 73% of teens in the early group considered prenatal care as a
      self-care activity, while just 1 in the late group did. All but 1 teen practiced 
      self-care throughout the pregnancy, sometimes before formally entering prenatal
      care. 94.1% in the early group and 83.3% in the late group reported that family
      members helped with self-care. Some nutrition self-care activities were increased
      intake of milk and vegetables and a decrease of elimination of fatty foods and
      caffeine. 97% in the early group and 75% in the late group enrolled in the Women,
      Infants, and Children program. 54% in the early group and 41% in the late group
      used vitamin and mineral supplements. 67.6% in early group and 75% in late group 
      either continued or began to exercise during pregnancy. 35.2% in the early group 
      and 41.6% in the late group took more time to sleep and rest. Even though some
      teens abused substances before pregnancy, they all reported no drug or alcohol
      use during pregnancy. 3 early-group teens and 1 late-group teen still smokes
      cigarettes, even though they knew it was unhealthy for the baby. Most teens
      avoided strenuous activities, e.g., team sports. Even though the teens practiced 
      self-care, delay of prenatal care can still lead to poor pregnancy outcomes. An
      increased need exists for health education or self-care in public schools and
      during routine preventive health care, mass media campaigns on pregnancy signs
      and symptoms and early prenatal care, and support from parents and other family
      members.

TI  - [Ambulatory arterial blood pressure monitoring in the management of hypertension 
      in pregnancy].
PG  - 358-62
AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) completes the diagnostic approach to 
      hypertension of pregnancy, by providing a dynamic study of the blood pressure
      status of the pregnant woman. It corrects certain erroneous diagnoses of
      hypertension of pregnancy, in particular those related to the "White coat"
      effect, especially common in pregnant women. ABPM enables the study of nocturnal 
      blood pressured figures, known for their prognostic value in hypertension of
      pregnancy. Finally, while loss or reversal of circadian rhythm appears to be of
      good predictive value regarding the onset of eclampsia, it is above all blood
      pressure load which appears to be harmful to fetal growth and maturity. ABPM also
      facilitates management by improving the compliance of pregnant women with regular
      monitoring and with treatment, by more accurately guiding the surveillance of
      drug treatment.

      thyrotoxic outpatients.
PG  - 756-60
AB  - Radiation doses to the family and general public from 131I therapy of outpatients
      were assessed for comparison with the 1990 International Commission on Radiation 
      Protection (ICRP) dose limits. Doses to family members of such patients, measured
      by previous workers, were converted to show that on average 5.6 +/- 3.7 microSv
      MBq-1 is received by the spouse and 1.5 +/- 0.87 microSv MBq-1 by other family
      members. It was deduced that the average dose to the spouse (D microSv MBq-1)
      when couples sleep apart for T days after administration is given by: D = 2.528 +
      3.072e-0.11T if an effective half-life, T(eff), of 6.35 days is used. The
      cumulative effect of repeated treatments should be considered and in view of
      ALARA it is recommended that couples sleep apart for at least 14 days after each 
      administration, even if this is below limits permitted by authorities. The dose
      to a pregnant colleague or family member other than the wife should be below 2
      mSv if the total administered activity is not more than 600 MBq. If the wife is
      pregnant, couples should sleep apart for at least 30 days after administration.

TI  - Early developmental changes in [3H]nicotine binding in the human brainstem.
PG  - 1127-38
AB  - Little is known about the developmental profile of nicotinic cholinergic
      receptors in the developing human brain, despite the potential importance of such
      information in understanding the pathogenesis of neurological abnormalities or
      increased risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to
      nicotine in utero. In this study, we determined the distribution of [3H]nicotine 
      binding in the developing human brainstem by quantitative tissue autoradiography.
      In midgestational fetuses, [3H]nicotine binding sites were heavily concentrated
      in tegmental nuclei related to cardiopulmonary integration, arousal, attention,
      rapid eye movement sleep, and somatic motor control. Over the last half of
      gestation, [3H]nicotine binding decreased 60-70% in the tegmental nuclei, with a 
      significant difference in binding between midgestation and early infancy. In
      contrast, there was essentially no change in [3H]nicotine binding in the major
      cerebellar-relay nuclei (principal inferior olive and griseum pontis) between the
      same time-points. Tritium quenching by increasing lipid (myelin) content in
      tissue sections did not account for the decreases in [3H]nicotine binding in
      tegmental nuclei. Based upon the high levels of [3H]nicotine binding at
      midgestation, combined with experimental data demonstrating trophic properties
      for acetylcholine, we postulate that nAChRs a role in the development of the
      brainstem tegmentum during this period, and that once this role is fulfilled,
      nicotinic cholinergic binding decreases and remains low thereafter.
      Alternatively, nicotinic cholinergic receptors may be critical for other
      developmentally related functions and/or neurotransmission in the brainstem
      tegmentum at midgestation. The high levels of [3H]nicotine binding in the
      brainstem tegmentum at midgestation and its rapidly changing profile over late
      gestation further suggest that mid-to-late gestation is a developmental period
      during which this region is likely to be most vulnerable to the harmful effects
      of nicotine in maternal cigarette smoke. The baseline information provided in
      this study is potentially relevant towards understanding attention deficits and
      risk for the sudden infant death syndrome in offspring exposed to cigarette smoke
      in utero.

TI  - Fetal respiratory neuronal activity during REM and NREM sleep.
PG  - 191-7
AB  - Chronically prepared near-term fetal lambs (129-133 days gestation) were
      exteriorized into a saline bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and each head
      was rigidly connected to a stereotaxic frame. Multibarrel glass electrodes were
      inserted into the region of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) during fetal
      breathing (FB) in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Of a total of 223 neurons, it
      was possible to record only 6 neurons for which firing amplitude did not change
      during the transition from REM to non-REM (NREM) sleep. The burst frequency,
      number of spikes per breath, and association with diaphragmatic activity were
      variable, with phasic activity preceding FB or disappearing and reappearing
      during FB. During the transition from REM to NREM sleep, phasic neuronal activity
      ceased, became tonic, and finally ceased altogether. L-Glutamate increased the
      number of spikes per breath and caused previous phasic activity to reappear but
      in NREM sleep produced only tonic activity. We conclude that during REM sleep the
      fetal respiratory neurons in the region of the NTS are to a large degree
      influenced by nonrespiratory REM sleep factors and that quiescence of respiratory
      neurons during NREM sleep is due to the lack of phasic input rather than to
      direct inhibition. Inhibition of FB during NREM sleep must occur upstream of the 
      NTS neuron.

TI  - Abdominal vibration alters sleep state in fetal sheep.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - Many pregnant women are exposed to low frequency sounds and vibrations while at
      work or play. How the fetus is affected by these physical stimuli is not clearly 
      documented. We recorded behavioral state and intrauterine sound pressure levels
      in eight fetal sheep previously instrumented with electrocortical, electroocular 
      and neck electromyographic leads, and with a miniature hydrophone. Data were
      collected before, during and after 30 min of abdominal vibration using a belt
      vibrator commonly used by humans in weight reduction programs. A sudden shift in 
      behavioral state occurred at the onset of vibration. There was a decrease in
      non-rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.02) and an increase in time during which the 
      sleep state could not be determined (P < 0.03). A 63% increase in number of
      epochs spent in this indeterminate period was evident during vibration. During
      the post-stimulus period, percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement sleep
      decreased as compared to the pre-stimulus period (P < 0.04), and non-rapid eye
      movement sleep increased as compared to the stimulus period (P < 0.01).
      Vibration-induced intrauterine sound pressures ranged from 131-142 dB at the
      fundamental frequency of 19 Hz and were 20-40 dB lower at the overtones which
      appeared in the spectrum between 35-200 Hz. Results indicated that environmental 
      vibration can disrupt fetal behavioral state, induce abnormal state changes, and 
      alter distribution of sleep states.

TI  - Neonatal withdrawal syndrome: associated drugs and pharmacologic management.
PG  - 202-11
AB  - Use of addicting drugs among women during pregnancy exposes newborns to
      potentially serious disorders. A group of symptoms referred to as neonatal
      withdrawal syndrome (NWS) may occur in infants born to mothers addicted to
      certain drugs because, at birth, the infants suddenly are cut off from the drug
      supply. Classes of drugs that cause NWS are those that produce addiction in
      adults, including the opioids (heroin, methadone, morphine), barbiturates,
      alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Many of the manifestations of NWS occur regardless 
      of the class of drug, including irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep
      pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and failure
      to gain weight. The fact that these symptoms are nonspecific makes it difficult
      to identify NWS unless it is specifically looked for. The onset, duration, and
      severity of the disorder differ based on such factors as the addictive drug used,
      time and amount of mother's last dose, and rate of elimination of the drug from
      the newborn. Pharmacologic intervention may be required to control severe
      symptoms and signs. The most common drugs used to modify withdrawal are
      phenobarbital, paregoric, chlorpromazine, and diazepam. Treatment is complicated 
      by conflicting information on the effectiveness of various agents.

      Twenty-two fetuses at 36-41 weeks of gestation were exposed to white noise during
      an active state. The sound was delivered for 5 min at an intensity of 100 dB. No 
      significant change in fetal activity was noted following the sound.

TI  - The relationship between heart rate and asphyxia in the animal fetus.
PG  - 166-75
AB  - In order to understand the mechanisms which regulate and control basal heart rate
      as well as heart rate variability in the fetus, a number of studies have been
      conducted in fetal animals. Information has been obtained largely from fetal
      sheep during the last third of gestation, although recently investigators have
      directed their attention to earlier gestations, such as 80-90 days, with term in 
      the sheep being 145 days. A few studies have focused on the non-human primate
      fetus for additional information. A variety of techniques has been utilized
      experimentally to produce hypoxemia and/or acidemia in fetal animals, including
      umbilical cord compression, maternal hypoxemia, and uterine blood flow
      restrictions. Evidence to date would indicate that both chemoreceptors and
      baroreceptors are present and active in the late gestation sheep fetus, giving
      rise to acute changes in fetal heart rate (FHR) with changes in oxygenation.
      Factors which must be considered in interpreting alterations in both mean FHR and
      FHR variability in response to a decrease in oxygenation include: 1) the
      mechanism giving rise to decrease in oxygen delivery, 2) the duration of
      hypoxemia and/or asphyxia, 3) the effect of sleep states and behavioural
      activity, 4) gestational age, and 5) condition of the fetus prior to the decrease
      in oxygen delivery. Heart rate variability in fetal sheep has been studied
      extensively and it has been shown that accelerations in the FHR are closely
      associated with skeletal muscle activity much like the human fetus, suggesting
      similar control mechanisms in the 2 species. The late gestation sheep fetus
      consistently and reliably experiences an increase in heart rate variability with 
      acute hypoxemia with and without acidemia until severe acidosis develops. In
      contrast, the hypoxemic human fetus, prior to labour, generally exhibits a
      decrease in FHR variability. The explanation for this apparent species difference
      remains unclear.

TI  - Circadian time structure of cardiovascular characteristics in human pregnancy.
PG  - 128-36
AB  - Conventional time-unspecified single measurements of blood pressure and heart
      rate may be misleading because they may be influenced, among other factors, by
      the patient's emotional state, position, diet, and external stimuli. All of these
      effects depend on the stages of a (mathematical) spectrum of rhythms and trends
      with age. The evaluation of predictable variability in blood pressure and heart
      rate by (a) the use of fully ambulatory devices, and (b) chronobiologic data
      processing, assesses early cardiovascular disease risk, e.g., in pregnancy. We
      have used this approach to quantify changes in 24-h synchronized (circadian)
      characteristics of cardiovascular variables in two consecutive pregnancies of a
      clinically healthy woman. Blood pressure and heart rate were automatically
      monitored, with few interruptions, at 1-h intervals, each time for at least 48
      consecutive h, and for a total of 76 days of monitoring in each pregnancy.
      Circadian parameters of those circulatory variables were computed for each single
      day of measurement by the least-squares fit of a 24-h cosine curve. Regression
      analysis of parameters thus obtained revealed patterns of variation of
      circadian-rhythm-adjusted means and amplitudes with gestational age. In both
      pregnancies, the predictable variability of the circadian-rhythm-adjusted mean of
      blood pressure can be approximated by a second-order polynomial model on
      gestational age: a steady linear decrease in systolic, diastolic, and mean
      arterial blood pressure up to the 22nd week of pregnancy is followed by an
      increase in blood pressure up to the day of delivery. This longitudinal study
      confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable
      pregnancy-associated variability in blood pressure and heart rate and also allows
      the establishment of prediction and confidence limits for cardiovascular
      parameters in a healthy pregnancy.

TI  - The effect of vibro-acoustic stimulation on fetal behavioral state organization.
PG  - 531-9
AB  - During the third trimester of pregnancy there is a gradual development of fetal
      behavioral states. These states are distinct and discontinuous modes of neural
      activity; they reflect a certain degree of maturity and/or integrity of the fetal
      brain and are homologous with those seen in newborn infants. Abnormal state
      development has been found in growth retarded fetuses and in fetuses of women
      with type-1 diabetes. Behavioral state organization is not easily influenced by
      external factors and most stimuli fail to induce a state change when the fetus is
      in quiet sleep (state 1F). However, fetuses do react to vibro-acoustic
      stimulation (VAS) with an electronic artificial larynx. This stimulus induces
      excessive fetal movements, prolonged tachycardia, disorganization of behavioral
      states, and state transitions normally not seen in healthy fetuses. The
      backgrounds for these excessive and unusual reactions are largely unknown. For
      the time being, it seems better not to use this device in clinical practice. In
      this review paper, data on the development of behavioral states and on fetal
      reactions to VAS are discussed.

PG  - 1271-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to document the presence or significance of circadian
      uterine activity rhythms in pregnant women who delivered at term and preterm.
      STUDY DESIGN: We measured uterine activity in 19 women divided into a control
      group (low risk for preterm labor, term delivery, n = 7), a group at high risk
      for preterm labor, term delivery (n = 6), and a group at high risk for preterm
      labor, preterm delivery (n = 6). Patients were hospitalized for 24 hours every 2 
      weeks from 26 weeks' gestation until delivery. Uterine activity was measured
      continuously by external tocodynamometer. RESULTS: Patients delivering at term
      demonstrated a nocturnal surge (4 to 7 AM) in uterine activity the last 80 days
      before delivery (p < 0.05, analysis of variance). Patients delivered preterm
      showed an initial nocturnal surge of uterine activity similar to those delivered 
      at term, but this disappeared 24 days before delivery (p > 0.05, analysis of
      variance). CONCLUSION: Uterine activity nocturnal surges normally precede term
      delivery. These surges are lost in women who deliver prematurely.

TI  - Maternal caffeine consumption and fetal behavior in normal third-trimester
      pregnancy.
PG  - 1105-11; discussion 1111-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to perform a longitudinal cohort study of 20 normal
      third-trimester pregnancies to observe whether the level of long-term maternal
      caffeine ingestion influenced fetal behavior. STUDY DESIGN: By dietary history 10
      normal pregnant women were categorized as "high" caffeine consumers (> 500
      mg/day, group H) and 10 as "low" caffeine consumers (> 200 mg/day, group L).
      Between 30 and 40 weeks biweekly 2-hour continuous ultrasonographic observations 
      of fetal heart rate; breathing activity; and eye, trunk, and extremity movements 
      were conducted. Maternal caffeine levels were determined at each session, and
      fetal states were identified and their duration quantified. Data were compared by
      analysis of variance by means of repeated measures or t tests. RESULTS: When
      compared with group L fetuses, group H fetuses spent similar mean time in state
      1F (quiet sleep), less mean time in state 2F (active sleep), and much greater
      mean time in state 4F (arousal). The mean time spent in no state decreased
      significantly in group L, was unchanged in group H, and was similar for both
      groups at term. Both groups had similar mean numbers of state changes at all
      gestational ages studied. Mean maternal serum caffeine levels in group H were
      always significantly higher than those in group L. CONCLUSION: Evolving fetal
      behavior may be influenced by the level of maternal caffeine consumption during
      the last trimester.

TI  - False suffocation alarms, spontaneous panics, and related conditions. An
      integrative hypothesis.
PG  - 306-17
AB  - A carbon dioxide hypersensitivity theory of panic has been posited. We
      hypothesize more broadly that a physiologic misinterpretation by a suffocation
      monitor misfires an evolved suffocation alarm system. This produces sudden
      respiratory distress followed swiftly by a brief hyperventilation, panic, and the
      urge to flee. Carbon dioxide hypersensitivity is seen as due to the deranged
      suffocation alarm monitor. If other indicators of potential suffocation provoke
      panic this theoretical extension is supported. We broadly pursue this theory by
      examining Ondine's curse as the physiologic and pharmacologic converse of panic
      disorder, splitting panic in terms of symptomatology and challenge studies,
      reevaluating the role of hyperventilation, and reinterpreting the contagiousness 
      of sighing and yawning, as well as mass hysteria. Further, the phenomena of panic
      during relaxation and sleep, late luteal phase dysphoric disorder, pregnancy,
      childbirth, pulmonary disease, separation anxiety, and treatment are used to test
      and illuminate the suffocation false alarm theory.

TI  - Behavioural state change in normal human fetuses following a single vibroacoustic
      stimulus: effect of duration of quiet sleep prior to stimulation.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - We examined 96 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation to
      determine the relationship between the duration of the active state following a
      single vibroacoustic stimulus (VAS) and the time spent in prestimulus state 1F,
      i.e. quiet sleep (QS). All fetuses were observed to enter state 1F prior to
      testing. After remaining in this state for 3 min, each fetus was randomized into 
      one of three groups: no stimulation (Group I, N = 32); a single 1-s VAS delivered
      after 3-5 min of QS (Group II, N = 33); and a single 1-s VAS delivered after
      18-20 min of QS (Group III, N = 31). Fetuses in Groups I, II, and III were
      otherwise behaviourally indistinguishable. Heart rate and eye and body movements 
      were monitored until the fetus either returned to state 1F and remained in that
      state for 3 min or did not return to state 1F within 60 min. Of the 64 fetuses
      who were stimulated, 62 responded, indicating that there was no effect of
      prestimulus state duration on the sensitivity to VAS. Fetuses stimulated after
      18-20 min of QS behaved similarly to fetuses who entered an active period
      spontaneously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Migraine and tension-type headache in a general population: precipitating
      factors, female hormones, sleep pattern and relation to lifestyle.
PG  - 65-72
AB  - In a cross-sectional epidemiological study of headache disorders information on
      precipitating factors, age at onset, influence of menstruation and pregnancy and 
      use of oral contraceptives was collected. The presence of migraine and
      tension-type headache was ascertained by a clinical interview and examination
      using the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society. 
      The prevalence of migraine and tension-type headache was also analysed in
      relation to variables of lifestyle: physical activity, smoking, consumption of
      coffee, alcohol intake and sleep pattern. In both migraine and tension-type
      headache, the most conspicuous precipitating factor was stress and mental
      tension. Other common precipitants were alcohol, weather changes and
      menstruation. Disappearance or substantial improvement of the headache during
      pregnancy was more frequent in migraineurs than in tension-type headache
      sufferers. The age at onset of both migraine and tension-type headache differs
      between men and women. Female hormones may be an important factor responsible for
      the sex difference of headache disorders. The level of physical activity showed
      no association with migraine, but a significantly higher prevalence of
      tension-type headache in men with exclusively sedentary activity emerged.
      Smoking, coffee and alcohol consumption showed no significant associations with
      the headache disorders. Sleep pattern was significantly associated with migraine 
      and tension-type headache in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In
      conclusion, migraine and tension-type headache seem to be different with regard
      to a number of endogenous and exogenous factors.

AB  - Cot death is the main concern of new parents and pregnant women, research carried
      out for the Health Education Authority's New Pregnancy Book shows. The book.
      which will be distributed free to first- time parents, has an expanded section on
      cot death, with guidance on laying babies down to sleep, including photographs of
      the safest positions. Pregnant women also worry about diet, the complications
      they might have during pregnancy and want more information about tests in
      pregnancy. Royal College of Midwives Officer Joy Moores said the book would be
      useful for midwives, enabling them to explore with women what choices are open to
      them and what support the maternity sen-ices can give'.

TI  - The fetal circadian pacemaker is not involved in the timing of birth in hamsters.
PG  - 530-7
AB  - The role of the fetal circadian pacemaker in the timing of birth was examined in 
      Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Two groups of pregnant hamsters with
      lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus received daily intraperitoneal injections 
      of melatonin (25 micrograms) on Days 9-15 of gestation. One group was injected
      with melatonin in the evening and the other in the morning. After the last set of
      injections, the animals were observed every hour until they gave birth. The
      timing of birth was not significantly different in the two groups, indicating
      that it was not affected by the melatonin injections. In contrast, the average
      phases of the pups' activity rhythms at weaning were significantly different in
      the two groups; this difference, approximately 10 h, indicated that the prenatal 
      melatonin injections set the phases of the pups' circadian pacemakers. These
      results suggest that the fetal pacemaker is not involved in the timing of birth, 
      since the pacemaker could be set to different phases without affecting this
      timing. In a separate study, time of birth and length of gestation were measured 
      for heterozygous tau mutant pups, which express a circadian rhythm with a period 
      of approximately 22 h. The results were compared with similar measurements
      obtained from a previous study of wild-type pups that express a circadian rhythm 
      with a period of approximately 24 h. In both cases, the pups had been born to
      wild-type mothers. The timing of birth was similar in the two groups, indicating 
      that the tau mutation does not influence the length of gestation or the time of
      day when birth occurs.

TI  - The effect of prenatal stress on adult sexual behavior in rats depends on the
      nature of the stressor.
PG  - 443-8
AB  - It is well known that prenatal stress induces behavioral demasculinization and/or
      feminization in male offspring during adulthood. In this study, four different
      stressors were prenatally applied to rats. Pregnant rats were subjected to
      immobilization, unavoidable electric foot shocks, rapid eye movement sleep
      deprivation (REMd), or immersion in cold water. During adulthood, male offspring 
      were tested for masculine and feminine sexual behavior. The results corroborated 
      the fact that immobilization induced an impairment of masculine sexual behavior
      and a facilitation of feminine sexual behavior. Electric shocks showed only minor
      differences in masculine behavior when compared to intact controls, and no signs 
      of lordosis behavior were observed. The REMd group displayed a major impairment
      of masculine behavior, even greater than that observed within the immobilization 
      group. However, lordosis behavior was only induced with estradiol. On the other
      hand, water immersion seems to have a facilitatory effect on several parameters
      of masculine behavior and did not show lordosis behavior even with hormonal
      treatment. These results strongly suggest that changes in sex behavior induced by
      prenatal stress are linked to the nature of the stressor.

TI  - Cocaine effects on neonatal heart rate dynamics: preliminary findings and
      methodological problems.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - Cocaine use by pregnant women has been reported to cause fetal and neonatal
      morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that human neonates exposed to cocaine
      via maternal use during pregnancy might manifest changes in beat-to-beat heart
      rate variability, similar to those described in experimental animals. In this
      preliminary report, we present findings from the first systematic analysis of
      heart rate dynamics in a small group of (n = 5) neonates exposed in utero to
      cocaine compared to gestationally age matched controls (n = 6) without known drug
      exposure. Overall heart rate spectral power during ten minute periods of
      quiescent sleep was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in the cocaine-exposed
      group, reminiscent of the changes recently reported in an animal model. In two
      other cocaine-exposed newborns, a quiescent sleep period could not be found. We
      discuss the special methodological problems associated with collection and
      interpretation of such data.

TI  - Inflammatory mediators regulate interleukin-8 production by cultured gestational 
      tissues: evidence for a cytokine network at the chorio-decidual interface.
PG  - 404-10
AB  - The physiology of parturition, and the pathophysiology of preterm labor, is
      incompletely understood. Infection of gestational tissues may account for a
      significant proportion of women who experience preterm labor. Interleukin-8
      (IL-8), or neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-1), is a potent chemotactic and
      activating factor for neutrophils and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      inflammatory injury to skin and lung, but has yet to be described in gestational 
      tissues. Cultured chorion and decidual cells obtained from normal human
      pregnancies were used to evaluate whether these tissues produce IL-8 basally and 
      in response to inflammatory cytokines. As measured by specific IL-8 RIA, chorion 
      and decidual cells produce IL-8 constitutively and in response to IL-1 beta and
      tumor necrosis factor. Cotreatment of chorion cells or decidual cells with IL-1
      beta and actinomycin D or cycloheximide abrogated IL-8 production. Northern blot 
      analysis confirmed that IL-1 beta stimulation of chorion and decidual cells
      resulted in increased IL-8 messenger RNA expression. Our data support the concept
      that a complex cytokine network between maternal and fetal gestational tissues
      exists, and that activation of inflammatory cytokine production in these tissues,
      including IL-8, likely contributes to the pathophysiology of infection-induced
      preterm labor.

TI  - Help me make it through the night: behavioral entrainment of breast-fed infants' 
      sleep patterns.
PG  - 436-44
AB  - The study objective was to investigate whether exclusively breast-fed infants
      could be taught to sleep through the night (defined from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM)
      during the first 8 weeks of life. The design was short-term longitudinal, from
      the last trimester of pregnancy until the eighth week after birth. Twenty-six
      first-time parents and their newborn were randomly assigned to treatment and
      control groups (13 in each group). Treatment parents were instructed to offer a
      "focal feed" (between 10 PM and 12 AM) to their infants every night, to gradually
      lengthen intervals between middle-of-the-night feeds by carrying out alternative 
      caretaking behaviors (eg, reswaddling, diapering, walking), and to maximize
      environmental differences between day and nighttime. All parents kept 72-hour
      diaries of their infants' feeding and sleeping patterns every week from birth to 
      8 weeks of age and rated their infants' temperament at birth and at 8 weeks. By 3
      weeks, treatment infants showed significantly longer sleep episodes at night. By 
      8 weeks 100% of treatment infants were sleeping through the night compared to 23%
      of control infants. Treatment infants were feeding less frequently at night but
      compensated for the relatively long nighttime interval without a feed by
      consuming more milk in the early morning. Milk intake for 24-hour periods did not
      differ between groups. Treatment infants were rated as more predictable on Bates'
      Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. It is concluded that parents can have a
      powerful influence on the development of their infants' sleep patterns. Frequent 
      night waking in breast-fed infants often results in early termination of
      lactation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Multiple sclerosis: the role of puberty and the pineal gland in its pathogenesis.
PG  - 209-25
AB  - Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS)
      is age-dependent being rare prior to age 10, unusual prior to age 15, with a peak
      in the mid 20s. It has been suggested that the manifestation of MS is dependent
      upon having passed through the pubertal period. In the present communication, I
      propose that critical changes in pineal melatonin secretion, which occur in
      temporal relationship to the onset of puberty, are intimately related to the
      timing of onset of the clinical manifestations of MS. Specifically, it is
      suggested that the fall in melatonin secretion during the prepubertal period,
      which may disrupt pineal-mediated immunomodulation, may stimulate either the
      reactivation of the infective agent or increase the susceptibility to infection
      during the pubertal period. Similarly, the rapid fall in melatonin secretion just
      prior to delivery may account for the frequent occurrence of relapse in MS
      patients during the postpartum period. In contrast, pregnancy, which is
      associated with high melatonin concentrations, is often accompanied by remission 
      of symptoms. Thus, the presence of high melatonin levels may provide a protective
      effect, while a decline in melatonin secretion may increase the risk for the
      development and exacerbation of the disease. The melatonin hypothesis of MS may
      explain other epidemiological and clinical phenomena associated with the disease 
      such as the low incidence of MS in the black African and American populations,
      the inverse correlation with sun light and geomagnetic field exposure, the
      occurrence of relapses in relation to seasonal changes and fluctuations in mood, 
      and the association of MS with affective illness and malignant disease.
      Therapeutically, this hypothesis implies that application of bright light therapy
      or the use of other major synchronizers of circadian rhythms such as sleep
      deprivation or application of external weak magnetic fields may be beneficial in 
      the treatment and/or prophylaxis of relapses in the disease.

TI  - [Circadian rhythm of pregnancy contractions].
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Continuous measurement of normal contractions in 57 primiparae and multiparae
      showed a minimum in the mornings and a marked peaking of frequency between 8:30
      PM and 2:00 AM. This could be due to a periodic fluctuation in the parameters
      influencing uterine motility. At night, motility-enhancing factors such as
      estrogens and prostaglandins predominate. These results suggest that in cases at 
      high risk for premature delivery, with high pelvic scores, therapy should be
      continued at night. In addition, the time when the contractions were recorded
      should be taken into account when assessing their frequency, and the measurement 
      repeated if necessary.

TI  - Review: extraaural health effects of aircraft noise.
PG  - 250-70
AB  - The number of aircraft movements in our society is increasing at a rapid rate. As
      a consequence the airspace is becoming more crowded, in particular in the
      vicinity of airports. As a consequence pollution (both air pollution and noise)
      near the airports increases. One solution to 'rush hours' in the airspace around 
      airports is to spread the number of flights more evenly over time. This leads to 
      more flights in the sensitive parts of the day: evening and night. This leads to 
      community reaction and places the potential health effects of noise in the focus 
      of societal attention. Human functioning is affected by noise in many ways.
      Effects of noise become detectable at a relatively low noise level, approx. 30
      dB(A). Above which noise levels and under what conditions these effects become
      threatening to health is still largely unknown. This holds true for
      cardiovascular effects, mental health, mortality rates, medicine consumption,
      pregnancy, delivery and physical development. On some aspects more certainty
      exists. Night time noise when it causes people to wake up or prevents them from
      falling asleep, or when it frequently disturbs the structure of sleep below the
      waking level, can be detrimental to health. Both for awakening reactions and for 
      annoyance, exposure-response relations are rather well established. Reading
      ability is hampered by noise. For the vegetative aspects, no clear and stable
      exposure-response relations are known at this moment. Hopefully this conference
      will fill in the gap.

TI  - Large fetal heart rate decelerations at term associated with changes in fetal
      heart rate variation.
PG  - 105-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether large antepartum decelerations 
      in fetal heart rate were associated with a switch from high to low fetal heart
      rate variation, suggestive of a change in sleep state, and whether the variation 
      predicted outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective computerized analysis of 10,272
      cardiotocographic records from 3998 patients at 37 to 42 weeks' gestation from
      four centers in England and Italy identified 140 good-quality records with large 
      decelerations (more than 20 lost beats in area). RESULTS: In otherwise normal
      cardiotocograms a large deceleration had a 40% chance of association with a
      downward change in fetal heart rate variation (69% when the deceleration exceeded
      100 lost beats). The change resembled that occurring naturally with behavioral
      states. Uterine contractions did not always precede large decelerations. When
      they did, the lag time (peak of contraction-trough of deceleration) increased
      from 28 seconds (at 20 to 29 lost beats) to > 100 seconds with increase in
      deceleration area. Of patients with large decelerations 76% had a normal vaginal 
      delivery. CONCLUSION: Large decelerations near term, present in up to 5% of
      patients with otherwise normal fetal heart rate and variation, are often
      associated with a fall in fetal heart rate variation characteristic of a change
      in sleep state, without ominous significance.

PG  - 138-45
AB  - Participants were 120 primiparous women who had vaginal delivery of a
      non-handicapped child. Saliva was collected twice daily through parturition to
      day 35 post-partum. In the prepartum, a highly significant circadian rhythm was
      seen in cortisol, with a lower-amplitude rhythm in progesterone (AM/PM = 1.12).
      Evening samples showed a rise in cortisol, with a highly significant rise on day 
      -1. The rise was small. The fall in progesterone in the 3 days before parturition
      was also small (approximately 6%). Neither change provides an obvious trigger for
      parturition.

PG  - 209-20
AB  - This paper summarizes the recent knowledge on the role of melatonin in humans.
      The first part of the present review considers the following aspects: circadian
      rhythm of melatonin excretion, melatonin in body fluids, melatonin influence on
      sexual maturation, changes of melatonin blood concentration during the menstrual 
      cycle and pregnancy, and the influence of melatonin administration on prolactin
      concentration. Current views on the relationship between melatonin and the
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cortex axis, as well as on changes of melatonin
      concentration during hypothyreosis, hyperthyreosis, and hyperparathyroidism are
      also discussed.

TI  - [Intra- and postpartum cortisol concentrations during fentanyl anesthesia].
PG  - 70-8
AB  - In a clinical study the course of cortisol concentration in serum was
      investigated at the following points: under labour, directly post partum
      simultaneously in the mother, the umbilical artery and vein and on the first and 
      second day after birth in the mother and on the second third days in the newborn.
      Two groups of patients were investigated: 51 first and multiple parturients with 
      peridural fentanyl analgesia for labour pain relief (PFA) and 42 first and
      multiple parturients as control group. The reduction of stress under PFA could be
      confirmed by measurement of cortisol concentrations in serum. The cortisol
      concentrations listed according to the time of day showed significantly lower
      values for the multiple parturients compared with the control group. Circadian
      peaks of the intrapartal cortisol in serum are generally absent in the multiple
      parturients. In the first parturients of the PFA group a more differentiated
      course of the cortisol levels listed according to the time of the day was
      observed. Up to about noon, the cortisol values are markedly lower than those of 
      the control group, but after decreasing tendency in the early afternoon, they
      show another peak around 4.00 p.m. This means there is still a circadian rhythm
      under the influence of PFA for the first parturients. In contrast to the multiple
      parturients, the reaction of the cortisol level of the first parturients after
      PFA is only of short duration. At the other measuring points there are possibly
      different stress factors such as permanent expectation under labour and the
      absence of labour experience, superposing the fentanyl effect seen in the
      cortisol levels of the multiple parturients.

PG  - 457-63
AB  - An epidemiological analysis of 38 cases of SIDS was carried out in the Pathology 
      Institute of the University of Milan. Those cases were collected from Milan
      district in four years, from 1987 to 1991. In 1991 the incidence of cot death in 
      the same district was 0.55 per 1000 live births. This study has led to the
      following conclusions. Most of SIDS victims were males, mostly aged between 40
      and 90 days; the totality (except one case that happened during maternal feeding)
      of the cases occurred during night sleep; a greater prevalence during winter
      months was found. We didn't find any correlation between type of feeding and cot 
      death. The weight at birth was mostly satisfactory; often the infants showed mild
      infections of the upper airways during the days immediately before death. It is
      possible to hypothesize a correlation between cigarette smoking and between drug 
      abuse (during pregnancy) and cot death. We didn't recognize a significant
      association between sleeping position of infants and their death nor between type
      of cushion and cot death. For each case a complete autopsy was carried out. We
      extended histological findings to cardiac conduction system, to brain-stem
      (central) and to ganglion structures (peripheric), sites of cardio-respiratory
      control. In 65.7% of cases we found cardiac conduction system alterations; in
      10.5% of cases we observed brain-stem anomalies, sometime these alterations were 
      associated. In one case we noticed an hypertrophy of aorto-pulmonary paraganglia 
      structures.

AB  - Aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of flumazenil when used for recovery
      after midazolam-induced sedation in short acting, out-patient procedure like
      interruption of early pregnancy. A significantly faster recovery of the patients 
      after injection of flumazenil was observed. When flumazenil was not used,
      patients remained drowsy, worse oriented, and less co-operative at 1.5 and 20 min
      after completion of abortion. There were no significant difference between the
      groups with and without flumazenil at the 60 min. In conclusion when it is
      possible to observe the patients for more than one hour, the application of
      flumazenil after sedation with midazolam is not necessary.

OAB - In a comparative study, the efficacy of flumazenil, when used for recovery after 
      midazolam-induced sedation for outpatient procedures, was assessed in two groups 
      of women undergoing early termination of pregnancy at a university maternity
      ward. The 1st group of 32 women received flumazenil immediately after the
      procedure, while the 2nd group did not. The 2nd group consisted of 30 women who
      underwent early abortion (10-11 weeks). Their average age was 29.9 years (range, 
      18-42 years); their weight averaged 60.6 kg (range, 43-72 kg). Premedication
      consisted of 0.5 mg of venous atropine. The average dose of anesthesia with
      midazolam amounted to 15.08 mg per patient. The patients fell asleep within 1-3
      minutes after receiving the drug (average, 1.87 minutes). The average time of
      awakening was 6.6 minutes (range, 2-20 minutes). The average duration of the
      procedure was 5.45 minutes (range, 3-14 minutes). Awakening and getting up were
      evaluated according to the modified scheme of Stewart after 1, 5, 20, and 60
      minutes. Phase 1 meant that the patient did not open her eyes and did not react
      to a command; Phase 2 occurred when the patient opened her eyes and responded to 
      the command; Phase 3 occurred when the patient was in light sleep and moments
      later opened her eyes; and Phase 4 occurred when the patient fully awakened,
      opened her eyes, and began to talk. Correlation analysis showed a significant
      reverse relationship between the speed of recovery after administration of
      midazolam and the administration of flumazenil at 5 minutes (r = - 0.8) and at 20
      minutes (r = - 0.9), but at 60 minutes the differences were evened out (r = -
      0.32). When flumazenil was not used the patients remained drowsy at 1, 5, and 20 
      minutes after completion of abortion. When the patients can be observed for more 
      than 1 hour, the administration of flumazenil after sedation with midazolam is
      not necessary.

      Circulating PRL is predominantly monomeric, although some patients with
      hyperprolactinemia appear to have increased quantities of the less biologically
      active polymeric forms. PRL is secreted episodically, with an increase in the
      amplitude of the secretory pulses with sleep. A transitory increase also occurs
      in response to the protein component of meals. Basal PRL levels increase in
      response to the hormonal milieu of pregnancy, and suckling postpartum triggers
      PRL release. Pathologic increases of PRL owing to hypothalamic dysregulation
      occur with a variety of medications, including the neuroleptics, metoclopramide, 
      antidepressants, methyldopa, reserpine and verapamil, abuse of opiates and
      cocaine, renal insufficiency, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency,
      neurogenic stimulation, and idiopathically. Hyperprolactinemia also may occur
      from structural lesions of the stalk and hypothalamus, which cause disinhibition 
      with or without maintenance of PRF activity, ectopic neoplasm production, and,
      most commonly, from prolactinomas. Diagnostic testing consists of routine
      chemistry and thyroid testing and imaging with MRI or CT. Dopamine agonists are
      the treatment of choice of prolactinomas of all sizes. Transsphenoidal surgery is
      an alternative for the patient who does not respond to medical therapy or who
      wishes definitive tumor removal, realizing that long-term cure is achieved in
      only 50% to 60% of patients with microadenomas and a much lower number in those
      with macroadenomas. Radiotherapy is reserved for patients who do respond to
      either medical or surgical treatment. Patients wishing to become pregnant usually
      are treated with bromocriptine, although prepregnancy surgical debulking may be
      advisable for those with large macroadenomas to reduce problems with tumor
      enlargement.

TI  - Respiration during sleep in pregnancy.
PG  - 637-44
AB  - Several changes in maternal physiology may profoundly alter sleep, especially
      during late pregnancy. Any condition that causes maternal hypoxemia will be
      worsened during sleep, particularly in the supine position. Although high
      circulating levels of progesterone increase respiratory drive during sleep, in at
      least some women this protective mechanism is insufficient to prevent
      sleep-disordered breathing and hypoxemia. The true incidence of sleep-disordered 
      breathing during pregnancy remains unknown. Although many women report sleep
      disturbance during pregnancy, those with severe snoring, observed irregular
      breathing with sleep, or excessive daytime somnolence should be referred for
      clinical polysomnography. With few data thus far available, nasal CPAP would
      appear to be the treatment of choice. Given the possible consequences of sleep
      apnea for fetal outcome, any significant sleep-disordered breathing is probably
      an indication for treatment.

TI  - Effects of childhood sexual abuse on childbirth: one woman's story.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - Anna Rose is a survivor of childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Much 
      of the abuse was "submerged" until her mid-thirties, when she was pregnant with
      her second child, and finally began to remember and deal with the realities of
      what had happened to her. During her second pregnancy, Anna wrote, "It has taken 
      me more than three years to even begin to deal with the rage I feel about my
      first birth experience, even though I have been in therapy most of that time. Now
      that I am pregnant again, the unresolved issues are coming to the surface, and
      intense fears that this birth will be a repeat of the first." Anna's first child,
      Elliot, was born in 1987 in a hospital birthing room in the northeastern United
      States. Her husband Paul, a younger sister, and a close friend were present, and 
      she was attended by an obstetrician named Bernie. She describes that birth as "19
      hours of hard labor, absolutely exhausting and unmanageable, which required drugs
      at some point to let me sleep for a few hours." Labor was induced by Pitocin due 
      to premature rupture of membranes and lack of effective contractions after 12
      hours. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was used throughout labor. Anna
      breastfed Elliot for three years, and found La Leche League "extremely helpful
      and supportive" during that time. Tom, Anna's second child, was born at home in
      1991. Two midwives attended the birth after she changed caregivers during the
      pregnancy because she "did not feel safe enough" with the obstetrician and
      nurse-midwife team she had chosen for this birth. She maintained the team as
      backup, although they did not know of her plans for a home birth. Her second
      labor lasted under 6 hours, was noninterventive, and "incredibly intense and
      painful, partly due to the abuse memories that were coming up and getting in the 
      way and partly due to the baby's position." We thank Anna Rose for sharing her
      story with Birth. Her reason for doing so is, in her words, because, "I feel
      strongly that it is important to share this information in an effort to educate
      health care professionals so that other women may be helped."

      childbearing women.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - Self-reported sleep disturbances and levels of vitality and fatigue were studied 
      in a secondary analysis of 25 pregnant and 29 postpartum employed women. Results 
      indicate that pregnant women have problems initiating and maintaining sleep, and 
      postpartum women have problems maintaining sleep, but not falling asleep. The
      primary reason for midsleep awakenings was urinary frequency among the pregnant
      women, and child care responsibilities among the postpartum women. Chronic sleep 
      disturbance was indicated by a greater percentage of postpartum women who fell
      asleep easily, very few who felt highly energetic at work, and most who perceived
      a high level of fatigue during the past week. Even with these sleep disruptions, 
      no differences occurred in the mean scores for perception of fatigue and vitality
      between the two groups. Clinicians can use these findings to educate women about 
      some changes they may anticipate and how they might manage them during pregnancy 
      and postpartum.

TI  - Myometrial contractile responsiveness to oxytocin after dexamethasone suppression
      of circadian uterine activity in pregnant rhesus macaques during late gestation.
PG  - 1636-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine if dexamethasone alters
      myometrial responsiveness to oxytocin or oxytocin secretion. STUDY DESIGN:
      Studies were conducted in rhesus macaques (n = 6), between 144 and 148 days'
      gestation (term 167 days). The first study was conducted at 9 AM and repeated 36 
      hours later at 9 PM. At 9 AM the following morning a continuous maternal
      dexamethasone infusion (15 micrograms/kg/hr given intravenously) was initiated,
      and the study was repeated at 9 PM, 60 hours later. Four doses of oxytocin (500, 
      1000, 2000, and 4000 pg/kg/min) were administered as 1-minute pulses every 5
      minutes for 30 minutes. The number of contractions per pulse (contraction/pulse
      ratio) was used to determine differences in myometrial responsiveness. RESULTS:
      Before dexamethasone infusion there was a circadian rhythm in uterine activity
      with peak contractile events between 8 and 10 PM (p < 0.01), whereas during
      infusion the rhythm was ablated. At oxytocin dose 1, the 9 AM contraction/pulse
      ratio (0.3 +/- 0.1) was lower than that for 9 PM (0.6 +/- 0.2) and for 60 hours
      later (0.6 +/- 0.1) (mean +/- SE, p < 0.05). Similar results were observed at
      dose 2, whereas no differences in the contraction/pulse ratio were noted at dose 
      3. Basal plasma oxytocin concentrations were unaffected by dexamethasone
      treatment, whereas plasma estradiol and cortisol concentrations were reduced
      compared with control values (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is a differential
      sensitivity to oxytocin between morning and evening and (2) the
      dexamethasone-induced loss of the uterine contractile rhythm is not the result of
      a loss of myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin or to a suppression of plasma
      oxytocin concentrations.

PG  - 1611-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to measure central nervous system insult from prenatal
      phenobarbital by quantified electroencephalographic evaluation of mature rat
      offspring. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four adult female rats were given phenobarbital
      as 0, 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg/day subcutaneously between 9 and 10 AM for 28 days
      before breeding and throughout gestation. The electroencephalograms of 90-day-old
      offspring were sampled over 24 hours and converted to the power spectra. RESULTS:
      Female offspring exposed prenatally to 20 mg and males exposed prenatally to 40
      mg displayed an increase in delta and a decrease in alpha and middle-beta
      waveform activities. Females exposed prenatally to 40 mg and males exposed
      prenatally to 60 mg displayed decreases in delta, theta, alpha, and middle-beta
      activities. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal phenobarbital exposure produced dose- and
      sex-dependent changes in the electroencephalogram of mature offspring consistent 
      with a generalized deficit in the neuronal synchronization mechanisms that are
      critical for normal sleep and learning.

TI  - Maturation of breathing.
PG  - 739-56
AB  - In summary, although the basic mechanisms involved in the control of breathing
      during fetal and neonatal life are similar to those investigated more extensively
      in adult subjects, there are some aspects that make this control unique at this
      age. First, sleep seems to have a very profound effect during this period of
      life, particularly in the fetus, in which breathing is allowed to occur only
      during REM sleep. Second, in utero breathing activity is present since early
      gestation and without apparent reason, since it is not responsible for gas
      exchange. Being the lung of the fetus, the placenta is responsible for gas
      exchange. The purpose of fetal breathing must therefore be discovered. Third, the
      discovery of fetal breathing is probably the most exciting contribution made in
      this area during the last 50 years. To learn why this episodic breathing in utero
      becomes continuous after birth is the major challenge of the moment. Trying to
      understand this change at birth may result in the discovery of key mediators that
      are at the heart of the mechanism controlling breathing in general.

TI  - Circadian rhythm of cell proliferation in the telencephalic ventricular zone:
      effect of in utero exposure to ethanol.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - The neocortical ventricular zone is composed of a desynchronized population of
      proliferating cells. These cells give rise to neurons in the infragranular
      laminae of neocortex. The present study documents a diurnal rhythmicity of cell
      proliferation in the ventricular zone and examines the effects of ethanol on this
      biological clock. Pregnant rats were fed one of 3 diets. They were provided an
      ethanol-containing (6.7% v/v) liquid diet ad libitum between gestational day (G) 
      6 and G18, pair-fed an isocaloric liquid control diet, or fed chow and water.
      Throughout the experiments, the rats were fed either at 08.00 h (E.S.T) or at
      17.00 h (lights on 06.00 to 18.00 h). Rats were given a single injection of
      bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on G17 at one point during a 24 h period (03.00, 06.00, 
      09.00 h, etc.). The fraction of ventricular cells that incorporated the BrdU was 
      determined using quantitative immunohistochemical methods. Pair-fed control rats 
      (fed at 08.00 or 17.00 h) consumed their food within 4 h of presentation. The
      ratio of cells passing through the S-phase of the cell cycle changed diurnally;
      the ratio was highest during the day (0.52 +/- 0.01 at 12.00 h) and lowest during
      the night (0.40 +/- 0.02 at 03.00 h). In contrast, the ethanol-fed rats grazed on
      their food throughout the dark cycle regardless of when the food was presented.
      The mean peak blood ethanol concentration was 142 +/- 13 mg/dl during the dark
      phase and less than 25 mg/dl during the light phase. Prenatal exposure to ethanol
      eliminates the fetal circadian rhythm in cell proliferation (mean labeling index 
      of 0.45 +/- 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Analysis of respiratory neuronal activity in fetal sheep.
PG  - 1972-81
AB  - We developed a new method to monitor fetal medullary respiratory neurons
      utilizing a two-stage approach. At 129-133 days of gestation, sheep were
      anesthetized, and a window was placed over the area of the fourth ventricle.
      After a recovery period of 3-5 days, the fetus was exteriorized into a saline
      bath under maternal spinal anesthesia, and the head was connected rigidly to a
      stereotaxic frame. Microelectrodes were inserted into the area of the nucleus
      tractus solitarius during rapid-eye-movement sleep, and extracellular recordings 
      of 223 respiratory neurons were analyzed: 76% were inspiratory, 9% expiratory,
      and 15% phase spanning, as classified by visual and computer correlation to
      diaphragmatic activity. More detailed analysis of 100 neurons was done to assess 
      the respiratory component (eta 2) by use of a modification of the method
      developed by Orem and Dick (J. Neurophysiol, 50: 1098-1107, 1983). With use of
      cohorts of 25 breaths, fetal respiratory neurons were found to frequently change 
      their phase relationship to diaphragmatic activity. The eta 2 statistic of fetal 
      respiratory neurons was not a stable characteristic but changed over time. This
      could be a reflection of an immature central respiratory system before birth or
      the lack of major sensory inputs.

TI  - Sleep quality in preeclampsia.
PG  - 1262-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to study the sleep quality in women with preeclampsia
      with a special reference to nocturnal body movement activity. STUDY DESIGN: Sleep
      quality was evaluated in nine women with preeclampsia and eight women with normal
      term pregnancy by means of questionnaires and by recording the nocturnal body
      movement activity with the static charge-sensitive bed. RESULTS: Subjective sleep
      complaints were similar in both groups. The total movement time and the total
      frequency of body movements in bed were, however, significantly increased in the 
      preeclamptic group. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that sleep is impaired in
      preeclamptic subjects.

TI  - A longitudinal study of sleep stages in young women during pregnancy and
      postpartum.
PG  - 449-53
AB  - We conducted a longitudinal polysomnographic study in five healthy primiparous
      subjects, whose sleep was first recorded between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation,
      then every 2 months until parturition and at 1 month postpartum. The first 6
      hours of sleep were used for statistical analysis. In contrast to previous
      studies, we found no reduction in stage 4 sleep with pregnancy. Slow-wave sleep
      (comprising stages 3 and 4), was significantly higher at 27-39 weeks of gestation
      than at 8-16 weeks, as predicted by the restorative theory of sleep. There was no
      significant difference in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time. When compared to a
      group of normal ovulating women, however, REM sleep time decreased during the
      last two months of pregnancy and, although there was no change in sleep onset
      latency, the time spent awake during the first six hours of sleep was increased. 
      Future research into the effects of cortisol and progesterone is indicated.

TI  - Comparison of EEG sleep measures in healthy full-term and preterm infants at
      matched conceptional ages.
PG  - 442-8
AB  - Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep studies were obtained on healthy
      full-term and preterm infants at matched conceptional ages. Studies were recorded
      under environmentally controlled conditions. Eighteen healthy preterm infants
      were matched to 18 full-term infants based on conceptional age, sex, race and
      socioeconomic class. The initial 3 hours of a 12-hour recording were
      simultaneously recorded on paper and computer. The visually scored data based on 
      the paper recordings for sleep architecture and continuity measures were studied.
      Differences in each sleep organization for the preterm infants included the
      following: a longer ultradian sleep cycle (70 minutes vs. 53 minutes, p = 0.02)
      was noted. More abundant trace alternant (34% vs. 28%, p = 0.02) and less
      abundant low-voltage irregular active sleep (13% vs. 17%, p = 0.05) were noted.
      Although no differences were observed for sleep latency and efficiency, the
      preterm infants had fewer numbers and shorter durations of arousals, fewer body
      movements and rapid eye movement (REM) (p < 0.01), particularly during quiet
      sleep. The extrauterine experience or the earlier birth of the preterm infant may
      influence specific sleep architecture and continuity measures when compared with 
      the sleep of full-term infants who experienced a complete intrauterine gestation.

TI  - Effect of bilateral vagotomy on oxygenation, arousal, and breathing movements in 
      fetal sheep.
PG  - 1402-12
AB  - To investigate the effects of bilateral cervical vagotomy on arousal and
      breathing responses, we studied eight sham-operated and eight chronically
      instrumented unanesthetized vagotomized sheep fetuses between 136 and 144 days of
      gestation (term approximately 147 days). Each fetus was instrumented to record
      sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, blood pressure, pH, and blood gas
      tensions. In a randomized order, fetal lungs were distended with four different
      O2 concentrations: 0 (100% N2), 21, 50, and 100% at a continuous positive airway 
      pressure of 30 cmH2O via an in situ Y-endotracheal tube. Under control
      conditions, inspiratory time and the duration of the single longest breathing
      episode decreased from 598 +/- 99 (SD) ms and 24 +/- 10 min in sham group to 393 
      +/- 162 ms and 11.0 +/- 3.0 min in vagotomized group (P = 0.04 and 0.033),
      respectively. In response to lung distension with 100% N2, breathing time
      decreased from 44 +/- 17 to 20 +/- 18% (P = 0.045) in sham-operated fetuses,
      whereas it remained unchanged in the vagotomized group. In response to 100% O2,
      fetal arterial PO2 increased in five of eight fetuses sham-operated from 18.2 +/-
      5.1 to 227 +/- 45 Torr (P = 0.0001) and in six of eight vagotomized fetuses from 
      18.5 +/- 4.4 to 172 +/- 39 Torr (P < 0.001). Although arousal was observed in all
      oxygenated fetuses at the onset of breathing, the duration of arousal was
      markedly attenuated in vagotomized fetuses (14 +/- 10 vs. 46 +/- 29 min in sham
      group; P = 0.024). Frequency and amplitude of breathing and respiratory output
      (frequency x amplitude) increased only in sham group (P = 0.02, 0.004, and
      0.0002, respectively). We conclude that in response to lung distension and
      oxygenation, arousal and stimulation of breathing during active and quite sleep
      are critically dependent on intact vagal nerves.

      twin gestations.
PG  - 1140-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that twins, when monitored simultaneously,
      show a remarkably high incidence of coincident fetal heart rate accelerations
      (about 58%). The current study examines synchrony of behavior patterns in twins. 
      STUDY DESIGN: We examined 37 fetal monitor strips from 15 sets of twins with
      simultaneous fetal heart rate and fetal movement recorded by means of Doppler
      techniques (Toitu MT-430 fetal actocardiograph). The strips were analyzed for
      coincidence of fetal heart rate accelerations and fetal movement episodes and
      then conceptually for synchrony of fetal behavior patterns on the basis of
      descriptions of behavioral states by Prechtl. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of
      fetal heart rate accelerations were found to be simultaneous. Forty-three percent
      of movement epochs were considered simultaneous. We found that twins exhibited
      synchronous behavior patterns (basically sleep or awake state) 94.7% of the time.
      CONCLUSION: Twin-twin interactions are more consistently related than suspected
      when observation is limited to heart rate alone, and the synchrony and role of
      fetal behavior states must be considered when twin interactions and behavior are 
      studied.

TI  - D1-dopamine receptors activate c-fos expression in the fetal suprachiasmatic
      nuclei.
PG  - 9201-4
AB  - The existence of an activatable dopamine system within the hypothalamic
      suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the site of a biological clock, was investigated in
      rats during fetal life. In situ hybridization studies revealed that D1-dopamine
      receptor mRNA was highly expressed in the fetal SCN and not expressed in other
      hypothalamic regions. Cocaine injected into pregnant rats or directly into rat
      fetuses on day 20 of gestation selectively activated c-fos gene expression in the
      fetal SCN; cocaine did not induce c-fos expression elsewhere in the fetal brain
      or in the maternal SCN. This cocaine-induced activation of c-fos expression in
      fetal SCN was mediated in part through D1-dopamine receptors, as the
      cocaine-induced activation was partially blocked by the D1-dopamine receptor
      antagonist SCH 23390. In addition, the selective D1-dopamine receptor agonist SKF
      38393 induced high levels of c-fos expression in the fetal SCN. The presence of
      an activatable dopamine system within the fetal SCN provides a mechanism through 
      which maternal signals could entrain the fetal biological clock and through which
      maternally administered psychotropic drugs could alter normal development of the 
      circadian timing system.

PG  - 1212-22
AB  - The general pharmacological profile of 7-fluoro-1-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-
      4(1H)-quinolone BTS 53 554, CAS 76568-68-8), the main metabolite of a new
      vasodilator, flosequinan (BTS 49 465), was investigated. 1. The central nervous
      system: BTS 53 554 at the dose of 30 mg/kg i.v. caused an increase in respiratory
      rate and a sedation in general behavior in rats. The drug also inhibited acetic
      acid-induced writhing and slightly decreased normal body temperature in mice.
      However, the drug at the doses up to 30 mg/kg i.v. had little effect on the
      spontaneous movement, hexobarbital-induced hypnosis, reserpine-induced
      hypothermia and motor coordination in mice. The drug showed neither
      anticonvulsant nor analgesic actions in mice. Furthermore, it had no effect on
      the spontaneous EEG, sleep-wakefulness cycle and EEG arousal response in rabbits 
      at doses up to 10 mg/kg intravenously. 2. The somatic nervous system: BTS 53 554 
      induced no muscle relaxation in mice and exerted no local anesthetic action in
      guinea pigs by corneal reflex method. In addition, it had little effect on the
      neuromuscular transmission in cats. 3. The autonomic nervous system and smooth
      muscle: BTS 53 554 showed no effect on the sympathetic ganglionic transmission in
      cats. In isolated smooth muscles, at doses up to 10(-3) mol/l it showed little
      effect on the acetylcholine- or barium chloride-induced contraction of guinea-pig
      ileum, norepinephrine-induced contraction of rat vas deferens or oxytocin-induced
      contraction of nonpregnant rat uterus. However, it inhibited non-competitively
      norepinephrine-induced contraction of isolated rat aorta at 10(-4) mol/l or more 
      and serotonin-induced contraction of isolated rat fundus at 3 x 10(-4) mol/l or
      more. In the isolated guinea-pig ileum, the drug slightly inhibited the
      histamine-induced maximal contraction at 10(-3) mol/l. These results suggest BTS 
      53 554 had no specific effect on norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine or
      histamine. The drug relaxed isolated guinea-pig trachea at 3 x 10(-5) mol/l or
      more and inhibited the spontaneous movement of isolated pregnant rat uterus at
      10(-4) mol/l or more, although these actions were extremely weaker than those of 
      isoproterenol (isoprenaline). BTS 53 554 also showed a slight inhibition of
      uterus movement in anesthetized rats at 30 mg/kg intravenously. 4. The digestive 
      system: BTS 53 554 tended to inhibit the gastrointestinal propulsion in mice and 
      showed a slight inhibition of gastric and intestinal motilities in rats at 10
      mg/kg intravenously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

      was found in patients with gestosis and IUGR, whereas such a rhythm was confirmed
      in normal pregnancies. The evaluation of circadian changes in estriol
      concentration in the third trimester of gestation may be useful when diagnosing

TI  - Nocturnal low back pain in pregnancy: polysomnographic correlates.
PG  - 251-3
AB  - Thirteen women in late stages of pregnancy underwent a polysomnographic study.
      Eight women (61%) complained of mild nocturnal back pain or back discomfort. Five
      women (39%) did not complain of nocturnal back pain. The two groups did not
      differ in total bed time, total sleep time, sleep latency, and wake after sleep
      onset (WASO). A significant decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and an
      increase in stage 2 were observed in the pain group. The same group had a
      statistically significant decrease in the basal O2 saturation level. The pain
      group also spent a longer time sleeping in the supine position. We hypothesize
      that a prolonged stay in the supine position leads to obstruction of the vena
      cava. In the presence of inadequate collateral circulation, increased pressure
      and venostasis in combination with a decrease in basal oxygen saturation may lead
      to hypoxemia, compromise the metabolic supply of the neural structures, and
      result in pain. It appears, therefore, that the vascular system plays an
      important role in the pathogenesis of pain. The role played by the disturbed
      sleep architecture in the production of pain remains to be established. It is
      possible that the changes observed in sleep architecture result from pain rather 
      than contribute to pain production.

TI  - From Fanny to Fernand: the development of consumerism in pain control during the 
      birth process.
PG  - 581-7
AB  - Obstetric anesthesia has been the object of public interest and patient advocacy 
      from its introduction in the 1840s to the present. Early arguments concerned the 
      significance of pain in childbearing and became a popular issue involving
      physicians, clergymen, and journalists. The first obstetric anesthesia, either,
      given in the United States was administered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1847.
      For the next several decades general anesthesia was the only feasible means of
      relieving labor pain. At the turn of the century a combination of scopolamine and
      morphine was introduced in the United States by a popular women's magazine; the
      National Twilight Sleep Association was launched. After the decline of this
      movement, the "natural" childbirth method came into national prominence. In spite
      of their differing pharmacologic characteristics, there are sociologic parallels 
      between the patient advocacy of Twilight Sleep and that of psychoprophylaxis.
      This study focuses on the public perception of these movements, which were begun 
      by physicians and subsequently endorsed by militant lay groups.

TI  - Effect of maternal cold exposure on brown adipose tissue and thermogenesis in the
      neonatal lamb.
PG  - 487-502
AB  - 1. This study examines the effect of chronic cold exposure during pregnancy,
      induced by winter shearing twin-bearing ewes 4 weeks before predicted lambing
      date, on O2 consumption and CO2 production during non-rapid-eye-movement (REM)
      sleep in lambs maintained for at least 1 h at warm (28-18 degrees C) and cold
      (14-5 degrees C) ambient temperatures at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days of age. This was
      combined with measurement of the thermogenic activity (GDP binding to uncoupling 
      protein in mitochondrial preparations) of perirenal adipose tissue from lambs
      immediately after birth and at 33 days of age. 2. Lambs born from shorn
      (cold-exposed) ewes were 15% heavier (P < 0.01) and possessed 21% (P < 0.01) more
      perirenal adipose tissue that contained 40% more protein and mitochondrial
      protein than unshorn (P < 0.05) controls. Total GDP binding in perirenal adipose 
      tissue was 40% greater (P < 0.05) in lambs born from shorn ewes but there was no 
      difference in lipid content of this tissue between the two groups. 3. At 1 day of
      age, lambs born from shorn ewes exhibited a 16% higher (P < 0.05) rate of O2
      consumption (per kilogram bodyweight) at the warm temperature and a 40% greater
      metabolic response to the cold ambient temperature. All lambs born from shorn
      ewes responded to cold exposure without shivering (i.e. via non-shivering
      thermogenesis) whilst shivering was measured in four out of seven lambs in the
      unshorn group. These differences had disappeared by 4 days of age as a result of 
      a 25% increased (P < 0.01) rate of O2 consumption in the warm in lambs born from 
      unshorn ewes and a 20% decrease (P < 0.05) in the response to the cold in lambs
      from shorn ewes. Shivering during cold exposure was measured in six out of nine
      lambs born from shorn ewes indicating a rapid alteration in thermoregulatory
      responses to cold during the first few days of life. 4. The levels of GDP binding
      and mitochondrial protein in perirenal adipose tissue fell by one-third in both
      groups of lambs during the first 33 days of life whereas lipid content either
      increased or was unchanged. This indicated that brown adipose tissue (BAT) was
      developing the characteristics of white adipose tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

TI  - Arterial oxygen tension threshold range for the onset of arousal and breathing in
      fetal sheep.
PG  - 342-9
AB  - Mechanisms for the control of episodic fetal breathing movements or the onset of 
      continuous breathing at birth remain unknown. Lung distension with 100% O2 at a
      continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm H2O may induce arousal and
      continuous breathing. To investigate 1) the threshold range of arterial oxygen
      tension (PaO2) for the onset of arousal and breathing and 2) the graded response 
      of breathing to various levels of PaO2, we studied 10 fetal sheep between 135 and
      142 d of gestation (term = 147 +/- 2 d). Each fetus was instrumented to record
      sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, arterial pH, and blood gas tensions. 
      PaO2 threshold was determined through an indwelling O2 sensor catheter. Fetal
      lungs were distended at a continuous positive airway pressure of 40 cm H2O with
      100% N2 or with O2 ranging from 40 to 100% via an in situ endotracheal tube. At
      the onset of arousal (n = 10), PaO2, arterial carbon dioxide tension, and Hb O2
      saturation increased from control values of 21.7 +/- 0.75 torr (2.9 +/- 0.09
      kPa), 41.8 +/- 1.1 torr (5.47 +/- 0.15 kPa), and 52.9 +/- 2.6% to 65.6 +/- 9.6
      torr (8.74 +/- 1.28 kPa), 46.9 +/- 1.3 torr (6.25 +/- 0.17 kPa), and 92.9 +/-
      2.06%, respectively, whereas the pH decreased from 7.31 +/- 0.006 to 7.27 +/-
      0.009 (mean +/- SEM; p = 0.001, 0.04, 0.002, and 0.001, respectively). Seven of
      10 fetuses breathed continuously. In these fetuses, PaO2 and arterial carbon
      dioxide tension further increased and pH decreased; however, no further
      significant increase in Hb O2 saturation was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

PG  - 1034-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and predisposing factors of severe
      hypoglycemia (SH) in pregnant women with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes
      mellitus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SH (impairment of consciousness due to
      hypoglycemia subsequently treated with glucagon or i.v. glucose) was recorded in 
      all pregnant type I diabetic women (n = 77) who attended our pregnancy clinic
      during 85 pregnancies from 1986 to 1990. RESULTS: Ninety-four SHs were reported
      during 35 pregnancies. Of 94 SHs, 84% occurred before the 20th gestational wk
      (median 12th wk) and 77% during sleep. In the group with SH, there was no
      permanent maternal sequelae, and there was a favorable fetal outcome (no
      perinatal death and no congenital malformation). Mean HbA1c values were not
      different between the group with and without SH for the first half (6.4 +/- 1.1
      vs. 6.3 +/- 0.9%) and 2nd half (5.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.7%) of pregnancy. The
      percentage of women with SH before pregnancy (51 vs. 28%, P less than 0.05) and
      the incidence of SH patients before pregnancy (0.49 vs. 0.08 SH/patient/yr) was
      different between the group with and without SH. CONCLUSIONS: SH is frequent
      during pregnancies of type I diabetic women with near normoglycemia. The risk for
      SH is particularly pronounced during the first half of pregnancy and in women
      with a history of SH.

TI  - Timing of birth in Syrian hamsters.
PG  - 6-10
AB  - The effects of mating time and of LD cycles on the timing of birth and length of 
      gestation were examined in Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Hamsters
      maintained on 14L:10D cycles were mated for 2 h either in the evening or in the
      morning, and groups of hamsters mated in the morning were subjected to either a
      6-h advance shift or a 6-h delay shift of the LD cycle on Days 5-14 of gestation.
      For the last 2 days of gestation the hamsters were kept in constant dim light and
      observed every hour to determine the time of birth. Hamsters mated in the evening
      gave birth an average of 4.8 h before those mated in the morning, and the
      hamsters subjected to an advance shift gave birth an average of 8.1 h before
      those subjected to delay shift. The results show that 80-100% of births occur
      during the subjective day on Day 16 of gestation and that the minimum duration of
      gestation is 15 days and 2 h. The regulation of birth appears to involve two
      processes, an interval timer related to the time of conception and a circadian
      rhythm that is governed by the LD cycle.

TI  - Fetal heart rate patterns and chronic exposure to antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 721-8
AB  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) characteristics of fetuses exposed and not exposed to
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were studied. FHR is considered to reflect central
      nervous system (CNS) integrity. Three intervals during pregnancy were
      investigated: 20, 32, and 38 weeks. At 32 and 38 weeks, FHR was studied in
      relation to quiet (C1F) and active (C2F) sleep periods. For each tracing, a
      baseline was determined and accelerations and decelerations were identified. To
      assess FHR variability, the long-term irregularity, interval difference and
      absolute beat-to-beat indexes, and the bandwidth were calculated for 30-s
      intervals between accelerations and decelerations. No marked differences were
      noted between study and control groups concerning basal FHR and the occurrence of
      accelerations. For FHR derived from the fetal ECG, all indexes of FHR variability
      and the bandwidth were lower for the study group as compared with the control
      group, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our study
      shows that chronic prenatal exposure to AEDs does not seriously interfere with
      modulation of fetal heart rhythm by the CNS.

TI  - Developmental thermoregulatory deficits in prenatal ethanol exposed long- and
      short-sleep mice.
PG  - 365-73
AB  - Sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of prenatal alcohol effects. To
      examine this hypothesis, the ontogeny of thermoregulation was measured in
      prenatal ethanol exposed offspring of mice selected for differences in alcohol
      sensitivity. Pregnant long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) mice were exposed to 3
      or 4 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin twice per day from
      day 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Doses were given six hours apart via gavage.
      Nonintubated lab chow controls were included for both genotypes. Offspring were
      fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred strain. Offspring temperatures 
      were measured at 0, 60, and 120 min away from the nest on alternating days from 7
      through 21 days of age. LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to the high
      ethanol dose showed lower temperatures at the 60 and 120 min time points on each 
      day of testing compared to all other treatment groups. Temperatures of offspring 
      prenatally exposed to the low ethanol dose did not differ from controls. These
      results suggest a relatively steep dose-response curve for thermoregulatory
      deficits in LS and SS offspring prenatally exposed to alcohol. Genetically-based 
      alcohol sensitivity did not influence the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on
      this response.

PG  - 169-75
AB  - Thirty female subjects examined in the first three months of pregnancy took part 
      in the study. Ten of these suffered from severe gravidic hyperemesis, while
      twenty had a physiological pregnancy. All subjects with hyperemesis and six
      controls were subjected to measurement of cortisolaemia at the following times:
      8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 4.00 so as to obtain the circadian curve of the hormone,
      measurement of T3 and T4 and of TSH. The Cattell test in form C was carried out
      in all patients. The results obtained evidenced a global increase in the
      production of cortisol in the group of hyperemetic women, with maintenance of the
      circadian rhythm. The Cattell test identified characteristic personality traits
      in the subjects suffering from hyperemesis compared to the controls.

TI  - Sleep in normal late pregnancy.
PG  - 246-51
AB  - Twelve women in their third trimester of pregnancy and 10 age-matched nonpregnant
      controls underwent complete polysomnography for one night in the laboratory.
      Seven of the original women returned for a second study 3-5 months postpartum.
      During late pregnancy, women showed increased wake after sleep onset (WASO) and a
      lower sleep efficiency in comparison with the control group. The percentage of
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was significantly decreased and the percentage of 
      stage 1 significantly increased compared to the nonpregnant group. At 3-5 months 
      postpartum, a significant reduction in WASO and increased sleep efficiency were
      noted. However, only a slight increase was noted in REM sleep during the
      postpartum period compared to the prepartum period. The most frequent sleep
      complaints in the pregnant group were restless sleep, low back pain, leg cramps
      and frightening dreams. In summary, in accordance with their complaints, women in
      their third trimester demonstrated polysomnographic patterns of sleep maintenance
      insomnia.

TI  - Apnea in subsequent asymptomatic siblings of infants who had an apparent
      life-threatening event.
PG  - 124-8
AB  - Infants experiencing apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) have been reported
      to have elevated frequencies of periodic breathing and obstructive apnea when
      compared to presumably normal control groups. Whether these characteristics
      extend to the siblings of ALTE infants remains unknown. This study compared,
      retrospectively, the apnea indices of 13 first-born infants experiencing an ALTE 
      with their subsequent asymptomatic siblings who had undergone polygraphic sleep
      apnea evaluations (including electrocardiogram, chest wall movements, expired
      CO2, and transcutaneous pulse oximetry). Gestation, birthweight, age at study,
      apnea and periodic breathing indices, and oxygen desaturations were compared.
      Regression analyses revealed that adjustments for gestational and postnatal age
      eliminated differences in apnea indices. ALTE infants and their subsequent
      siblings experienced similar rates of apnea. Neither group had elevated rates of 
      prolonged central apneas (greater than 10 seconds duration) or periodic breathing
      (greater than 5% sleep time). Neither group had subsequent severe apneas. The use
      of polygraphic study and cardiac/apnea monitors in subsequent siblings of ALTE
      are unnecessary and should be considered only when there is parental
      disagreement.

TI  - A study on the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus.
PG  - 391-6
AB  - We observed fetal behavior by using three ultrasonic real-time scanners
      simultaneously in 30 normal pregnant women between 20 and 40 weeks of gestation
      and analyzed developmental changes in behavioral pattern focussing the attention 
      on the characteristics of REM and non-REM sleep and wakeful state. The frequency 
      of REM significantly increased with gestational age, and its occurrences formed a
      group in late pregnancy. REM and non-REM periods, which were defined as the phase
      with uninterrupted appearance of rapid eye movements and the phase without them
      over 3 min, respectively, became clearly distinguishable between 28 and 31 weeks 
      of gestation. The correlation between the occurrence of rapid eye movements and
      breathing movements was high after 27 weeks. These results demonstrate the course
      of the development of sleep-wakefulness cycle in the human fetus.

PG  - 309-16
AB  - This prospective study of 63 women was designed to investigate the relationship
      between sleep disruption prior to the birth, during labour and in the early
      postpartum period and the subsequent development of the postnatal blues. The
      results from this preliminary study suggest that two factors: (a) a night-time
      labour; and (b) a history of sleep disruption in the latter stages of pregnancy, 
      may have aetiological importance in the development of postnatal blues. There was
      little evidence from this study to suggest that sleep disruption on the nights
      following the birth, the third sleep factor investigated, had any impact on the
      expression of the blues.

TI  - Contemporary risk factors for sudden infant death in an Irish population--a case 
      control study.
PG  - 131-4
AB  - This case-controlled study examines some recently implicated risk factors for
      Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (S.I.D.S.) in Irish infants. Irish S.I.D.S. infants 
      are lighter at birth than controls (3463g) compared to (3542g) and boys
      out-number girls by a ratio of 1.3:1. S.I.D.S. infants are more frequently:
      breast-fed (42% vs 25%) and sleep in a location other than the parent's bedroom
      (54% vs 21%), but start solids at a similar age and appear not to be sicker prior
      to death than the control group. This study highlights the frequency of symptoms 
      of possible ill-health (i.e. snuffles and being "chesty") in well infants during 
      the first months of life with 32% of the control group having snuffles and 35%
      described as "chesty". In addition these symptoms are frequently treated with
      antibiotics with 31% of the control group having already received antibiotics by 
      2 months of age. A majority of S.I.D.S. infants were described as cold when found
      (52%) with 39% described as warm and 15% as sweaty. Obviously the recently
      implicated role of overheating may be relevant in the latter 15% of S.I.D.S.
      cases. In this series, 88% of infants had died by 6 months of age. Of the 97
      parents of S.I.D.S. infants questioned, 78 had subsequently become pregnant by
      the time the study was conducted at an average time of 5 months post the S.I.D.S.
      event.

TI  - New-onset ventricular tachycardia during pregnancy.
PG  - 933-41
AB  - During evaluation for palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, seven pregnant women 
      had documented ventricular tachycardia. Before pregnancy none had a history of
      significant cardiac disease or symptomatic arrhythmia. The tachycardia rate
      ranged from 117 to 250 beats/min and lasted up to 65 seconds. Arrhythmia
      evaluation in five of the patients suggested catecholamine-sensitive ventricular 
      tachycardia. This diagnosis was supported by either a positive relation to
      exercise or isoproterenol infusion, suppression of arrhythmia by beta-blockade or
      sleep, and lack of induction of arrhythmia by programmed electrical stimulation
      of the heart. The arrhythmias resolved in one patient soon after evaluation and
      in one other patient after 2 months of controlling therapy. Five other patients
      continued to receive therapy throughout pregnancy. Delivery was accomplished in
      all patients without significant maternal or neonatal complications.

TI  - Prolonged periodic breathing: significance in sleep studies.
PG  - 450-3
AB  - Periodic breathing (PB) is a pattern of breathing that is frequently recognized
      in infants being studied for possible sleep apnea. Infants presenting to a sleep 
      laboratory over a 3 1/2-year period who had evidence on their initial study of
      prolonged (greater than 15% of total sleep time) PB were prospectively studied in
      an effort to determine the significance of this pattern of breathing. Of the 331 
      infants studied, 40 demonstrated prolonged PB. Sixteen of these infants, who were
      of 37 weeks' gestation or greater at birth and did not receive pharmacologic
      therapy, were studied on at least two occasions (group 1). Of the remaining 24
      infants, 11 were treated with methylxanthines by their attending physician (group
      2), and 13 did not return for sequential studies (group 3). All infants who were 
      of less than 37 weeks' gestation at birth were separately evaluated (group 4).
      For group 1, who were studied at a mean age of 15 postnatal weeks, there was a
      mean of 36.4% periodicity which decreased on the second study to 18.0%. By the
      fourth study, this had decreased to 9.2%. In group 2, there was a mean of 41.3%
      periodicity during the first study which decreased to 6.4% on the second study.
      Infants of group 3 had a mean of 31.4% PB on their initial study and the
      premature infants, group 4, had 30.1% PB. All infants showed a decrease in PB
      with sequential studies and no infant was known to have died of sudden infant
      death syndrome or any other disorder in the first year of life.(ABSTRACT

TI  - [Infection-induced pathologic change in respiratory parameters in the young
      infant].
PG  - 115-7
AB  - While many aspects related to the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant
      death remain unclear, the ultimate trigger event appears to be an acute
      regulatory disturbance of the cardiorespiratory neurons of the reticular
      formation of the brain stem. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that SIDS
      often occurs after infection of the upper respiratory tract. We present the case 
      history of a 10-week old infant, where the respiratory pattern demonstrated
      highly pathological alterations induced by a mild infection of the upper airways,
      as confirmed by oxycardiorespirography. Oxycardiorespirography provides
      continuous recording of the respiration (transthoracic impedance) extending over 
      several hours during sleep and during the critical phase just before going to
      sleep and waking up in relation to heart rate, partial oxygen pressure (measured 
      transcutaneously) and nasal flow. The presented infant is a premature infant
      delivered in the 34th week of gestation according to Dubowitz (artificial
      respiration for 7 days due to hyalin membrane syndrome stage II). During
      infection periodic breathing was found to be 19.3% with partly severe hypoxemia. 
      The longest single episode of apnea was 30 seconds. On the average, 5 episodes of
      bradycardia occurred (less than 100/min/measuring hour). An OCRG investigation
      performed at the age of 5 weeks and after disappearance of the infection at the
      age of 12 weeks yielded normal findings. This permits the conclusion that in out 
      patient an infection of the upper airways may have induced a pathologic
      respiratory pattern, which could be a major trigger mechanism for sudden infant
      death.

TI  - Nonnutritive sucking: adaptation and health for the neonate.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - Nonnutritive sucking has been found to affect movement, sleep, state regulation
      and arousal, oxygenation, and nutrition and growth. Its quality is used as an
      indicator of central nervous system well-being. Speculations have been suggested 
      about improved outcomes from respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus
      arteriosus, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The possible effect of sucking
      movements on attachment between mother and infant has also been described.
      Further research in the many areas in which this sucking phenomenon has effects
      are indicated. Exploration of the impact of nonnutritive sucking on the preterm
      infant of less than 28 weeks gestation and less than 800 gm and on the infant
      with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is recommended. Further research also needs to
      focus on implications of clinical applications of these findings to nursing care.

TI  - Melatonin as a proconvulsive hormone in humans.
PG  - 125-35
AB  - The pineal gland and melatonin exert a major influence in the control of brain
      electrical activity and have been shown to be involved in seizure and sleep
      mechanisms. Since pinealectomy has been reported to result in seizures in
      experimental animals, it is assumed that melatonin has anticonvulsant properties.
      Indeed, limited studies in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy indicate that
      melatonin attenuates seizure activity. In the present communication we present
      evidence, based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain measurements, that
      melatonin may exert proconvulsive activity in humans as well. The proconvulsive
      properties of melatonin may explain several phenomena associated with epilepsy
      such as the increased occurrence of seizures at night when melatonin plasma
      levels are 5 to 8-fold higher than during the day and the observed exacerbation
      of seizures premenstrually and during pregnancy as well as the attenuation of
      seizures in the menopause. Furthermore, our findings suggest that anticonvulsants
      which decrease melatonin secretion, such as the benzodiazepines, may exert their 
      antiepileptic activity by attenuating nocturnal melatonin secretion. Finally, we 
      propose that patients with nocturnal epilepsy or those experiencing exacerbation 
      of seizures premenstrually may benefit from the administration of agents which
      block the secretion or action of melatonin.

      were studied under different experimental designs (fasting, reversed photoperiod,

      alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine). The rhythm of fasted rats did not change. There were
      modifications in the rhythm of rats submitted to a reversed photoperiod or

      hypothalamus of guinea pig with special regard to the prenatal colocalization
      with gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-like immunoreactivity.
PG  - 66-73
AB  - Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) colocalizes within
      gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH)-containing neurons in adult hypothalamus
      and could play a role in the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary axis in adults.
      To support the possibility that DSIP also participates in fetal neuroendocrine
      events and to demonstrate the ontogenic evidence of coexisting neuropeptides, we 
      have performed a detailed immunocytochemical study of DSIP- and
      GnRH-immunoreactivity in fetal hypothalamus of guinea pig. Using indirect
      immunofluorescent and sequential double-immunolabeling (elution-restaining)
      techniques, the results indicated that DSIP immunoreactivity was initially
      detected at the 38th day of gestation. In contrast to the first appearance of
      GnRH immunoreactivity at day 28, therefore, a 10-day delay was found. Such a
      delay remains as yet unexplained. From its first occurrence, DSIP
      immunoreactivity was always labeled with GnRH, whereas some of
      GnRH-immunoreactive structures did not display a DSIP immunoreactivity. But with 
      the growth of fetus, especially before and after birth, a complete overlap
      between DSIP and GnRH immunoreactivity was observed throughout various regions of
      hypothalamus. Attention was also focused on prenatal morphological development of
      DSIP/GnRH- and GnRH-immunolabeled neurons. Initially, labeled neurons were
      visualized as uni- or bipolar types. Thereafter, their smooth and irregular
      subtypes could be distinguished. During later fetal age, relatively mature
      features were evident such as the increase of multipolar and irregularly labeled 
      neurons. Taken together, these data provide, for the first time, anatomical
      evidence that DSIP exists in fetal hypothalamus and that, like GnRH, it could
      regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during ontogenesis.

PG  - 497-501
AB  - Eighteen non-pregnant woman complaining about insomnia were polysomnographically 
      investigated for 3 nights with weekly intervals. They received placebo, 2 mg
      flunitrazepam or 10 mg zolpidem according to a cross-over double blind design.
      The patients were selected by general practitioners on the basis of subjective
      complaints. Zolpidem is a recently introduced short-acting imidazopyridine
      hypnotic, binding to a subunit of the benzodiazepine 1 receptor. Flunitrazepam is
      a well-known hypnotic, binding to both the benzodiazepine 1 and 2 receptor
      subtypes. Objective recording did not substantiate the subjective complaint of
      insomnia. Sleep patterns during placebo differed only little from that expected
      from age matched healthy persons. Both flunitrazepam and zolpidem significantly
      shortened sleep onset (5 min of continuous sleep beginning with NREM 1 sleep).
      The sleep composition following flunitrazepam was characterized by an increase in
      NREM 2, a prolongation of the time of REM sleep, a reduction of REM sleep and an 
      increase in NREM 3-4 sleep during the first 2 h of sleep. The sleep composition
      following zolpidem resembled more than seen in persons without sleep complaints. 
      However, as compared to placebo, there was a decrease of the time spent awake
      during sleep and an increase in NREM 3-4 during the first 2 of sleep.

TI  - Perinatal development of human circadian rhythms: role of the foetal biological
      clock.
PG  - 371-8
AB  - The development of circadian rhythms and the neuronal mechanisms underlying their
      generation (particularly the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus) were
      reviewed. Based on perinatal animal studies and data from human foetuses and/or
      preterm infants it was concluded that human circadian rhythms are present as
      early as at 30 weeks of gestation. The significance of the mother and/or the
      environment regarding the entrainment of the "endogenous" foetal biological clock
      was emphasized.

PG  - 151-62; discussion 162-3
AB  - Circadian rhythms are already present in the fetus. At a certain stage of
      pre-natal hypothalamic development (around 30 weeks of gestation) the fetus
      becomes responsive to maternal circadian signals. Moreover, recent studies showed
      that the fetal biological clock is able to generate circadian rhythms, as
      exemplified by the rhythms of body temperature and heart rate of pre-term babies 
      in the absence of maternal or environmental entrainment factors. Pre-term babies 
      that are deprived of maternal entrainment and kept under constant environmental
      conditions (e.g., continuous light) in the neonatal intensive care unit run the
      risk of developing a biological clock dysfunctioning. However, the fact should be
      acknowledged that at least in mice the development of the circadian pacemaker
      (i.e., SCN) does not depend on environmental influences (Davis and Menaker,
      1981), although other data suggest that severe disruption of the maternal
      circadian rhythm indeed abolishes the circadian rhythm of the fetal SCN (Shibata 
      and Moore, 1988). During aging and in particular in AD circadian rhythms are
      disturbed. These disturbances include phase advance and reduced period and
      amplitude, as well as an increased intradaily variability and a decreased
      interdaily stability of the rhythm. Among the factors underlying these changes
      the loss of SCN neurons seems to play a central role. Other contributory factors 
      may be reduced amount of light, degenerative changes in the visual system and the
      level of activity and decreased melatonin.

TI  - Diazepam and atropine as premedicants: no discrimination by monoamine metabolite 
      and catecholamine measurements in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma.
PG  - 80-3
AB  - The relationships between self-reported assessments of the quality of the
      preoperative night's sleep, preoperative anxiety, and several biochemical and
      physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in pregnant women
      at term receiving no premedication (n = 15), a placebo tablet (n = 15), diazepam 
      5 mg p.o. (n = 15), or atropine 0.01 mg/kg i.m. (n = 15), in connection with
      spinal analgesia for elective caesarean section. In the patients receiving no
      premedication, the subjective estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's
      sleep was negatively associated with concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and its
      metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in CSF, and with plasma
      adrenaline. The anxiolytic effect of diazepam was reflected as significantly
      lower plasma levels of another metabolite of NA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol
      (DHPG). Placebo and diazepam, and to a lesser extent atropine, confounded the
      statistical relationships between the clinical and biochemical responses found in
      the patients with no premedication. On the whole, the biochemical monoamine
      measurements were of little use in determining the clinical effects of different 
      kinds of premedicants.

TI  - Hallermann-Streiff syndrome: a review.
PG  - 488-99
AB  - The Hallermann-Streiff syndrome is characterized by dyscephaly, hypotrichosis,
      microphthalmia, cataracts, beaked nose, micrognathia, and proportionate short
      stature. Cause is unknown; sporadic occurrence is the rule. Data presented in
      this review include the characteristics of pregnancy, growth and development,
      principal manifestations, radiographic and ophthalmological characteristics, and 
      the results of cephalometric study. Potential complications in the syndrome are
      related to the narrow upper airway associated with the craniofacial
      configuration. Severe complications may include early pulmonary infection,
      respiratory embarrassment, obstructive sleep apnea, and anesthetic risk. Topics
      for future study are suggested.

TI  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in secondary hypertension.
PG  - S69-71
AB  - The term 'secondary hypertension' includes a variety of aetiological processes
      with no obvious common feature apart, perhaps, from the loss of normal blood
      pressure regulatory factors. It has been suggested that all forms of secondary
      hypertension, including renal/renovascular, accelerated phase, glucocorticoid and
      mineralocorticoid excess, phaeochromocytoma and toxaemia in pregnancy are
      associated with the loss of the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure. The
      evidence for this view appears strongest for glucocorticoid-induced hypertension,
      but for most other forms the available data are conflicting and are mostly based 
      on small numbers of patients without adequate control populations. Sleep is a
      powerful determinant of the nocturnal fall in blood pressure but few studies have
      addressed the quality of sleep in groups of patients who are often sick and/or
      hospitalized. Abnormalities in sympathetic drive (e.g. autonomic neuropathy and
      phaeochromocytoma) can abolish the nocturnal blood pressure reductions, and
      activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be a critical factor in
      determining the normal diurnal changes in blood pressure. As approximately 20% of
      patients with 'essential hypertension' have a blunted fall in nocturnal blood
      pressure it seems unlikely that ambulatory blood pressure could ever be useful in
      screening for secondary hypertension.

TI  - [Psychosomatic aspects of oral contraception].
PG  - 955-8
AB  - Oral contraceptive use is influenced by multiple emotional factors. Physiological
      and psychological effects are closely correlated. Contraception may assist women 
      in pursuing important psychosocial goals, on the other hand, it may cause a
      number of problems. Many unconscious wishes or fears may interfere with the clear
      separation of sexuality from fertility. Ambivalence about pregnancy, neurotic
      personalities and problems in partner relationship may cause psychic conflicts
      with regard to contraception. Anxiety, side effects, misuse of contraceptives or 
      problems in the relationship between doctor and patient may result. As a further 
      development psychosomatic symptoms such as discomfort, nervousness, sleep
      disturbance, fatigue, nausea and sexual disorders may appear. The physician must 
      take contradictory feelings of the patient into consideration, including her
      anxiety and her possible ambivalence with respect to pregnancy.

OAB - Oral contraceptive (OCs) which are highly effective, simple to use, and
      reversible, are used by 50 million women globally. In Germany 37.1% of women used
      them in 1985. Recently their acceptance has declined because of the fear of side 
      effects such as cancer, thrombophlebitis, and frigidity. Other negative factors
      are opposition of partner, religious views, inconvenience of daily intake,
      negative reports from the press, discussion by family physician, and anxiety
      about complications in the offspring. Psychological and psychosomatic side
      effects very from 1% to 56%. Most are psychovegetative symptoms: headache,
      sweating, heart disorders, gastrointestinal tract (GI) disorders, nausea, and
      sleep disturbance. Psychological symptoms include increased irritability,
      impulsiveness, affective lability, anxiety, depressive feelings, reduced libido, 
      and sexual disorders. Unconscious and ambivalent feelings about wanting a child
      and problems with the partner can result in forgetting to take the pill.
      Inhibitions, shame, guilt, and repressed feelings about sexuality lead to a sense
      of victimization in the form of pregnancy. The Catholic Church holds the view
      that contraception and abortion are unnatural as enunciated in a 1968 encyclical 
      on human life. Conflicts with the partner can be resolved by compromise and by
      medical counseling of both parties. True psychopathological disorders have to be 
      distinguished from the psychological problems of healthy people. The soundness of
      the physician-patient relationship is essential for contraceptive counseling and 
      for resolving such conflicts.

TI  - A review of epidemiological studies of sudden infant death syndrome in southern
      New Zealand.
PG  - 344-8
AB  - The rate of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Southern New Zealand has been 
      very high with an apparent real increase in incidence from the early 1970s.
      Recent research is reviewed and the results of specific interventions aimed at
      preventing SIDS summarized. The intervention consisted of strongly advising new
      parents that their babies sleep on their back or side and that they avoid
      over-heating, especially during infections. For the Otago area, child-care
      practice has been documented and prone sleeping of 1 month old babies has
      declined from 41.8% in 1986 to 2.4% in 1989-90. There is also evidence that
      parental control of infants' thermal environment has improved, maternal smoking
      during pregnancy has slightly decreased and the number of babies breast fed at 1 
      month of age has increased by 11%. In Southern NZ there has been a decline in
      post-neonatal SIDS mortality from 6.3 deaths per 1000 live births 1979-84 to 1.3 
      per 1000 live births in 1990. There are grounds for supposing that the
      intervention has been causative of this change, a possibility being addressed by 
      on-going studies.

TI  - Circadian myometrial and endocrine rhythms in the pregnant rhesus macaque:
      effects of constant light and timed melatonin infusion.
PG  - 1777-84
AB  - Six chronically catheterized rhesus macaques maintained on a 12-hour-light/dark
      cycle (lights on from 7 AM to 7 PM) showed a nocturnal uterine activity rhythm
      with peak contractile events between 9 and 11 PM (p less than 0.05). In blood
      samples collected at 3-hour intervals over a 24-hour period, we determined that
      plasma melatonin and progesterone concentrations were elevated at night whereas
      estradiol, estrone, and cortisol reached peak concentrations in the early morning
      (p less than 0.05). Lights were then left on for the remainder of the study.
      After 12 days in constant light, daily rhythms in uterine activity and plasma
      steroid levels were relatively unchanged, whereas melatonin concentrations were
      suppressed. Animals then received a timed infusion of melatonin (0.2 mg/kg/hr
      each day from 7 PM to 6 AM daily until delivery). The nocturnal uterine activity 
      rhythm and the rhythms in plasma steroid concentrations were maintained. We
      conclude that the 24-hour patterns in maternal uterine activity and plasma
      steroid hormone levels are circadian rhythms generated by an endogenous biologic 
      clock and do not appear to be driven by the pattern of melatonin in circulation.

TI  - The development of ultradian and circadian rhythms in premature babies maintained
      in constant conditions.
PG  - 33-52
AB  - Twenty very premature babies, born at 24-29 weeks gestation, have been studied
      while they were maintained in intensive care with continuous intravenous feeding 
      and constant ambient lighting and temperature. Hourly records of insulated skin
      temperature and heart rate were made for a continuous period of 6-17 weeks,
      always starting the recording within 24 h of birth. The development of rhythms
      within the ultradian, circadian and infradian domains was sought by methods
      including maximum entropy spectral analysis and autocorrelation. Circadian and
      ultradian rhythms were present, but not regularly so; rather they appeared and
      disappeared erratically in successive weeks. As a consequence, the group as a
      whole did not show an increasing rhythmicity with chronological age. In some
      cases, babies were later placed in a ward in which the lighting was dimmed at
      night, and feeding by mouth at regular intervals was instituted. There was some
      evidence for increases in circadian and ultradian rhythmicity after these
      changes. These results enable inferences to be drawn as to the origin of fetal
      rhythms in the third trimester of pregnancy, as well as speculation to be made on
      the ontogeny of ultradian and circadian rhythms in the neonate.

TI  - Circadian changes in salivary constituents and conductivity in women and men.
PG  - 125-40
AB  - Circadian rhythms in salivary [glucose], [Na+], [K+] and conductivity were
      measured in 2 age groups of men (men A, 20-45 years and men B, 46-60 years) and 8
      different states of fertility in women (normally menstruating, taking oral
      contraceptives, pregnant, lactational amenorrhea, lactational amenorrhea and
      taking oral contraceptives, lactating and menstruating, menopausal, and
      post-menopausal). Unstimulated whole saliva (2-3 ml) was collected every 3 h over
      a 48 h span. Analysis of Spearman Rank Correlations indicated significant
      circadian rhythms (significant positive coefficients) for all groups of [Na+]
      (mean = 0.577 +/- 0.040) and conductivity (mean = 0.410 +/- 0.050). There was no 
      evidence of differences in prominence of rhythm across groups for [Na+] and
      conductivity. [K+] showed less evidence of rhythms and much greater variability
      between groups (mean correlation coefficient = 0.198 +/- 0.055). Rhythms in
      [glucose] (mean correlation coefficient = 0.409 +/- 0.051) were evident in all
      groups except men B (0.016), menopausal women (0.151) and post-menopausal women
      (0.310). Model analysis of the data showed no discernible rhythmic trend with age
      for either conductivity, [Na+] or [K+], where any differences were explainable by
      the group characteristics. The rhythm in [glucose] showed a significant weakening
      with age over all groups (F-ratio = 7.46**), and was different between men A and 
      men B (F-ratio = 6.95**). It was concluded that circadian rhythms were present in
      whole unstimulated saliva for conductivity and [Na+] and that these rhythms were 
      independent of reproductive state, whereas circadian rhythms in [K+] were
      dependent on reproductive state. Circadian rhythms for [glucose] were dependent
      on age. The loss of a rhythm in [glucose] with age indicates that glucose, Na+
      and K+ are not linked in their entry into saliva. The influence of entry and
      reabsorption on the final concentrations of glucose, Na+ and K+ in saliva is
      discussed.

TI  - Temporal structuring of delivery in the absence of a photoperiod: preparturient
      myometrial activity of the rhesus monkey is related to maternal body temperature 
      and depends on the maternal circadian system.
PG  - 617-25
AB  - No convincing evidence exists that the shift from myometrial contractures to
      contractions, which determines the synchronized 24-h rhythm in the dynamics of
      the primate uterus, may be attributed to an endogenous circadian rhythm. We
      therefore wished to ascertain whether a 24-h periodic shift would also occur in
      the myometrial activity of animals kept under constant conditions. We studied
      five pregnant rhesus monkeys, kept in continuous darkness from 56-77 days
      gestational age until delivery at 117-167 days gestational age. During the last
      week before delivery we determined the individual phase, level, and amplitude of 
      circadian changes in maternal body temperature and 24-h myometrial activity
      patterns in the form of contractions. In all five monkeys, a rhythm with a period
      of 24-h characterized the temporal incidence of preparturient contraction
      activity. A consistent phase lag of 6-7 h from the temperature crest was observed
      in four out of the five animals. The circadian phase of all individual rhythms
      was idiosyncratic among animals. We conclude that endogenous rhythms in body
      temperature and preparturient myometrial activity are truly circadian. In
      addition, these rhythms are either interdependent or subject to the same maternal
      timekeeping mechanism, supporting the hypothesis that the exact time of the day
      at which birth occurs in the rhesus monkey depends on the maternal circadian
      system.

TI  - [Pain in the fetus: neurobiological, psychophysiological and behavioral
      aspects.].
PG  - 122-30
AB  - Until a short time ago, the view prevailed worldwide that children were less
      sensitive to pain than adults, and such operations as circumcision were performed
      in babies without adequate anesthesia or analgesia. This view is now considered a
      misconception, as psychophysiological and behavioral studies show that even
      neonates have a well-functioning nociceptive system. Nociception generally refers
      to the neural and sensory aspects of pain, which do not necessarily include
      conscious experience. There is no discontinuity in the development of the nervous
      system during birth, and therefore it can be concluded that the fetus is also
      responsive to noxious stimuli. The question arises as to the stage of ontogeny of
      the human at which nociceptive behavior begins. Literature on the fetal nervous
      system reveals that the first signs of somatosensory system function occur at
      week 7 of gestation and at week 22 the synaptic connection from the nervous
      periphery to the somatosensory cortex is becoming established. During this
      period, motor behavior matures, from stereotyped reflexes to spontaneously
      generated complex motor patterns reminiscent of the repertory of voluntary
      movement. From week 22 onward the electroencephalogram (EEG) shows increasingly
      more varied patterns, and sleep-wake states can be discerned after week 30 of
      gestation. Somatosensory evoked cortial potentials have been recorded from
      gestational week 28 onward. Substance P, a neuropeptide associated with pain in
      the adult nervous system, is present in the fetal spinal cord as early as week 12
      of gestation, while the antinociceptive opioid peptide enkephalin does not appear
      until week 24. From week 15 onward, opioid peptides such as beta-endorphin appear
      in the pituitary; their release becomes sensitive to environmental stimuli from
      about week 20 onward, which can be considered the onset of pituitary stress
      responses. In particular, parturition and abortion induced the release of opioid 
      peptides. Studies of conditioned behavior show that the fetus has the ability to 
      learn. It has been hypothesized that the fetus and neonate possess a procedural
      memory, which is not transferred to the language-based memory of later phases of 
      life. Learning and memory are the most essential elements for the construct of
      "consciousness." Therefore, a primitive type or level of consciousness might
      exist in the fetus. Thus, a considerable range of sensorimotor function,
      including memory, develops during fetal life. Anatomical, physiological and
      behavioral data suggest that the nociceptive system is included in this
      development. Although we cannot be sure at present whether the fetus consciously 
      experiences pain, beyond the protective nociceptive behavioral responses,
      anesthesia should be used for invasive procedures to protect the fetus and its
      nervous systems.

TI  - [Nyctohemeral changes of blood pressure. Diagnostic and prognostic value].
PG  - 11-5
AB  - The blood pressure shows circadian variation in normal subjects with higher
      diurnal than nocturnal values: the difference between day and night time blood
      pressure is about 10-20 mmHg for systolic and for diastolic blood pressure. These
      variations are mainly related to physical and/or psychosensorial stress: the
      physician is himself a cause of increased blood pressure (the "white coat"
      effect). The degree of the nocturnal decrease in blood pressure which is maximal 
      2 and 3 o'clock is related to the quality and depth of sleep. The nocturnal
      decrease is followed by an increase in blood pressure when the person wakes up
      (early morning peak). Diagnostic signs: a physiological inversion of the
      circadian rhythm may be observed in people who sleep during the daytime and work 
      at night. There would seem to be less of a nocturnal fall in black persons in the
      United States. Some pathological conditions can inverse or at least disturb the
      ciacadian variation: apart from hypertension, this has been reported in autonomic
      nervous system disease, in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy in some elderly
      patients, in Cushing's syndrome, after cardiac transplantation, etc... In
      hypertensives, the lack of nocturnal decrease of the blood pressure or an
      inversion in circadian rhythm should be looked for in severe and secondary
      hypertension such as associated with pheochromocytoma, or in renal dialysis
      patients. In toxaemia of pregnancy, this abnormality may herald an eclamptic
      crisis. Prognostic signs: in normotensives (especially in black persons) and
      hypertensives, inversion of the circadian rhythm is associated with more severe
      left ventricular hypertrophy and a higher morbidity.

TI  - Fetal rest-activity cycles and chronic exposure to antiepileptic drugs.
PG  - 722-8
AB  - Rest-activity patterns were studied in fetuses exposed to antiepileptic drugs
      (AEDs) and in control fetuses at three intervals during pregnancy: 20, 32, and 38
      weeks. At 20 weeks, periods of rest and activity were distinguished on the basis 
      of fetal motility. Trunk, head, and arm movements were totaled. Periods of
      absence of movements for greater than 3 min were found in 20 of 31 recordings
      from AED-exposed fetuses compared with 11 of 20 recordings from controls (p
      greater than 0.05). The duration of these periods of inactivity did not differ
      significantly between the two groups. At 32 and 38 weeks, information on fetal
      motility and fetal heart rate (FHR) were combined to recognize rest-activity
      patterns according to the fetal behavioral state concept. At 32 weeks, three true
      fetal behavioral states were found for the study group, while there were none in 
      the control group. Coincidence 1F through 4F occurred significantly less
      frequently at 32 weeks than at 38 weeks, regardless of whether fetuses were
      AED-exposed or not: 59% vs. 82% for the study group and 59% vs. 80% for the
      controls. At 38 weeks, true fetal behavioral states appeared in 20 of 34 fetuses 
      exposed to AEDs and in 17 of 35 controls (p greater than 0.05). The sequence in
      which parameters changed within state transitions was found to follow the same
      preferred pattern in both groups. For transitions from behavioral state 1F (quiet
      sleep) into 2F (active sleep) the FHR pattern changed significantly earlier than 
      fetal body or eye movements, while for the reverse transitions the FHR pattern
      changed significantly later (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Circadian rhythms of heart rate and mean arterial pressure in chronically
      instrumented pregnant rats.
PG  - 758-63
AB  - With the use of a chronic preparation to directly monitor blood pressure and
      heart rate in pregnant rats, continuous data were obtained over the last half of 
      gestation in normotensive rats. Over this time span, the animals showed
      significant decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate. Heart rate
      exhibited marked and consistent circadian rhythmicity with peaks occurring near
      the midportion of the dark phase of the 24-hour cycle. Blood pressure rhythms
      were less prominent and peaked later. The trends observed in blood pressure and
      heart rate over gestation suggest that the pregnant rat is a useful model for
      studying the cardiovascular effects of pregnancy.

TI  - Computerized analysis of episodic changes in fetal heart rate variation in early 
      labor.
PG  - 618-24
AB  - Fetal heart rate variation in early labor was measured by computerized analysis
      in cyclic episodes of low or high variation in 136 women at 37 to 42 weeks'
      gestation. The amplitude (mean +/- SE) in episodes of low variation was 20.6 +/- 
      0.4 milliseconds; in high variation it was 57.3 +/- 1.1 milliseconds. The
      duration (mean +/- SE) of low episodes (24.3 +/- 1.3 minutes) was less than that 
      of high episodes (45.1 +/- 2.7 minutes) but was sometimes greater than 1 hour. In
      episodes of low variation the amplitude was less than 5 beats/min long term in
      11% and less than 2.5 milliseconds (pulse intervals) short term in 8%; these
      measures would be predictive of intrauterine death if persistent before birth. We
      conclude that the use of decreased fetal heart rate variation as a diagnostic
      sign of acute fetal hypoxemia in labor is incorrect, because changes of this size
      occur randomly as a consequence of fetal sleep states. There was no significant
      correlation between fetal heart rate variation over the last hour of labor and
      umbilical arterial base deficit on delivery.

TI  - Preterm birth in lambs: sleep patterns and cardio-respiratory changes.
PG  - 139-45
AB  - Cardio-respiratory physiology in sleep was examined in eight preterm lambs born
      at 133-135 (134 +/- 1, mean SEM) days of gestation after 3-5 days of pulsatile
      ACTH/TRH infusion, and contrasted with eight lambs born at term (147 +/- 1 days).
      Lambs were instrumented with electrodes for recording electrocorticogram,
      electro-oculogram and nuchal electromyogram to define behavioural states, as well
      as carotid arterial catheters for determination of arterial pressure, heart rate 
      and arterial blood gases. Compared to full-term lambs, the preterm lambs
      exhibited extended active sleep times, elevated PaCO2 and faster heart rate in
      all behavioural states than full-term lambs; with increasing postnatal age, sleep
      times and heart rate declined. As similar differences are found in preterm human 
      infants, the preterm lamb will be a useful model to study the underlying
      physiology of these cardio-respiratory alterations.

TI  - Fatigue in early pregnancy. An exploratory study.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - The experience of fatigue in early pregnancy was studied, using a general model
      of fatigue as the conceptual framework. A convenience sample of 30 women, age
      20-35 years, who were at less than 20 weeks' gestation and without health
      problems were included in the study. Physiologic, psychological, and
      environmental factors were measured and related to the occurrence and intensity
      of fatigue. Pearson correlations and content analysis were used to analyze the
      data. Results showed that a large portion of the sample (90%) experienced fatigue
      and that this fatigue had a significant impact on their ability to maintain
      personal and social activities. Significant correlations were observed between
      fatigue and the physiologic variables of nausea and feeling tired upon awakening 
      from sleep. There was no significant relationship between fatigue and
      environmental variables such as number of hours worked or the number of children 
      living in the home. In addition, significant correlations were observed between
      fatigue and psychological variables that included depression, anger, anxiety, and
      confusion. These data suggest that fatigue is a significant problem for pregnant 
      women and is not relieved by rest. These data further suggest that the fatigue
      may be related to other physiologic changes, perhaps hormonal, that mediate
      physiologic and psychological variables, including fatigue.

TI  - [Ontogeny of behavioral patterns in relation to the concurrent development of
      central nervous system function, focusing on REM sleep, NREM sleep and waking
      states in the human fetus].
PG  - 843-52
AB  - Behavior is considered a one to one match between the manifestation of a
      particular individual motor activity (movement) and its correlated brain
      function. Each motor activity can be seen to run on its own developmental course 
      with advance in gestation, while various movements also develop in concurrence
      with one another during intrauterine life, gradually integrating into complex and
      accommodated movements. I emphasized the present study, under real-time
      ultrasound observation, for investigating whether or not three states: REM (rapid
      eye movement) sleep, NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep and the waking state
      actually exist in utero, and if so, when the development of these states begins. 
      1. Examined for 30-40 minutes were 21 fetuses, including 10 from 33 to 36 weeks
      of gestation and 11 from 37 to 41 weeks of gestation. As parameters, the duration
      of each eye movement unit and the cumulative duration of this movement, from the 
      shortest to a given duration, per individual case, were observed. A scattergram
      of cumulative duration vs, given duration obtained from all cases, for each
      age-group, were analyzed using "piecewise linear regression". Critical points
      were noted, with statistical significance, at 0.62 second for the earlier group
      and at 0.76 second for the later group. These findings reveal two different types
      of eye movement: rapid and slow eye movements. The fact that the rapid eye
      movement coexists with the slow eye movement during REM period indicates that REM
      sleep exists in utero at the latest at 33 weeks of gestation. 2. Observed for 60 
      minutes were 26 fetuses from 28 to 41 weeks of gestation. Regular mouthing
      movement every 300 to 600 msec concurred significantly only with the NREM period 
      from 35 weeks of gestation onwards. Random mouthing movements were observed
      predominantly during REM sleep and were unrelated to the advance in gestational
      age. This concurrence between the NREM period and regular mouthing indicates the 
      existence of NREM sleep in utero at this age of gestation. 3. To evaluate whether
      the waking state is present, 10 fetuses at 36 weeks or more of gestation were
      examined for a concurrence between miosis/mydriasis and the REM/NREM periods.
      Using pupil diameter as a parameter, miosis and mydriasis were distinguished from
      each other, statistically, by means of "least median of squares regression".
      Accordingly, the NREM period was occupied only by miosis (41.0% of total
      observation period), while the REM period was divided into two conditions: 52.6% 
      with miosis and 6.4% with mydriasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - The effects of lung distension, oxygenation, and gestational age on fetal
      behavior and breathing movements in sheep.
PG  - 193-201
AB  - Lung distension with 100% O2 at a continuous positive airway pressure of 30 cm
      H2O may induce continuous fetal breathing movements (FBM) in sheep. The
      objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the relative roles of lung
      distension and oxygenation and 2) to test the hypothesis that FBM can be induced 
      during labor, when normally they are greatly reduced or absent. We studied 13
      chronically instrumented, unanesthetized fetal sheep between 128 and 144 d of
      gestation (term = 147 +/- 2 d). Each fetus was instrumented to record sleep
      states, diaphragm electromyogram, blood pressure, arterial pH, and blood gas
      tensions. The fetal lungs were distended via an in situ endotracheal tube with
      four different concentrations of O2 (0, 21, 50 and 100%) at a continuous positive
      airway pressure of 10, 20 and 30 cm H2O in a randomized order. No change in any
      recorded physiologic variable was observed at 129 +/- 1 or 132 +/- 1 d of
      gestation. At 135 +/- 1 and 138 +/- 1 d, in response to a continuous positive
      airway pressure of 30 cm H2O and 100% O2, pH decreased (p = 0.0004 and 0.005,
      respectively) and arterial O2 tension increased (p = 0.004 and 0.02,
      respectively). However, increases in 1) breathing time, 2) breathing
      time/low-voltage electrocortical activity ratio, 3) duration of arousal, and 4)
      length of single breathing epochs were observed only at 138 +/- 1 d. Lung
      distension with N2 resulted in a decrease in FBM. Six fetuses were studied during
      labor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Characterization of electroencephalographic state in fetal baboons.
PG  - R496-500
AB  - Long-term recordings of the electroencephalograms (EEGs) from the non-human fetal
      primate have been visually scored for state. Data were obtained from three
      fetuses using recently developed techniques for chronic instrumentation of the
      pregnant baboon. Seven days or more after surgery, nine chart records of 4-5 h in
      duration were analyzed. These records were made during an interval in gestation
      from 143 to 153 days (term = 175 to 185 days). Criteria for differentiation of
      EEG state were based on the presence (state 1) or absence (state 2) of trace
      alternant, which is the predominant characteristic of EEG activity during quiet
      sleep in human preterm and term infants. Two patterns of EEG activity were
      readily distinguished at both standard (30 mm/s) and compressed (30 mm/min) EEG
      chart speeds. On a minute-by-minute basis, there was an overall concurrence of
      82.9% for EEG state when scored from compressed and standard EEG records. From
      the compressed records, state 1 was present on average 38.3% of the time, with a 
      mean epoch duration of 15.1 min, while epochs of state 2 averaged 25.9 min. We
      conclude that at least two EEG states are present at this gestation in the fetal 
      baboon. These two states can be reliably defined visually by scoring methods
      directly comparable to those used for EEG recognition of sleep states in the
      human newborn infant. To validate the conclusion that these fetal state
      assignments based on patterns of EEG activity correspond to sleep states, it will
      be necessary to determine if the oscillations of other physiological parameters
      are coherent with these patterns.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea during pregnancy. Therapy and implications for fetal
      health.
PG  - 461-3
AB  - A 32 yr-old woman in her last trimester of pregnancy was found to have severe
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The overnight polysomnogram demonstrated an apnea 
      plus hypopnea index of 159 events per hour. Apneas were associated with severe
      oxygen desaturation to 40% during rapid eye movement sleep, maternal bradycardia,
      and second degree heart block. External cardiotocography showed normal fetal
      heart rate reactivity to fetal movements, even during the apneas and episodes of 
      oxygen desaturation. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure at a level of 15
      cm H2O effectively treated the apneas and desaturation and had no effect on the
      fetal heart rate. The patient was induced electively during the 39th wk of

PG  - 17-21
AB  - Relationship between blood flow velocity waveform and fetal behavioral states was
      studied in 16 normal pregnancies at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation. The peak flow
      velocity has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction during active
      sleep, as against that in quite sleep. These data reflect reduced ductal flow and
      suggest a redistribution in the left-ventricular and right-ventricular output in 
      favor of the left side of the heart during active sleep. In a prospective
      cross-sectional study of 49 pregnancies (50 fetuses) between 25th and 38th weeks 
      an exponential increase in breathing-related ductal blood flow velocity
      modulation was observed with advancing gestational age, reflecting the developing
      pulmonary vascular bed. Fetal ductal flow velocity waveforms were also recorded
      in 13 cases of prolonged severe oligohydramnios after membrane rupture before 28 
      weeks' gestation. Normal ductal blood flow velocity modulation values were
      associated with normal neonatal lung performance, whereas reduced blood flow
      velocity modulation values were associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. Fetal
      breathing-related ductal flow velocity modulation appears to be a promising
      predictor of neonatal lung performance.

TI  - Automated analysis of near-term antepartum fetal heart rate in relation to fetal 
      behavioral states: the Sonicaid System 8000.
PG  - 57-65
AB  - Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded in 16 uncomplicated near-term 
      pregnancies. The recordings were used to evaluate a system for automated fetal
      heart rate analysis (Sonicaid System 8000). Fetal rest-activity patterns were
      considered in the analysis. The mean duration of C2F periods "active sleep," 33
      minutes) was significantly greater than that of C1F periods ("quiet sleep," 19
      minutes) (p less than 0.001). The incidence of accelerations and decelerations
      and the overall fetal heart rate variations were greater during C2F than during
      C1F (p less than 0.001). In 11 of 16 C1F periods, the system classified the fetal
      heart rate variation as "questionable" or "abnormal." Episodes of high variation 
      were identified in only 3 of 16 C1F periods, but they were found in all 18 C2F
      periods. Episodes of low variation were identified in 14 of the 16 C1F periods
      but were not found in any C2F periods. During C2F periods, the system's criteria 
      of normality were met in all cases but one; they were not met during any of the
      C1F periods. Thus the diagnosis of fetal distress should not be based merely on
      the absence of accelerations, low fetal heart rate variation, or absence of
      episodes of high variation in recordings with a duration of less than 45 minutes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if a skeletal photoperiod
      administered at the appropriate time of a 24-h day could stimulate prolactin and 
      somatotropin release in dairy cattle. Cows in mo 8 of gestation were exposed to
      either 12 to 13 h of continuous light or to three skeletal photoperiods
      consisting of a total of 8 h of light. Cows in the skeletal photoperiod light
      regimens received 6 h of light from 0500 to 1100 h and a 2-h light pulse at
      either 1500 to 1700 h, 1800 to 2000 h, or 2100 to 2300 h. Cows exposed to the
      light regimen pulse at 1800 to 2000 h exhibited a circadian rhythm of prolactin
      and somatotropin release. The mean prolactin and somatotropin concentrations were
      also higher in this treatment. It is concluded that a circadian rhythm with a
      photosensitive phase is present for prolactin and somatotropin release in the
      lactating dairy cow. The photosensitive phase for both hormones occurs between 13
      and 15 h after subjective dawn. The expression of the circadian rhythm of these
      hormones depends on the photoperiod to which cows are exposed.

TI  - Fetal behavioural states and hypertensive pregnancy.
PG  - 163-5
AB  - Delay in fetal maturation in diabetic and accelerated fetal maturation in
      hypertensive pregnancies have been reported in the past. The spontaneous activity
      of fetal nervous system during pregnancy was followed longitudinally in a group
      of 29 normal pregnancies from 28 x th to 40 x th week of gestation by means of
      fetal behavioural states determination. 1 F state (quiet sleep) progressively
      increases from median values of 5.0% to values of 22.5-25% at term of pregnancy. 
      This state represents the positive activity of inhibitory centers has been
      related to a positive evolutionary process of brain maturation according to
      preceding experiences conducted on experimental models and preterm babies
      followed with EEG and direct observation in the early neonatal period. The method
      of behavioural states determination has been applied to a group of 33 gestational
      diabetes (GDM) pregnant women followed longitudinally, and a clear reduction of
      development of 1 F state has been evidentiated, with significant differences (p
      less than 0.001) at 35-36 weeks of gestation versus the control group. The normal
      values are reached in concomitance with L/S value of maturity. In 30 pregnant
      women affected by gestational hypertension (GH) different result are obtained: 1 
      F state seems to develop earlier, and is increased (p less than 0.001) around
      30-32 weeks versus the control group if a fetal growth reduction is present. The 
      value of 1 F behavioural state in the evaluation of fetal condition of
      pathological pregnancies is discussed.

AB  - Pregnant dams were subjected to REM sleep deprivation during different stages of 
      pregnancy. Pups were reared by their biological mothers and tested as adults for 
      susceptibility to PTZ-induced convulsions, and ambulation and defecation in an
      open-field arena. Adrenal weights were taken at this time. Those animals whose
      mothers had been stressed during the first trimester showed a reduction in
      ambulatory behavior measured in the open field, and a reduction in adrenal weight
      after open-field exposure. Subjects exposed to prenatal stress (PNS) during the
      2nd trimester showed an increased susceptibility to PTZ-induced clonic
      convulsions, and a reduction in adrenal weight after PTZ administration and
      open-field exposure. Finally, subjects exposed to PNS during the third trimester 
      showed a reduction in susceptibility to PTZ compared with 2nd week PNS pups. The 
      results showed different patterns of prenatal stress-induced behavioral and
      physiological changes, depending on the developmental stage in which the stress
      was applied.

TI  - Do beta-adrenergic blockade and sleep state affect cardiorespiratory control in
      neonatal lambs? Multivariate autoregressive modeling approach.
PG  - 272-7
AB  - Beta-Blockers are used in pregnancy-associated hypertension and in postnatal
      cardiac arrhythmias, and the neonate may get them in breast milk. We therefore
      studied the effects of beta-adrenergic medication on interrelations between heart
      rate (HR), respiration, and arterial blood pressure (aBP) in newborn lambs. The
      influence of sleep state on these cardiorespiratory interrelations was also
      examined. HR, aBP, and respiration (based on transthoracic electrical impedance) 
      were recorded and the sleep state was visually documented in five healthy
      chronically instrumented newborn lambs before the age of 30 d. Propranolol was
      given (1 mg/kg). Two-min stationary segments of the three signals were analyzed
      using a multivariate autoregressive model, which yields oscillations of the
      signals and intersignal relationships as source contributions. The variabilities 
      of aBP and HR were greatest at the low frequencies (less than 0.25 Hz) and so
      were their intersignal relationships (including baroreflex). The respiratory
      variability was greatest at the frequencies corresponding to the respiratory
      rate. During quiet sleep, the variabilities in HR, aBP, and respiration were
      lowest. The impact of respiratory oscillations on other signals increased but the
      impact of aBP variability decreased during quiet sleep. beta-Blockade and sleep
      state affected separately the cardiovascular and respiratory variables and their 
      interrelations. beta-Blockade reduced HR and increased pulse pressure. The
      overall heart rate variability and the respiratory low-frequency contribution to 
      heart rate variability decreased due to the beta-blockade. We postulate that the 
      beta-adrenergic system is an important regulator of HR and HR variability in
      neonatal lambs and also of the low-frequency components of the respiratory sinus 
      arrhythmia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Ovarian morphology, endocrine function and intra-follicular blood flow during the
      peri-ovulatory period.
PG  - 319-24
AB  - Transvaginal ultrasonography with colour flow mapping has been used to study
      changes in intra-follicular morphology and blood flow during a peri-ovulatory
      period in one volunteer. Aspects of uterine morphology and blood flow were also
      recorded. The intervals from a defined luteinizing hormone (LH) rise and peak to 
      the mean time of follicular rupture were 37.5 and 17.5 h, respectively. Blood
      flow velocity waveforms were observed clearly at the time of the LH rise and
      blood vessels were visible when the hormone level reached a peak. Concurrently,
      the wall of the follicle became less clear, crenated, thicker and more echogenic.
      A structure resembling the detached cumulus and oocyte was seen before the
      follicle had ruptured. Peak systolic blood velocity was highest immediately after
      ovulation had occurred. Blood flow impedance in the uterine arteries suggested
      the presence of a circadian rhythm, but no pronounced daily changes were observed
      over the study period. In contrast, flow velocity waveforms were clearly visible 
      in the endometrium around the time of ovulation. These preliminary data suggest
      that intra-follicular vascularization or angiogenesis may be critical processes
      that might be used to predict ovulation and could possibly be modified to help
      achieve or avoid a pregnancy.

AB  - A typical diurnal variation in blood pressure is observed in patients with
      essential hypertension. Attenuation or lack of circadian periodicity might be
      expected in patients with secondary hypertension. Therefore, non invasive
      ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring was performed in 172 patients with secondary
      hypertension and in 201 patients with essential hypertension. The following
      patients with secondary hypertension were investigated: renoparenchymatous
      nephropathy (n = 29), diabetic nephropathy (n = 24), morbus Conn (n = 6), renal
      artery stenosis (n = 32), pheochromocytoma (n = 5), hemodialysis patients (n =
      30), and patients after kidney transplantation (n = 44). In addition, 36 pregnant
      women (17 normotensives, 19 hypertensives) were studied. 98.5% of patients with
      essential hypertension showed a nightly decline in blood pressure of at least 15 
      mmHg (systolic + diastolic), whereas 70% of patients with secondary hypertension 
      showed either an attenuated circadian rhythm or no circadian rhythm. Patients
      with pheochromocytoma who had a nighttime increase in blood pressure demonstrated
      the greatest difference in the essential hypertension collective, followed by
      patients with diabetic nephropathy and patients after kidney transplantation.
      After successful treatment of the condition leading to hypertension, circadian
      periodicity returned in some patients. In summary, these results suggest that the
      absence of a nighttime decline in blood pressure during 24-h-ambulatory
      monitoring is an indication of secondary hypertension, which should be further
      investigated. As a practical consequence, antihypertensive drugs should also be
      applied in an evening dose in secondary hypertensives. Noninvasive ambulatory
      blood-pressure monitoring is recommended for treatment control, especially in
      patients who need an efficient blood-pressure control.

TI  - Maturational sequence of fetal breathing movements.
PG  - 36-40
AB  - The inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured in REM and NREM 
      periods, respectively, and their changes with advancing gestational age were
      investigated. Ten women without complications in their 20th to 40th week of
      pregnancy were examined. Fetal breathing movements and REM were observed
      simultaneously using ultrasonography. REM and NREM periods were selected for
      analyzing breathing movements separate from the whole examination period. The
      inspiratory times of fetal breathing movements were measured with the hand-held
      pressure transducer. The changes in inspiratory time with fetal age showed the
      same pattern both in REM and NREM periods. There were no significant changes in
      inspiratory time before 28 weeks gestational age. After that, the inspiratory
      time lengthened, showing the maximum at 32-35 weeks and then shortened at 36-40
      weeks gestational age. There were no differences of the inspiratory time between 
      REM and NREM periods before 32 weeks. After 32 weeks, the inspiratory time in the
      NREM period was longer than in the REM period. These changes in fetal breathing
      movements are thought to be caused by the morphological maturation of the fetal
      lung and the functional development of respiratory and sleep center of the fetal 
      central nervous system.

TI  - REM sleep determined using in utero penile tumescence in the human fetus at term.
PG  - 30-5
AB  - To assess how REM/NREM periods can be linked to the determination of the REM/NREM
      sleep and/or awake state, we have investigated the relationship between the
      REM/NREM periods and penile tumescence in the human fetus. This study was made on
      11 male fetuses from 36 to 41 weeks of gestation. Eye movement and penile
      tumescence were simultaneously examined with an observation window of 60 min,
      using two separate real-time ultrasound systems. The mean percentage of the total
      duration of penile tumescence during the REM period and that during the NREM
      period was 77.7 and 15.8%, respectively. In all cases, the total duration of
      penile tumescence during the REM period against REM duration was greater than the
      duration of tumescence during the NREM period against NREM duration with
      statistical significance. This indicates that the fetal penile tumescence is
      strongly associated with REM period and the REM period containing penile
      tumescence in the human fetus can be considered equivalent to REM sleep in utero.
      In addition, the finding that there exists a part of the REM period lacking
      penile tumescence suggests the possible origin of the awake state, brought about 
      by advances in fetal development at this stage of gestation.

      Pathophysiology].
PG  - 355-68
AB  - Subject of this review is the pathophysiology of the respiratory distress
      syndrome (RDS), the apnea, and the sudden-death infant syndrome (SIDS). The
      fatality rate of the RDS yet amounts to 24%. Preterm infants are preferably
      involved because of their deficient surfactant synthesis. The lack of surfactant 
      causes atelectases, hyaline membranes, lung oedema, and augmentation of
      respiration work. Only towards the very end of gestation the amount of surfactant
      of the fetal lung increases rapidly so that the normal postnatal respiration is
      guaranteed. RDS produces a pathological circulatory situation with insufficiency 
      of the right heart and congestion. The atrial natriuretic hormone is increased
      about tenfold in the serum of RDS-infants. Modern treatment of the RDS uses
      instillations of exogenous surfactants before the first breath. Apneic attacks
      are observed predominantly during REM-sleep. They seem to have pathological value
      only if they exceed 15 seconds. Infants with recurrent apnoea breathe
      periodically, they were mostly preterm newborns. Probably, the cause of recurrent
      apneic attacks are central regulatory deficits and adenosine may play an
      important pathological role as neurotransmitter. Arrhythmias of the heart
      including the QT-syndrome observed in SIDS-infants at risk may have the same
      central pathophysiological source.

PG  - 130-8
AB  - We studied maternal and fetal blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases
      and fetal behavioral state alterations in response to maternally administered
      cocaine hydrochloride in 11 pregnant sheep. Cocaine administration to the ewe
      caused a dose-dependent increase in maternal blood pressure and heart rate and in
      fetal blood pressure, and a decrease in fetal arterial oxygen tension. In the
      ewe, blood pressure changes corresponded linearly to dose administered (r = 0.88,
      p less than 0.001). Blood pressure changes were correlated to peak plasma cocaine
      concentration in the ewe (r = 0.52, p less than 0.01) and in the fetus (r = 0.43,
      p = 0.05). In addition, in 7 of 8 fetuses which had entered rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep within 5 min of maternal cocaine administration, REM sleep was
      abruptly terminated either by the cocaine, fetal hypoxia or some other
      nonspecific event caused by the maternal cocaine administration. Maternal cocaine
      administration causes maternal and fetal hemodynamic alterations that have
      potential adverse effects in pregnancy.

TI  - Maternal thyroid function in early and late pregnancy.
PG  - 196-202
AB  - Thyroid function was investigated during and after pregnancy in 12 healthy
      euthyroid women. During pregnancy, serum total T4 (TT4) levels were significantly
      elevated and nearly stable, while thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels
      progressively increased till the 7th month. A slight elevation, though not
      significant, of free T4 (fT4) was recorded in early pregnancy. In the following
      months, fT4, free T3 (fT3) and the T4/TBG ratio progressively diminished,
      reaching a plateau at the 7th month. Serum TSH levels, measured by an
      ultrasensitive immunofluorometric assay, were comparable to postpartum values
      during the first trimester and showed a moderate upward trend with the
      progression of pregnancy. The evaluation of 24-hour TSH profiles was performed in
      5 women during the first trimester of pregnancy. In all women, the circadian
      rhythm of TSH was present with a normal nocturnal surge, though anticipated in 1 
      case. In summary (1) during the first trimester of pregnancy, the increased
      thyroid activity does not seem to be only sustained by pituitary TSH which
      remains unmodified; the negative correlation between TSH and hCG levels might
      suggest that hCG also stimulates the gland to increase thyroid hormone output,
      and the presence of a normal TSH circadian rhythm indicates that the central
      mechanism of neuroregulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis is preserved in early 
      pregnancy, and (2) in late pregnancy, a marked decrease in free thyroid hormone
      fractions is accompanied by serum TSH levels still in the normal range,
      indicating a modification of thyroid homeostasis which might recognize various
      etiological factors.

TI  - The effect of seizures on hormones.
PG  - S46-50
AB  - Serum prolactin (HPR) levels are influenced by waking and sleep states, as
      reflected by surges in serum concentrations during daytime naps and nocturnal
      sleep. Other physiological causes of hyperprolactinemia include sexual activity, 
      pregnancy, and lactation. Drugs may stimulate or inhibit HPR secretion.
      Pathological causes for HPR secretion include destructive lesions of the
      hypothalamus, prolactin-secreting neoplasms of the pituitary gland, lesions of
      the spinal cord, and occasionally Parkinson's disease. The most predictable
      postictal changes are increased serum cortisol levels and hyperprolactinemia.
      Serum HPR rises after virtually all generalized tonic-clonic seizures, most
      complex partial seizures, and some simple partial seizures. Absence and myoclonic
      seizures do not affect serum HPR levels. Repeated epileptic seizures and
      electroconvulsive therapy treatments produce successively less marked rises in
      serum HPR. The postictal elevation of serum cortisol has a longer latency than
      for HPR and follows an earlier rise in serum ACTH. Other postictal hormonal
      changes are much more variable. Because of the normal diurnal variation in serum 
      cortisol levels and the relative delay in the postictal elevation of serum
      cortisol, HPR is more useful as a diagnostic measure of epileptic seizures. This 
      application of HPR requires an understanding of other factors that influence
      serum HPR and the use of baseline serum HPR levels for comparison. HPR data must 
      be correlated with behavioral and electroencephalographic events.

TI  - Control of prolactin secretion.
PG  - 1157-67
AB  - 1. Prolactin is a 21,500 Dalton single-chain polypeptide hormone but may occur in
      50 kDa and 150 kDa molecular variants. 2. These large PRL variants may be
      secreted predominantly; this condition is termed "macroprolactinemia". It is
      characterized by high immunological and normal biological serum levels of
      prolactin, and lack of clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. 3. The
      information on PRL is encoded on chromosome 6. Transcription can be enhanced and 
      suppressed by a variety of hormonal factors. 4. PRL is secreted in a pulsatile
      fashion; it displays a circadian rhythm (with a maximum during sleep) and is
      stimulated by some amino acids. PRL also responds to mechanical stimulation of
      the breast. 5. PRL rises during pregnancy, and maintainance of hyperprolactinemia
      (and, thereby, physiological infertility) is dependent on the frequency and
      duration of breast feedings. 6. Hypothalamic regulation of prolactin mainly
      involves tonic inhibition via portal dopamine. The physiological importance of
      various stimulating factors present in the hypothalamus is still incompletely
      understood. In particular, there is still no place for TRH in PRL physiology. 7. 
      PRL is released in response to stress; this response may be mediated by opioids. 
      The low-estrogen, low-gonadotropin amenorrhea of endurance-training women is not 
      mediated by prolactin, however. 8. Estrogens stimulate PRL gene transcription via
      at least two independent mechanisms. There are many clinical examples of this
      estrogen effect on prolactin serum levels, and also on the growth of
      prolactinomas. 9. Mild hyperprolactinemia remains an enigma which cannot
      satisfactorily be resolved by biochemical or radiological testing. The border
      between "normal" and "elevated" prolactin is ill-defined. The possibility of
      macroprolactinemia complicates this matter even further. 10. The number of drugs 
      which suppress prolactin by acting on pituitary D2 receptors, and which are
      useful in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, continues to increase. In the
      field of ergot alkaloids, parenteral application appears to be a logical solution
      to the problem of the high first-pass effect; in addition, this form of treatment
      is frequently better tolerated than the oral route. 11. Prolactinoma development 
      is presently being studied employing molecular biological techniques; the
      question of whether tumorigenesis can be attributed to specific defects of gene
      regulation remains to be answered.

TI  - Outcome of pregnancies experienced during residency.
PG  - 618-22
AB  - To investigate potential adverse effects of residency training on pregnancy
      outcome, a cohort study was conducted among 45 university-affiliated residency
      programs. Outcomes of the first pregnancy experienced during residency were
      compared between 92 female residents and 144 spouses of male residents. Despite
      long hours, sleep deprivation, and an increase in perceived stress, the female
      residents were as likely to give birth to a live, full-term newborn as the
      spouses of male residents. For white cohort members, an increased risk of
      premature labor without delivery was identified (RR = 12.3, 95% confidence
      interval 2.4-61.6). No significant differences were found in prematurity,
      spontaneous and therapeutic abortions, or presence of congenital abnormalities in
      the infants. Method of delivery and use of anesthetics and of other medications
      were similar in both groups. Pregnancy outcomes between the two groups were
      similar; however, the increased risk for premature labor among female residents
      is a cause for concern and should be further investigated.

PG  - 966-9
AB  - Like for other side effects oral contraceptives are often blamed for inducing
      depressive illness. Psychiatric literature and own data permit the following
      statements: 1. OC's do not induce psychiatric symptoms like depression on a
      pharmacological basis. 2. There is no preponderance of psychiatric symptoms
      during pill use. 3. If there is any effect on mood, initiative or affection this 
      is more likely to be mentioned in patients with psychiatric history. 4. The
      indication for oral contraception in neurotic-psychopathic personalities should
      be considered seriously. 5. There is a positive secondary psychotropic effect of 
      OC's via improving acne, bleeding irregularities and dysmenorrhoea.

OAB - Psychotropic effects have been imputed to oral contraceptives (OCs); however,
      studies with large populations found no depressive episodes caused by OCs.
      Affective disorders of women such as premenstrual syndrome and postpartum and
      menopausal depression are well-known. The estrogen and progesterone levels are
      high during pregnancy, when the risk of emotional disease declines. A study on
      Marvelon (containing .15 mg of desogestrel and .03 mg of ethinyl estradiol)
      involving 27,000 women found a history of depression in 3%, but in 90% the
      symptoms disappeared after OC use. Other studies corroborated the finding that
      OCs exerted a stabilizing effect on emotional disorders. The overwhelming
      majority of women without psychiatric anamnesis did not suffer any mood
      fluctuations under OC use. In a study, 4327 women were interviewed at 3 and 6
      months of OC use, and in 45.7% their sense of well-being improved, 30.3% were in 
      a good frame of mind, and 21.2% had a slight deterioration of their sense of
      well-being. Neurotic and introverted persons tended to attribute affective
      disorders, weakness of concentration, sleep disturbances, and the avoidance of
      sex to OCs. With such individuals, OC indication requires particularly strict
      adherence to rules. The ability of Ocs to improve acne was analyzed when 1785
      questionnaires were examined from 1958 women who had used Marvelon. 60% reported 
      improvement of their acne, and 50% of the more severe cases improved.
      Dysmenorrhea and menstrual cycle disorders improved similarly. Body weight
      increase in insignificant with modern OCs. OCs exert a positive psychotropic
      effect through their ability to influence these conditions.

TI  - Variability of arterial blood pressure in normal and hypertensive pregnancy.
PG  - S77-81
AB  - In normal pregnancy the circadian blood pressure rhythm is similar to that in the
      non-pregnant state, with the highest blood pressure values in the morning and the
      lowest at midnight. This rhythm is lost in patients with pre-eclampsia. Women
      with severe pre-eclampsia show a reversed circadian rhythm, with a nocturnal
      increase in blood pressure during the sleeping phase. Although the reasons for
      this nocturnal hypertension in severe pre-eclampsia are poorly understood, the
      results suggest that pre-eclamptic women are endangered by hypertensive
      emergencies, mostly at night. Therefore blood pressure measurement should be
      extended to the night, and antihypertensive treatment must be adapted to the
      demands of a reversed circadian rhythm in relevant subgroups of patients.

TI  - Maternal cocaine addiction. II: An animal model for the study of brainstem
      mechanisms operative in sudden infant death syndrome.
PG  - 231-4
AB  - Respiratory control abnormalities are mechanistic in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
      (SIDS). In particular, arousal form sleep is an important component of
      respiratory regulation. Cocaine alters central neurotransmitter metabolism,
      particularly the monoamines. The locus coeruleus, the major Norepinephrine (NE)
      neuronal system, is involved in arousal from sleep related apnea and has
      extensive forebrain and brainstem projections. Thus, it is plausible that in
      utero cocaine exposure disrupts the normal maturation of transmitters and/or
      brain structures essential to sleep related respiratory regulation. Infants
      exposed to cocaine in utero may have an increased incidence of SIDS. We propose
      that cocaine use in pregnancy alters the normal maturation of centers and/or
      neurotransmitters involved in respiratory regulation thereby altering postnatal
      respiratory control. We hypothesize that the increased incidence of SIDS in
      cocaine exposed infants may be secondary to deficits in arousal. The study of
      prenatal brain development and of postnatal respiratory control in rabbit pups
      exposed to cocaine in utero will provide a useful model for the study of
      mechanisms operative in SIDS.

TI  - [Changes in sleep and night respiration in asthma and obstructive or restrictive 
      lung diseases].
PG  - 1857-61
AB  - Interactions between sleep and respiration have been noticed in several lung
      diseases. In COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) patients, the night
      sleep is delayed or shortened and deep sleep is often reduced or even absent.
      These disturbances are associated with hypoxaemic episodes occurring either in
      light slow wave sleep or in REM sleep, the former being short in duration and
      mild but repetitive and related to ventilatory changes, the latter prolonged,
      often severe, and resulting from both decrease in ventilation and alterations of 
      ventilation-perfusion ratios. Restrictive syndrome due to interstitial pneumonia,
      kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular diseases or, more commonly, to obesity or even
      pregnancy also alter sleep in a non-specific manner. Most of them result in
      hypoxia during paradoxical sleep. Unquestionably, there exists a relationship
      between sleep and asthma (aggravation of dyspnoea at night, reduction of peak
      expiratory flow when awaking, stage 2 asthmatic attacks). This relationship is
      probably caused by multifactorial interactions.

PG  - 483-7
AB  - Alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of alcohol-related birth defects
      (ARBD). To examine this hypothesis, pregnancy outcome and offspring development
      were examined in alcohol-sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) mice and alcohol-resistant
      Short-Sleep (SS) mice following prenatal ethanol exposure. Dams were
      intragastrically intubated twice per day (6 hr apart) with either 4.5 g/kg (20%
      w/v) ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) on days 7 through 18 of
      pregnancy. An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Results
      showed litter mortality at 10 days of age was greater for LS-E litters compared
      to both LS-S and LS-C litters. Litter mortality for SS-E litters did not differ
      from either SS-S or SS-C litters. Maternal weight gain, blood ethanol levels, and
      birth weight deficits were similar for ethanol-exposed LS and SS groups. These
      results suggest genetically based alcohol sensitivity influences the severity of 
      ARBD.

AB  - The relationships between self-reported assessments of acute anxiety and several 
      biochemical and physiological indicators of stress reaction were investigated in 
      pregnant women at term in connection with spinal analgesia for caesarean section.
      Fear and apprehension were statistically significantly associated only with blood
      pressure and with an increase in heart rate from the previous day. The subjective
      estimate of the quality of the preoperative night's sleep was negatively
      associated with biochemical plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of
      sympatho-adrenal activity. The previously reported negative correlation between
      body height and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, an indicator of serotonin
      metabolism) in lumbar CSF was confirmed. The concentration of 5-HIAA in CSF was
      positively correlated with the levels of other acidic monoamine metabolites and
      cortisol in CSF. It is concluded that hormone and monoamine metabolite
      measurements in CSF and plasma have only limited usefulness as quantitative
      indicators of the intensity of preoperative fear and anxiety.

PG  - 1239-42
AB  - In 16 normal pregnancies the relationship between foramen ovale flow velocity
      waveforms and fetal behavioral states at 37 to 38 weeks' gestation was studies
      with Doppler techniques. Foramen ovale flow velocity waveforms are characterized 
      by a typical systolic/diastolic component. Average flow velocity was
      statistically significantly increased in behavioral state 2F (active sleep) as
      compared with state 1F (quiet sleep), which was mainly determined by an increase 
      in flow velocity during the end-systolic and passive atrial filling phase. The
      increase in the average flow velocity at the foramen ovale level during active
      sleep suggests a redistribution of blood flow at the cardiac level, resulting in 
      an increased right-to-left shunt.

TI  - Apneic effects of cholecystokinin in unanaesthetized fetal sheep.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - The effects on breathing movements and sleep state of cholecystokinin octapeptide
      (CCK-8) and its antagonist, proglumide, have been studied in unanaesthetised
      fetal lambs of 124-142 days gestation. CCK-8 when given into a lateral cerebral
      ventricle as bolus injections of 10-500 ng caused dose-related periods of apnea
      ranging from 63-214 min. When given as a 100 ng bolus followed by a 50 ng/h
      infusion for 2 h there was a prolonged period of apnea lasting 331 +/- 56 min.
      There was no effect of CCK-8 when given in higher doses (1-50 micrograms). The
      antagonist proglumide reversed the apnea induced by CCK-8 infusion, but had no
      effect when given alone, nor did it affect the normal fetal depressive response
      to hypoxia. Neither CCK-8 nor proglumide had any effect on electrocortical
      activity. We conclude that CCK has no role in the inhibitory mechanisms causing
      the apnea associated with high voltage electrocortical activity or hypoxia in the
      fetus. Furthermore CCK does not appear to be involved in the regulation of sleep 
      state in the fetal lamb.

TI  - A family study of sleep apnea. Anatomic and physiologic interactions.
PG  - 554-9
AB  - The distribution of symptoms, physiologic responses, and upper airway structure
      in members of one family with three generations of subjects with sleep apnea (SA)
      is reported. Questionnaire data were obtained from ten family members (ages 7 to 
      66 years), overnight sleep studies were performed in nine subjects, and
      ventilatory responses to hyperoxic hypercapnia and to eucapnic hypoxia and
      cephalometry were obtained in five subjects. All ten family members reported
      habitual snoring or nighttime snorting/gasping; five of ten family members also
      reported excessive daytime sleepiness. All studied subjects except for a pregnant
      woman had greater than ten apneas/hypopneas per hour. Ventilatory responses to
      hypoxia were markedly reduced in all five subjects studied (less than or equal to
      0.51 L/min/SaO2); hypercapnic responses were reduced in three of five subjects
      (less than or equal to 0.61 L/min/mm Hg CO2). No subject was morbidly obese (body
      mass index less than 29 kg/m2) or demonstrated retrognathia. The posterior airway
      space was reduced in three subjects, and the mandibular to hyoid distance was
      increased in four subjects. The two subjects with the longest soft palates and
      the most inferiorly displaced hyoids had the most severe sleep disorder. Sleep
      apnea was present, albeit less profound, in the one subject with normal anatomy
      who had an abnormal hypoxic ventilatory response. The distribution of these
      physiologic and anatomic measurements in this family provides further support for
      a genetic basis for SA, and suggests that the disorder may occur as a result of
      interactions between ventilatory control abnormalities and anatomic risk factors.

TI  - [Chronological change of EEG findings in a case of pyridoxine dependency
      seizures].
PG  - 501-6
AB  - A patient of pyridoxine dependent seizures was reported. He was born at 34 weeks'
      gestation and weighted 2,760 g. Apgar scores were 6 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes,
      respectively. He showed the first seizure 2 hours after his birth. Phenobarbital,
      phenytoin, sodium valproate, diazepam and clonazepam were not effective.
      Pyridoxal phosphate (50 mg) was given intravenously, resulting in suppression of 
      convulsions. However, muscle tonus was severely depressed. In EEG, a
      discontinuous pattern was found in quiet and indeterminate sleep on the 2nd day
      of life. At 5th week multifocal spikes were found, and the discontinuous pattern 
      persisted. Ictal discharges at 13th week showed generalized, continuous,
      irregular and high voltage slow waves with multifocal spikes. At 27th week of
      life, high voltage slow waves disappeared and multifocal spike discharges
      decreased. At 2 years and 10 months of age, the patient was suffering from
      athetotic cerebral palsy and severe mental retardation. Pyridoxal phosphate at
      the doses of 35-40 mg/kg/day had been administered. Irritability sometimes
      occurred and additional 50 mg of pyridoxal phosphate controlled this irritability
      effectively.

TI  - Energy conservation during skin-to-skin contact between premature infants and
      their mothers.
PG  - 445-51
AB  - The effects of skin-to-skin contact on three indexes of energy expenditure: heart
      rate, activity level, and behavioral state, were examined in a pilot study. It
      was hypothesized that skin-to-skin contact, because of its soothing effects,
      would increase sleep, lower activity level, and reduce heart rate. Eight healthy 
      preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit, who had reached 34 to 36 weeks
      gestation, experienced one session of skin-to-skin contact for an interfeeding
      interval. Observations were made once each minute using continuous videotape
      throughout three consecutive interfeeding intervals (before, during, and after
      skin-to-skin contact). Significant treatment effects were found by
      repeated-measures analysis of variance for behavioral state and activity level;
      pair-wise comparisons showed that quiet sleep frequency was significantly
      increased and activity level reduced during skin-to-skin contact. Infants had
      longer durations of quiet sleep during skin-to-skin contact. The Pearson
      product-moment correlation between heart rate and behavioral state was robust and
      generally linear, supporting use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure
      in these subjects. The findings suggest that skin-to-skin contact is a simple,
      cost-effective intervention that reduces activity and state-related energy
      expenditure.

TI  - [24-hour blood pressure measurement in normal pregnancy in hypertensive pregnant 
      patients].
PG  - 768-73
AB  - Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed in 17
      normotensive and 19 preeclamptic pregnant women. The normotensive women showed a 
      significant nightly decline in their systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In
      contrast, the preeclamptic women demonstrated either an attenuated circadian
      rhythm or no circadian rhythm at all. This result was even more pronounced in
      patients with severe hypertension, some of whom had a nocturnal increase in blood
      pressure in spite of being treated with antihypertensive drugs in an evening
      dose. The lack of nocturnal blood pressure decrease was also found 24 hours post 
      partum. In summary, these results suggest that preeclamptic women are endangered 
      by hypertensive emergencies mostly during the night. Therefore blood pressure
      controls should be extended into the night, and antihypertensive drugs should
      also be given in a sufficient evening dose.

TI  - Effects of clonidine on breathing movements and electrocortical activity in the
      fetal lamb.
PG  - 661-8
AB  - Clonidine is a recommended antihypertensive for use during pregnancy, although
      little is known of its fetal effects. This study examines the effects of
      clonidine on breathing and sleep-state cycling in fetal lambs. Clonidine was
      infused into a fetal lateral ventricle for up to 24 hours at 128 to 135 days'
      gestation. Control infusions of artificial cerebrospinal fluid had no effect.
      Clonidine infusion significantly reduced the incidence and episode duration of
      fetal breathing for the duration of the infusion period. Cycling of
      electrocortical activity became irregular and rapid, and the incidence of
      high-voltage electrocortical activity (equivalent to quiet sleep) was reduced.
      Fetal heart rate decreased but arterial pressure was unaffected. After infusion
      the breathing incidence and episode duration both increased significantly
      compared with control, with continuous high-amplitude breathing for several
      hours, whereas the incidence of high-voltage electrocortical activity remained
      low. Because lung development is promoted by fetal breathing, long-term use of
      clonidine during pregnancy could slow lung development by reducing fetal
      breathing activity.

TI  - Effects of behavioural states on cardiac output in the healthy human fetus at
      36-38 weeks of gestation.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - Doppler velocity waveforms from atrioventricular valves were recorded in 20
      healthy fetuses at 36--38 weeks of gestation during both behavioural states 1F
      (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep). No significant changes were found in the
      ratios between the velocities during early passive ventricular filling and active
      ventricular filling (E/A ratios) at the level of both mitral and tricuspid valves
      when the measurements obtained during states 1F and 2F were compared. Moreover,
      during state 2F the left ventricular output increased and the right ventricular
      output decreased, resulting in a marked modification of the right to left cardiac
      output ratio. Our data suggest a redistribution of cardiac output in favour of
      the left side of the heart during state 2F.

TI  - Pickles, peptide hormones and pregnancy: a hypothesis.
PG  - 255-9
AB  - In western societies a high frequency of heartburn, nausea and vomiting occur
      during pregnancy. The causes and mechanisms of these clinical symptoms remain
      poorly understood. Evidence suggests steroid hormones modulate gastrointestinal
      transit time and plasma peptide hormones, while peptide hormone modulated food
      intake and preferences. Since diurnal and episodic release of steroid and peptide
      hormones occur, it is postulated that heartburn and other digestive dysfunction
      during pregnancy are associated with elevated steroid and peptide
      (beta-endorphin, NPY) hormone interaction with innate biological rhythms
      controlling the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Diurnal salivary cortisol patterns during pregnancy and after delivery:
      relationship to plasma corticotrophin-releasing-hormone.
PG  - 279-89
AB  - The circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol was studied in 10 healthy women every 4
      weeks throughout pregnancy. In addition, in 12 women the diurnal patterns of
      salivary cortisol, serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, plasma CRH and serum progesterone
      were analysed in late third trimester pregnancy and again 3-5 days after
      delivery. Salivary cortisol profiles exhibited a clear circadian rhythm during
      pregnancy with an increase in mean salivary cortisol from the 25th to 28th week
      onwards reaching concentrations in late pregnancy more than twice as high as in
      non-pregnant controls, rapidly returning to normal concentrations after delivery.
      The coefficient of variation of salivary cortisol profiles decreased in third
      trimester pregnancy due to a parallel upward shift of cortisol concentrations
      (40.2 +/- 3.4% vs 77.6 +/- 6.6% after delivery, P less than 0.01). A diurnal
      pattern was also found for plasma ACTH and serum cortisol before and after
      delivery with lower concentrations post-partum (P less than 0.01). In late
      pregnancy, progesterone concentrations were significantly higher in the evening
      (930 +/- 85 nmol/l vs 813 +/- 74 nmol/l at 0900 h, P less than 0.01) but showed
      no diurnal variation post-partum. Plasma CRH was significantly elevated in late
      third trimester pregnancy (1.22 +/- 0.23 micrograms/l at 0900 h) but showed no
      diurnal change (1.30 +/- 0.28 micrograms/l at 1900 h). Moreover, no correlation
      between the free cortisol increase in late pregnancy and plasma CRH was noted
      despite a wide range of CRH levels (0.13-3.60 micrograms/l). In contrast, a
      significant correlation was observed between the serum progesterone increase and 
      the salivary cortisol increase in late pregnancy (r = 0.70, P less than 0.05).
      These findings demonstrate that placental CRH is not the only regulator of
      maternal ACTH and cortisol release. Instead, our study suggests that placental
      CRH has little influence on baseline maternal adrenocortical function in
      pregnancy. The elevated salivary cortisol levels in pregnancy may be explained by
      glucocorticoid resistance owing to the antiglucocorticoid action of high
      progesterone concentrations.

TI  - Maternal genetic effects on ethanol teratogenesis and dominance of relative
      embryonic resistance to malformations.
PG  - 539-45
AB  - Maternal genetic factors and/or fetal genetic factors contribute to variations in
      response to prenatal alcohol exposure. To assess the contribution of maternal
      genotype to ethanol teratogenesis, a reciprocal cross study was conducted in an
      animal model using C57BL/6J (B6) and long-sleep (LS) mice. B6 mice are more
      susceptible than LS mice to prenatal ethanol-induced malformations but both mouse
      stocks are susceptible to fetal weight deficits following in utero alcohol
      exposure. B6 and LS dams were reciprocally mated to B6 or LS males producing four
      embryonic genotype groups: the true-bred B6B6 and LSLS genotypes, and the
      genetically similar B6LS and LSB6 genotypes (the F1 genotype). Dams were
      intubated with either 5.8 g/kg ethanol (E) or an isocaloric amount of sucrose (S)
      on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on gestation day 18, weighed, and
      assessed for soft tissue or skeletal malformations. Results showed a greater
      litter weight deficit and increased total malformation rate in ethanol-exposed F1
      litters carried by B6 mothers compared to ethanol-exposed F1 litters carried by
      LS mothers. This result would be expected only if maternal genetic factors
      contribute significantly towards susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis. The
      influence of the LS mother was to decrease susceptibility to ethanol
      teratogenesis compared to the B6 mother while the influence of the B6 mother was 
      to increase susceptibility to ethanol teratogenesis compared to the LS mother.
      The average malformation rate for F1 litters was significantly less than the
      predicted midparental value. This shows that the F1 genotype exhibited dominance 
      towards resistance to prenatal alcohol effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - The relationship of respiratory complications from gastroesophageal reflux to
      prematurity in infants.
PG  - 755-7
AB  - The association between respiratory complications of gastroesophageal reflux
      (GER) and prematurity in infants has not been described completely. We studied 82
      consecutive infants less than 6 months of age with major respiratory symptoms
      suspected to be caused by GER. Twenty-eight patients had bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia (BPD). Extended (18 to 24 hours) esophageal pH monitoring was used to
      document GER with a pH score. Respiratory complications were considered to be
      caused by GER if a prolonged mean duration of sleep reflux (ZMD) was found.
      Seventy-five of the 82 (91%) infants had documented GER, but only 45 (55%) had a 
      prolonged ZMD. The incidence of GER was high regardless of the gestational age at
      birth, postconceptual age at time of study, and the presence of BPD. The
      incidence of a prolonged ZMD was higher in infants who were 34 to 39 weeks'
      gestation (10/12, 83%) than in infants who were less than 34 weeks' gestation at 
      birth (15/37, 41%; P = .01). The incidence of a prolonged ZMD was lowest in
      infants 39 weeks or less postconceptual age at the time of study (4/14, 29%; P = 
      .017). Most infants with BPD did not have a prolonged ZMD (12/28, 43%). However, 
      11 of the 12 (92%) infants with BPD and a prolonged ZMD showed dramatic
      improvement after effective antireflux therapy compared with 0 of 16 infants with
      BPD and normal ZMD (P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

OAB - Among the Hausa-Fulani women of Zaria, Nigeria, "cold" or "sanyi" is thought to
      be a common cause of illnesses, and especially edema (swelling) during pregnancy.
      The traditional treatment for these illnesses is a hot bath. The new mother or
      mother-to-be sleeps in an overheated room and must take baths in very hot water, 
      called "wankan- jego," to keep out the cold. The birth attendant uses a bundle of
      leafy twigs from tamarind or neem trees to splash hot water over the women's
      body. This splashing hides the real temperature of the hot water over the women's
      body. This splashing hides the real temperature of the hot water so that she does
      not feel it, but it may actually be 82 degrees centigrade. Severe scalds often
      result from, such baths. Women confined during childbirth in the hospital and
      then discharged are still often subjected to the "wakan-jego" after they return
      home. Their thighs, buttocks and breasts are the most susceptible areas where
      these hot-water scald burns are the worst, sometimes even resulting in their
      nipples being sloughed off, thus making the mother unable to lactate. Since most 
      deliveries in the Zaria region still take place at home and most patients with
      childbirth complications come to the hospital only as a last resort, it is
      possible that scald injuries are underreported and the total morbidity and
      mortality rate may be much higher, both of mothers and babies. Understanding this
      cultural ritual is necessary to devise effective countermeasures, like
      encouraging hand testing the bath water for its safety before commencing the
      baths. Better still, since all the scalded patients in the groups studied were
      illiterate housewives, formal education could disprove the need for these
      traditional and harmful hot baths to chase away the "cold" that has been falsely 
      believed to be the cause of childbirth illnesses. [full text]

PG  - 93-8
AB  - For the purpose of determining the most reasonable lying posture for pregnant
      women, we investigated the lying positions of both 247 non-pregnant women and 302
      pregnant women during sleep. As for the rate of each position during the entire
      period of observation, 33.2% of the non-pregnant women were in the supine
      position, 41.2% in the lateral position, 18.4% in Sims' position and 7.1% in the 
      prone position. In the pregnant group, the rate of supine position, simple
      lateral position and Sims' position was 34.2%, 52.2% and 12.7%, respectively, but
      the rate of the prone position was limited to 0.8%. All of the gravidas assuming 
      the prone position were at less than 16 weeks of gestation. Non-pregnant women
      could sleep in a variety of positions, but pregnant women could assume the prone 
      position during sleep only in the stage when the abdomen is not yet prominent or 
      distended. Pregnant women were restricted significantly, either consciously or
      unconsciously, with progress in gestation.

      but significant intrapartal sleep loss. A computation of Pearson's correlation
      coefficient indicated no significant relationship between sleep loss and moods of
      anxiety, hostility, and depression.

TI  - Maternal activity and birth weight: a prospective, population-based study.
PG  - 522-31
AB  - To determine the association between maternal activity and pregnancy outcome, the
      authors investigated the separate influences of time, physical effort, and
      posture at work, both at a job and in the home, on birth weight. Study subjects
      were 1,507 of 1,889 women appearing consecutively for antenatal care at a
      district general hospital in inner London, England, in 1982-1984. Data were
      collected prospectively by interview and examination at several stages of
      pregnancy. Multivariable linear regression was used to distinguish associations
      with physical activity from confounding by other factors. The mean birth weight
      of infants born to women in full-time employment was 49 g less than that for
      births to women not in paid work (95 percent confidence interval (Cl) 1-97 g).
      However, the difference was due to confounding, and after adjustment, full-time
      employment was associated with a 12-g increase in birth weight (95 percent Cl -39
      to 63 g). There was little difference in birth weight related to gestational
      stage at leaving work. Duration, physical effort required, and energy expenditure
      in paid work and in work at home had no discernible association with birth
      weight. A small increase in birth weight was associated with increased hours of
      sleep. These data allow estimates of associations with birth weight as precise as
      80 g. Within the range of activities performed by pregnant women in the
      population studied, birth weight is unlikely to be associated with maternal
      physical activity.

TI  - Prediction of subsequent motor and mental retardation in newborn infants exposed 
      to alcohol in utero by computerized EEG analysis.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - In a prospective, blinded study 38 infants of mothers with varying quantities of 
      alcohol ingestion during pregnancy had an EEG at 40 weeks post conceptional age. 
      Bayley Development Tests were administered between 1.5 and 10 months of age. The 
      total power of the EEG during REM sleep was inversely related to subsequent motor
      development (r = -0.51, F = 13.1, p less than 0.0008) whereas the total power of 
      the EEG during quiet sleep was inversely related to subsequent mental development
      (r = 0.61, F = 24.4, p less than 0.0001). In alcohol exposed babies EEG
      abnormalities were present even in the absence of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).
      In 16 older children born to abstainers or alcoholic mothers similar results were
      obtained. Thus, the power of the EEG during REM and quiet sleep at birth appears 
      to be a sensitive index of alcohol effects on the fetal brain and may be used to 
      predict future motor and mental development.

TI  - Enlarged adenomectomy for enclosed prolactinomas: a preliminary study of 26
      cases.
PG  - 92-8
AB  - Preliminary results obtained from 26 cases of prolactinomas less than 20 mm in
      diameter after treatment by enlarged adenomectomy are described. The operation
      consisted in removal of the adenoma, a layer of normal pituitary at the outer
      edge of the tumour and the pituitary capsule in contact with the sellar meninges.
      24 women and 2 men were involved whose prolactin levels (PRL) were less than 200 
      ng/ml. All presented abnormal PRL responses to Thyrotropin releasing hormone
      (TRH) and Metoclopramide (MCP) tests and an absence of a nocturnal rise in the
      sleep cycle study. Postoperatively, three patients developed transitory diabetes 
      insipidus and five transitory adrenal insufficiency. Gonadotropin reserve was
      always found normal. All 24 women resumed normal menstrual cycles and two became 
      pregnant within one year. From a serological viewpoint, after surgery 100% of
      patients were found to be normal for levels of prolactin but only 85% turned to
      normal dynamic tests. The results of this small series of enlarged adenomectomies
      seem better than those obtained using selective adenomectomy, but must be
      confirmed with time.

TI  - Responses to ethanol challenge in long- and short-sleep mice prenatally exposed
      to alcohol.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - Individual sensitivity to alcohol may influence the severity of functional
      deficits due to prenatal alcohol exposure. To examine this hypothesis, Long-Sleep
      (LS) and Short-Sleep (SS) mice, selectively bred for differences in
      ethanol-induced narcosis, were intubated with either 2.9 g/kg ethanol (E) or an
      isocaloric amount of sucrose (S) twice per day on days 7 through 15 of pregnancy.
      An untreated control group (C) was maintained for each line. Offspring were
      fostered to lactating Rockland-Swiss mice at birth. Males and females from each
      litter were challenged with an acute dose of ethanol (3.8 g/kg) at 30 days of
      age. Measures of sleep time duration, waking blood ethanol concentrations (BEC), 
      rectal temperatures, heart rate, and ethanol clearance were obtained to examine
      whether the acute effects of ethanol are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure.
      Prenatal alcohol exposure did not differentially affect responses to ethanol
      challenge within either genotype. Ethanol-induced hypothermia, heart-rate
      depression, and sleep time did differ between genotypes, with LS more affected
      than SS mice. Ethanol clearance rates were faster for SS than LS mice. These
      results suggest postnatal pharmacological responses to acute ethanol challenge
      are not altered by prenatal alcohol exposure in LS and SS mice. Prenatal
      alcohol-exposed offspring of both mouse genotypes showed lower average heart rate
      responses than controls, suggesting this measure may be a sensitive indicator of 
      prenatal alcohol effects in mice.

TI  - Sleep and the reproductive cycle: a review.
PG  - 409-21
AB  - Women of all ages have been found to have a higher rate of sleep disturbances
      than men. Attempts to determine whether hormonal changes marking their
      reproductive lives render women more vulnerable to emotional stress and to
      concomitant sleep disturbances are the focus of this article. Investigations of
      sleep patterns and sleep-related experiences that occur in connection with the
      menstrual cycle (normal menstrual cycle and premenstrual syndrome) and are
      associated with hormonal abnormalities (amenorrhea) and changes in hormonal
      status (pregnancy and menopause) are reviewed. Methodological problems are
      discussed and areas of future research are proposed. It is suggested that the
      triad of sleep, endocrine changes, and mood should be more systematically
      investigated.

TI  - Endpoints of chronobiologic cardiovascular monitoring during pregnancy for
      planning exercise and assessing effects.
PG  - 605-14
AB  - The chronobiologic question is raised whether exercise may be indicated for the
      pregnant woman as a general prophylactic measure and, if so, whether it should be
      timed according to rhythms and stage of pregnancy. This question, recently
      considered by others without chronobiologic focus, is here reviewed against the
      background of results from ongoing chronobiologic studies of blood pressure (BP) 
      and heart rate (HR) in pregnancy. During pregnancy, the MESORs and circadian
      amplitudes of systolic (S), mean arterial (MA) and diastolic (D) BP are
      correlated with a questionnaire-assessed cardiovascular risk score. Such results 
      were found under noisy ordinary conditions of life without accounting for effects
      of activity. They are group results, and as such require further work before they
      can contribute to identifying individuals at high risk in particular need of
      intervention, such as exercise. The dependence of exercise effects upon circadian
      rhythms should also prompt the use of rhythmometry at all ages for timing
      exercise, for gauging its effects and eventually for the optimization of fitness 
      training for the population as well as for peak performance.

TI  - [Fetal respiratory movements and their regulation].
PG  - 523-7
AB  - In 1972, fetal breathing movements were clinically rediscovered. Details of their
      episodic occurrence, frequency, inspired volume, pleural pressure, and the nearly
      absolute independence of fetal blood gases were investigated in animal
      experiments. In the human being, there is also an association between fetal
      breathing and sleep state: fetal breathing movements were confined almost
      exclusively to periods of REM sleep. The pattern of respiratory frequency changes
      as gestation progresses; the rates decrease as term approaches. Hardly any
      breathing movement can be detected during labor. The fetal respiratory centre is 
      capable of rhythmic movements, but there is a lack of response to basic chemical 
      stimuli from the periphery of the body. The association between fetal breathing
      and REM sleep implies that the connection between breathing and behaviour is
      already established before birth; but in the fetus, the link between breathing
      and metabolism is not yet forged. Throughout postnatal life this linkage
      predominantly regulates breathing. The difference between fetus and newborn in
      the reaction to chemical stimuli implies a change at birth related to the glomera
      cells of the carotid bodies. Under the influence of the marked increase in the
      sympathetic tone there is a major increase in the sensitivity of the receptor
      cells to oxygen deficiency immediately after birth.

TI  - Sleep promotion: an important dimension of maternity nursing.
PG  - 9-17
AB  - Studies indicate that sleep is disturbed throughout the maternity cycle. The
      sleep disturbance, leading to reduced sleep time, has been associated with a
      variety of physical, behavioral, and psychological problems. When these are
      superimposed on the normal pregnancy and child birth, the potential for altered
      health is increased. Nursing intervention to identify sleep deficit and promote
      sleep is required at all stages of the maternity cycle. A knowledge of sleep
      structure and the role of each stage of sleep is a prerequisite in understanding 
      the value of sleep in health.

AB  - The circadian rhythm of alpha-amylase, E.C. 3.2.1.1.
      (alpha-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolase) in parotid gland of 25 day old rats was
      studied under different experimental conditions (fast, reversed photoperiod,
      constant light or darkness and treatment with reserpine and
      alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine). The rhythm of rats fasted or exposed for 7 days to
      constant darkness did not change. There were modifications in the rhythm of rats 
      submitted to a reversed photoperiod and it disappeared in animals submitted to
      constant light or darkness for 15 days or treated with reserpine or
      alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. The rhythm persisted, with minor changes in the
      acrophase, in parotids of rats kept during their gestation and post-natal life in
      constant light or darkness. Results suggest that the circadian rhythm of
      alpha-amylase in parotid gland of young rats is endogenous, synchronized by the
      photoperiod, under autonomous nervous system control and maternal coordination.
      This model appears to be useful in the study of sympathetic nervous system
      control of target organs and circadian rhythms in general.
