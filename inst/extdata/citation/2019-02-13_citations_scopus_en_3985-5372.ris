AB  - NSAIDs are frequently used in clinical practice and they account for approximately 5-10% of all drug prescriptions. NSAID use has been associated with a risk of adverse events, which have a relevant impact on morbidity and mortality and account for a substantial increment of healthcare costs. Less common, but clinically relevant, adverse events associated with NSAID use are the impairment of the CNS and, particularly, the appearance of psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms include changes in cognition, mood state and even precipitation or exacerbation of pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This article aims to review the medical literature on published reports of NSAID-related psychiatric adverse events, identify risk factors for these events and describe mechanisms potentially involved in their onset. We identified 27 reports with data on 453 cases of NSAID-related psychiatric adverse events. Data suggest that individuals who may be particularly susceptible to such events include patients with a history of psychiatric illness and possibly parturients. Indometacin and selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors were the most frequently reported culprit drugs; however, whether this reflects an increased incidence with these drugs compared with other NSAIDs or factors such as usage or reporting patterns is unknown. A possible explanation for the psychiatric effect of NSAIDs resides in the modulation of central neurotransmission by prostaglandins, the synthesis of which is inhibited by NSAIDs. COX-2 is a key enzyme in this process since its activity is localised in distal dendrites and dendritic spines, which are cellular specialisations involved in synaptic signalling. Dopamine is considered the most relevant neurotransmitter involved in this phenomenon. Psychiatric symptoms are a rare but relevant complication of NSAID use. This effect is probably a consequence of impairment in neurotransmission modulated by prostaglandins when NSAIDs are used by susceptible individuals. These drugs should be used with caution in high-risk individuals with pre-existing psychiatric illness, and caution may also be advisable in the postpartum period. To date, reports of NSAID-related psychiatric adverse events have most commonly involved indometacin and selective COX-2 inhibitors. Prescribers should consider warning patients of the possibility of an acute neuropsychiatric event when traditional NSAIDs or selective COX-2 inhibitors are prescribed.

AB  - Background: Anopheles gambiae Giles is the most important vector of human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Knowledge of the factors that influence its daily oviposition pattern is crucial if field interventions targeting gravid females are to be successful. This laboratory study investigated the effect of oviposition substrate and time of blood feeding on daily oviposition patterns of An. gambiae mosquitoes. Methods: Greenhouse-reared gravid and hypergravid (delayed oviposition onset) An. gambiae sensu stricto and wild-caught An. gambiae sensu lato were exposed to three types of substrates in choice and no-choice cage bioassays: water from a predominantly anopheline colonised ground pool (anopheline habitat water), swamp water mainly colonised by culicine larvae (culicine habitat water) and distilled water. The daily oviposition pattern and the number of eggs oviposited on each substrate during the entire egg-laying period were determined. The results were subjected to analysis of variance using the General Linear Model (GLM) procedure. Results: The main oviposition time for greenhouse-reared An. gambiae s.s. was between 19:00 and 20:00 hrs, approximately one hour after sunset. Wild-caught gravid An. gambiae s.l. displayed two distinct peak oviposition times between 19:00 and 20:00 hrs and between 22:00 and 23:00 hrs, respectively. During these times, both greenhouse-reared and wild-caught mosquitoes significantly (P < 0.05) preferred anopheline habitat water to the culicine one. Peak oviposition activity was not delayed when the mosquitoes were exposed to the less preferred oviposition substrate (culicine habitat water). However, culicine water influenced negatively (P < 0.05) not only the number of eggs oviposited by the mosquitoes during peak oviposition time but also the overall number of gravid mosquitoes that laid their eggs on it. The differences in mosquito feeding times did not affect the daily oviposition patterns displayed. Conclusion: This study shows that the peak oviposition time of An. gambiae s.l. may be regulated by the light-dark cycle rather than oviposition habitat characteristics or feeding times. However, the number of eggs laid by the female mosquito during the peak oviposition time is affected by the suitability of the habitat. Â© 2004 Sumba et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of the SpaceLabs 90207 ambulatory blood pressure monitor among pregnant women. Methods: Patients participating in research projects involving ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in pregnancy (N = 110) were asked to complete a questionnaire relating to patient satisfaction on completion of the monitoring period. The first part of the questionnaire involved rating on a visual Likert scale (0- 10) whether they found the monitor heavy, noisy, cumbersome, disturbing, or embarrassing to wear. The second part of the questionnaire addressed whether cuff inflation caused significant sleep disturbance or physical discomfort. Outcome Measures: The mean (SD) and range of the Likert scores are reported. The number of patients reporting sleep disturbance or physical discomfort was calculated. Logistic regression was used to examine which factors were significant predictors of discontinuing monitoring. Results: The mean (SD) responses measured by the Liken scores were: finding the monitor heavy 3.2 (2.3); comfortable 4.8 (2.3); straightforward to use 8.8 (1.8); cumbersome 3.8 (2.3); disturbing 4.5 (2.7); noisy 1.6 (2.2); and embarrassing to wear 1.7 (2.1). Difficulty initiating sleep was reported by 28.8% of patients, and a further 56.3% reported difficulty maintaining sleep due to the monitor. Sleep disturbance was found to be the strongest predictor [r = 0.52; OR 1.68 (1.23, 2.27), p = 0.0009] for the 15% of patients discontinuing the monitoring. Conclusions: While pregnant women tolerate the noise, weight, inconvenience, and disturbance associated with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) well, sleep disturbance is a major cause of dissatisfaction and noncompliance. Future studies should evaluate critically the number of nocturnal blood pressure assessments required, and should allow for a withdrawal rate of approximately 15% when performing sample size calculations for ABPM studies in pregnancy.

AB  - Puerperal psychosis is the most serious psychiatric disorder after childbirth. Despite the ongoing debate regarding its diagnostic status, there is increasing evidence that it is related to bipolar or schizoaffective disorder. Although a well-recognized precipitant of mania, the role of sleep loss has not been systematically studied in the onset of puerperal psychosis. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disruption resulting from longer labour or nighttime delivery would be associated with the onset of puerperal psychosis. Data on duration of labour and time of delivery were compared between a group of patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of puerperal psychosis and a group of controls from the same hospitals that were matched on age, parity, and on year of admission to the hospital. The most common DSM-IV diagnoses were bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. The women in the puerperal psychosis group had a longer duration of labour and were more likely to have a nighttime delivery compared to women in the control group. Insomnia was the most frequent and usually the earliest symptom. Small sample size, chart review, no direct measure of sleep, and use of a normal control rather than a comparison group of at-risk women. These preliminary findings provide indirect evidence that sleep loss may be a precipitant of puerperal psychosis in women who are biologically predisposed to this illness.

AB  - The relationship between circadian rhythmicity and rodent reproductive cyclicity is well established, but the impact of disrupted clock gene function on reproduction has not been well established. The present study evaluated the reproductive performance of mice carrying the ClockÎ19 mutation that were either melatonin deficient (ClockÎ19/Î19) or had the capacity to synthesise melatonin reinstated (ClockÎ19/Î19 + MEL). The ClockÎ19/Î19 mice took 2-3 days longer to mate, and to subsequently deliver pups, than their control line. The melatonin-competent mutants had a smaller, but still significant (P&lt;0.05), delay. The ClockÎ19 mutation resulted in smaller median litter sizes compared with control lines (seven v. eight pups; P &lt; 0.05), whereas melatonin proficiency reversed this difference. Survival to weaning was 84% and 80% for the ClockÎ19/Î19 and ClockÎ19/Î19 + MEL lines, respectively, compared with 94-96% for the two control lines. The ClockÎ19/Î19 mutants became behaviourally arrhythinic in constant darkness but, despite this, seven of seven became pregnant when paired with males after at least 14 days of constant darkness (five of seven within 4 days of pairing). In the ClockÎ19/Î19 + MEL mice, seven of 15 became arrhythmic in constant darkness but still became pregnant. The seven mice that free ran for at least 14 days in constant darkness with a period of 27.1 h also became pregnant. The present study has demonstrated that the ClockÎ19 mutation has significant, but subtle, effects on reproductive performance. The reintroduction of melatonin competency and/or other genes as a result of crosses with CBA mice reduced the impact of the mutation further. It would appear that redundancy in genes in the circadian system allows the reproductive cyclicity to persist in mice, albeit at a suboptimal level. Â© CSIRO 2004.

AB  - Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. About 20% of the population consumes less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg. Women, particularly, have low intakes. For example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men have inadequate intakes. Mg deficiency during pregnancy can induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric consequences that might last throughout life. Studies of gestational Mg deficiency in animals show that Mg deficiency may have marked effects on parturition and postuterine involution. It has interfered with fetal growth and development, and caused morbidity from hematological effects and disturbances in temperature regulation, to teratogenic effects. Emphasis, here, is on effects of chronic clinical gestational Mg deficiency as it affects the infant. Premature labor, contributed to by uterine hyperexcitability caused by chronic maternal Mg deficiency, that can be intensified by stress, gives rise to preterm birth. If the only cause of uterine overactivity is Mg deficiency, its supplementation constitutes nontoxic tocolytic treatment, as an adjuvant treatment, that is devoid of toxicity and enhances efficacy and safety of tocolytic drugs such as beta-2 mimetics. Evidence is considered that Mg deficiency or Mg depletion can contribute to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS may be a fetal consequence of maternal Mg deficiency through impaired control of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermoregulation mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set point. SIDS can result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. Possibly, simple nutritional Mg supplements might be preventive. Various stresses in an infant can transform simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion. For example, lying prone can be stressful for the baby, as can parental smoking. The role of chronopathological stress appears to be often neglected, as it constitutes a clinical form of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its anatomical and clinical stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (MT) and of its urinary metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (6 SMT)]. SIDS might be linked to impaired maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT. Prophylaxis of this form of SIDS should include atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for pregnant women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. Consequences of maternal primary Mg deficiency have been inadequately studied. To determine ultimate outcomes of gestational Mg deficiency in infants, a long-term multicenter placebo-controlled prospective study should undertaken on effects of maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality/morbidity in fetus, neonates, infants, children and adults, not only during pregnancy and the babyâs first year, but throughout life.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that fatigue and sleep disturbance in late pregnancy are associated with labor duration and delivery type. In a prospective observational study of 131 women in their ninth month of pregnancy, objective (48-hour wrist actigraphy) and subjective (sleep logs and questionnaires) measures were used to predict labor outcomes using analysis of variance and logistic regression. Controlling for infant birth weight, women who slept less than 6 hours at night had longer labors and were 4.5 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Women with severely disrupted sleep had longer labors and were 5.2 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Fatigue was unrelated to labor outcomes. Health care providers should prescribe 8 hours of bed time during pregnancy to assure adequate sleep and should include sleep quantity and quality in prenatal assessments as potential predictors of labor duration and delivery type.

AB  - Objective. To assess whether sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is associated with increased behavioral morbidity. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted of school-aged children in an urban, community-based cohort, stratified for term or preterm (<37 weeks' gestation) birth status. A total of 829 children, 8 to 11 years old (50% female, 46% black, 46% former preterm birth) were recruited from a cohort study. All children had unattended in-home overnight cardiorespiratory recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and heart rate for measurement of the apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas per hour). SDB was defined by either parent-reported habitual snoring or objectively measured OSA. Functional outcomes were assessed with 2 well-validated parent ratings of behavior problems: the Child Behavioral Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised:Long. Results. Forty (5%) children were classified as having OSA (median apnea hypopnea index: 7.1 per hour; interquartile range: 3.1-10.5), 122 (15%) had primary snoring without OSA, and the remaining 667 (80%) had neither snoring nor OSA. Children with SDB had significantly higher odds of elevated problem scores in the following domains: externalizing, hyperactive, emotional lability, oppositional, aggressive, internalizing, somatic complaints, and social problems. Conclusions. Children with relatively mild SDB, ranging from primary snoring to OSA, have a higher prevalence of problem behaviors, with the strongest, most consistent associations for externalizing, hyperactive-type behaviors.

AB  - Leptin is a cytokine-like protein that plays a crucial role in energy homeostasis through a negative control on food intake. Adipose cells represent the major source of leptin, which is also produced in significant amounts by the placenta during pregnancy. Increased placental leptin has been demonstrated in pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy disorder associated with placental hypoxia. This has led to the hypothesis that leptin gene expression is enhanced in response to oxygen deficiency. We have tested this possibility in placental and adipose cultured cells, where both leptin gene expression and leptin release in culture medium are markedly increased by hypoxia. This effect is mediated by the transcription factor HIF-1 (Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1) interacting with a consensus sequence located in the proximal promoter of the leptin gene. These data demonstrate that leptin is a new hypoxia-inducible gene. Circulating levels of leptin are elevated in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OAS), a syndrome that leads to recurrent intermittent periods of hypoxia. Elevation of leptin levels might represent a compensatory response to minimize the frequent metabolic dysfunctions associated with OAS, if resistance does not compromise leptin metabolic efficiency.

AB  - Because of its multiple involvement in physiological processes, autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, a key regulator of homeostatic control, demonstrates a progressive increase during pregnancy. The profile of its maturation, mainly in the parasympathetic arm, in premature or full term infants, may help us to better understand its pathophysiological role. We prospectively evaluated ANS maturity in a group of 23 premature (PREM) infants at their theoretical term age and in 8 full term (FT) newborns. All recordings were registered close to the theoretical full term period (from 38 to 41 weeks) for the PREM group and during the first week of life for the FT newborns. Polygraphic recordings, EEG monitoring associated with visual clinical control, and Holter ECG, were performed simultaneously. ANS indices were then calculated during quiet sleep periods, using Wavelet transform of RR (beat to beat) intervals. High frequency components were found to be significantly lower in the PREM than in the FT group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, at theoretical full term age, the greater the prematurity, the lower was parasympathetic activity. Because it is easy, monitoring of parasympathetic activity may help us to understand autonomic maturation and its clinical prognostic implications.

AB  - This prospective study was conducted to identify work, health, and social predictors of partner satisfaction at 6 months postpartum. Surveys were completed by 261 expectant fathers and mothers (128 couples) during pregnancy and at 6-months postpartum. Both fathers and mothers experienced significant postpartum declines in partner satisfaction and caring. Postpartum partner satisfaction was related to partners' expressions of caring and mental health, and to several work characteristics, including parents' contributions to housework, satisfaction with housework sharing, and fathers' having reasonable (instead of excessive) workloads.

AB  - Depression during the postpartum period is a significant public health concern, affecting 8%-15% of women and resulting in considerable morbidity for women, and their infants and families. Risk, prevalence, and distinguishing features of postpartum mood disorders are provided. Anxiety and depression frequently co-occur, suggesting symptoms of anxiety should also be attended to when screening for postpartum depression. Recommendations include the use of a brief, valid screening instrument as a routine clinical practice and the unique role of the obstetrician/gynecologist, pediatrician, and family practice physician in identification and referral. A summary of evidence-based treatment options for postpartum depression, along with current information about psychotropic medication, is provided to assist in risk-benefit analyses and decision making with patients.

AB  - The risk of antimalarial drug-related toxicity must be balanced against the likely outcome of malaria treatment or prophylaxis. In patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, atovaquone/proguanil is very well tolerated as prophylaxis and treatment, and artemether/lumefantrine is a new well tolerated option for treatment. Chloroquine is inexpensive and well tolerate; however, its efficacy against P. falciparum is decreasing. Mefloquine is generally well tolerated as prophylaxis and treatment against chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria, although serious neuropsychiatric toxicity may occur. Quinine, used to treat falciparum malaria in many countries, is commonly associated with adverse effects resulting in poor compliance.

AB  - Background: Heart period variability provides a measure of balance between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the PNS develops during the final weeks of gestation, premature infants have an overriding SNS. Spectral power analysis of heart period variability reveals two main frequency regions, the low frequency region (LF) representing primarily SNS activity and the high frequency region (HF) representing PNS activity. Objectives: To identify the characteristics of heart period power in the LF and HF regions in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in the neonatal intensive care unit across gestational age groups and between sleep and awake states. Methods: Data were collected from 16 intubated and mechanically ventilated VLBW infants with respiratory disease. Using spectral analysis techniques, heart period power in the two main frequency regions was extracted. Results: HF power did not improve with gestational age as expected. LF power did increase with age, albeit nonsignificantly. LF and HF power were not significantly different between awake and sleep states. Conclusions: The results of this preliminary study suggest that PNS tone does not improve with gestational age in VLBW infants with respiratory disease. The intensive care environment may stimulate a sympathetic response in these infants and disrupt normal PNS development. Copyright Â© 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Ontogeny of arousal data constitute a vital supplement to the sparse literature on spontaneous neuronal activity. These data demonstrate that measurable infant spontaneous arousals (SAs) with an inherent oscillatory entrainment occur six times more in active sleep than in quiet sleep of the same duration and are identifiable as a human neurobiologic function. These SAs are not significantly associated with race or ethnicity, gender, total hours spent sleeping, percent time spent in active or quiet sleep, preterm status, history of a life-threatening event, having had a sibling who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), or having had a mother who smoked during this pregnancy. As measurable neurophysiologic events, SAs establish parameters for research at molecular and molar levels focusing on several critical areas: (1) the neuronal control of SA related to neurotransmitters, (2) as a significant antecedent factor in clinical cardiorespiratory events occurring in infants at high epidemiologic risk for SIDS; (3) as a regulatory biologic factor underlying temperament and executive cognitive functioning, and (4) morbidity and mortality effects possibly related to therapeutic interventions that alter SA levels.

AB  - This pilot study examined whether giving stress reduction (SR) instructions to pregnant women would be effective in regulating stress, mood, and cortisol levels during pregnancy. Forty-one predominantly low-income Latina women, receiving prenatal services at a public county hospital, completed measures of stress and mood (depressive symptoms, positive and negative affect) and provided morning and evening saliva samples to measure cortisol prior to and after receiving SR instructions. We hypothesized that adherence to these SR instructions would result in lower levels of stress, negative mood states, and cortisol levels when compared to baseline values. Repeated measures ANOVA analyses demonstrated significantly lower levels of stress (P<0.001), lower symptoms of depression and negative affect (P<0.01), and lower levels of morning cortisol (P=0.01) under the SR condition, compared to baseline. Health behaviors that were engaged in during the SR condition and implications for prenatal health interventions are discussed. Â© 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During pregnancy, systemic inflammatory responses induce cytokines that may stress the fetus and contribute to cardiovascular and neuroendocrine dysfunction in adulthood. We evaluated the effects of early and late prenatal exposure to IL-6 on mean systolic arterial pressure (MSAP) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation in male and female rats at 5-24 wk of age. MSAP and ACTH and corticosterone levels were measured basally and in response to a novel environment, immobilization stress, and stimulation with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and ACTH. In addition, mRNA expression and protein levels of glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, CRF receptor type 1, and CRF were estimated in brain areas thought to mediate central effects of corticosteroids on the HPA axis and on central neuroendocrine regulation of MSAP. Both early and late prenatal IL-6 exposure led to hypertension, which was evident in females at 5 wk of age. In adult rats, basal ACTH and corticosterone levels were elevated, the responses to stress and stimulation tests were of extended duration, and circadian rhythm during the light period was flattened and reversed. Mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression was reduced in the hippocampus, the CRF level was increased in the hypothalamus, and CRF receptor type 1 mRNA expression was increased in the pituitary. These findings suggest that fetal stress induced by prenatal exposure to IL-6 leads to hypertension and dysregulation of HPA axis activity during adulthood.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to establish whether diurnal blood glucose profiles differed in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) with different forms of hypertensive complications. Methods: The subjects were patients diagnosed at 26-32 gestational weeks as having GDM (n = 178). They were classified as being normotensive, having chronic hypertension (with or without superimposed pre-eclampsia on chronic hypertension) or pregnancy-induced hypertension (with or without proteinuria). We compared diurnal blood glucose profiles (blood glucose taken every 4 h over 24 h) in these three groups. Results: Hypertension complicated 43% of the women with GDM. The glucose profiles were similar between the three groups, except that in early morning hours (from 04:00 to 08:00 h) blood glucose concentrations increased in mothers with chronic hypertension, whereas they decreased in the normotensive women. In univariate regression analysis, both obesity (BMI â¥ 28 kg/m2) and chronic hypertension showed significant association with blood glucose rise from 04:00 to 08:00 h, but in a multiple regression model neither showed significant independent effect. Conclusions: The rise in blood glucose levels during the early morning hours in women with GDM and chronic hypertension could reflect greater insulin resistance and sympathetic overactivity.

AB  - Prenatal stress in the rat induces enhanced reactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, disturbances in a variety of circadian rhythms and increased anxiety-like behaviour. Such abnormalities parallel those found in human depressed patients. Prenatally stressed (PS) rats could represent, therefore, an interesting animal model for the evaluation of the efficacy of pharmacotherapeutic intervention in psychiatric disorders that has often been addressed using control animals. In the present study, PS and non-stressed rats were chronically treated with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) and assessed in the forced swim test. Glucocorticoid receptor binding sites in the hippocampus were measured and 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels in the frontal cortex were also assessed. PS rats were characterised by increased immobility in the forced swim test, reduced hippocampal corticosteroid receptor binding and increased levels of cortical 5-HT1A mRNA. All these parameters were significantly reversed by chronic imipramine treatment. Conversely, no significant effects were observed for non-stressed rats. All these effects are consistent with the expected pharmacotherapy of depression-like abnormalities in PS rats. These results further indicate that PS rats are a relevant animal model of depression.

AB  - Background: Cigarette smoking and cocaine use in pregnancy are common in the US and both are risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Although the cause of SIDS is not known, one postulated mechanism involves abnormalities of arousal and arousal regulation. Cigarette smoking and cocaine use may cause deficits of arousal. Many believe arousal deficits occur prenatally. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of cigarette smoke and cocaine exposure during pregnancy on measures of fetal arousal and arousal competency: 1) the fetal response to vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) and 2) habituation to VAS. Hypothesis: Maternal cigarette smoking and cocaine use in pregnancy are associated with altered arousal and arousal regulation in the fetus. Methods: Three groups of mother-fetal dyads were enrolled: 1) cigarette smokers (n = 54), 2) cocaine users (n = 30), and 3) controls (n = 60). One hundred eight fetuses were tested at 29-31 wk gestation, 119 at 32-35 wk, and 118 at 36+ wk. The fetal response to VAS was assessed using real-time ultrasound and a paradigm of arousal responsiveness. Responders were tested with repeated VAS to assess habituation. Also, the quality of fetal reactivity to repeated stimuli was assessed as a measure of arousal and arousal regulation competence (Behavioral Reactivity Scale). Results: The control group had a larger proportion of fetuses who were too active to initiate testing ("too active to test") (p = 0.013); the proportion of fetuses too active to test decreased with increasing gestational age. The majority of the fetuses who could be tested responded to the initial VAS, and there were no group differences. The proportion of fetuses that habituated and the rate of habituation did not differ between the groups. Behavioral reactivity did not differ between groups. Conclusions: The original hypotheses were not confirmed. However, the chosen assessment paradigms may have lacked sensitivity. The proportion of fetuses that were "too active to test" decreased with gestational age. The control group had a larger proportion of fetuses that were "too active to test" compared with the exposure groups. We speculate that these findings indicate that prenatal exposure to these neuroteratogens may have produced an acceleration of the behavioral response to vibroacoustic stimulation.

AB  - Apnea of prematurity is commonly seen in infants less than 32 weeks gestation and is a disorder of immature respiratory control. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain its etiology. Three distinct types of apnea have been recognized: central, obstructive, and mixed. The vast majority of episodes are mixed apnea. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, pathogenesis, and management of apnea of prematurity. Methylxanthines remain the mainstay in management of apnea of prematurity.

AB  - The application of ultrasound in assessing the fetal cardiovascular system often requires the accurate estimation of maximum blood flow velocity waveforms using Doppler measurements. The modified geometric method estimates the maximum Doppler frequency as the frequency at which the vertical distance between the integrated spectrum and the reference line that connects the origin to the maximum value of the integrated spectrum is the largest. This paper presents a mathematical formulation for a class of maximum blood flow velocity estimation algorithms that includes the modified geometric method. The analysis provides a rationale for the continued use of the modified geometric method for estimating the maximum frequency envelopes of Doppler signals. This paper also contains experimental results demonstrating the superiority of the modified geometric method over a commonly used threshold crossing method.

AB  - The occurrence of insomnia in women is influenced in great part by the complex hormonal cycles they undergo. Patterns of insomnia in younger women may be physiologically different on a hormonal basis from those found in older women. Although significant objective sleep disturbances have been difficult to demonstrate across the menstrual cycle in normal women, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) includes premenstrual insomnia and premenstrual hypersomnia as sleep disorders within the category of menstrual-associated sleep disorder. On the other hand, during pregnancy and after childbirth, profound fluctuations in steroid and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis-related hormones produce significant physiological changes, including sleep disruption. During the menopausal transition, significant sleep disruptions are provoked by sleep-disordered breathing, vasomotor disturbance, and mood disorders. Regardless of age, women with chronic insomnia are at higher risk for developing or sustaining depression. Thoughtful management approaches must consider known relationships between menstrual or menopausal status and various sleep disorders, and should rely on pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, or a combination of treatments to achieve successful relief from insomnia. The off-label, first-line use of antidepressants for treating insomnia in the absence of depression is now considered debatable. The long-term efficacy and safety of the newer benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs) for insomnia, whether taken nightly or episodically, are supported by existing clinical experience. US Food and Drug Administration guidelines limiting the use of hypnotics to only a few weeks predate the newer generation BZRAs, and, as such, the guidelines may no longer be truly appropriate for these new agents.

AB  - Depression and insomnia are both significantly more prevalent in women than in men. Risks appear linked to fluctuations and transitions in gonadal hormones during various phases of women's lives, with the risk of depression greatest during the period from menarche to menopause. Increased risks of both insomnia and depression also coincide with the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, during and after pregnancy, and during the peri-/postmenopausal period. Gonadal hormones exert significant effects on the neurohumoral systems most intimately associated with depression and insomnia, with corresponding implications for treatment. Medications related to the serotonin system -The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs - appear to be uniquely effective in the treatment of insomnia and depression experienced by women. SSRIs and the nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists are generally useful as first-line treatments in a number of circumstances; hormone replacement therapies can also be considered. Behavioral therapies for insomnia may be particularly relevant for postpartum patients because of safety concerns and to prevent the development of autonomous chronic insomnia, which may also increase the risk of depression. In light of the high risk of relapse and high likelihood of comorbidity, it is crucial to effectively treat both insomnia and depression in women. However, few data exist for many key areas related to the treatment of these disorders in women, and research is greatly needed. Â© 2004 Excerpta Media, Inc.

AB  - Photoentrainment of the biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) begins shortly after birth. Here we show usingc-FOS immunoreactivity as a marker for neuronal activity that the melanopsin/PACAP containing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) which project to the SCN as the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) are responsive to light from birth. After postnatal day 12 where the classical photoreceptors become functional other RGCs and cells of the inner nuclear cell layer also respond to light. Light also induces c-FOS immunoreactivity in the retinorecipient SCN from the first postnatal day and accordingly PACAP immunoreactive fibres are visible in the SCN. The results indicate that the retina is light responsive before functional rods and cones and that the RHT is functional from birth supporting that photoentrainment of the biological clock begins shortly after birth.

AB  - Up to 70% of people developing epilepsy may expect to become seizure free with optimum antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. The remaining 30% are the most difficult to treat. Most patients are controlled on a single AED, but a small proportion requires a combination of two agents. Add-on therapy with a second drug, rather than substitution, may be a viable and rational approach in some patients, particularly if the first drug is relatively well tolerated. Precise classification of the type of seizures, as well as the epilepsy syndrome, together with careful recording of both seizures and adverse effects, are essential if rational management decisions are to be made. The goal of therapy should be complete seizure freedom with a single drug taken once or twice a day and without adverse effects. If control is difficult to achieve, the maximum tolerated dose of each drug should be explored, but a balance needs to be struck between adverse effects and control of seizures. In patients in whom treatment appears to be ineffective, the diagnosis of epilepsy and adherence to therapy should be reviewed. Drugs used in combination must be carefully selected, as poor adherence, drug interactions, and toxicity are more likely if more than one drug is prescribed. Agents are usually chosen according to seizure type, patient characteristics, and often by clinician preference. Those that are better tolerated have a low potential for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions, and those that can be easily introduced without any complicated titration schedule have an advantage.

AB  - Pregnancy in mammals is a time of considerable physical, physiological and behavioral change necessary for the continuance of the gestation. Gestating pigs are often used in behavior and welfare studies; yet, there are little published data describing how pregnancy affects normal behavior and cardiac activity patterns. The objective of this work was to describe the longitudinal dynamics of cardiac activity and behavior during pregnancy in primiparous pigs (gilts). The behavior and cardiac activity of nine gilts were recorded on eight occasions at certain fixed time points during their pregnancy: 1-2 weeks before oestrus and mating (week -1), 14 days postmating (week 2), and days 30 (week 4), 44 (week 6), 65 (week 9), 79 (week 11), 93 (week 13) and 107 (week 15) of pregnancy. Temporal changes in behavior patterns were present in all gilts over the course of gestation. Pretest levels of general activity progressively declined between weeks -1 and 15, as indicated by a decrease in the proportion of observations spent rooting (p<0.001), walking (p<0.001) and standing (p<0.001). There was a corresponding increase in inactivity (p<0.001), and the proportion of time spent sleeping, as opposed to lying alert, increased also (p<0.001). Apart from RR-min and its corresponding HR-max indices, all time-domain parameters were influenced by the stage of gestation. Specifically, mean HR increased (p<0.001), whereas the root-mean-square of successive differences (RMSSD) and standard deviation (S.D.) decreased (p<0.001). Pregnancy further impacted the frequency domain measures of heart rate variability. From week - 1 to 15, the absolute magnitude of Total power (p<0.001) decreased, HF power decreased (p<0.001) and LF power increased (p=0.004). In conclusion, pregnancy induced widespread changes in behavior and in sympathovagal regulation of cardiac activity in pigs that were reflected in both the time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability analysis.

AB  - Background: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of opioids vary throughout the day, as demonstrated for oral morphine in chronic pain. However, little is known about the chronobiology of intrathecal lipid soluble opioids used for labor analgesia. The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether the duration of action of intrathecally administered sufentanil is influenced by the time of administration. Methods: Ninety-one women in the first stage of labor were enrolled. Labor analgesia was first provided by 10 Î¼g intrathecal sufentanil. The duration of action of intrathecal sufentanil was measured and analyzed by the cosinor method to determine periodic intraday variation. Results: Pain assessed by a visual analog score was not different among patients (70 Â± 17 mm) before the injection of intrathecal sufentanil. Rhythm analysis revealed a mean (Â± SD) duration of analgesia (mesor) of 93.0 Â± 3.8 min. A highly significant 12-h rhythm was found, with two peaks: One was near midnight (0.78 Â± 0.6 h), and the other was near noon (12.78 Â± 0.6 min) (P < 0.01). The amplitude of this 12-h component was 16.1 Â± 5.5 min. Conclusions: The duration of intrathecal sufentanil analgesia exhibited a temporal pattern with 30% variations throughout the day period. The authors point out that the lack of consideration of chronobiological conditions in intrathecally administered analgesia studies can cause significant statistical bias. Further studies dealing with intrathecal opioids should consider the time of drug administration.

AB  - Background A pacemaker system is required for peristalsis generation. The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are considered the intestinal pacemaker, and are identified by expression of the c-kit gene - encoded protein. Gastroschisis is characterized by a severe gastrointestinal dysmotility in newborns. In spite of this clinical picture, few studies have focused on smooth muscle cells (SMC) morphology and none on ICC. Therefore, their morphology has been studied in fetuses at term in the rat model of gastroschisis. Methods At 18.5 day's gestation (E18.5), 10 rat fetuses were killed, 10 underwent surgical creation of gastroschisis, and 10 underwent manipulation only. The small intestine of the latter 2 groups was harvested at E21.5. Specimens were processed for H&E, c-kit and actin (alpha smooth muscle antibody [Î±-SMA]) immunohistochemistry, and trasmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results In the controls, SMC were c-kit+ and Î±-SMA+, with labeling intensity increasing by age. At E21.5, some cells around the Auerbach's plexus were more intensely c-kit+, and differentiating ICC were seen under TEM at this level. Gastroschisis fetuses had no c-kit+ cells referable to ICC. In the more damaged loops, SMC were very faintly c-kit+ and Î±-SMA+. Under TEM, there were few differentiated SMC and no presumptive ICC. In the less-damaged loops, SMC were faintly c-kit+ and Î±-SMA+ and had ultrastructural features intermediate between those of E18.5 and E21.5 controls; ICC were very immature. Conclusions ICC and SMC differentiation is delayed in gastroschisis with the most damaged loops showing the most incomplete picture. These findings might help in understanding the delayed onset of peristalsis and the variable time-course of the recover seen in babies affected by gastroschisis. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Upper airway congestive symptoms during pregnancy have been recognized since the late 19th century (1). Among randomly selected pregnancies, as many as 18-30% of patients will report substantial symptoms of rhinitis and sinusitis, and this figure may be higher among patients with pre-existing atopic disease (2-4). "Rhinitis of pregnancy" can take many forms. In another chapter in this review, Dr. Elergard discusses a form of rhinitis in pregnancy that occurs as a result of physiologic changes specific to pregnancy. This is to be distinguished from other forms of rhinitis coincident sometimes aggravated by pregnancy such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. The incidence of allergic conditions is 20-30% among women of childbearing years (5). Of those pregnant women with known allergies, some studies suggest that as many as 10-30% will experience increasing allergic symptoms during their pregnancy returning to their normal pre-pregnancy state after delivery (5-7). Postulated causes include those responsible for "rhinitis of pregnancy" such as increased circulating blood volume giving rise to nasal vascular engorgement and hormonal influences on nasal mucosal secretions and have been discussed in another chapter of this review (8,9).

AB  - Most studies of sleep-wake states of preterm infants have been cross-sectional. Thus, the extent to which sleep-wake development occurs within individuals and how environmental factors affect the development of sleeping and waking is unclear.This study examined the development of sleeping and waking during the preterm and early post-term periods and the effects of infant health and environmental characteristics.Longitudinal, descriptive design.134 preterm infants at high risk for developmental problems because of birthweights under 1500 g or mechanical ventilation.Weekly 2-h behavioral observations were conducted from the time infants were no longer critically ill until 43 weeks post-conceptional age or discharge. A single follow-up observation was conducted 1-3 months later.Active sleep, large body movements and the percent of no REM during active sleep decreased with age, and quiet waking, active waking, quiet sleep and regularity of respiration in active sleep and quiet sleep increased. The state of sleep-wake transition increased until 40 weeks and then decreased after 43 weeks CA. Negative facial expressions showed a quadratic decrease over age. Active waking, active sleep, negative facial expressions and quiet sleep regularity showed a change of development after term. Infant characteristics, illness severity and medical treatments, the handling due to performing an EEG and hospital had only minor effects.Significant development of sleeping and waking occurs over the preterm period. Additional research is needed to determine how the change from the hospital to the home environment affects on these developmental trajectories. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of the different states of alertness on 1) nonnutritive swallowing (NNS) frequency, 2) the relationship between NNS and the respiratory cycle, and 3) the association of NNS with spontaneous apneas. Recordings of sleep states, diaphragm and laryngeal constrictor electrical activity, nasal flow, electrocardiogram, respiratory inductance plethysmography, and pulse oximetry were obtained from six preterm lambs without sedation. Analysis of 2,468 NNS showed that 1) NNS frequency was higher during quiet wakefulness and active sleep (AS) than in quiet sleep; 2) in all states of alertness, a greater number of NNS (38%) were preceded and followed by an inspiration; 3) although NNS and central apneas were rarely coincidental, AS appeared to favor their association; and 4) most obstructive apneas occurred in AS and were coincidental with bursts of NNS. Compared with results in full-term lambs, premature birth does not modify the NNS-respiratory coordination. However, AS in preterm lambs is characterized by a higher association of NNS bursts with obstructive apneas.

AB  - Purpose. The aim of the present study was to determine whether community pharmacists recommend appropriate medications and give valid information to pregnant women. Methods. A total of 163 community pharmacists randomly selected in the Midi-PyrÃ©nÃ©es area were interviewed by means of an open questionnaire. Ten scenarios were proposed concerning back pain, headache, coughs and sore-throats, fever, constipation, nausea, dyspepsia, 'venous insufficiency', allergic rhinitis and insomnia. Results. Out of the total, 130 pharmacists accepted to answer. Out of them 94.5% reported advising homeopathy, especially for coughs and allergy. They often advised medication for pain, fever, nose and oropharynx disorders, 'venous insufficiency', dyspepsia or constipation. By contrast, they referred the women to the general practitioner for nausea and vomiting or back pain. Advice without drug dispensation was given for gastrointestinal disorders or 'venous insufficiency'. Phytotherapy only concerned 0.5-2% of the answers except for anxiety and sleep disturbances (59%), 'venous disorders'(17%) and sore-throat (9%). Pharmacists' answers were sometimes inappropriate involving (1) pharmacologically illogical advice, (2) drugs for which neither clinical nor experimental data are available and (3) drugs potentially harmful in pregnancy. Conclusions. The present study shows that French community pharmacists do not always give appropriate advice to pregnant women. As primary health care providers, pharmacists have to improve counselling regarding drug use in pregnancy. Copyright Â© 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The power spectra of night sleep EEGs of 12 breast-feeding 9-13 week postpartum mothers were analyzed and compared with those of 12 non-pregnant women. The power spectra in the delta and theta frequency range during NREM sleep for breast-feeding mothers were significantly higher than those for non-pregnant women. In addition, the all-night sleep patterns of the mothers were classified into two groups - interrupted sleep due to taking care of their infants and non-interrupted sleep - in order to observe the influence of partial sleep deprivation. The power spectra in the delta and theta frequency range were not significantly different between them. This result suggests that increased delta and theta power spectra during postpartum sleep do not result from partial sleep deprivation. The role of prolactin in breast-feeding mothers' sleep is also discussed. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypoglycaemia is a common condition, which may easily be missed due to the variation in clinical presentation in patients with or without diabetes. The most common cause is related to the treatment of diabetes. Non-diabetes related hypoglycaemia is rare. Nonetheless, the need for careful evaluation of the underlying cause is important as well as relieving symptoms. The diagnosis and investigations involved in management of hypoglycaemia are discussed with a direct relevance to the acute general physician.

AB  - With the use of ambulatory monitoring, a circadian blood pressure pattern has been shown to characterize normotensive as well as hypertensive pregnant women. However, the potential differences between healthy and complicated pregnancies in pulse pressure, an independent marker of cardiovascular risk in the general population, have not yet been investigated. We analyzed 2523 blood pressure series sampled for 48 hours once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit until delivery in 245 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 140 with gestational hypertension, and 49 who developed preeclampsia. Compared with uncomplicated pregnancies, a statistically significant elevation in the 24-hour mean of pulse pressure is found in complicated pregnancies in all trimesters (P<0.001). Results further indicate similar 24-hour mean of pulse pressure between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy (P=0.158). The increase in pulse pressure among women who developed preeclampsia compared with women with gestational hypertension, although small, was statistically significant in the second trimester (1.4 mm Hg; P=0.010) and, to a larger extent, in the third trimester of pregnancy (1.8 mm Hg; P<0.001). The differences in pulse pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies, observed already in the first trimester of gestation, are found when systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are within the accepted range of normotension. Moreover, ambulatory pulse pressure provides higher sensitivity than clinic measurements for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy.

AB  - A paucity of data exists concerning the normal glycemic profile in nondiabetic pregnancies. Using a novel approach that provides continuous measurement of blood glucose, we sought to evaluate the ambulatory daily glycemic profile in the second half of pregnancy in nondiabetic women. Fifty-seven obese and normal weight nondiabetic subjects were evaluated for 72 consecutive hours with continuous glucose monitoring by measurement interstitial glucose levels in subcutaneous tissue every 5 minutes. Subjects were instructed not to modify their lifestyle or to follow any dietary restriction. For each woman, mean and fasting blood glucose values were determined; for each meal during the study period, the first 180 minutes were analyzed. For the study group, the fasting blood glucose level was 75 Â± 12 mg/dL; the mean blood glucose level was 83.7 Â± 18 mg/dL; the postprandial peak glucose value level was 110 Â± 16 mg/dL, and the time interval that was needed to reach peak postprandial glucose level was 70 Â± 13 minutes. A similar postprandial glycemic profile was obtained for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Obese women were characterized by a significantly higher postprandial glucose peak value, increased 1- and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels, increased time interval for glucose peak, and significantly lower mean blood glucose during the night. No difference was found in fasting and mean blood glucose between obese and nonobese subjects. Glycemic profile characterization in both obese and normal weight nondiabetic subjects provide a measure for the desired level of glycemic control in pregnancy that is complicated with diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Objective: To observe day-to-day variability in glucose levels in pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes using the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) and to assess the usefulness of continuous glucose measurements for adjustment of insulin treatment. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: The obstetrical outpatient clinic of the University Medical Centre Utrecht. Population: Pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods: Thirty-one pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes used the CGMS for two consecutive days. Patients were classified in two groups (high vs low day-to-day variability) based on visual inspection of the glucose excursions. The relationship between day-to-day variability and the variables HbA1c, maternal age and body mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes, number of self-monitored blood glucose levels, number of insulin injections, gestational age, nutrition, physical activity, White classification, living with children and method of insulin administration was determined. The two days of the first 20 CGMS measurements were separated and four physicians were asked to give recommendations on treatment adjustment for each separate day. Main outcome measures: Mean absolute difference (MAD) was calculated for each patient as measure of day-to-day variability. Results: Seventeen patients (55%) were classified as having low (MAD 0.92-2.33 mmol/L) and 14 (45%) as having high day-to-day variability (MAD 2.41-6.12 mmol/L). Of the variables measured, only the relation between MAD and HbA1c was significant (r = 0.58, P = 0.001). The difference in recommendation on treatment adjustment between the days of the CGMS measurement ranged from 29% to 48%. This percentage was significantly higher in the high day-to-day variability group (48 vs 33%, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Day-to-day glucose variability is high and the treatment of pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes is a problem. Fine-tuning of insulin regimens based on two-day measurements with the CGMS is not advisable.

AB  - Objectives: To review our management of infants discharged home receiving supplemental oxygen. Stable preterm infants receive low flow O2 by nasal cannulae aiming for SaO2 of â¥ 95%. Oxygen-dependent infants must pass an air test (ability to maintain SaO2 &gt; 80% during 4 h disconnection from oxygen) before discharge home with supplemental oxygen. A sleep study is performed before nocturnal O2 is ceased. Methods: Infants less than 33 weeks gestational age (GA) who were admitted January 1999-June 2001 and discharged home with supplemental oxygen were identified through the databases and medical records of the King Edward Memorial/ Princess Margaret Hospitals. The data collected were compared with an audit performed a decade earlier. Results: Ninety-three infants were discharged home with supplemental oxygen between 1999 and 2001 (10% neonatal intensive care unit admissions less than 33 weeks GA; median GA 26 weeks (interquartile range 25-28). All infants had an air test before discharge: 63% failed the first air test and 30% at least two air tests. The median delay between the first air test and discharge was 2 weeks. The median postmenstrual age at discharge was 40 weeks gestation (interquartile range 38-41). Ninety infants had a sleep study before nocturnal oxygen was ceased and nine failed the first sleep study. Hospital readmission rate was 60%. More preterm infants (less than 33 weeks) were discharged with supplemental oxygen in 1999-2001 (10%, n = 96 in 1999-2001) than in 1987-1992 (2.5%, n = 53) and this was associated with an earlier discharge (40 vs 44 weeks postmenstrual age), lower oxygen requirements at discharge (60 vs 125 mL/min), earlier discontinuation of daytime and nocturnal oxygen (1 vs 4 months postmenstrual age and 2.5 vs 6 months postmenstrual age) and no increase in readmission rate (64% vs 60%). The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia for these infants has remained stable at 20%. Conclusion: Our home oxygen programme, based on an air test predischarge and a sleep study prediscontinuation of nocturnal oxygen, facilitates early discharge home. Our data suggest that over the last decade, bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with less impairment in lung function. Further evidence from randomized clinical trials is required to determine optimal target range for oxygen saturation in preterm infants.

AB  - Aim: To compare the breathing patterns of infants born by elective caesarean section to those infants delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of labour. Methods: Healthy term infants born by caesarean section were studied. The study group (n = 13) had no trial of labour, whereas infants in the control group (n = 13) failed a trial of labour. Polysomnographic study was performed at 36 h of age. Heart and respiratory rate, type and duration of apnoeas, arterial oxygen saturation and lower limb movements were analysed. Results: Term infants born by elective caesarean section had a shorter duration of pregnancy and weighed less. Their heart rate was faster, they had more mixed apnoeas, and during quiet sleep they had more central apnoeas of longer duration. Conclusion: Cardiorespiratory patterns in infants delivered by elective caesarean section are different from those delivered by caesarean section after a failed trial of labour.

AB  - Question. In the 1960s, Dr Cameron, a Montreal, Que, psychiatrist, experimented with drug-induced sleep and electroconvulsive therapy for psychiatric patients, believing that this method "wipes them clean of harmful memories." In 1992 the government of Canada settled lawsuits by former patients of Dr Cameron, awarding them large payments. The government rejected a similar claim by Lloyd Schrier, whose mother had been treated by Dr Cameron while she was carrying Lloyd, arguing that Lloyd was not Cameron's patient. Or was he? Answer. The fetus was exposed to the medications taken by his mother, (eg, barbiturates) and thus qualifies as an unconsenting patient.

AB  - Aim. To review recent advances in the procedures and techniques that have made possible to evaluate the anatomy and function of the central nervous system (CNS) in the fetus. Development. The neurological evaluation of the fetus can be performed at different levels: clinical, anatomical and functional. At a clinical level the analysis of body, ocular or respiratory fetal movements, as well as fetal heart rate, defines 4 behavioural states: 1F and 2F correspond to the quiet and active sleep, respectively. States 3F and 4F occur during wakefulness in the newborn, but there is no scientific evidence that the fetus is awake. Behavioral states probably play an important role in the process of CNS maturation and development. Anatomic evaluation of the CNS to rule out brain malformations can be performed with ultrasound since week 7-8 of gestational age and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since week 18-20. Both techniques are also useful in the diagnosis of acquired fetal neurological diseases. Both modalities are concordant in the majority of cases, but in others each of them provides additional, different information. Computed tomography should only be used in selected cases that involve bone structures. Functional evaluation of fetal CNS can be performed with proton MR spectroscopy, which determines the cerebral content of inositol, choline, creatine and N-acetylaspartate. Other techniques to functionally study the fetal brain are functional MRI (fMRI), near infrared spectroscopy, and magnetoencephalography. Conclusions. Fetal neurology is a discipline that will continue to develop fast in the immediate future. Technological advances will facilitate the possibility of a more rapid and reliable diagnosis of anatomic or functional abnormalities of the fetal CNS.

AB  - Background: While postpartum depression is a major health issue for many women from diverse cultures, this affective condition often remains undiagnosed and untreated. The objective of this article is to critically review the literature to determine the current state of scientific knowledge related to the treatment of postpartum depression from a biological perspective. Method: Databases searched for this review included MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, ProQuest, the Cochrane Library, and the WHO Reproductive Health Library from 1966 to 2003. The search terms used were postpartum/postnatal depression and randomized controlled/clinical trials in various combinations. Published peer-reviewed articles in English from 1990 to 2003 were chosen for review, although select earlier studies were also included based on good methodological quality and/or the absence of more recent work. The criteria used to evaluate the interventions were based on the standardized methodology developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Results: Nine studies that met study criteria were examined. The interventions studied included antidepressant medication, estrogen therapy, critically timed sleep deprivation, and bright light therapy. Although some of these interventions have been better studied for depression unrelated to childbirth, methodological limitations render their efficacy equivocal for postpartum depression with limited strong evidence available to guide practice or policy recommendations. Conclusions: Despite the recent upsurge of interest in this area, many questions remain unanswered, resulting in diverse research implications. In view of the lack of randomized controlled trials, psychiatrists who are experts in the treatment of postpartum mood disorders have developed consensus guidelines. These guidelines will require regular updating as better and stronger evidence emerges. Â© Copyright 2004 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To assess the relationship between congenital uterine malformations and blood pressure in pregnancy. Study Design: Twenty-four-hour automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (readings every 30 min) was performed in 16 normotensive, nonproteinuric, primigravidae with congenital uterine malformations (5 uterus septus, 9 uterus bicornis, 2 uterine didelphys) between 20 and 30 weeks. From the 24-hr blood pressure report, we calculated 24-hr mean, daytime and nighttime means. The results were compared with 16 primigravidae, matched for age and gestation, who were and remained normotensive throughout pregnancy, and tested for statistics with t-test; significance assessed at p < 0.001. Results: Although they were within the normotensive range, all blood pressure measurements considered were significantly higher in pregnant women with congenital uterine malformations, compared to normal pregnant women. Namely, 24-hr, daytime, and nighttime systolic (mean Â± SD) were 121.1 Â± 8.4, 124.4 Â± 8.8, 114.0 Â± 7.7 mmHg, respectively, in women with uterine malformations and 108.0 Â± 7.4, 109.2 Â± 7.3, 102.1 Â± 8.5 mmHg, respectively, in normal pregnant women. Twenty-four-hour diastolic, daytime, and nighttime diastolic (mean Â± SD) 74.1 Â± 10.2, 77.1 Â± 10.6, 68.1 Â± 9.2 mmHg, in women with uterine malformations and 64.1 Â± 5.7, 66.0 Â± 5.7, 58.2 Â± 6.3 mmHg, in normal pregnant women (all differences p < 0.001). Fifteen of the fetuses from women with congenital uterine malformations showed intrauterine growth retardation. No differences were found 6 months after delivery. Conclusions: Although the blood pressure levels remained within the normotensive range, pregnant women with congenital uterine anomalies have a higher blood pressure than normal women. Elevated blood pressure can result from altered uterine circulation and reduced blood supply to the placenta. This pathogenesis or the poor placentation may result in a foetal growth retardation.

AB  - Aim: To determine whether high levels of maternal physical activity (dancing during pregnancy), influenced the offspring. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four women (32 of whom had continued to dance for at least 2 months after the beginning of pregnancy) filled in a questionnaire to assess the health and behavior of their offspring, now 11-15 years of age. Results: More children born from women who had continued to dance during pregnancy needed to be rocked to sleep during their first year (p < 0.05). More children in the study group played musical instruments (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding other parameters. Conclusions: The greater need to be rocked to fall asleep and the attitude to play musical instruments recorded in the children of dancers may be related to prenatal maternal movement. But they may also be due to other causes as discussed. Copyright Â© 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Classic experiments have shown that ovulation and estrous cyclicity are under circadian control and that surgical ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) results in estrous acyclicity in rats [1-3]. Here, we characterized reproductive function in the circadian Clock mutant mouse [4, 5] and found that the circadian Clock mutation both disrupts estrous cyclicity and interferes with the maintenance of pregnancy. Clock mutant females have extended, irregular estrous cycles, lack a coordinated luteinizing hormone (LH) surge on the day of proestrus, exhibit increased fetal reabsorption during pregnancy, and have a high rate of full-term pregnancy failure. Clock mutants also show an unexpected decline in progesterone levels at midpregnancy and a shortened duration of pseudopregnancy, suggesting that maternal prolactin release may be abnormal. In a second set of experiments, we interrogated the function of each level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in order to determine how the Clock mutation disrupts estrous cyclicity. We report that Clock mutants fail to show an LH surge following estradiol priming in spite of the fact that hypothalamic levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), pituitary release of LH, and serum levels of estradiol and progesterone are all normal in Clock/Clock females. These data suggest that Clock mutants lack an appropriate circadian daily-timing signal required to coordinate hypothalamic hormone secretion. Defining the mechanisms by which the Clock mutation disrupts reproductive function offers a model for understanding how circadian genes affect complex physiological systems.

AB  - Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a condition that accompanies many seemingly unrelated diseases. It is commonly associated with various clinical conditions such as pregnancy, aging, pulmonary diseases, cancers, and other systemic illnesses. The condition has been attributed to various causes such as platelet abnormalities, hormonal disturbances, and cytokine dysfunction, but the exact underlying mechanism has been elusive. We propose a unifying hypothesis that activation of the adrenergic system is the common thread that links all of the disparate clinical associations of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. In diseased states, autonomic stimulation may occur as a result of chemoreceptor activation in response to acidosis, hypoxia, or hypercapnia. Examples include sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and tumor-induced hypoxia. In this setting, clinical signs of HOA may be a marker of underlying autonomic dysfunction. Autonomic stimulation may also occur as a normal part of pregnancy or as an abnormal component of aging. The exact pathway linking adrenergic excess to HOA remains to be clarified, but a plausible scenario based on current molecular evidence is offered. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Daily variation in niche use among vertebrates is attributed to a variety of factors, including thermoregulatory, reproductive, and nutritional requirements. Lemuriform primates exhibit many behavioral and physiological adaptations related to thermoregulation and sharp, seasonal reproduction, yet they have rarely been subjects of a quantitative analysis of circadian (or daily) rhythms in niche use. In this study, I document daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use over an annual cycle in two sympatric, frugivorous lemurs, Varecia rubra and Eulemur fulvus albifrons. Data on diet, forest site, and forest height were recorded at 5-min time points on focal animals and divided into three time blocks for analysis (06:00-10:00 hr, 10:00-14:00 hr, and 14:00-18:00 hr). I employed multivariate tests of independence to examine daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use according to sex, season, and reproductive stage. Throughout the day, V. rubra is frugivorous and dwells in the upper canopy, with notable departures (especially for females) during the hot seasons, gestation, and lactation. E. f albifrons has heterogeneous daily rhythms of food choice and microhabitat use, particularly across seasons, and both sexes are equally variable. These daily rhythms in diet and microhabitat use appear related to thermoregulatory and nutritional requirements, seasonal food availability and circadian rhythms of plant (and possibly insect) palatability, predator avoidance tactics, and in the case of Varecia, to reproduction. Daily rhythms of food choice in V. rubra support two previously suggested hypotheses explaining why primates consume more nonfruit items late in the day, whereas those of E. f. albifrons are too variable to lend support to these hypotheses.

AB  - Background: The objective was to study the influence of birth weight on office and ambulatory pulse pressure. Methods and results: Three hundred healthy children (176 girls), aged 10-18 years, born at term after a normotensive pregnancy were included. The subjects were divided according to birth weight: 2.000-2.500 kg, 2.501-3.000 kg, 3.001-3.500 kg and > 3.500 kg. For each subject, office and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were performed according to the protocol designed. There were significant differences among groups in 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure (PP). No differences were observed in terms of sex, current age, weight and height. Using a multiple linear regression analysis, sex, but not birth weight was the only independent factor related to office PP after controlling for current age, weight and height. Twenty-four hour pulse pressure was significantly related not only to current weight but also inversely to birth weight after controlling for sex, current age, and height. Conclusions: The results disclose a relationship between birth weight and ambulatory pulse pressure while seeking to advance knowledge about the possible associations between birth weight and cardiovascular risk.

AB  - The aim of the present study was investigate, in young rats, the effects of malnutrition on astrocyte distribution of two hypothalamic regions, the circadian pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the medial preoptic area (MPA). Control rats were bom from mothers fed on commercial diet since gestation and malnourished rats from mothers fed on multideficient diet, from the beginning of gestation (GLA group) or from the onset of lactation (LA group). After weaning, pups received ad libitum the same diet as their mothers, and were maintained under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. The animals were analyzed either at 30-33, or 60-63 days of life. Brain coronal sections (50 Î¼m) were processed to visualize glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity. Compared to control rats, both malnourished groups of 30 and 60 days exhibited a reduced number of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes in the SCN. The total GFAP-immunoreactive area in the SCN of the GLA group differed from the control group at both age ranges analyzed. The GFAP expression as measured by the relative optical density (ROD) exhibited a 50-60% reduction in the MPA in both malnourished groups, compared to controls. The results suggest that malnutrition early in life leads to alterations in gliogenesis or glial cell proliferation in both nuclei, being these alterations greater in the MPA. Compensatory plasticity mechanisms in the GFAP-expression seem to be developed in the astrocyte differentiation process in the SCN, especially when the malnutrition is installed from the lactation.

AB  - Background: The molecular aetiology of disturbed embryogenesis and other unfavourable outcomes in offspring of diabetic mothers is not fully understood. Experimental studies have suggested an involvement of radical oxygen species (ROS) in the teratological process. The aim of our study: To investigate if maternal diabetes in humans is capable of inducing alterations in vascular oxidative stress parameters and whether such changes are associated with disturbances in foetal development. Methods: Seventy patients with pre-gestational diabetes (PGDM) were chosen for the study: 29 (41.4%) belonged to class B according to White, 15 (21.4%) to class C, 8 (11.4%) to class D, 3 (4.3%) to class F, 3 to class R and 12 (17.1%) to class F/R. In 20 (28.6%) patients from this group an unfavourable outcome was noted. All patients were subjected to intensive insulin therapy. Glycaemia was estimated by daily self-monitoring, and diurnal glucose profiles and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) concentrations were measured monthly. Oxidative stress was evaluated as changed superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities as well as of malondialdehyde (MDA) and peroxides concentrations in maternal erythrocytes and blood serum. Results: Prior to conception, the mean glycaemia in the group that had a planned pregnancy was 6.6 mmol/l and HBA1C was 9.35%. Throughout the course of pregnancy, these parameters were maintained at a level of 6.7 mmol/l and 7.85%, respectively. The activity of all antioxidative enzymes was lower before than during pregnancy, and so was the concentration of MDA. The MDA concentrations were higher in patients with elevated glycaemia and with an unfavourable outcome. The investigated ROS, the glycaemia level, as well as the concentration of HBA1C did not show any significant differences between pregnancies with and without vascular complications. Patients with a favourable perinatal outcome presented a higher activity of antioxidant enzymes, than those with unfavourable outcome, throughout the whole course of pregnancy. The appearance of unfavourable perinatal outcomes in relation to parameters of oxidative stress was assessed by logistic regression. Both SOD and GPX activities, as well as peroxides' concentration, showed significant correlations (p &lt; 0.005) with foetal complications. However, after mean glucose levels in the studied group were included into these analyses, this relationship was only evident with SOD and GPX activity (p &lt; 0.0016). Conclusion: Oxidative stress is one of several important factors contributing to unfavourable outcome of human diabetic pregnancy. Â© 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.

AB  - Advances in assisted reproductive technology and increases in the proportion of maternities in older women have both contributed to the steep increase in the incidence of twin pregnancies since the 1980s. Maternal and perinatal complications are higher in twins than in singleton pregnancies. A significant proportion of perinatal mortality and morbidity among twins is due to the high incidence of preterm delivery and the added complication of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) in monochorionic twins. Monochorionic twins also have a much higher rate of perinatal mortality than dichorionic twins, the greatest risk being before fetal viability (<24 weeks gestation). Early diagnosis of twins and their chorionicity, close fetal surveillance, particularly of monochorionic twins, and prompt therapeutic intervention in TTS are necessary to reduce perinatal mortality. Intrapartum management in the hospital setting with anaesthetic and neonatal facilities, as well as critical assessment of mode of delivery, have led to better outcomes. Ultrasonography is a valuable tool in the management of twin pregnancy. This chapter briefly summarises these topics, with a particular focus on recent literature. Â© 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Since poor sleep quality is associated with multiple health problems, it is important to understand factors that may affect sleep patterns. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a continuous, 60-Hz, nighttime magnetic field exposure on sleep outcomes in young women sleeping at home. The study was a randomized crossover trial, comparing intervention (0.5-1.0 Î¼T above ambient levels) with ambient magnetic field levels, during two 5-night measurement periods. Subjects lived in the Seattle, Washington, area and were 20-40 years of age, had regular menstrual cycles, were not taking oral contraceptives, and had not breastfed or been pregnant during the previous year. The study was conducted between March and September of 2001. Sleep outcomes were measured via actigraphy. The range of magnetic field exposure was 0.001-0.50 Î¼T during the ambient period and 0.41-1.21 Î¼T during the intervention period. Sleep outcomes were not significantly different between the intervention and the ambient measurement periods. The intervention magnetic field had no effect on sleep patterns, suggesting that this exposure may not be an important factor in predicting sleep of young women who sleep at home.

AB  - This study analyzes the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin, 1985) in 588 pregnant women or in puerperium.The reliability was examined with the alpha of Cronbach, whose value was 0,82 and the analysis of the main components showed a single- factor solution accounting for 58,6% of the variance. The convergent and discriminant evidence was analyzed with the domains of COOP-WONCA Charts and The Nottinghan Health Profil: the life satisfaction obtained significant relationship with the indicators of the mental domain and it didn't show significant relation with the physical domain. The items about social domain and then those related to energy, pain and sleep showed statistically significant relations, but lower than those related to the psychological domain.

AB  - While the prevalence of bipolar disorder is roughly equal in women and men, the course of illness tends to be more severe in women. In 50% of women with bipolar disorder, illness onset occurs at or within 1 year of menarche. Despite this pattern, most women with bipolar disorder are not accurately diagnosed until they have had a child and developed an episode of PPD. The occurrence of PPD in a patient with recurrent depression but no history of mania or hypomania should raise the index of suspicion for the presence of an underlying bipolar disorder. Medications used in the treatment of bipolar disorder can result in side effects, such as sexual dysfunction or weight gain, and in drug-drug interactions. Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills while sodium valproate may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, which is the most common cause of menstrual disturbance in women of reproductive age. Contrary to popular belief, pregnancy does not protect against bipolar disorder relapse. Thus, physicians must be proactive in protecting the mother from relapse. In general, physicians should use nonpharmacologic measures as much as possible, pharmacology when necessary, and consider electroconvulsive therapy when the risks of medications are too great. Psychotic, floridly manic, or profoundly depressed patients should be given medication, for which information concerning safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding exist. For less severe problems, nonpharmacologic strategies can be employed and include promoting the maintenance of healthy nutrition and activity, protecting social and activity/sleep rhythms, educating patients and their families on how to recognize a prodrome of illness, and the use of cognitive-behavioral therapy to address mild symptoms of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse.

AB  - Several thyroid hormone preparations are currently available, including levothyroxine sodium (thyroxine), liothyronine (triiodothyronine), and desiccated thyroid extract, as well as a combination of levothyroxine sodium and liothyronine. Levothyroxine sodium monotherapy at an appropriate daily dose provides uniform levels of both thyroxine and triiodothyronine in the circulation without diurnal variation. Therefore, it is the preparation of choice in most patients with hypothyroidism of both the primary and central types. A normal thyrotropin (TSH) level of 1-2 mU/L is considered the determinant of optimal daily levothyroxine sodium dose in patients with primary hypothyroidism, whereas normal thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels in the mid or upper normal range may denote optimal replacement in patients with central hypothyroidism. Optimal daily levothyroxine sodium dose may be determined according to serum TSH level at the time of diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Initial administration of close to the full calculated dose of levothyroxine sodium is appropriate for younger patients, reducing the need for follow-up visits and repeated laboratory testing for dose titration. In the elderly and in patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), the well established approach of starting with a low dose and gradually titrating to the full calculated dose is always the best option. Levothyroxine sodium can and should be continued in patients receiving treatment for CAD. Even minor over-replacement during initial titration of levothyroxine sodium should be avoided, because of the risk of cardiac events. Chronic over-replacement may induce osteoporosis, particularly in postmenopausal women, and should also be avoided.

AB  - Many diseases show patterns of temporal variation that remain unexplained. We hypothesize that oscillation of autonomic balance over different time intervals plays a role in these variations. In the Darwinian struggle, organisms must perform various functions related to fitness such as survival, energy acquisition, and reproduction in a prioritized fashion. Autonomic systems enable differential allocation of effort to various functions under different conditions, some of which vary in patterns that are predictable such as circadian, menstrual, seasonal, and life cycles. For many species, daytime functions such as seeking food and avoiding predators are achieved with sympathetic activity while night-time functions such as internal processing are achieved with parasympathetic activity. For organisms that maintain thermal homeostasis year-round, cooler temperature seasons may demand sympathetic bias to drive adaptive thermogenesis. Reproduction may necessitate autonomic shift to sympathetic bias during the luteal phase and pregnancy to modulate immune balance towards a more tolerant Th2 bias. Many diseases including infectious, cardiovascular, inflammatory, pulmonary, metabolic, fertility, oncologic, and neurologic conditions also show variation in prevalence over these cycles. The co-variation of autonomic balance and diseases over time intervals suggests that autonomic balance, by its direct effects as well as its indirect effects through modulation of T helper immune balance, plays an under-recognized role in diseases. The theory is extended to the co-variation of autonomic balance and diseases over the lifespan. Termination of organisms during senescence, achieved by emergence of autonomic imbalance and other systemic dysfunctions, is explored from a Darwinian perspective. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have tried to overcome poor results from isolated blood pressure values in detecting hypertension in pregnancy by relying on ambulatory monitoring. Low sensitivity of the 24-hour mean has led many authors to conclude that ambulatory monitoring is not a valid approach in pregnancy. Against this background, we have evaluated prospectively the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of gestational hypertension of the tolerance-hyperbaric test. This is a combined approach consisting of establishing tolerance intervals for the circadian variability of blood pressure as a function of gestational age, and then computing the hyperbaric index (area of blood pressure excess above the upper limit of the interval) by comparison of any patient's blood pressure profile with those limits. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied 328 women who provided a 2014 blood pressure series. They were sampled for 48 hours once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (mostly within the first trimester of gestation) until delivery. The hyperbaric index of each blood pressure series was calculated by taking into account the reference circadian tolerance limits established from a 497 series previously sampled from an independent reference group of 189 normotensive pregnant women. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the tolerance-hyperbaric test was 91% for women sampled during the first trimester of gestation, and increased up to 99% in the third trimester. Specificity was above 99% in all trimesters. Positive and negative predictive values were above 96% in all trimesters. Moreover, the hyperbaric index provided an early identification of subsequent gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, on the average of 23 weeks prior to the clinical confirmation of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The tolerance-hyperbaric test represents a reproducible, stable, noninvasive, and high sensitivity test for the very early identification of subsequent gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, which can also be used as a guide for establishing prophylactic or therapeutic interventions.

AB  - In the Jouvet's laboratory, as early as 1960 the study of the ontogenesis of paradoxical sleep (PS) named "sleep with jerks" began in the kitten and led to the first publication in 1961. Then, several species were studied, lamb, rat, human neonates, etc. These works showed that at birth sleep with jerks was preponderant in altricial (immature) species (cat, rat) and the first to appear during the second half of gestation in precocious species (guinea pig). For Jouvet, sleep with jerks is a immature form of PS. Why PS is so important at birth ? The maturation of the central nervous system, based on the myelinization, starts in the spinal cord then forwards to the brainstem and forebrain. So, PS mechanisms located in the brainstem are the first to mature and the only one to function. Then the slow wave sleep (SWS) and waking structures become mature. Phylogenetic studies showed that in mammals and birds PS was present even in marsupials and monotremes. Until now only the one exception is the dolphin with a voluntary breathing. To sleep and breath, dolphin has developed an unilateral sleep without classical PS. In other animals, reptiles, amphibians, fishes, PS was not observed with the parameters used in mammals. The study at birth (not yet done) of reptiles would allow perhaps the observation of a temporary PS. Based on these findings, a schematic model of the sleep regulation can be elaborated. Haeckel's aphorism "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" seems true for PS which appears in birds and mammals i.e. at the end of evolution as it appears at the end of gestation when PS cerebral structures are present and mature.

AB  - A 25-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 2, at 37 weeks gestation was evaluated and treated for preeclampsia. Overnight, the patient had a witnessed apneic episode with maternal oxygen desaturation and concurrent fetal heart rate deceleration. She subsequently delivered an infant that was small for gestational age. This is the first case described with confirmed obstructive sleep apnea by formal polysomnography and witnessed maternal desaturation with fetal heart rate decelerations. Recognizing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) early in gestation will help dictate treatment options and may prevent adverse maternal fetal outcomes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) seems to be a safe treatment with minimal adverse effects. Questioning of patients at the first prenatal visit and monitoring for increased snoring during gestation may help detect early signs and symptoms of OSA. Treatment of OSA with CPAP might improve perinatal outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the severity of the low back pain (LBP) during pregnancy, including prevalence, risk factors, impact on daily living, and health provider management. METHODS: An anonymous survey consisting of 36 questions was distributed to pregnant women participating in various prenatal care clinics and educational classes in New Haven County, Connecticut. A total of 950 surveys was returned from May 2002 through October 2003. At each site, a researcher was available each week to answer questions and gather surveys. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-five (68.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 65-72%) respondents reported experiencing LBP during their current pregnancy. The prevalence was not affected by gestational age (P = .56). Low back pain during the current pregnancy was predicted by age (younger women were more likely to develop it; P = .004), history of LBP without pregnancy (P = .002), during menstruation (P = .01), and during a previous pregnancy (P = .002). The majority of respondents reported that LBP during pregnancy caused sleep disturbances (58%; 95% CI 54-62%) and impaired daily living (57%; 95% CI 53-62%). Average pain was moderate in severity. Nearly 30% of respondents stopped performing at least one daily activity because of pain and reported that pain also impaired the performance of other routine tasks. Only 32% (95% CI 28-36%) of the respondents with LBP during pregnancy informed their prenatal care providers of this problem, and only 25% (95% CI 21-28%) of prenatal care providers recommended a treatment. CONCLUSION: Low back pain during pregnancy is a common problem that causes hardship in this population. Further studies are indicated in the areas of prevention and treatment.

AB  - Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder generally affecting girls. Affected individuals are apparently normal at birth but later pass through a period of regression with loss of hand and communication skills and the development of hand stereotypies and dyspraxia. Mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene, have now been found to cause Rett syndrome in up to 80% of classical cases. We report a girl with Down syndrome, one of three children with birth defects in a family of five. From the age of 18 months she developed symptomatology considered by her primary physician to be very characteristic of Rett syndrome. However, this remained a clinical diagnosis till the age of 12 years. Laboratory confirmation of the dual diagnosis, which includes a R168X mutation in the MECP2 gene in addition to trisomy 21, has now been possible. The presence of one neurological or developmental disorder does not necessarily preclude a diagnosis of Rett syndrome.

AB  - Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone [CRH; also known as Corticotrophin Releasing Factor(CRF)], a41-amino-acid hormone, is one of the body's major modulators of the stress response. CRH coordinates the endocrine, autonomie, and behavioural responses to stress through actions in both the brain and the periphery activating the Tight or flight' response. CRH is also implicated in various neurological disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and anorexia nervosa, and it has been described as a biological clock controlling the length of gestation in humans and other higher-order primates. In the past decade there has been an enormous effort expended in the design and development of new therapeutic agents targetting CRHs in the central nervous and peripheral systems. In this review, we examine the chemistry and recent developments in this exciting field.

AB  - Chronic primary Mg deficiency is frequent. Around 20% of the population consumes less than two-thirds of the RDA for Mg, in both genders and in women particularly: for example, in France, 23% of women and 18% of men. Primary Mg deficiency may occur in fertile women. Gestational Mg deficiency is able to induce maternal, fetal, and pediatric consequences which might last throughout life. - Experimental studies of gestational Mg deficiency show that Mg deficiency during pregnancy may have marked effects on the processes of parturition and of postuterine involution. It may interfere with fetal growth and development from teratogenic effects to morbidity: i.e. hematological effects and disturbances in temperature regulation. - Clinical studies on the consequences of maternal primary Mg deficiency in women have been insufficiently investigated. To check the validity of the role of this frequent gestational Mg deficiency, the protocol of a long term multicentric placebo controlled prospective study on the effects of maternal nutritional Mg supplementation on lethality and morbidity in fetus, neonates, infants, children and adults should be carried out not only during pregnancy and the first year of life, but throughout life. - Two clinical forms of chronic gestational Mg deficiency in women have been stressed: â¢ Premature labor when chronic maternal Mg deficiency is involved in uterine hyperexcitability, â¢ Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) when it is caused by either simple Mg deficiency or various forms of Mg depletion. - Nutritional Mg treatment of premature labor. If gestational Mg deficiency is the only cause for uterine overactivity, nutritional Mg supplementation constitutes the etiopathogenic atoxic tocolytic treatment. But although it is an adjuvant factor in premature labor, it is only a useful accessory treatment, devoid of toxicity but which increases the effectiveness and safety of the associated tocolytic drugs such as beta-2 mimetics. - SIDS due to gestational Mg deficit: Mg deficiency or various forms of Mg depletion. SIDS may be caused by the fetal consequences of maternal Mg deficiency through an impaired control of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) thermoregulation, mechanisms leading to a modified temperature set point. SIDS may result from dysthermias: hypo- or hyperthermic forms. A possible prevention could rest on simple maternal nutritional Mg supplementation. Various stresses in pregnant women or in the infant may transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion: stress in baby care such as bedding in prone position, environmental factors such as parental smoking, but the role of chronopathological stress particularly appears to be too often neglected as it constitutes a clinical form of primary hypofunction of the biological clock [with its anatomical and clinical stigma such as reduced production of melatonin (âMT) and of its urinary metabolite: 6 Sulfatoxy-Melatonin (â6 SMT)]. SIDS might be linked to an impaired maturation of both the photoneuroendocrine system and BAT. A preventive treatment of this form of SIDS should associate atoxic nutritional Mg therapy for pregnant women with total light deprivation at night for the infant. The place of Mg therapy for the infant and of MT, L Tryptophan and taurine is uncertain for the moment.

AB  - Context: The precise function of sleep in animals and human beings is still unknown, and any sort of physical, social or psychological variation may change the normal sleep-wake cycle. Purpose: This research aims is to determine the sleep disorders (SD) for each of the three trimesters of the pregnancy comparing them to the pre-pregnancy state (PG). Method: SD were investigated in three hundred pregnant women 11- to 40-years-old through with a brief clinical interview based on directed questions. One hundred pregnant women were considered for each trimester. Results: The rate of pregnant women with insomnia increased by 23% in the 2 nd trimester (p &lt; 0.005); the rate for excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) by 15% in the 1 st trimester (p&lt;0.003), 55% in the 2 nd trimester (p&lt;0.001) and by 14% in the 3 rd trimester (p&lt;0.002); the rate for mild sleepiness increased by 33% in the 2 nd trimester (p&lt;0.002) and by 48% in the 3 rd trimester (p&lt;0.001); the rate for specific awakenings increased by 63% in the 1 st trimester, by 80% in the 2 nd trimester and by 84% in the 3 rd trimester (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: SD were more frequent during pregnancy comparatively to PG state, mostly at the expenses of EDS and specific awakenings.

AB  - Sleep and sleep disorders are different in several important ways between men and women. Because of pregnancy and menopause, women experience changes in sleep that may present as clinical problems. In clinical populations, women are more likely to present with insomnia than are men, although their sleep may be better preserved. The presentation of sleep apnea in women is distinct from that of men and is less likely to include a "classic" history of witnessed apnea or heavy snoring. More likely it presents with nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue or mood disturbance. There are little data on the effects of different treatments for OSA between men and women. OHS is a syndrome that may be as common in women as in men. The role of hormones in its pathophysiology is not well-defined.

AB  - Pregnancy rhinitis is a very common condition. Defined as "nasal congestion present during the last 6 or more weeks of pregnancy without other signs of respiratory tract infection, and with no known allergic cause, disappearing completely within 2 wk after delivery," it strikes one in five pregnant women, and it starts in almost any gestational week. The pathogenesis is not clear, but placental growth hormone is suggested to be involved. Smoking and sensitization to house dust mites are probable risk factors. It is often difficult to make a differential diagnosis from sinusitis, which may in pregnancy present with nasal congestion as the only symptom. Antral irrigation is diagnostic for purulent sinusitis and often needs to be repeated, as it should be treated intensively. Because of changes in pharmacokinetics, increased dosage of betalactam antibiotics is needed during pregnancy. As pregnancy rhinitis reduces quality of life and possibly also affects the fetus, there is often need for treatment. Nasal corticosteroids have not been shown to be effective. Systemic administration should be avoided, but nasal corticosteroids could be used in pregnancy when indicated for other sorts of rhinitis. Nasal decongestants give good temporary relief, so pregnancy rhinitics tend to overuse them, giving an additional rhinitis medicamentosa. Therefore, use of nasal decongestants should be restricted to a few days. Invasive methods of turbinate reduction may be effective but are not recommendable in this self-limiting condition because of side effects. Nasal saline washings, exercise, and mechanical alar dilators are safe general means to relieve nasal congestion, but the ultimate treatment remains to be found.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of marital status on state of health. Methods: Data were obtained from the Hungarostudy 2002, a national representative study: 12668 persons were interviewed, representing the Hungarian adult population. Questions referring to marital status, age, education, and different diseases were included in the survey. Shortened Marital Stress Scale, Shortened Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Anxiety Scale, Shortened Vital Exhaustion Questionnaire and Sleep Complaints Scale have been used. Results: 18% of the adult Hungarian population are single, 60.8% are married or living in a common low marriage, 8.7% are divorced, or living separately from their spouses and 12.4% are widowed. We have differentiated low stressed and high stressed marriages, and we have found that all diseases occurred more frequently in high stressed marriages, both among men and women. Among women these differences were significant in gynecological problems, endangered pregnancy, abortions, panic and depression. For men these differences were significant for diseases caused by alcohol and drug abuse. We have analyzed the relation of marital status to depression, anxiety, sleep complaints, and vital exhaustion. After controlling for age and education, the highest scores for depression, anxiety, sleep complaints, and vital exhaustion, were found in stressed marriages (higher than in divorcee or widowhood), both for men and women. These values were significantly higher, compared to the lowest values, which were found in good marriages, both for men and women. Conclusions: Marriage in itself is not a protective factor against diseases: stressed marriages are related to an increased incidence of different diseases. Good marriages were related to good health.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that physical leisure time activities reduce the risk of developing persistent fatigue. Methods: The hypothesis was tested in a sample that was homogeneous with respect to sex and occupation, with a prospective cohort design. Of 6234 vocationally active, female, Norwegian nurses' aides, not on leave because of illness or pregnancy when they completed a mailed questionnaire in 1999, 5341 (85.7%) completed a second questionnaire 15 months later. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of persistent fatigue - that is, always or usually feeling fatigued in the daytime during the preceding 14 days. Results: In participants without persistent fatigue at baseline, reported engagement in physical leisure time activities for 20 minutes or more at least once a week during the three months before baseline was associated with a reduced risk of persistent fatigue at the follow up (odds ratio = 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.89), after adjustments for age, affective symptoms, sleeping problems, musculoskeletal pain, long term health problems of any kind, smoking, marital status, tasks of a caring nature during leisure time, and work factors at baseline. Conclusion: The study supports the hypothesis that physical leisure time activities reduce the risk of developing persistent fatigue.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of role conflict, its sources and potential impact on female physicians' general health have received little scientific attention in Hungary. Aim: To explore the prevalence and determinants of perceived role conflict among female physicians in Hungary. Method: A nationwide survey among 500 female physicians using questionnaires. Complete data were available for 298 (59.6%) female physicians. Results: The prevalence of role conflict was 63% among female physicians. Principal sources of role conflict were associated with maternal duties (56.4%), occupational factors (21.5%), and domestic duties (19.9%). Furthermore, a high prevalence of somatic and psychiatric morbidities have been found. Correlation analyses confirmed a significant relationship between role conflict and depression, suicidal ideation, hypertension, pathologies associated with pregnancy, long working hours (> 8h) and the frequency of night duty. In addition, 82.2 and 83% of the female physicians reported sleep deprivation and exhaustion due to excessive workload, respectively. Five categories of coping strategies for role conflict-induced distress were identified: specialty change made for children (37.1%), seeking support from family members/colleagues (23.5%), suppression (14.5%), smoking (5%) and drug abuse (2%). Conclusion: High prevalence of role conflict and maladaptive stress-coping strategies may serve as catalysts of physical and psychiatric ill-health among female physicians in Hungary.

AB  - Migraine is a prevalent condition in young, otherwise healthy people. Its diagnosis is clinical, based on criteria developed by the International Headache Society. Migraine currently is understood as a neurovascular disorder in which involvement of vascular structures is secondary to inciting central nervous system events. Treatment must be individualized. Avoidance of known triggers and alterations in daily routines can be helpful. Abortive treatment of individual attacks with medication is necessary for most migraineurs who consult a physician. Simple analgesics may be appropriate for mild, nondisabling attacks, but triptans or other specific treatments are preferred for attacks that are moderate or severe. Preventive treatment with daily medication is necessary for patients who have more than one attack per week or whose attacks respond poorly to abortive medication. Subpopulations of migraineurs, such as children, elderly patients, and women, have special treatment needs.

AB  - Objectives: To address the clinical significance of sinusoidal heart rate (SHR) pattern and review its occurrence, define its characteristics, and explain its physiopathology. Background: In 1972, Manseau et al. and Kubli et al. described an undulating wave form alternating with a flat or smooth baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) in severely affected, Rh-sensitized and dying fetuses. This FHR pattern was called 'sinusoidal' because of its sine waveform. Subsequently, Modanlou et al. described SHR pattern associated with fetal to maternal hemorrhage causing severe fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis. Both Manseau et al. and Kubli et al. stated that this particular FHR pattern, whatever its pathogenesis, was an extremely significant finding that implied severe fetal jeopardy and impending fetal death. Undulating FHR pattern: Undulating FHR pattern may be due to the following: (1) true SHR pattern; (2) drugs; (3) pre-mortem FHR pattern; (4) pseudo-SHR pattern; and (5) equivocal FHR patterns. Fetal conditions associated with SHR pattern: SHR pattern has been reported with the following fetal conditions: (1) severe fetal anemia of several etiologies; (2) effects of drugs, particularly narcotics; (3) fetal asphyxia/hypoxia; (4) fetal infection; (5) fetal cardiac anomalies; (6) fetal sleep cycles; and (7) sucking and rhythmic movements of fetal mouth. Definition of true SHR pattern: Modanlou and Freeman proposed the following definition for the interpretation of true SHR pattern: (a) stable baseline FHR of 120-160 bpm; (b) amplitude of 5-15 bpm, rarely greater; (c) frequency of 2-5 cycles per minute; (d) fixed or flat short-term variability; (e) oscillation of the sinusoidal wave from above and below a baseline; and (f) no areas of normal FHR variability or reactivity. Physiopathology: Since its early recognition, the physiopathology of SHR became a matter of debate. Murata et al. noted a rise of arginine vasopressin levels in the blood of posthemorrhagic/anemic fetal lamb. Further works by the same authors revealed that with chemical or surgical vagotomy, arginine vasopressin infusion produced SHR pattern, thus providing the role of autonomic nervous system dysfunction combined with the increase in arginine vasopressin as the etiology. Conclusion: SHR is a rare occurrence. A true SHR is an ominous sign of fetal jeopardy needing immediate intervention. The correct diagnosis of true SHR pattern should also include fetal biophysical profile and the absence of drugs such as narcotics.

AB  - Sleep-related complaints are common in the general population. Prevalence rates are significantly higher among women and the older age groups. About 10% of those experiencing insomnia state that the complaint is chronic. Chronic primary insomnia results from the reaction to an emotional trigger or stressful event, which leads to the further development of sleep-preventing associations. Chronic secondary insomnia is that related to another mental disorder, a neurologic disease, another sleep disorder, a general medical condition, the effect of a drug of abuse or a medication. Sleep disturbances have also been described in pregnancy and during menopause. In patients with chronic primary insomnia nonpharmacological strategies and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics) are indicated. In patients with secondary insomnia the underlying disorder needs to be treated appropriately. Currently used hypnotics include benzodiazepine derivatives, the cyclopyrrolone zopiclone, the imidazopyridine zolpidem and the pyrazolopyrimidine zaleplon. In patients with chronic insomnia most hypnotics reduce sleep-onset latency, decrease the number of nocturnal awakenings and reduce the time spent awake. The increase in total sleep time is related to greater amounts of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep quality is also improved. Despite consistent effects on sleep-onset latency, zaleplon administration is not associated with significant changes in total sleep time and sleep quality. In contrast to the benzodiazepines and zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon do not suppress slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Sleep laboratory and clinical studies tend to indicate that benzodiazepines are only effective when administered for relatively short periods of time in patients with chronic primary insomnia. Furthermore, a rebound insomnia has been described for short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines. No evidence of tolerance or rebound insomnia has been observed in relation to zolpidem or zaleplon administration.

AB  - Alcohol is an important element in the causal chain of risk for fetal, infant, and childhood mortality. Mortality risk is influenced by interactions of alcohol with other environmental and genetic factors and temporal periods of susceptibility. In this paper we discuss four time periods (preconceptual, gestational, infancy, and childhood) where alcohol use may create a context of risk. Alcohol use in one period increases the risk of alcohol use in subsequent periods. Gestational alcohol use can influence risk of mortality from abuse of mother/fetus, can cause other adverse outcomes, and can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). In infancy alcohol use can increase risk from impairment of arousal in adults who use alcohol. Infants with gestational exposure can be behaviorally difficult with sleep disturbance, irritability, and colic. This can increase the risk of harm or death, especially during periods of caretakers' alcohol use. Caretakers' alcohol use and smoking are strongly correlated. The all-cause mortality rate in people diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is over 5%. All-cause mortality in siblings of diagnosed cases of FAS is increased 530% compared to siblings of matched controls. We recommend that a context of alcohol use be considered as a marker for multifactorial risk in all fetal, infant, and child deaths. A schema to collect data on alcohol use is provided to increase awareness of alcohol use as an environmental risk marker for mortality. Â© 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Activity-rest behavior of 20 neonates born vaginally, 18 neonates born by medically planned Cesarean section (C-section), and 19 neonates born by medically required C-section after labor onset (all born in the thirty-seventh to forty-second week of gestation) was monitored for six successive days starting in the first week of life. Actigraphy was used to record and show time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small wristwatch-like ActiwatchÂ® actometers. Nursing/feeding times were recorded by using the actometers' integrated event marker button. Recordings in both C-section groups were performed in the hospital; for neonates born vaginally and for some born by C-section, recordings were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation. Amount of sleep time during daytime, nighttime, and 24h, as well as sleep bouts during the daytime and nighttime, were compared. The majority of vaginally born neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency in their spectra. In contrast, both groups of neonates born by C-section showed significantly less distinct circadian frequencies in their spectra. All three groups showed a significant difference in amount of nighttime sleep vs. daytime sleep, with more sleep at nighttime. There were no differences in the amount of nighttime sleep, daytime sleep, and sleep time during 24h between the groups born by different delivery modes.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is implicated in the control of circadian rhythms of gonadal function. Although several structures surrounding the SCN are sensitive to the effects of gonadal steroids, similar effects in the SCN remain unclear. For example, there are conflicting data on whether the SCN is sexually differentiated. This study attempted to determine sex differences in the number of SCN cells generated during late gestation, and if testosterone mediates these differences. Pregnant female rats were treated with 5-bromo-2â²-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) on gestational day 18 (E18), the day when aromatase activity peaks in the developing rat fetus. These animals were also given injections of oil or testosterone propionate (10 mg/0.1 ml peanut oil) from E15 until parturition. Litters were allowed to survive until adulthood and were killed on postnatal day 60 (PN60). Following fixation, brain sections containing the SCN from these rats were processed for BrdU immunocytochemistry. A second set of SCN sections was processed for immunocytochemistry detecting BrdU and some of the cell groups prevalent within the SCN. Data showed that female rats have a higher number of cells labeled with BrdU in the SCN, particularly in the medial and caudal SCN. This sex difference was abolished in animals treated with testosterone during late gestation. Double immunocytochemistry revealed that BrdU-labeled cells were neurons expressing calbindin-D28K, vasoactive intestinal peptide and, to a lesser degree, vasopressin. Our results unveiled a previously unknown effect of gonadal steroids on the developing SCN, which may contribute to the emergence of gender-specific circadian rhythms.

AB  - Several studies have indicated that the use of the 24 h mean blood pressure, mainly using reference thresholds derived from general nonpregnancy practice, does not provide an effective test for an individualized early diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy, thus concluding that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not a valid approach in pregnancy. With the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, epidemiologic studies have reported gender differences in the circadian variability of blood pressure and heart rate. Typically, men exhibit a lower heart rate and higher blood pressure than women, the differences being larger for systolic than for diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, normotensive and hypertensive pregnant women are characterized by differing but predictable patterns of blood pressure variability throughout gestation. However, the diminished blood pressure in nongravid women as compared with men, the added decrease in blood pressure during the second trimester of gestation in normotensive but not in hypertensive pregnant women and the large amplitude of the circadian pattern that characterizes the blood pressure of healthy pregnant women at all gestational ages, have not been taken into account when establishing reference thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy. This review will describe these issues, summarize previous results from independent groups on the prognostic value of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in pregnancy, propose answers as to an accurate reference threshold for blood pressure at different stages of gestation and suggest how this information should be used in order to identify those women at a higher risk of hypertension, who will also be more suitable for prophylactic and/or therapeutic intervention in the early stages of pregnancy.

AB  - A significant body of literature has endorsed the view that the sleep of women differs in many respects from that of men. Beyond gender differences, however, are questions about sleep within cohorts of women. For example, in adult women ages 20-45 years, there are women with regular menstrual cycles, women taking oral contraceptives, pregnant and lactating women, and women entering menopause. Given that each of these states is associated with a unique hormonal environment, it is important to determine whether there are clinically significant differences in the sleep of women in these phases of life. This article presents what is known currently about the sleep of women from adulthood through menopause and provides recommendations for evaluation and treatment.

AB  - We report the cases of 2 women with epilepsy who suffered generalized postpartum seizures on the first day after giving birth. The first had a history of febrile convulsions in childhood and had a seizure in the 36th week of gestation due to sleep deprivation. She had received epidural analgesia for labor pain. The second patient had had her most recent crisis at the beginning of the third trimester of pregnancy. Both patients had low serum levels of antiepileptic drugs. The pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs can change during pregnancy, making seizures more difficult to control. Serum levels of these drugs should therefore be monitored more often, given that a generalized maternal seizure can have devastating consequences for the fetus. More careful planning and management of pregnancy is necessary for epileptic patients to ensure successful outcomes for both mother and fetus.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the pathophysiology of acute urinary retention in women with a retroverted gravid uterus and to suggest measures to prevent its recurrence. Methods: In five women with a retroverted gravid uterus and acute urinary retention necessitating catheterization, the morphology of the genitourinary system was assessed by using transabdominal, transvaginal and introital sonography. Results: In the supine resting position, the cervix was displaced superiorly and anteriorly by the impacted and retroverted uterus so that it compressed the lower bladder, leading to obstruction of the internal urethral orifice. The upper bladder extended superiorly and overlay the uterus. During straining, urethral motion was not limited and there was an average rotational angle of the bladder neck of 32Â°, ranging from 21Â° to 44Â°. Increasing abdominal pressure further compressed the lower bladder. Measures suggested to the women for the prevention of urinary retention included limiting fluid intake before sleep, changing from the supine to the prone position before getting up and avoiding a Valsalva maneuver but performing a CredÃ© maneuver during voiding. In all except one case these measures successfully prevented recurrence. Conclusions: Acute urinary retention secondary to a retroverted gravid uterus is caused by a displaced cervix compressing the lower bladder and interfering with drainage to the urethra. The urethra itself is not compressed or distorted. Understanding the pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract may allow maneuvers which prevent acute urinary retention. Copyright Â© 2004 ISUOG.

AB  - Our aim was to determine whether maternal cigarette smoking affects arousal and ventilatory responses to hypoxia in infants. Infants born to non-smoking (NS, n=15) and smoking mothers (SM, n=9) were studied at 2-5 weeks, 2-3 and 5-6 months. Ventilatory responses to 15% O2 were determined preceding arousal. At each age and in both groups, infants aroused more frequently and earlier to hypoxia in active sleep (AS) than quiet sleep (QS). Arousal latency was longer in SM infants (in QS) at 5-6 months (P&lt;0.05). Baseline respiratory parameters were not different between groups, except that, at 2-3 months, SM infants had higher SpO2during AS than NS infants. Maternal smoking did not affect ventilatory responses preceding hypoxia-induced arousal in either sleep-state at any age. We conclude that mild hypoxia stimulates ventilation and arousal in infants up to 6 months and that arousability is depressed in SM infants at 5-6 months; however, ventilatory responses preceding arousal are not adversely affected by smoking.

AB  - Aims. In this work we review the major publications dealing with disorders that affect the digestive system and how they are related to sleep. Development. Sleep disorders occur in 12-25% of the general population and a large percentage of these pathologies are related to disorders of the digestive system. We review the different pathologies and symptoms linked to the digestive tract that give rise to sleep disorders. The study first examined the upper digestive tract, that is, the teeth and teeth grinding, and we then went on to look at gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal motility disorders, peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis, gastric ulcer, irritable bowel, proctalgia, the extent to which the disorders are related to pregnancy, disorders at the paediatric age and eating disorders. Conclusions. Digestive pains during sleep form a heterogeneous clinical picture that disrupts patients' sleep and exerts an influence on their quality of daily living, which in turn may affect sleep and favour the appearance of pains. To date these symptoms have received relatively little attention, but in the few studies that have been carried out, it has not been possible to establish with any degree of accuracy whether sleep and the digestive system share common control mechanisms or not. Research into this type of disorders could help to prevent the appearance of the complications that appear in these clinical pictures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe naturally occurring birth patterns in low-risk women with singleton gestations and spontaneous onset of labor at term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The timing of birth of women who delivered in the low-risk labor unit at Parkland Hospital, Dallas, Texas, between January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2000, was analyzed. Women admitted to this unit were between 360/7 and 416/7 weeks of gestation, were in spontaneous labor, and had a singleton gestation. Women with contraindications to labor, significant medical problems, a known fetal anomaly, and stillbirths were excluded from analysis. The frequency of birth was analyzed in relation to the time of day, day of week, and month of the year. RESULTS: Low-risk women (n = 6,608) met the study criteria and were included in the analysis. No association was found between the day of the week and the frequency of births (P = .31). Births were most common between the hours of 1 to 2 PM and least common between the hours of 10:00 to 12:00 hours (Central Standard Time, P = .04). Births were more common in the fall, September through November, and least common in the winter, December through February. Daylight Saving Time did not affect these results. CONCLUSION: Birth after the spontaneous onset of labor is most common in the early afternoon, and most births occur in the fall. There is no natural association between spontaneous birth in low-risk women and the day of the week. Â© 2004 by The American Colege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Accurate characterization of features of the melatonin production curve is important for research in chronobiology. Local polynomial regression is used to model the plasma melatonin concentration curve and obtain consistent and asymptotically normally distributed estimates of synthesis onset and offset times, duration, peak concentration, and area under the curve. A simple production-clearance model for melatonin kinetics provides the connection between plasma concentrations and the melatonin production curve. This model identifies onset and offset times with critical points of derivatives of the concentration curve. The method proposed has the advantage of flexibility and ease of implementation. Local polynomial regression can be shown to produce consistent estimates of the regression curve and parameters of interest. Furthermore, the method can be implemented in any software package with weighted least squares routines.

AB  - 1. We have previously demonstrated the existence of a dual neuromodulatory regulation of prolactin secretion by the opioid system. In the present work, we evaluated the opioid receptor subtypes involved in both the stimulatory and the inhibitory regulation of prolactin secretion in pregnant rats. 2. Specific opioid agonists and antagonists were administered intracerebro ventricular (i.c.v.) to rats on day 3 and on day 19 pregnancy in rats of pretreated with mifepristone. Blood samples were obtained after decapitation at 12.00 and 18.00 h. Serum prolactin levels were measured by RIA. 3. The Î¼-selective agonist DAMGO and Î²-endorphin caused a significant increase in serum prolactin secretion on day 3 of pregnancy, during the diurnal surge and intersurge period. Pretreatment with naloxone prevented the increase on prolactin levels induced by DAMGO. The administration of U-50,488, a Îº-selective agonist or DPDPE, a Î´-selective agonist, did not modify serum prolactin concentration while the Î¼1-antagonist naloxonazine reduced significantly serum prolactin levels. On day 19 of pregnancy, the release of prolactin induced by mifepristone was significantly increase by naloxonazine, while the Îº-antagonist nor-binaltorfimine induced only a small but significant increase. No effect was observed after administration of the Î´-antagonist naltrindole. 4. We conclude that the Î¼-opioid receptor seems to be more specifically involved in both the stimulatory and inhibitory regulation by the opioid system on prolactin secretion during pregnancy. The increase on serum prolactin levels on day 3 after administration of DAMGO and Î²-endorphin may suggest the participation of other regulatory mechanisms as the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems. On day 19, only the endogenous ligands Î´ did not participate in the regulation of prolactin secretion, while the participation of the Îº-opioid receptor was significantly less effective than the endogenous ligand Î¼. Our results provide evidences of an important role of the opioid system through specific receptors on the regulation of prolactin secretion during early and late pregnancy.

AB  - Background. Back pain during late pregnancy is a frequent clinical problem. Very little is known about the impact of this symptom on the quality of life among pregnant women with back pain. Objectives. To study the influence of back pain and physical ability on quality of life in late pregnancy. Methods. One hundred and sixty women in the 34th-37th week of pregnancy and attending two different midwife receptions, were asked to fill out questionnaires including: general questions about background factors, the Disability Rating Index (DRI) to score the physical ability, and The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) for assessing health-related quality of life. Two groups were defined, with and without back pain. Results. One hundred and thirty-six (85%) out of 160 screened women returned the questionnaire for evaluation. The 69 (51%) women with back pain rated significantly (p < 0.05) higher on the DRI; on NHP part I, sub scales sleep, energy, pain, physical functioning and total score; and on NHP part II, aspects occupation, ability to perform jobs around the house, social life and hobbies compared with women without back pain. Conclusions. Irrespective of back pain the pregnant women studied featured lower quality of life (QOL) compared with published data on healthy women. Among the women with back problems, who had the most impaired QOL, the factors affecting QOL were mostly related to physical ability.

AB  - Objective: Bipolar disorder affects 0.5%-1.5% of individuals in the United States. The typical age at onset is late adolescence or early adulthood, placing women at risk for episodes throughout their reproductive years. General guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder are available from the American Psychiatric Association, but additional issues arise when these guidelines are applied in the treatment of peripartum women. The authors summarize knowledge regarding the management of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period, with a focus on managing mania, hypomania, and the psychotic components of the illness. Method: An expert panel reviewed articles that address the management of bipolar disorder and the consequences of the use of mood stabilizers during pregnancy, and a consensus document was generated. Results: The treatment of bipolar disorder in pregnant women involves significant challenges. Some mood stabilizers, e.g., sodium valproate and carbamazepine, are human teratogens. On the other hand, the teratogenicity associated with lithium may have been overestimated in the past. Conclusions: Since treatment can be managed most effectively if pregnancy is planned, clinicians should discuss the issue of pregnancy and its management with every bipolar disorder patient who has childbearing potential, regardless of future reproductive plans. Additional research should address the risks of disturbed sleep to pregnant and postpartum women with bipolar disorder, as well as structural and behavioral consequences to offspring when mood stabilizers are used during pregnancy. Longitudinal and cohort studies can promote these efforts. Given the rate of bipolar disorder in the general population, research efforts will need to be broad based and include multiple collaborating centers.

AB  - The developmental decrease in rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep in man occurs between birth and after puberty. We hypothesize that if this decrease in REM sleep does not occur, lifelong increases in REM sleep drive may ensue. Such disorders are characterized by hypervigilance and sensory-gating deficits, such as are present in postpubertal onset disorders like schizophrenia, panic attacks (a form of anxiety disorder), and depression. The decrease in REM sleep in the rat occurs between 10 and 30 days of age. We studied changes in size and physiological properties of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) cells involved in the control of arousal, i.e., waking and REM sleep. During the largest decrease in REM sleep (12-21 days), cholinergic PPN neurons doubled in cell area, the hypertrophy peaking at 15-16 days, then decreasing in area by 20-21 days. Noncholinergic PPN cells did not change in area during this period. We confirmed the presence of two populations of PPN neurons based on action potential (AP) duration, with the proportion of short-AP-duration cells increasing and long AP duration decreasing between 12 and 21 days. Most cholinergic and noncholinergic cells had short AP durations. Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) duration became segregated into long and short AHP duration after 15 days. Cells with short AP duration also had short AHP duration. The proportion of PPN cells with Ih current increased gradually, peaking at 15 days, then decreased by 21 days. These changes in morphological and physiological properties are discussed in relation to the developmental decrease in REM sleep.

AB  - We have compared 430 healthy Swedish infants born between 1991 and 1995 with 599 healthy, six months old infants born in 2002, regarding the prevalence of risk factors for SIDS. Following the introduction of the campaign to reduce the risk of SIDS in Sweden in 1992, we could see a decrease in prone sleeping from 32 % to 7 % together with an increase in supine sleeping from 35 % to 44 %. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has gone down from 24 % to 10 %. The prevalence of breast feeding, already high in Sweden in the 90s, was largely unchanged, 69 % at six months of age in 2002. This comparison shows that parents of small infants have accepted the advice on ways to reduce the risk of SIDS, and that information given at infant welfare clinics is still effective ten years later. Further improvements are possible by changing the side sleeping position to supine, and by decreasing tobacco smoking among pregnant mothers.

AB  - Chong et al. examined risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) before and after the start of the Swedish campaign to reduce the risk of SIDS. They found that maternal smoking was the strongest risk factor for SIDS in the post-campaign compared to the pre-campaign period. Conclusion: After successful results of the SIDS campaigns to prevent prone sleeping, strong efforts need to be undertaken to eliminate maternal smoking during pregnancy altogether without replacing cigarette smoking with other nicotine delivery devices such as snuff, gum or patches.

AB  - Aims: To determine whether combined pre- and postnatal nicotine exposure compared with prenatal exposure alone results in more compromised postnatal hypoxia defense mechanisms and further alteration of the postnatal breathing pattern (reduced tidal volume and increased respiratory rate). Methods: Seven lambs exposed to nicotine prenatally (pN) (approximate maternal dose: 0.5 mg/kg/d) and seven lambs exposed to nicotine pre- and postnatally (ppN) (postnatal dose: 1.6-2 mg/kg/d) were studied without sedation at an average age of 5 d and 21 d during resting (room air) conditions, during exposure to 10% O2 and during a brief exposure to 100% O2. Results: Resting minute ventilation, occlusion pressure, effective impedance, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were similar in the two groups during wakefulness and quiet sleep. Resting tidal volume was significantly higher in ppN than in pN lambs during wakefulness (9.4 Â± 0.7 vs 7.7 Â± 1.4 ml/kg, p &lt; 0.05) and quiet sleep (9.8 Â± 0.6 vs 7.6 Â± 1.5 ml/kg, p &lt; 0.01) at 5 d and also at 21 d during wakefulness (7.7 Â± 1.0 vs 6.2 Â± 1.1 ml/kg, p &lt; 0.05). The ventilatory, heart rate and blood pressure responses to hypoxia were comparable in the two groups during both activity states. Time to arousal from quiet sleep in response to hypoxia was equivalent in the two groups. The ventilatory response to hyperoxia was not significantly different in the two groups during either activity state. Conclusion: Continued postnatal nicotine exposure after prenatal exposure did not further compromise hypoxia defense mechanisms after birth.

AB  - Aim: To assess the change of risk factors that are specific to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after the initialization of a campaign to reduce the risk (RTR) of SIDS compared to non-SIDS postneonatal deaths. Methods: Data were extracted from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, 1982-1991 and 1993-1998. 1105 infants died from SIDS during the postneonatal period, 2115 postneonatal deaths were from other causes and 11050 live birth controls were selected. Risk factors previously identified to be related to SIDS were defined as high parity, prematurity, young maternal age, low Apgar score, birth during the night, single motherhood, multiple births, maternal smoking, male gender, short length standard deviation score (SDS) and small weight-to-length SDS. Results: Non-SIDS deaths were more significantly related to a low 5-min Apgar score, smaller weight-to-length SDS, and/or short length SDS values; while SIDS deaths were more closely related to mothers with higher parity or multiple births, mothers who smoked during pregnancy and single-parent (mother) families. Maternal smoking was even more prominent among SIDS deaths in the post-campaign period. The adjusted odds ratios, compared with non-SIDS deaths, increased from 1.84 (95% CI: 1.48, 2.28) in the pre-campaign period to 4.11 (95% CI: 2.72, 6.21) in the post-campaign period. Conclusions: Maternal smoking during pregnancy remains the most important modifiable risk factor for SIDS in the post-campaign period in comparison with non-SIDS postneonatal deaths. Other than putting babies in a supine sleeping position, maternal smoking should be the next most important issue to be considered, if there is to be a second campaign.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. The effect of maternal smoking on apnea and arousal patterns in preterm infants is currently unknown. Multichannel polysomnographic studies were performed in preterm infants. Thirty infants were enrolled into the study: 16 exposed prenatally to cigarette smoke (S) and 14 control infants (C). There was no difference in the gestational and postconceptional ages at the time of study. Maternal smoking was associated with a significant increase in the apneic index in these infants (28.6 Â± 6.4/ hour [S] vs. 13.2 Â± 3.9 [C]; p < 0.05), and the difference was noted for obstructive events and only during active sleep. The arousal index was significantly decreased in the maternal smoking group (34.5 Â± 2.3/hour [S] vs. 46.3 Â± 5.6/hour [C]; p < 0.05), with a specific decrease in percentage of arousal after respiratory events (10.7 Â± 2.1% [S] vs. 29.4 Â± 5.4% [C]; p < 0.05). In conclusion, preterm infants exposed prenatally to cigarette smoke have increased respiratory events during active sleep, predominantly due to obstructive apnea, and possibly a higher arousal threshold during apneic events. These alterations in respiratory and arousal patterns in preterm infants born to smoking mothers may lead to significant vulnerability in this population.

AB  - A new luminescence-enhanced enzyme immunoassay (LEIA) has been developed and validated for the direct measurement of cortisol in saliva and serum. It has been demonstrated that this LEIA has a very good analytical and functional sensitivity. There was a good correlation to a commercial RIA. The assessment of diurnal cortisol profiles of healthy persons are discussed. Cortisol monitoring is indicated in diseases with abnormal glucocorticoid production such as Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease. Because of the diurnal fluctuation of cortisol levels it is necessary to take several samples for an individual cortisol profile or during dynamic tests like the dexamethasone-suppression or ACTH stimulation. Salivary sample collection is an alternative method without the stress of repeated venipuncture. The measurement of cortisol in saliva is advisable in patients with abnormal cortisol-binding-globulin (CBG) levels such as pregnancy, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome or marked adipositas and during the administration of certain drugs, especially oral contraceptives.

AB  - We assessed the correlation between the rhythm ofmelatonin concentration and circadian blood pressure patterns in normal and hypertensive pregnancy. Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure and blood samples every 4 h were monitored in 16 primigravidae who had shown an abnormal circadian blood pressure pattern (eight pre-eclamptic and eight normotensive) in pregnancy and 6-12 months after pregnancy. The circadian rhythm was analyzed by chronobiological measures. Eight normotensive women with maintained blood pressure rhythm served as controls. During pregnancy, melatonin concentration was significantly higher in pre-eclamptic than in normotensive women (pre-eclampsia, 29.4 Â± 1.9 pg/ml, normotensin, altered rhythm, 15.6 Â± 2.1; controls, 22.7 Â± 1.8; p < 0.001) This difference faded after pregnancy, owing to the fall observed in pre-eclampsia (11.8 Â± 3.2 pg/ml, 9.8 Â± 2.1, and 11.1 Â± 2.0, respectively; NS). The rhythm of melatonin concentration was lost in all pregnant women with loss of blood pressure rhythm. After pregnancy, normotensive women showed a reappearance of both melatonin and blood pressure rhythm, whereas pre-eclamptic women showed a reappearance of blood pressure but not melatonin rhythm. The loss of blood pressure rhythm in pregnancy is consistent with the loss of melatonin concentration rhythm. In pre-eclamptic women, the normalization of blood pressure rhythm, while melatonin rhythm remained altered, suggests a temporal or causal priority of circadian concentration of melatonin in the determination of blood pressure trend.

AB  - Background: Bright light therapy was shown to be a promising treatment for depression during pregnancy in a recent open-label study. In an extension of this work, we report findings from a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study. Method: Ten pregnant women with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly assigned from April 2000 to January 2002 to a 5-week clinical trial with either a 7000 lux (active) or 500 lux (placebo) light box. At the end of the randomized controlled trial, subjects had the option of continuing in a 5-week extension phase. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version was administered to assess changes in clinical status. Salivary melatonin was used to index circadian rhythm phase for comparison with antidepressant results. Results: Although there was a small mean group advantage of active treatment throughout the randomized controlled trial, it was not statistically significant. However, in the longer 10-week trial, the presence of active versus placebo light produced a clear treatment effect (p = .001) with an effect size (0.43) similar to that seen in antidepressant drug trials. Successful treatment with bright light was associated with phase advances of the melatonin rhythm. Conclusion: These findings provide additional evidence for an active effect of bright light therapy for antepartum depression and underscore the need for an expanded randomized clinical trial.

AB  - Background: The tolerance-hyperbaric test has been shown to provide a valuable approach for the prediction of the outcome of pregnancy. In this test, diagnosis of hypertension is based on the hyperbaric index (area of blood pressure excess above the upper limit of a reference threshold) calculated by comparison with a time-specified tolerance interval for the circadian variability of blood pressure. Objective: To evaluate prospectively the stability and reproducibility of the tolerance-hyperbaric test. Methods: We studied 403 women who provided 2430 blood pressure series sampled for 48 consecutive hours once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (mostly within the first trimester of gestation) until delivery. Circadian 90% tolerance limits for blood pressure were established as a function of trimester of gestation from 497 series previously sampled from an independent reference group of 189 normotensive pregnant women. Diagnosis of hypertension was established in this trial for each woman in the validation sample on the highly restricted basis of presenting at least one blood pressure profile with a hyperbaric index above the threshold for diagnosis after 20 weeks of gestation. Results: Sensitivity of the tolerance-hyperbaric test was 93% for women sampled during the first trimester of gestation, and increased to 99% by the third trimester. Specificity was more than 99% in all trimesters. The positive and negative predictive values were greater than 96% in all trimesters. Conclusions: The tolerance-hyperbaric test represents a reproducible, stable, non-invasive and high-sensitivity test for the very early identification of subsequent hypertension in pregnancy.

AB  - During recent decades, the development of ultrasonic techniques has enabled the direct visualization of fetal life in utero. Real-time recording of fetal activity in various periods of gestation and the analysis of behavioral patterns have resulted in the detailed description of sequential changes in fetal behavior and provided information about the functional development of the fetal central nervous system. It is generally accepted that patterns of fetal activity reflect the development and maturation of the central nervous system. Therefore, the distinction between normal and abnormal fetal behavior could make possible the detection of discrete structural brain abnormalities. Fetal behavioral patterns throughout gestation and their correlation with structural developmental events are discussed in this review. Â© 2004 Parthenon Publishing.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of two synthetic progestagen preparations Chlormadinone acetate (CAP, ChronosynÂ®, Veterinaria AG ZÃ¼rich) and Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, NadigestÂ®, G Streuli & Co. Uznach) on cycling activity and fertility in sheep. A flock of 28 non pregnant white alpine sheep was randomly divided into three groups, A (n = 10), B (n = 9) and C (n = 9). During a period of 4 weeks the cycling activity was confirmed by blood progesterone analysis. Thereafter, the animals of group A were treated with 50 mg CAP, those of group B with 140 mg MPA and those of group C with physiological saline solution. All injections were given intramuscularly. Suppression of endogenous progesterone secretion lasted from 28 to 49 days (xÌ = 39 days) in group A and from 42 to 70 days (xÌ = 50 days) in group B. The synchronization effect of both preparations was unsatisfactory as the occurrence of first estrus was distributed over a period of 3 weeks in group A and 4 weeks in group B. These findings could also be confirmed by the lambing period which lasted 52 days in group A and 36 days in group B. Control animals lambed within 9 days due to the synchronizing effect of the ram. The first fertile estrus was observed 36 days (group A) and 45 days (group B) after the treatment. In group A all 10 animals and in groups B and C 8 of 9 ewes each became pregnant. Parenteral progestagen application with CAP and MPA is a simple, safe and reversible method of estrus suppression in the sheep. The minimal suppressive duration of 4 (CAP) and 5 weeks (MPA) is not sufficient when a period of 3 months (alpine pasture period) is desired.

AB  - The parturition behaviour of 82 multiparous and 46 primiparous native goats, maintained under extensive management system (10Â° N.L.) was observed. The animals were separated from the flock according to the behavioural signs around time of kidding. The signs were udder turgency, isolation, restlessness, searching for the most suitable space for kidding, repeatedly lying down and standing and, intolerance. The contractions phase lasted 2.06h and does remain in recumbent position; for primiparous it was 2.35h (0.40-8.30h) and for multiparous was 1.5h (0.18-6.30h). The different stages of the expulsion phase had a mean duration of 25.8 min, 32 and 22 min for primiparous and multiparous respectively. The phase between the rupture of the foetal bag and presentation of the fore-hooves and muzzle of the kid was the more prolonged (13.9 min; P<0.05). Foetal expulsion was more frequent in the standing position (65.2 and 70.7% for multiparous and primiparous respectively) specially in longitudinally superior presentation (95.7%). Time of placenta expulsion was 2.15h (0.45-2.43h) for primiparous and 2h (0.30-2.25h) for multiparous. Mean duration of single birth was 4.38h and lasted 5.22 and 4.13h for primiparous and multiparous respectively (P<0.01). For multiple births the intervals between the first and second (9.4 min) and second and third kid (6 min) extended the duration of the partum to 4.47 and 4.53h respectively. A circadian regulation of the labour process was confirmed by the diurnal pattern of birth time (78% between 6 am and 6 pm) and the higher frequencies between 6 am and 12 m (56.3%). The contact with the placenta expulsed was lower in multiparous (39%) than in primiparous (54.3%) as well as the partial placentophagy (17.1 vs 23.9% respectively). Mortality at birth was 2.2 and 3.5% for does and kids respectively. The mean body weight of mothers and kids was 27.8Â±5.1k and 2.54Â±0.6k respectively. Dystocia, retained placenta or metritis were not observed. In 75% of the goats a fall of body temperature between 0.6 and 1.1Â°C (mean 0.82Â°C) before 24-48h of kidding was observed. However, differences were not significant due to great individual variability, which affect it value as a predictor of the parturition (P>0.05).

AB  - One of the central issues in developmental neurology is the need to formulate concepts helping to understand human behavior, which reflects the central nervous system from early intrauterine age to the young infant and even up to adulthood. Real-time ultrasound observations have been used from the early 1980s onwards to witness the origin, occurrence and developmental course of specific fetal movement patterns emerging during early prenatal life. A large variety of movement patterns has been observed: startles; general movements; breathing movements; head, trunk and extremity movements; jaw openings; yawning; sucking; swallowing; hiccups; and hand/face contacts. In combination with fetal heart rate monitoring, two-dimensional ultrasound has been used in the third trimester to document the development of fetal behavioral states continuing from pre- to postnatal life. In the early 1990s we started to perform longitudinal examinations in twin pregnancies observing similar movement patterns to those in singletons. In multiple pregnancies, the inter-twin variance of different subsets and the possible impact of internal and external parameters can be studied. In addition, we have studied inter-twin reactions towards touch, reflecting the development of both initiative and sensitivity towards touch and finally the first inter human contacts. Here we describe some essential issues of the documentation of fetal behavior in singleton and twin pregnancy. Â© 2004 Parthenon Publishing.

AB  - Fetal behaviors gradually integrate into more complex movements in relation to each other along with functional central nervous system development. Investigating the ontogenesis of fetal behavior made it possible to allow prenatal localization of functional brain impairment, however, it is still difficult to deduce higher brain function in human fetuses. Fetal learning has the potential to be a new parameter to deduce higher brain function in the human fetus. We investigated fetal learning from a behavioral development perspective assessed by a conventional parameter, i.e. eye movement patterns. After at least 32 weeks of gestation, the fetuses presented habituation to vibro-accoustic stimulation. Fetuses less developed required significantly more trials to show habituation than developed fetuses from a behavioral standpoint even at the same gestational age. Three- or four-dimensional ultrasound evaluation also provides new findings in fetal behaviors in early gestation. These methods could be new parameters to assess fetal brain function, however, it is necessary to choose appropriate parameters and to develop easy and ubiquitous criteria, which cover higher brain function throughout the entire gestational stage.

AB  - Aims: To investigate the influence of analytical design on the variability of published results in studies of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Methods: The results of a prospective case-control study, of 203 cases of SIDS, and 622 control infants are presented. All variables significant on univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model analysed in nine stages, starting with sociodemographic variables, then sequentially and cumulatively adding variables relating to pregnancy history, current pregnancy, birth, the interval from birth to the week prior to death, the last week, the last 48 hours, and the last sleep period. A ninth stage was created by adding placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period. Results: As additional variables are added, previously published SIDS risk factors emerged such as social deprivation, young maternal age, â¥3 previous live births, maternal smoking and drinking, urinary tract infection in pregnancy, reduced birth weight, and the infant having an illness, regurgitation, being sweaty, or a history of crying/colic in the interval from birth to the week before death, with co-sleeping and the lack of regular soother use important in the last sleep period. As the model progressed through stages 1-9, many significant variables became non-significant (social deprivation, young maternal age, maternal smoking and drinking) and in stage 9 the addition of placed to sleep prone for the last sleep period caused â¥3 previous live births and a reduced birth weight to become significant. Conclusion: The variables found to be significant in a case-control study, depend on what is included in a multivariate model.

AB  - The advent of psychotherapeutic drugs has enabled management of mental illness and other neurological problems such as epilepsy in the general population, without requiring hospitalization. The success of these drugs in controlling symptoms has led to their widespread use in the vulnerable population of pregnant women as well, where the potential embryotoxicity of the drugs has to be weighed against the potential problems of the maternal neurological state. This review focuses on the developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of five broad categories of widely available psychotherapeutic drugs: the neuroleptics, the antiepileptics, the antidepressants, the anxiolytics and mood stabilizers, and a newly emerging class of nonprescription drugs, the herbal remedies. A brief review of nervous system development during gestation and following parturition in mammals is provided, with a description of the development of neurochemical pathways that may be involved in the action of the psychotherapeutic agents. A thorough discussion of animal research and human clinical studies is used to determine the risk associated with the use of each drug category. The potential risks to the fetus, as demonstrated in well described neurotoxicity studies in animals, are contrasted with the often negative findings in the still limited human studies. The potential risk for the human fetus in the continued use of these chemicals without more adequate research is also addressed. The direction of future research using psychotherapeutic drugs should more closely parallel the methodology developed in the animal laboratories, especially since these models have already been used extremely successfully in specific instances in the investigation of neurotoxic agents.

AB  - Depression is more prevalent in women than in men, which may be related to biological, hormonal, and psychosocial factors. Four depressive conditions are specific to women: premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), depression in pregnancy, postpartum depression, and depression related to perimenopause or menopause. Antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and venlafaxine has demonstrated efficacy in PMDD. Both continuous and intermittent dosing regimens were effective at usual but not at low dosages. Despite reluctance of some women to take medication for depression during pregnancy and breastfeeding, substantial evidence suggests that antidepressants are safe and efficacious during these periods, while untreated depression has negative consequences for both mother and child. In peri- or postmenopausal women with depression, estrogen may enhance the effects of antidepressant medications, although a pooled analysis of data in women aged 50 years or over treated with venlafaxine found that remission rates were similar in those who were taking estrogen and those who were not. The management of women with depression can be done safely and effectively using antidepressants and alternative interventions throughout the life cycle.

AB  - Clinical and laboratory investigations starting in 1958 of a group of dwarfed children resembling isolated GH deficiency but who had very high serum levels of GH led to the description of the syndrome of primary GH resistance or insensitivity (Laron syndrome) and subsequently to the discovery of its molecular defects residing in the GH receptor and leading to an inability of IGF-I generation. With the biosynthesis of IGF-I in 1986, therapeutic trials started. Continuously more and more patients are being diagnosed in many parts of the world with a variety of molecular defects. This syndrome proved to be a unique model that enables the study of the consequences of GH receptor defects, the physiopathology of GH-IGF-I disruption, and comparison of the GH-independent IGF-I effects. This review presents the personal experience gained from the study follow-up and treatment of the 60 patients followed up for many years in the Israeli cohort.

AB  - Background and objective: Combined spinal-epidural is an alternative technique to epidural analgesia for labour, but its benefits are not clearly identified. Methods: A prospective, blinded, randomized study was undertaken involving 113 women attending a university hospital obstetric department. Analgesia was initiated with intrathecal bupivacaine 0.25% 1 mL + sufentanil 5 Î¼g in the combined spinal-epidural group (n = 54), and with bupivacaine 0.125% + epinephrine 2.5 Î¼g mL-1 + sufentanil 7.5 Î¼g in the epidural group (n = 59). In both cases this was followed by patient-controlled epidural analgesia with bupivacaine 0.125% (+ sufentanil 0.25 Î¼g mL -1). Duration of labour, quality of analgesia and side-effects were compared between groups. Results: In the combined spinal-epidural group, the onset of analgesia was faster (5 vs. 15 min, P &lt; 0.001), the consumption of bupivacaine was lower (7.5 vs. 11.3 mg h-1, P = 0.003) and there was less unilateral analgesia (14.8% vs. 40.7%, P = 0.002) than in the epidural group. The characteristics of labour were similar in both groups. However, in the combined spinal-epidural group, there was a higher incidence of posterior presentation (25.9% vs. 10%, P = 0.03), pruritus (P &lt; 0.001), hypotension (P = 0.002), somnolence (P = 0.01), nausea (P = 0.02) and one case of meningitis. Conclusions: The combined spinal-epidural technique provided more effective analgesia during labour than epidural analgesia alone but offered no other advantage. It induced more adverse effects and this should be considered before routinely using the combined spinal-epidural technique.

AB  - Circadian pacemakers drive many daily molecular, physiological and behavioural rhythms. We investigated whether the main olfactory bulb is a functional circadian pacemaker in rats. Long-term, multielectrode recordings revealed that individual, cultured bulb neurons expressed near 24-h oscillations in firing rate. Real-time recordings of Period1 gene activity showed that a population of cells within the bulb expressed synchronized rhythmicity starting on embryonic day 19. This rhythmicity was intrinsic to the mitral, and not the granule, cell layer, entrainable to physiological temperature cycles and temperature compensated in its period. However, removal of the olfactory bulbs had no effect on running wheel behaviour. These results indicate that individual mitral/tufted cells are competent circadian pacemakers which normally synchronize to each other. The daily rhythms in gene expression and firing rate intrinsic to the olfactory bulb are not required for circadian patterns of locomotion, indicating that they are involved in rhythms outside the canonical circadian system.

AB  - In order to longitudinally analyze the diurnal variations in fetal heart rate (FHR) baseline, 24-h FHR recordings were made at 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36 weeks for a normal pregnant woman. Significant diurnal variations were found in all gestational weeks. The amplitude of diurnal variation increased with advancing gestation. The FHR baseline at 00:00-09:00 hours significantly decreased from 24 to 30 weeks, while that at 15:00-21:00 hours decreased after 27 weeks. These findings suggest that the changes in the diurnal variations of FHR baseline with advancing gestation reflect the process of development of the fetal nervous system.

AB  - We measured core body temperatures of three pregnant ewes and their fetuses by means of chronically implanted temperature-sensitive data loggers. In standard laboratory conditions (dry-bulb temperature 20-22Â°C) core body temperatures of pregnant sheep and their fetuses during the last trimester of pregnancy demonstrated a constant feto-maternal temperature gradient, and a daily thermal circadian rhythm for the mother and fetus with a small amplitude (<1Â°C). When the same pregnant ewes were transferred to a natural field habitat where dry-bulb temperature varied between 7Â°C and 27Â°C in a 24h period, there was a marked increase in the amplitude of ewe nychthemeral temperature rhythms (â¼2Â°C). There was similarly an increase in fetal temperature rhythms, but the variations were smaller. Immediately after birth in the field, the core temperature of newborn lambs fell by up to 4.5Â°C. Thereafter, newborn lambs increased their core body temperatures and appeared to regulate core temperature and daily temperature rhythms at the same levels that they were as fetuses. Only in the second month post-birth do lamb core temperatures and temperature rhythms begin to resemble those of adult sheep. We have shown that fetal thermal protection, which is evident in ewes housed in in-door conditions, persists in natural field conditions also, where fetuses appear to be more protected from night-time falls- than daytime rises in maternal core temperature.

AB  - Background. Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV), increased alveolar difference for oxygen and, in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related disturbances, these changes could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Objectives. Because of conflicting data from respiratory sleep studies in pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 21 pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO 2) in the supine and sitting positions. Methods. We tested 21 healthy pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation. Arterial samples were taken in the sitting position. Complete polysomnography was performed in all of the pregnant women. Before the polysomnography arterial samples were taken in the supine and sitting positions and then every 2 h until termination of the study. Results. We did not find any correlation between SaO2/PaO 2 levels and apnea, hypopnea or percent of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea was significantly lower during pregnancy (5.81 Â± 2.1 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) than postpartum (12.1 Â± 2.7 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) (p &lt; 0.001), which may be due to the raised level of progesterone. The PaO 2 levels in the supine position were significantly lower than in the sitting position at 36 weeks of gestation (p &lt; 0.001). No differences were found between PaO2 levels in the sitting and supine positions postpartum (p &lt; 0.5). Conclusions. According to our results we conclude that 1) the frequency of apnea and hypopnea in pregnancy was significantly lower than postpartum, and 2) a significant difference in PaO2 levels in the sitting and supine positions was observed at 36 weeks of gestation.

AB  - Objective: To determine the relationship between umbilical venous (UV) volume flow and fetal behavioral states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep) in normal pregnancies at 36-40 weeks of gestation. Methods: Fetal behavioral states were established in 17 normal pregnancies by means of combined assessment of fetal heart rate patterns (FHRP), and fetal eye and body movements. UV vessel area (mm2) as obtained by tracing the inner vessel area using Labview and Imaq Vision software and UV time-averaged flow velocity (mm/s Doppler) were multiplied to calculate UV volume flow (mL/min) including flow/kg fetus. The pulsatility index (PI) in the umbilical artery was also determined. In each woman, all parameters were measured between three and five times in each behavioral state. Data are reported as mean Â± 1 SD and analyzed by paired t-test. Results: No statistically significant behavioral-state-related changes were observed for UV time-averaged velocity and UV volume flow, resulting in UV volume flow/kg fetus of 69.1 Â± 14.9 mL/min*kg at 1F and 71.6 Â± 12.1 mL/min*kg at 2F (not significant). A statistically significant increase (P = 0.02) was established for UV cross-sectional area (46.4 Â± 8.6 mm2 vs. 49.0 Â± 10.1 mm2) and for fetal heart rate (FHR) from 134.2 Â± 10.3 bpm in 1F to 144.2 Â± 7 bpm in 2F. Umbilical artery PI was not significantly different between the two behavioral states. Conclusions: On the basis of high venous vessel wall compliance, the significant increase in UV cross-sectional area during fetal behavioral state 2F may be determined by a rise in mean venous pressure. The significant rise in FHR may reflect increased fetal cardiac output during state 2F while the resistance at the hepato-ductal pathway remains relatively constant with the purpose of meeting raised energy demands during the active sleep state. This is further supported by the observed trend towards an increase in UV volume flow. Copyright Â© 2004 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the human declines from â¼50% of total sleep time (â¼8 h) in the newborn to â¼15% of total sleep time (â¼1 h) in the adult, and this decrease takes place mainly between birth and the end of puberty. We hypothesize that without this developmental decrease in REM sleep drive, lifelong increases in REM sleep drive may ensue. In the rat, the developmental decrease in REM sleep occurs 10-30 days after birth, declining from >70% of total sleep time in the newborn to the adult level of â¼15% of sleep time during this period. Rats at 12-21 days of age were anesthetized with ketamine and decapitated, and brain stem slices were cut for intracellular recordings. We found that excitatory responses of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) neurons to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid decrease, while responses to kainic acid increase, over this critical period. During this developmental period, inhibitory responses to serotonergic type 1 agonists increase but responses to serotonergic type 2 agonists do not change. The results suggest that as PPN neurons develop, they are increasingly activated by kainic acid and increasingly inhibited by serotonergic type 1 receptors. These processes may be related to the developmental decrease in REM sleep. Developmental disturbances in each of these systems could induce differential increases in REM sleep drive, accounting for the postpubertal onset of a number of different disorders manifesting increases in REM sleep drive. Examination of modulation by PPN projections to ascending and descending targets revealed the presence of common signals modulating ascending arousal-related functions and descending postural/locomotor-related functions.

AB  - Objective. This is a prospective study of the effects of maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy on newborn neurobehavioral integrity, including systematic measures of behavioral state, sleep organization, motor activity, heart rate variability (HRV), tremulousness, and startles. Methods. The sample included 17 SSRI-exposed and 17 nonexposed, full-birth-weight newborn infants who had no obvious medical problems and were matched on maternal cigarette use, social class, and maternal age. SSRI exposure was determined by medical records and maternal self-report during a standard interview. Behavioral state, startles, and tremulousness were evaluated for 1 hour between feedings. Automated recordings of motor activity and HRV were also assessed during a 15-minute subset sleep period. HRV was subjected to spectral analysis to detect rhythms in autonomic regulation. Exposed and nonexposed infant groups were compared on measures of neurobehavioral development both before and after adjustment for gestational age as a covariate. Results. SSRI-exposed infants had a shorter mean gestational age; were more motorically active and tremulous; and showed fewer rhythms in HRV, fewer changes in behavioral state, fewer different behavioral states, and a lower peak behavioral state. SSRI-exposed infants also had significantly more rapid eye movement sleep, which was characterized by longer continuous bouts in that state and higher numbers of spontaneous startles or sudden arousals. After effects of gestational age were covaried, significant differences continued to be found in tremulousness and all measures of state and sleep organization, but effects on startles, motor activity, and rhythms in HRV were no longer significant. Conclusions. Results provide the first systematic evidence that women who use SSRIs during pregnancy have healthy, full-birth-weight newborn infants who show disruptions in a wide range of neurobehavioral outcomes. Effects on motor activity, startles, and HRV may be mediated through the effects of SSRI exposure on gestational age. Future research can lead to a better understanding of the effects of SSRI use during pregnancy and an improved public health outcome.

AB  - The effects of noise on health, especially that of children, were reviewed. (1) From the point of view of disturbance of daily living, subjective recognition of "noisiness" is an important issue in relation to the study of noise. Concerning the effects of airplane noise on school children, while no effects on the hearing level were detected, a significant increase in the complaint of "noisiness" was observed. (2) Exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be associated with a decrease in the body weight of newborn babies. Moreover, the height of 3-year-old boys and girls was found to be significantly decreased in association with increase in the environmental noise. (3) Noise levels that seemed to have some influence on the sleep of adults did not affect the sleep of children. (4) In a group of children living in noisy districts exhibiting poor academic performance, the academic performance seemed to become progressively worse as the school grade advanced. (5) No consensus has been arrived at in regard to headphone-induced hearing impairment. Researches and studies effective enough to influence policy decisions must be continually conducted in the future, with appropriate control for related factors.

AB  - Background: After striking changes in rates of sudden unexplained infant death (SIDS) around 1990, four large case-control studies were set up to re-examine the epidemiology of this syndrome. The European Concerted Action on SIDS (ECAS) investigation was planned to bring together data from these and new studies to give an overview of risk factors for the syndrome in Europe. Methods: We undertook case-control studies in 20 regions. Data for more than 60 variables were extracted from anonymised records of 745 SIDS cases and 2411 live controls. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for every factor in isolation, and to construct multivariate models. Findings: Principal risk factors were largely independent. Multivariately significant ORs showed little evidence of intercentre heterogeneity apart from four outliers, which were eliminated. Highly significant risks were associated with prone sleeping (OR 13.1 [95% CI 8.51-20.2]) and with turning from the side to the prone position (45.4 [23.4-87.9]). About 48% of cases were attributable to sleeping in the side or prone position. If the mother smoked, significant risks were associated with bed-sharing, especially during the first weeks of life (at 2 weeks 27.0 [13.3-54.9]). This OR was partly attributable to mother's consumption of alcohol. Mother's alcohol consumption was significant only when baby bed-shared all night (OR increased by 1.66 [1.16-2.38] per drink). For mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, OR for bed-sharing was very small (at 2 weeks 2.4 [1.2-4.6]) and only significant during the first 8 weeks of life. About 16% of cases were attributable to bed-sharing and roughly 36% to the baby sleeping in a separate room. Interpretation: Avoidable risk factors such as those associated with inappropriate infants' sleeping position, type of bedding used, and sleeping arrangements strongly suggest a basis for further substantial reductions in SIDS incidence rates.

AB  - It has been suggested that shift work, night work in particular, affects worker's psychophysical health. However, the effects of night work on the health of pregnant women are not physiologically well elucidated. The effects of night work on the biological function of pregnant women were studied in the present study. Three pregnant and six non-pregnant nurses that engaged in fast-rotating shift system cooperated for the study. The 24-h urine samples were collected in two time frames, daytime (07:00 to 23:00) and nighttime (23: 00 to 07:00) on the day shift, the night shift and the days off. Urinary concentrations of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and norepinephrine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and estriol by radioimmunoassay. The excretion profiles of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the pregnant and the non-pregnant women were altered on the night shift, which might relate the derangement of circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion. The urinary norepinephrine level during the night work was considerably higher in the pregnant women, which indicated the presence of higher physical burden in them due to the night work. The urinary estriol level was not significantly affected by shift, day/night and individual factors, and the effect of night work on urinary estriol level of the pregnant women remained uncertain. The results of the present study suggested that the night work of the pregnant shift workers should be much more relieved.

AB  - Studies based on office blood pressure measurements concluded that parity has significant effects on blood pressure during pregnancy. The authors evaluated possible differences in the circadian pattern of blood pressure as a function of parity in normotensive women systematically studied by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. They analyzed 1400 blood pressure series sampled for 48 consecutive hours every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery in 234 women. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group (nulliparous vs. multiparous) and trimester of gestation was established by population multiple-component analysis. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern, described by a model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 hours, was demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (p<0.001). There was no significant difference in 24-hour mean among groups divided by parity at any stage of pregnancy (p>0.315). Data obtained from systematic ambulatory monitoring in normotensive pregnant women indicate the lack of differences in blood pressure according to parity. Reference thresholds for blood pressure in pregnancy could thus be developed as a function of rest-activity cycle and gestational age only, independent of parity.

AB  - Background. Circadian variation may affect many biological and pharmacological phenomena. Methods. To assess circadian variations in labour pain perception, 222 consecutive nulliparous women with uncomplicated pregnancy, spontaneous labour, cervical dilatation (3-5 cm), ruptured membranes and normal fetal heart rate tracings were studied. Visual analogue pain scores (VAPS) were analysed and divided into four periods: night (1:01 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.), morning (7:01 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.), afternoon (1:01 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and evening (7:01 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.). VAPS were also compared between daytime (morning+afternoon) and nocturnal (evening+night) periods. Results. Daytime mean VAPS were lower than nocturnal scores [75.6 (15.1) vs 85.7 (14.1), P<0.0001]. VAPS were lower in the morning than in the afternoon, evening and night periods (ANOVA, P<0.0001). Conclusion. Labour pain perception appears to be chronobiological, and this might be taken into account when enrolling parturients in studies designed to assess or treat labour pain.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate whether maternal blood cortisol acts as an entrainer of the fetus, we compared diurnal variations in the fetal heart rate (FHR) of two cases with Cushing's syndrome, under condition of glucocorticoid replacement therapy after adrenalectomy. Subjects: The Maternal cortisol concentration in Case 1 showed bimodal change, at 31 and 38 weeks' gestation, while the concentration in Case 2 was found to have an abnormally high level with no diurnal variation at 30 weeks and a monomodal pattern at 34 weeks. Results: The FHR patterns in both cases demonstrated similar developmental change: a remarkable diurnal rhythm comparable to control cases was observed at 34-38 weeks. Analysis of spectral 1/f characteristics revealed, however, that Case 1 exhibited a pattern equivalent to control cases, whereas in Case 2, FHR values did not display overt diurnal variation. Conclusions: The diurnal rhythm of FHR develops irrespective of daily variation in maternal cortisol concentration. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether self-initiated and recorded automated blood pressure measurement can provide an accurate estimate of ambulatory blood pressure in pregnant women suspected of having 'white coat hypertension'. Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: Women's and Children's Health Unit, St George Hospital, a teaching hospital of the University of New South Wales. Population: Pregnant women being assessed for possible 'white-coat hypertension'. Methods: Sixty-six pregnant women who were undergoing 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in their home or work environment also measured their blood pressure six times during this interval using a self-initiated automated blood pressure recorder (Omron HEM 705CP). Agreement between awake ABPM and Omron recorded blood pressures was tested by Bland-Altman analysis. Main outcome measure: Limits of agreement between blood pressures measured by each device. Results: Average blood pressures obtained by the two devices were identical (125/77 mmHg) but limits of agreement were wide, -20 to +23 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and -9 to +15 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion: The Omron HEM 705CP is a useful device for measuring group average blood pressures in pregnant women suspected of having white coat hypertension but cannot reliably replace ABPM for clinical management of individual pregnant women.

AB  - Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of valproate (VPA) has been discussed in relation to the risk and prevention of VPA teratogenicity. Prospective epidemiological studies have shown that high VPA dosages (â§1,000 mg/day) and high VPA concentrations (â§70 Î¼g/ml) together with VPA polypharmacy (especially coadministration with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs) are regarded as clinical risk factors for increased VPA teratogenicity. An animal experiment has also shown that high peak concentration after single dosing of VPA during the early stage of pregnancy correlates well with the incidence of neural tube defects. All of these risk factors enhance metabolic conversion from VPA to its toxic metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-en). On the other hand, the use of slow-release formulation of valproate (VPA-SR) results in reduced formation of 4-en as well as decreased diurnal fluctuations in VPA concentrations. These pharmacokinetic and metabolic alterations by using VPA-SR may be helpful in reducing VPA teratogenicity. We therefore recommend that high VPA dosages, high VPA concentrations and VPA polypharmacy should be avoided in epileptic women of childbearing age. Conventional VPA, when used in these subjects, should be replaced with VPA-SR before pregnancy to diminish the risk of VPA teratogenicity.

AB  - Background: Measurement of plasma total homocysteine has become common as new methods have been introduced. A wide range of disorders are associated with increased concentrations of total homocysteine. The purpose of this review is to provide an international expert opinion on the practical aspects of total homocysteine determinations in clinical practice and in the research setting and on the relevance of total homocysteine measurements as diagnostic or screening tests in several target populations. Methods: Published data available on Medline were used as the basis for the recommendations. Drafts of the recommendations were critically discussed at meetings over a period of 3 years. Outcome: This review is divided into two sections: (a) determination of homocysteine (methods and their performance, sample collection and handling, biological determinants, reference intervals, within-person variability, and methionine loading test); and (b) risk assessment and disease diagnosis (homocystinuria, folate and cobalamin deficiencies, cardiovascular disease, renal failure, psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment, pregnancy complications and birth defects, and screening of elderly and newborns). Each of these subsections concludes with a separate series of recommendations to assist the clinician and the research scientist in making informed decisions. The review concludes with a list of unresolved questions. Â© 2004 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

AB  - An experimental model of ascending placentitis was developed in the mare to characterize the uterine myoelectrical pattern in late gestation and determine how ascending placentitis altered this pattern. In experiment 1, myometrial electrical activity was analyzed during the early morning, late morning and evening hours in four mares in the last 15 days of gestation to identify patterns of activity. In experiment 2, nine mares received intra-cervical inoculations of Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus. Myoelectrical activity in the early morning and evening hours in these mares was compared with four control mares. In experiment 1, the number of spike burst clusters > 30 s was greater in the evening than in the late morning hours (P < 0.04). Spike burst activity (number Ã duration) of mares in experiment 1 was similar during day and night recordings until the last 6 days of gestation when it gradually increased each evening until parturition (P < 0.05). In experiment 2, control mares experienced a gradual increase in the number of small spike burst clusters in the last 6 days (P = 0.008) and an increase in large and small spike burst clusters in the evening hours in the last 4 days of gestation (P = 0.03). Mares with experimentally induced placentitis never exhibited a rise in spike burst clusters but had an increase in the mean duration and activity index of large spike burst clusters in the 4 days before parturition (P < 0.04). In conclusion, control mares had a progressive, reversible rise in myoelectrical activity at night in the week preceding parturition. This was not observed in mares with experimentally induced placentitis. They exhibited an increase in the intensity and duration of large spike burst clusters possibly in response to local inflammation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the tolerance, compliance and problems associated with usage of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) by pregnant women with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Patients and method: Twelve pregnant women diagnosed with SDB received polysomnography (PSG) at entry, CPAP titration, repeat PSG at 6 months gestation (GA) and home monitoring of cardio-respiratory variables at 8 months GA. Compliance was verified by the pressure at the mask. Results from the Epworth sleepiness scale, fatigue scale and visual analogue scales (VAS) for sleepiness, fatigue, and snoring were compared over time. Results: All of the subjects had full term pregnancies and healthy infants. Nightly compliance was at least 4 h initially and 6.5 h at 6 months GA. Nasal CPAP significantly improved all scales compared to entry. VAS scores remained lower at 6 months GA compared to entry. Re-adjustment of CPAP pressure was needed in six subjects at 6 months GA. Conclusion: Nasal CPAP is a safe and effective treatment of SDB during pregnancy. Â© 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sleep patterns and dream content may be affected by stressful life events such as pregnancy loss. Women who are pregnant subsequent to a prior pregnancy loss tend to have anxious and emotionally charged experiences during their pregnancies. Dreams can affect pregnancy outcomes, specifically premature birth. This qualitative study is the first investigation to explore sleep disturbances caused by dreams as experienced by a diverse group of women pregnant subsequent to a pregnancy loss. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 4 categories of dreams. We offer clinical assessment and intervention strategies to support these women prenatally and present suggestions for research to facilitate our understanding of their experiences.

AB  - Environmental-factor changes may largely be accountable for the dramatic increase of obesity prevalence in industrialized countries. This study investigated the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and various socioeconomic, clinical, behavioural and reproductive factors in a population from Southern France. Using a cross-sectional study, a sample of 3127 current and former salaried workers (1658 men and 1469 women) completed a questionnaire on personal and medical histories, and had a clinical examination including height and weight measurements. Age-adjusted and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. The overall prevalence of obesity (BMI Ã£Â¢Ã¢â¬Â°ÃÂ¤ 30kg/m2) was 9.8% and was higher in men than in women (11.1 versus 8.3%). Multivariate analyses showed that in both sexes, low educational level, television watching, low physical activity and ex-smoking habits, were independently associated with a higher BMI. Furthermore, in women, we found independent and positive associations between BMI and the number of naps per week, short sleep duration, daily alcohol consumption, the number of pregnancies, early age at menarche or the non-use of oral contraceptives. Our results reveal the complexity that exists between BMI and environmental factors and stress the need to analyse and to handle these factors simultaneously. Â© 2004, European Society of Cardiology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the sleep patterns and fatigue of both mothers and fathers before and after childbirth. The authors used wrist actigraphy and questionnaires to estimate sleep and fatigue in 72 couples during their last month of pregnancy and 1st month postpartum. Both parents experienced more sleep disruption at night during the postpartum period as compared to the last month of pregnancy. Compared to fathers, with their stable 24-h sleep patterns over time, mothers had less sleep at night and more sleep during the day after the baby was born. Sleep patterns were also related to parents' work status and type of infant feeding. Both parents self-reported more sleep disturbance and fatigue during the 1st month postpartum than during pregnancy. Mothers reported more sleep disturbance than fathers, but there was no gender difference in ratings of fatigue. At both time points, fathers obtained less total sleep than mothers when sleep was objectively measured throughout the entire 24-h day. Further research is needed to determine the duration of sleep loss for both mothers and fathers, to evaluate the effect of disrupted sleep and sleep loss on psychosocial functioning and job performance, and to develop interventions for improving sleep patterns of new parents.

AB  - Retrospective (questionnaire) and prospective (5-day diary) self-reports of sleep were obtained from 209 women during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. On average, the women slept for 465 min, took around 20 min to get to sleep, and were awake for just over 30 min after initial sleep onset having woke 2.6 times on average. Sleep efficiency was around 89%. Significant differences were found between retrospective and prospective reports only on the number of minutes awake after sleep onset and on sleep efficiency. However, these differences were small. Retrospective and prospective reports were only moderately correlated. These results were not markedly different from values reported in much smaller, previous studies of pregnant women using polysomnography, suggesting that the self-reports were valid. The findings suggest that sleep parameters are not as adversely affected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy as is generally believed.

AB  - A case of ruptured aneurysm in pregnancy treated by embolization is reported. A 27-year-old, previously healthy woman was admitted to her family hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department in the 28th week of gestation. She was sleepy and complained of headache and nausea. On admission to our hospital, her Glasgow coma scale was 12, but she had no neurological deficit. A computed tomography scan of the head revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral angiography showed a saccular aneurysm at the left vertebral-posterior inferior cerebellar artery junction. She was treated by endovascular approach with Guglielmi detachable coils. Successful maternal and fetal outcomes were achieved. After 35th week of gestation, she gave birth to a healthy infant by cesarean section. After 16th weeks' gestation, side effects for the fetus from radiation, iodized contrast material and general anesthesia are considered rare. Coil embolization of an aneurysm in pregnancy is the favorable method as is clipping.

AB  - This review will focus on the development of behavioural states and breathing during early developmental stages prior to term gestation. Although these behavioural states are immature during early development, their cyclicity is clearly seen. Preterm infants characteristically have a large proportion of indeterminate sleep and small amount of wakefulness. Whereas oxygenation is relatively stable during active and quiet sleep in ventilated preterm infants, indeterminate sleep and arousals are associated with hypoxaemic episodes. Arousals have also been linked to apnoea in spontaneously breathing infants. Since well-defined sleep cycles are beneficial for the oxygenation of preterm infants, we should explore ways to promote their natural sleep while they are exposed to neonatal intensive care. Care practices such as clustering procedures, kangaroo care and optimal positioning have been shown to improve the integrity of sleep. Optimizing the sleep cycling might improve the long-term outcome of preterm infants. More studies in this area are clearly needed. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Across the life cycle of women, the quality and quantity of sleep can be markedly impacted by internal (eg, hormonal changes and vasomotor symptoms) and external (financial and child-care responsibilities; marital issue) factors. This paper will outline some of the major phases of the life cycle in women that have been associated with sleep problems. The main messages from this paper include 1) that very little systematic, large-scale research has been performed in virtually every area reviewed; and 2) once identified, the sleep problem is generally best addresed by the standard therapeutic approach, except in the case of preganant and lactating women in the concern for the fetus and child must be considered in the treatment decision. This paper is organized into sections that address sleep problems associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, postpartum, and perimenopause. Anecdotal reports treatment that address the specific physical discomfort experienced by the woman (eg, analgesics for premenstrual pain, pregnancy pillows for backache, and hormone replacement therapy for hot flashes). The importance of developing standard treatment recommendations is stressed because the develoment of chronic insomnia has been linked to precipitating events. In addtion, primary sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome) have been shown to increase during pregnancy and menopause, but treatment recommmendations may be contraindicated or are not specific for women.

It is a relatively common but frequently unrecognized disorder, with a prevalence ranging from 2.5 to 15% of the general population, increasing with age and with a female preponderance. The diagnosis is clinical but polysomnography is useful to determine its profound impact on sleep (difficulties in sleep onset, maintaining sleep during the night, and sleep fragmentation) and for the evidence of periodic legs movements during sleep and wake. RLS is generally idiopathic, with familial association in 40-60% of the cases, but may also be symptomatic of such associated conditions (secondary forms) as peripheral neuropathies, uremia, iron deficiency (with or without anemia), diabetes, Parkinson's disease and pregnancy. Response to dopaminergic drugs indicates that dopamine receptors are implicated, and although much progress has been made in diagnosis and treatment in the last decade, more is needed for complete elucidation of the etiology and pathophysiology of RLS.

AB  - The benefits of antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy remain uncertain. Blood pressure control to prevent or correct severe hypertension can avert maternal target organ damage and may allow obstetricians to prolong pregnancy or avoid hospitalization. Several factors limit the conclusions derived from systematic review of the available studies, including failure to distinguish among women with preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or whose hypertension antedated pregnancy. As well, the application of consensus guidelines is limited by the unfortunate tendency to measure blood pressure by use of oscillometric devices rather than auscultation. We review the basis for using specific antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy and highlight important shortcomings in therapeutic knowledge that should be addressed in future studies.

AB  - Objectives: We hypothesized that mother-infant bed sharing, compared to solitary sleeping, would be associated with higher infant heart rates. The objective was to compare infant heart rates between the 2 environments and, secondarily, to test for relationships between heart rate and other, previously reported, differences in the same infants. Design: Heart rate was measured in 15 infants over a bed-sharing night and a solitary-sleeping night. Eight of the 15 infants routinely bed shared with the mother at home; the other 7 routinely slept in a room alone. Setting: The Sleep Disorders Center, University of California, Irvine Medical Center. Participants: Fifteen mother-infant pairs who met criteria for routinely bed sharing or sleeping solitarily. All were healthy, and infants were more than 38 weeks gestation at birth and 11 to 15 weeks old at the time of the study. Interventions: None. Results: Analysis of variance indicated that, irrespective of routine sleeping condition, heart rate was lower during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing in all sleep stages. Significant regressions were found with infant temperature. Heart-rate variability was higher during solitary sleeping than during bed sharing (both routine groups) in stages 1 and 2 and rapid eye movement sleep, but only stages 1 and 2 sleep effects were independent of basal heart rate. Conclusions: Infant heart rate is affected by the mother's presence in the sleep environment. The increase in sympathetic activity in stages 3 and 4 and rapid eye movement sleep might be partly explained by differences in thermoregulation between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments. These results support the notion that sensory differences between bed-sharing and solitary-sleeping environments account for some of the physiologic differences between infant sleep in the 2 sleeping conditions.

AB  - The risks and benefits of psychopharmacological treatment in pregnancy need careful consideration. Conventional antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants are relatively safe for the foetus. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear to be safe, but mood stabilisers such as lithium, sodium valproate and carbamazepine are associated with increased foetal malformations. Benzodiazepines in the first trimester are teratogenic, and in high dosage can also cause withdrawal symptoms, hypotonia and agitation in the newborn. Women taking atypical antipsychotics should be switched to conventional antipsychotics before they conceive. In women with long-term mental illness necessitating psychotropic medication, effort should be made to stop polypharmacy and non-essential medication (e.g. benzodiazepines) and to decrease the dose of essential drugs, after full assessment. There is rarely a valid reason to stop essential drug treatment during pregnancy.

AB  - Study Objectives: Recent studies suggest a specific association between intrauterine growth restriction that commonly occurs in preeclampsia and decreased maternal cardiac output. Sleep is associated with marked hypertension in preeclampsia. We therefore aimed to determine how sleep influences other hemodynamic parameters in preeclampsia, specifically to determine if sleep-induced exacerbation of hypertension was associated with reductions in cardiac output. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial of nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Setting: King George V, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Patients: Twenty-four women with severe preeclampsia and 15 control nulliparous subjects. Intervention: Full polysomnography including beat-to-beat blood-pressure recording. Stroke volume, heart rate, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and ejection duration were derived from the blood pressure waveform. Half of the 24 preeclamptic subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure and the other half to receive no treatment. Measurements and Results: Heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output were similar in controls and patients with preeclampsia during wakefulness, while total peripheral resistance was significantly elevated. Sleep induced marked decrements in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output in preeclamptic subjects and resulted in further increments in total peripheral resistance. Cardiac output during sleep was correlated with fetal birth weight (r2 = 0.64, P < .001). When preeclamptic subjects were treated with continuous positive airway pressure, reductions in cardiac output were minimized, while increments in total peripheral resistance were also reduced. Conclusions: These data indicate that sleep is associated with adverse hemodynamic changes in women with preeclampsia. These changes are minimized with the use of continuous positive airway pressure. Reduced cardiac output during sleep may have an adverse effect on fetal development.

AB  - This review, although not exhaustive, provides information on the potential impact of psychiatric illness on obstetric outcome. There is clear evidence that psychiatric illness poses a risk to pregnancy outcome. The reproductive safety data on many of the available treatments fail to demonstrate a clear risk from treatment. The medications with clear teratogenic, neonatal, and developmental risks are, not surprisingly, those used to treat some of the most severe and debilitating psychiatric illnesses. Even the amount of information available is inadequate without some straightforward clinical guidelines. A model of risk for illness and treatments of illnesses during pregnancy developed by the authors' group [237] reminds clinicians that nonexposure does not exist. Rather, the decision is which type of exposure is in the best interest of the patient and family-exposure to illness or exposure to treatment. Regardless of the choice, clinicians are encouraged to think in terms of reducing the total number of exposures; that is, if choosing to treat, patients should be kept well by adjusting and monitoring medications-partial treatment simply provides exposure to illness and treatment. Guidelines to accomplish the goal of minimizing exposures include: 1. Treating women of reproductive capacity from the first visit as if they are pregnant: choosing treatments with reproductive safety information (eg, new and improved = no data) and providing supplemental folic acid for all women (800 Î¼g), with higher doses for those treated with anticonvulsants (3 to 4 mg). 2. For women who conceive while taking a medication, and if it was efficacious for them, then the majority of decisions for medication selection should be considered already made for pregnancy and lactation (eg, do not switch medications once pregnant or for breastfeeding, as that simply exposes the baby to a second medication and the data previously discussed do not apply). 3. Because the serum concentration of most medications decreases during pregnancy, establishing criteria a priori for increasing the maternal daily dose; as a general rule, sleep patterns are good markers of psychiatric illnesses. 4. Always preferring monotherapy to two medications. 5. Obtaining up-to-date information at www.emorywomensprogram.org (a website with links to many support groups, reproductive safety registries) or other women's health websites. These basic guidelines can help decrease the number of exposures and aid in conducting clinical care with at least some reproductive safety data.

AB  - This review addresses the maternal and perinatal benefits and risks of antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy. It covers the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy (with a brief discussion of ambulatory blood pressure measurement) followed by both the general principles of management of pregnancy hypertension and the specifics of individual antihypertensive drugs and drug classes. Discussion is focused on quantitative overviews of randomised, controlled trials, although observational literature is also discussed, particularly in reference to the potential teratogenicity of agents and the safety of their administration to nursing mothers. The treatment of severe hypertension is addressed separately from the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension, for which the maternal and fetal risks are substantially different. 2004 Â© Ashley Publications Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature surrounding women's psychological health in pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal periods. The content will provide clinically useful information to midwives and health care professionals involved in caring for women during the antenatal, intranatal and postnatal periods. The impact of psychological health status in pregnancy on clinical outcomes such as preterm labour, pre-eclampsia, epidural use, caesarean section, instrumental deliveries and increased rates of admission to neonatal intensive care, alongside the cognitive and social development of the infant and child are well documented. Less research to date has considered the impact of psychological well-being on the mother throughout pregnancy, the peripartum, postpartum and beyond. Psychological status for these women has traditionally been characterised by anxiety and depression, largely ignoring the complex psychological interrelations that characterise pregnancy. Psychological status in pregnancy cannot be defined within a unidimensional framework but must include a comprehensive assessment of all the dimensions that attribute to mood and emotional status for women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. This paper intends to address the constructs of anxiety and depression, worry, control, quality of life, sleep and self-esteem. Screening for, and identification of, maternal psychological distress from a multidimensional perspective enables healthcare professionals to recognise and acknowledge normal and abnormal adjustment and offer interventions, strategies and support to facilitate a woman's transition to motherhood.

AB  - Good airway management technique is an essential skill for physicians in most specialties. This article begins with a review of basic airway anatomy and the physiology of the uninstrumented airway. This subject is of particular importance given the increasing use of procedural sedation and the increased recognition of sleep-disordered breathing in infants and children. A discussion of the various artificial airways and their advantages and disadvantages follows. The difficult airway is an important contributor to both patient morbidity and mortality. It is important to have a planned management approach available for the anticipated and, more importantly, the unanticipated difficult airway. The recommendations of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Taskforce on the Management of the Difficult Airway have good application for this important problem. The fetus with the prenatal diagnosis of a lesion that predicts a difficult airway presents a particular challenge. The utilization of an ex-utero intrapartum treatment method is presented as an important approach for the delivery and airway management of these infants. This section closes with a discussion of the prehospital airway management of the pediatric patient. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exacerbation of certain medical conditions during specific phases of the menstrual cycle has long been recognized. Mechanisms of the cyclic variations are poorly understood, but are often attributed to fluctuations in reproductive hormones. We hypothesize that normal variations in autonomic balance during the menstrual cycle, which likely evolved as adaptations for reproduction, may contribute to catamenial variations in diseases independent of hormonal variations. Emerging evidence suggests that autonomic balance shifts towards sympathetic bias during the second half of the menstrual cycle. This shift can be seen as an evolutionary adaptation to address the immunologic and physiologic demands for successful implantation and gestation. Through direct modulation of lymphoid system and activation of the cortisol pathway, sympathetic bias promotes a shift to relative T helper (Th)-2-biased immunity which may favor maternal tolerance of the embryo by attenuating Th-1-mediated interference of implantation. Immune variance during the menstrual cycle has been implicated in menstrual fluctuations of many diseases, but until now the immune variance has been attributed to female hormonal changes. We propose that shifts in autonomic balance independently contribute to fluctuations in diseases by modulating the immune system. Still further, we propose that many other diseases fluctuate due to the direct nervous system actions of shifts in autonomic balance. Our hypothesis portends new therapeutic paradigms based on cyclical modulation of autonomic balance to address catamenial variations of medical conditions. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Disparities in maternal and infant health have been observed among members of different racial and ethnic populations and persons of differing socioeconomic status. For the Healthy People 2010 objectives for maternal and child health to be achieved (US Department of Health and Human Services. Healthy People 2010. 2nd ed. With understanding and improving health and objectives for improving health [2 vols.]. Washington DC: US Department of Health and Human Services, 2000), the nature and extent of disparities in maternal behaviors that affect maternal or infant health should be understood. Identifying these disparities can assist public health authorities in developing policies and programs targeting persons at greatest risk for adverse health outcomes. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2000-2001. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants. PRAMS employs a mixed mode data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of different perinatal health behaviors and experiences among women delivering live infants in 31 states and New York City. This report summarizes data for 2000-2001 from eight states (Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, and North Carolina) on four behaviors (smoking during pregnancy, alcohol use during pregnancy, breastfeeding initiation, and use of the infant back sleep position) for which substantial health disparities have been identified previously. RESULTS: Although the prevalence of each behavior varied by state, consistent patterns were observed among the eight states by age, race, ethnicity, education, and income level. Overall, the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy ranged from 9.0% to 17.4%. Younger (aged <25 years) women, white women, American Indian women, non-Hispanic women (except in Hawaii), women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes consistently reported the highest rates of smoking. Overall, the prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy ranged from 3.4% to 9.9%. In seven states, women aged >35 years, non-Hispanic women, women with more than a high school education, and women with higher incomes reported the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. Overall, the prevalence of breastfeeding initiation ranged from 54.8% to 89.6%. Younger women, black women, women with a high school education or less, and women with low incomes reported the lowest rates of breastfeeding initiation. The size of the black-white disparity in breastfeeding varied among states. Overall, use of the back sleep position for infants ranged from 49.7% to 74.8%. Use of the back sleep position was lowest among younger women, black women, women with lower levels of education, and women with low incomes. Ethnic differences in sleep position varied substantially by state. INTERPRETATION: PRAMS data can be used to identify racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in critical maternal health-related behaviors. Although similar general patterns by age, education, and income were observed in at least seven states, certain racial and ethnic disparities varied by state. Prevalence of the four behaviors among each population often varied by state, indicating the potential impact of state-specific policies and programs. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: States can use PRAMS data to identify populations at greatest risk for maternal behaviors that have negative consequences for maternal and infant health and to develop policies and plan programs that target populations at high risk.sk. Although prevalence data cannot be used to identify causes or interventions to improve health outcomes, they do indicate the magnitude of disparities and identify populations that should be targeted for intervention. This report indicates a need for wider targeting than is often done. The results from this report can aid state and national agencies in creating more effective public health policies and programs. The data described in this report should serve as a baseline that states can use to measure the impact of policies and programs on eliminating these health disparities.

AB  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the term first proposed in 1969 for a distinctive subgroup of unexpected infant deaths occurring during the first months of life, with relatively consistent clinical, epidemiological and pathological features, which remain unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including a complete autopsy, examination of death scene and review of clinical history. Sudden infant death unnecessary means SIDS. According to definition, SIDS remains a diagnosis of exclusion, distinguished from others only by subjective and permissive variables. Despite the vague and permissive nature of the definition, epidemiological studies identified some risk factors as prematurity and social disadvantage. Nevertheless, the most interesting findings are those related to environmental and care features, as drug addiction and/or smoke exposition during pregnancy, sleep position of the infant, environmental temperature, parental bed sharing and breast feeding. Those factors play a variable role, but their correction reduced SIDS incidence. Sudden infant death is a diagnosis made by expert pathologists with pediatrician's and investigator's advice, based primarily on autopsy findings and death scene investigation performed through the severe application of investigative protocols.

AB  - Dopaminergic agents, particularly dopamine agonists, have been used with increasing frequency in the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder. These evidence-based practice parameters are complementary to the Practice Parameters for the Treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, published in 1999.1 These practice parameters were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding the dopaminergic treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The following recommendations serve as a guide to the appropriate use of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Levodopa with decarboxylase inhibitor, and the dopaminergic agonists pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole are effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Other dopamine agonists (talipexole, cabergoline, piribidel, and alpha-dihydroergocryptine) and the dopaminergic agents amantadine and selegiline may be effective in the treatment of RLS and PLMD, but the level of effectiveness of these medications is not currently established. Lastly, no specific recommendations can be made regarding dopaminergic treatment of children or pregnant women with RLS or PLMD.

AB  - The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored a "Workshop on Alcohol Use and Health Disparities 2002: A Call to Arms," on December 5, 2002, in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. This workshop was part of the NIAAA/NIH comprehensive strategic plan to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, health disparities. Eleven topics were addressed: (1) biomedical risk factors that may contribute to disparities in the toxic effects of alcohol; (2) alcohol and gene-environment interactions that affect the health of diverse groups; (3) alcohol pharmacogenetics in Mexican-Americans; (4) determinants of risk for alcoholism in minority populations; (5) consideration of population groups in linkage-disequilibrium studies to identify genes associated with alcohol dependence; (6) interaction between alcohol dependence and African-American ethnicity in disordered sleep, nocturnal cytokines, and immunity; (7) disparities of brain functional reserve capacity affecting brain morbidity related to substance abuse; (8) alcohol and pregnancy disparities; (9) role of alcohol in cancer risk disparities; (10) ethnic diversity in alcoholic cardiomyopathy; and (11) postmenopausal health disparities. On the basis of these presentations, seven conclusions emerged: (1) Genetic variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes exist in various populations. (2) These enzymes play a role in the variation in health effect outcomes seen in different populations, owing to alcohol consumption. (3) Differences between and among population groups can be critically important for the design and interpretation of studies in genetics. These include differences in expression of phenotype, in locus heterogeneity, in risk alleles, and in population structure. (4) Incidence rates for fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are greater in African-Americans and Native-Americans than in Caucasians. Genetic polymorphisms, nutrition, and other factors may account for these differences. (5) The highest mortality rate for cirrhosis has been found in white Hispanic men. (6) Mexican-Americans have a low frequency of the protective alleles ADH1B*2 and ALDH2*2 and a relatively high frequency of CYP2E1 c2, which is associated with early onset alcoholism. (7) The incidence rate for cancer is greater for African-Americans than for Caucasians, and part of the higher risk may be attributed to heavier drinking. Â© 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Study Objective. To evaluate the clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction of long-term danazol delivered vaginally as treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding. Design. Prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). Setting. University hospital. Patients. Twenty premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial polyps. Intervention. After curettage or hysteroscopic-directed biopsies, women used one 200-mg tablet of danazol vaginally every day, continuing the therapy as long as they were totally satisfied with it. Measurements and Main Results. Women were instructed to keep a diary of menstrual bleeding and to rate blood loss on a visual analog scale from zero (no blood loss) to 10 (gushing-type bleeding). They were seen every month for 3 months, then every 3 months for 9 months, and then every 6 months for 4 years for Papanicolau smear, pelvic examination, and transvaginal ultrasonography. They were asked to bring their diary of menstrual bleeding. They were asked about side effects and their satisfaction with the therapy. Peripheral blood was drawn for blood count and serum chemistries. Hysteroscopic-directed biopsies were repeated after 3 months of therapy in women with endometrial hyperplasia. The severity of blood loss was significantly reduced in all women after 3 months of treatment. All women with endometrial hyperplasia had regression of hyperplastic endometrium. None of the women with endometrial polyps had sonographic signs of recurrence during therapy. Only 10 women (50%) completed 1-year follow-up, and only 5 women (25%) completed 5-year follow-up. Conclusion. These results suggest that long-term administration of vaginal danazol after curettage or hysteroscopic-directed biopsy is both efficacious and safe in women with heavy menstrual bleeding, but the rate of discontinuance is high.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the frequency of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) among unselected term newborns, using newborn behaviour data only. Methods: This hospital-based prospective exploratory study used clinical observations of newborn behaviours, mothers' observations of their newborns and newborn chart data to determine the prevalence of suspected and confirmed cases of NAS in a convenience sample of unselected term newborns "rooming in" with their mothers in a large central city acutecare referral hospital. Over a 4-month period, 824 out of 1008 newborns were observed at between 8 and 30 hours of life by specially trained nurse observers. Behaviours recorded and their weighting were adapted from the Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (NASS) by Finnegan and Kaltenbach. Newborns with scores of 5 or greater and "suspect for NAS" were referred to their physicians for confirmation or refutation of the clinical findings. The prevalence of "suspect for NAS" and confirmed NAS as well as of individual neonatal behaviours, was calculated. Results: Thirty-one (3.8%) of 824 term "rooming in" newborns were identified with findings suggestive of NAS. Four newborns were positively identified as having NAS and treated. The identification was confirmed by post hoc affirmation of maternal drug use. Individual behaviours occurring in 10% or more of newborns included excessive sneezing, nasal stuffiness, unsustained suck tremor, and abnormal nipple latch. Conclusions: Clinical observation of newborn behaviour may identify NAS. Further studies are recommended to correlate this methodology with laboratory findings, as are more in-depth maternal questionnaires concerning use of mood-altering substances. The Prevalence of NAS is likely underestimated because of early hospital discharge. A coordinated system of early identification and infant-specific assessment and treatment, both in hospital and following discharge home is advocated. Â© 2004.

AB  - Summary. In Germany there are several commited self-help groups as well as numerous medical authorities and specialist associations which however haven't got together yet in order to set up a systematic health education campaign. So far the knowledge of other professional fields like that of graphic designers, specialists of communication and public health scientists hasn't been sufficiently used to familiarize nearly all pregnant women, parents, grandparents and babysitters with those known medical subject matters. Hopefully paediatricians, gynaecologists, children's nurses, midwives, breast-feeding consultants, paediatric preventive assistants, consultants for pregnant women who smoke and mothers in general will soon start to get going an effective lasting and possibly nationwide preventive campaign which will be supported by the competent social ministries and financing authorities, self-help groups, graphic designers, specialists for communication and public health scientists. The aim should be to reduce the amount of sudden infant death cases to or even below the level of The Netherlands (minimum figure in 2002: 0.11 SID cases per 1.000 live births). Already in 1972-15 years before the beginning of the Dutch preventive campaign - in former East Germany a ministerial instruction had advised mothers not to let infants sleep on prone position. Historically, the promotion of infants sleeping on prone position seems to have been a tragic break of tradition in the western world in between 1970 and 1990, as infants had been put to sleep almost only on their back during the past centuries. If we compare East and West Germany concerning the influence on the ways of looking after infants since the 1960th of the last century it has become clear that the advice of medical authorities mainly effects the way of nursing regardless of the political system. More and more, paediatricians, gynaecologists, midwives and children's nurses should become aware of this responsibility.

AB  - In the current study, design and success of intervention programmes to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in Austria are described and major future challenges indicated. Various prevention programmes are being carried out in the federal states of Austria and they focus on the detailed information of parents about modifiable SIDS risk factors. Relevant topics such as guidelines for home monitoring are carefully addressed in the Austrian consensus statements. With the introduction of the first campaigns SIDS incidence rates have gradually dropped from 1.69 (1988) to 0.51 per 1000 life births (2000). In line, there was a decline in the prevalence of risk behaviour, especially of the prone sleeping position (federal state of the Tyrol: 53.7% before the campaign (1984-1994) vs. 4.7% thereafter (1995-2001), p < 0.001). Because of this latter trend smoking during pregnancy became the most prevalent SIDS risk factor and the prevalence of the side sleeping position substantially increased. To maintain the current success in lowering SIDS frequency, prevention programmes ought to continue and changes in the weight of risk factors should be considered. Further efforts are required to achieve a thorough post-mortem examination in virtually all sudden unexpected deaths, to establish a country-wide SIDS data base and to continuously update SIDS risk profiles in Austria.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that chronic morphine treatment of pregnant rats alters maternal behavior. Other studies have shown long-term effects of prenatal exposure to morphine, including changes in reproductive behavior in adult females. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal morphine exposure on a variety of maternal behaviors such as nursing, maternal activities, nonmaternal activities, and pup retrieval Prenatal morphine exposure increased active and decreased passive nursing. There were no differences in maternal activities such as presence in the nest, contact with pups, grooming of pups, and/or manipulation of nest shavings. In the retrieval test, prenatally morphine-exposed mothers were faster in carrying the first pup, retrieving the first pup back to the nest, and returning all pups to the nest than prenatally saline-exposed mothers. Maternal and nonmaternal activities also were affected by the light:dark cycle. All saline- and morphine-exposed mothers nursed more, were more often in the nest, and more often in contact with greater than half of their litter during the light than the dark sessions. On the other hand, nonmaternal activities increased during the dark sessions: Mothers cared for themselves (groomed, ate) more and displayed more rearing and sniffing. Mothers spent more time resting with their eyes closed during the light sessions regardless of prenatal drug exposure. The present study demonstrated that the effect of morphine on maternal behavior is different in adult exposed and prenatally exposed mothers. While direct morphine treatment impaired maternal behaviors, prenatal morphine exposure has the opposite effect. Â© 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Interactions exist between progestins and the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subtype A where C21-steroids function as activators. Other interactions between progesterone and neurotransmitter systems include stimulation of dopamine release in striatal tissue, stimulation of GnRH release from hypothalamic neurons and inhibition of opioid receptor binding and activation. Cyproterone acetate increases dopaminergic responses and binds to opiate receptors independently of its classical effect on the androgen receptor. Progesterone substitution in perimenopausal women promotes length and quality of sleep. This effect seems most prominent for progesterone administered vaginally. Progestins also play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Migraine symptoms occur predominantly during the perimenstrual stage. Women who suffer from menstrual migraine triggered by premenstrual progesterone loss often benefit from cyclic progesterone administration. This may be because progesterone and allopregnenolone reduce meningeal release of substance P and inhibit the development of neurogenic oedema. Women whose migraine symptoms subside during pregnancy, however, benefit from intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate. Progesterone, generated from pregnenolone by Schwann cells, also enhances myelin synthesis. Myelination of axons is promoted when progesterone is added to cultures of rat dorsal root ganglia. No reliable data exist with respect to the effects of other progestins on demyelinating disease. Progestins promote the growth of meningioma as progesterone receptors predominate in meningioma tissue. Progesterone and synthetic progestins should therefore not be prescribed in these patients.

AB  - Asthma can pose a serious threat to the pregnant mother and her fetus if not treated appropriately. Studies analyzing the causes of death in severe asthma have shown that most occur outside of the hospital with neither the physician nor the patient appreciating the seriousness of the symptoms [31]. For this reason, a pregnant woman with a diagnosis of asthma must be evaluated thoroughly and managed aggressively by an obstetrician and pulmonary specialist or a maternal-fetal medicine specialist trained in high-risk pregnancies. Any evaluation or assessment of the pregnant asthmatic must be interpreted in light of pregnancy-induced changes. Treatment must be focused on set goals to correct maternal hypoxia, relieve bronchospasm, ensure adequate ventilation, and optimize uteroplacental exchange preventing fetal hypoxia.

AB  - The hypothalamus is involved in a variety of autonomic, endocrine, neurological and behavioural functions including temperature, osmostatic and autonomic nervous system regulation, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal and gonadal control, thirst, appetite and weight control, memory and emotional behaviour including aggression and laughter, and biological (circadian) rhythms. The functional anatomy of the hypothalamus and its major afferent and efferent neurological connections are described, with particular reference to hypothalamic hamartomas (HH), gelastic seizures, MRI of the hypothalamus, and potential effects of surgery for HH. Normal development of the hypothalamus is reviewed in relation to models of forebrain development, descriptive hypothalamic embryology and the importance of known transcription factors. Potential environmental antecedents to HH development are discussed, and the significance for sporadic, isolated HH of several syndromes associated with HH is explored.

AB  - Prenatal stress (PS) can produce profound and long-lasting perturbations of individual adaptive capacities, which in turn can result in an increased proneness to behavioural disorders. Indeed, in PS rats there is evidence of impaired social play behaviour, disturbances in a variety of circadian rhythms, enhanced anxiety and increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. This study was designed to experimentally investigate the degree of reversibility of PS-induced disturbances of social play and HPA reactivity by assessing the effect of the enrichment of the physical environment on PS rats during periadolescence. PS subjects showed a reduced expression of social play behaviour and a prolonged corticosterone secretion in response to restraint stress, but both these effects were markedly reversed following environmental enrichment. Interestingly, the enrichment procedure increased social behaviour but had no effect on corticosterone secretion in nonstressed animals, indicating a differential impact of the postnatal environment as a function of prenatal background. As a whole, results clearly indicate that rats prenatally exposed to stress can benefit during periadolescence from the modulatory effects of an enriched environment. Moreover, they confirm that PS may well represent a suitable animal model for the design and testing of new therapeutic strategies for behavioural disorders produced by early insults.

AB  - Pregnancy and lactation involve great demands on the cardiovascular system. The purpose of this study was to investigate how the heart rate and diurnal heart rate pattern change when dogs become pregnant or lactate. Five clinically healthy female beagle dogs were mated, and delivered three to seven healthy puppies. The heart rate was investigated with 24-h ECG (Holter) once during anoestrus, at 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks of pregnancy, and at week 4 postpartum (lactation). However, at 9 weeks, the ECG could not be recorded for the fully 24 h in 4 of 5 dogs, because labour started and the dogs then appeared disturbed by the recordings. The results at this date are not included in the statistical comparison. The heart rate increased progressively during pregnancy and was still elevated at 4 weeks of lactation. During late pregnancy the difference in heart rates between daytime and nighttime became smaller, but the heart rate was significantly higher in daytime in all periods. In conclusion, the increased heart rates during pregnancy and lactation reflect increased demands on the cardiovascular system and may be important to consider in clinical practice.

AB  - The role of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in hypertension has been recently emphasized in relation to target organ damage. This review shows the importance of ABPM in a special group of patients in order to better select some pathological states. According to the European Society of Hypertension recommendations and not only, we identify the patients who can benefit from ABPM, what the most useful parameters to measure and what goals in terms of ABPM should be achieved. We focus on patients with renal disease, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, sleep apnea syndrome, after heart transplantation, pregnancy and children. Evidence presented in this article demonstrates the high prevalence of a blunted circadian blood pressure profile, its clinical relevance in these patients, and the need to achieve the lowest blood pressure throughout 24-hour in order to prevent both cardiovascular and renal risk. In these special states ABPM can be used because of its prognostic value, as a predictor of complications and also serves as a marker of treatment efficacy.

AB  - Galactorrhea is frequent in women. Although it is usually idiopathic, an etiological diagnosis is mainly based on the demonstration of underlying hyperprolactinemia, which also evokes other conditions, such as anovulatory sterility, hyperandrogenism, menstrual cycle problems, and more rarely, hypophyseal tumor. In addition to exogenous causes, hyperprolactinemia can be secondary to metabolic disorders, or may be of functional or adenomatous origin. A definitive diagnosis is based on the severity of the prolactin level and on morphological examination of the hypophysis. Treatment is a function of the etiology and of the eradication of iatrogenic causes, essentially anti-domaminergic therapy, and more rarely surgery. Treatment is orientated according to the terrain and to whether a younger patient desires contraception or pregnancy, and includes surgery in the case of adenoma, as well as to the response and tolerance to medical treatment.

AB  - The study was conducted in the Department of forensic medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Hospitals. The 601 cases of alleged rape victims brought by police at Gynecology casualty during the period of 1996-2001 were studied and analyzed along with the haemotoxylin and eosin, stained smear preparations which were examined for the presence of spermatozoa and parameters were discerned which would prove useful in establishing the offence of rape. It was found that the commonest age group of victims was 11-20 years (51.58%). A total of 323 (53.80%) victims were unmarried and only fourteen (2.4%) victims were pregnant at the time of commission of rape. Most of the victims (93.8%) belonged to the poor socio-economic strata. In majority that is 215(35.77%) of the cases, the offender was complete stranger to the victims and in 22 cases (3.7%), some intoxicating substance was used to lower the victim's opposition. A diurnal and seasonal variation was also found. Only 92(15.31%) of cases showed genital injuries and 169(28.12%) of cases had extra genital injuries whereas 91(15.14%) cases had both genital as well as extra genital injuries. Fresh hymeneal tear was present in 15.1% cases and 5 O'clock(30%) and 7 O'clock (25%) being the commonest position of hymeneal tear. A total of 178 cases (29.62%) showed sperms in the vaginal smear and sperm heads could be recovered from vagina as long as 7 days after coitus.

AB  - In 1981, seven patients with nonseasonal depression were treated with bright white light. In 1982, bright artificial light was used to treat a manic-depressive patient with a seasonal mood cycle. In the last 20 years, a plethora of studies have further defined the depressive populations, who are responsive to light treatment; the optimal timing, intensity, spectral frequency, and duration of treatment, its comparison with other pharmacological interventions; predictors of response; side-effect profiles; viable placebo-control conditions; alternative devices and forms of administration; potential mechanisms and anatomical pathways mediating light's physiological effects; and its application to other disorders and subsyndromal states. These studies have been conducted across multiple countries with surprisingly consistent results. Further work is needed, as highlighted in this review, to clarify the specific mechanism of action in subtypes of depressive disorders and differential age and gender effects. Although the majority of work in this area is relatively new, it behooves the reader to remember that Solomon, almost 3000 years ago, wrote in Ecclesiastes: "Truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun" (11:7).

AB  - It is reported about the keeping of a group of Naked Mole Rats (Heterocephalus glaber; nine males and 13 females), which had been imported from Kenya in 1996. The animals are kept in a small experimental room without windows at permanent darkness, 30Â°C environmental temperature and relative humidity above 70%. They live in a glass container, to which a collapsible system of plexiglass tubes is connected. The moles are daily fed ad libitum with different fresh root crops. Until today three adult animals of the colony have died (tooth problems; bite injuries; parturition complication). The first queen of the colony had three litters with altogether 10 puppies, of which four are still alive. It died during its last litter caused by a complicated stillbirth. The female established after that as new queen in the colony had up to now only one litter with two puppies, which did not survive. The evaluation of the motor activity of the naked mole rats - continously recorded by video techniques - showed the period length of their circadian activity rhythm on the average with 24 h 13.5 Â± 14.4 min. It is supposed that the activity of the mole rats is regulated by the alteration of the local earth magnet field running in a 24-h rhythm.

AB  - A bidirectional interaction exists between sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) and endocrine activity in various species including humans. Various hormones (peptides, steroids) were shown to participate in sleep regulation. A keyrole was shown for the reciprocal interaction between sleep-promoting growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and sleep-impairing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Changes in the GHRH:CRH ratio result in changes of sleep-endocrine activity. There is good evidence that the change of this ratio in favor of CRH contributes to aberrances of sleep during aging and depression. Besides of GHRH ghrelin and galanin promote SWS, whereas somatostatin is another sleep-impairing factor. NPY acts as a CRH antagonist and induces sleep onset. Prolactin enhances rapid eve-movement sleep (REMS) in rats. SWS is enhanced in patients with prolactinoma. Other studies on the influence of prolactin of human sleep are lacking. There is a controversy whether CRH promotes REMS. In humans vasocactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) appears to play a role in the temporal organization of sleep, since after VIP administration the NREMS-REMS cycle decelerated. Several neuroactive steroids (pregnenolone, progesterone, allopregnanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone) exert specific effects on sleep EEG via GABAA receptors. Cortisol appears to enhance REMS. Finally gonadal hormones participate in sleep regulation. Estrogen replacement therapy and CRH-1 receptor antagonism in depression are beneficial clinical applications of the basic research presented here.

AB  - Background: Despite extensive research on the onset of labor, almost no data are available on women's perception of labor onset. We undertook a study to assess how women experience spontaneous onset of term labor. Methods: A semistructured questionnaire was given to 235 women admitted in spontaneous labor at term. Women noted when labor had started, whether and when membranes had ruptured, and answered an open question about how labor had announced itself. Two investigators independently subdivided women's experiences on how labor had started into 369 sampling units corresponding to 8 predefined categories. Results: Nearly two-thirds of the sampling units (63.4%) related to recurrent and nonrecurrent pain, and the ratio between the two types was higher for multiparas than for nulliparas. The number of women and sampling units were identical for each of the following categories: watery fluid (n = 47), blood-stained loss (n = 33), gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 10) and altered sleep patterns (n = 11); 22 sampling units relating to emotional upheaval were mentioned by 16 women. Although 33.6 percent of women experienced rupture of membranes before admission, only 21.6 percent associated it with their onset of labor, either alone (11.5%) or in association with other categories (10.1%). Conclusions: Although women experience onset of labor in a variety of ways, for most it is a concrete event. Studies on duration of labor should take women's perception of onset of labor as a starting point rather than rely on surrogate measures.

AB  - Aim: To identify risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the sleeping environment of Irish infants. Methods: A five year population based case-control study with parental interviews conducted for each case and three controls matched for age, place of birth, and last sleep period. A total of 203 SIDS cases and 622 control infants born 1994-98 were studied. Results: In a multivariate analysis, co-sleeping significantly increased the risk of SIDS both as a usual practice (adjusted OR 4.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 17.37) and during the last sleep period (adjusted OR 16.47; 95% CI 3.73 to 72.75). The associated risk was dependent on maternal smoking (OR 21.84; 95% CI 2.27 to 209.89), and was not significant for infants who were â¥20 weeks of age (OR 2.63; 95% CI 0.49 to 70.10) or placed back in their own cot/bed to sleep (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.21 to 5.41). The use of pillows, duvets, and bedding with tog value â¥10 were not significant risk factors when adjusted for the effects of confounding variables, including maternal smoking and social disadvantage. However, the prone sleeping position remains a significant SIDS risk factor, and among infants using soothers, the absence of soother use during the last sleep period also significantly increased the SIDS risk (OR 5.83; CI 2.37 to 14.36). Conclusion: Co-sleeping should be avoided in infants who are <20 weeks of age, or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. The prone position remains a factor in some SIDS deaths, and the relation between soother use and SIDS is a complex variable requiring further study.

At present, the "gold standard" is methadone maintenance, but the use of other agonists and of combined compounds with antagonists are increasingly used, especially Buprenorphine. This paper reviews the main findings from research and their consequences for best practice rules. The evolution and organisation of substitution treatment in Europe is described, indicating a major discrepancy in administrative regulations. Emerging trends are also mentioned, as well as the merits and limitations that mark the place of substitution treatment in a comprehensive therapeutic network for opioid dependence.

AB  - Purpose of review: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has mandated new requirements for work hours for all US resident physicians that became effective in July 2003. Member countries of the European Union are also implementing a reduction in work hours for trainee physicians as per the European Work Time Directives. The following review provides a summary of the basis of limiting work hours for residents, steps taken towards limiting the working hours for resident doctors, and implications to residents, institutions, and states. Recent findings: Reduction of work hours for physicians in training is a much awaited and necessary change. Though the framework for such a reduction is in place in most countries, implementation of the policies has been slow thus far, mainly due to financial and manpower constraints. Setting of deadlines for compliance and legislation to penalize the defaulting institutions and programs may help to put the recommendations on work hours into practice. Summary: Long work hours contribute to stress, fatigue, and mood changes in trainee physicians that are potentially deleterious to the physician and patients. Recommendations have been made across the globe to reduce resident doctor work hours and legislation is in place to monitor institutional compliance with these recommendations. Once these regulations are complied with, follow-up studies will be needed to evaluate their effects on physician well-being and patient care. Â© 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with a period length of about 24-hrs. Evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that the circadian timing system develops prenatally and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a circadian clock, is present by mid-gestation in human and non-human primates. Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is responsive to light at very premature stages and that low intensity lighting can regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms in sleep-wake and hormone secretion generally developing after two months of age. Showing the importance of photic regulation of circadian phase in infants, exposure of premature infants to low-intensity cycled lighting results in the early establishment of rest-activity patterns that are in phase with the 24-hour light-dark cycle. With the continued elucidation of circadian system development and influences on human physiology and illness, it is anticipated that consideration of circadian biology will become an increasingly important component of neonatal care.

AB  - The circadian amplitude of neonatal blood pressure, monitored for 2 days at 30-minute intervals during the first week of life on 39 babies exposed in utero to betamimetics, was statistically significantly larger than that of the 126 unexposed babies. The respective circadian double amplitudes (Â± SEM) were 7.9 Â± 0.8 vs. 5.6 Â± 0.3 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (P=0.005) and 5.7 Â± 0.6 vs. 4.0 Â± 0.2 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.020). An above-threshold circadian amplitude of blood pressure being associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk, the results, corroborated independently during adolescence, warrant caution in prescribing betamimetics to prevent premature labor.

AB  - Objectives. Blood pressure of pregnant women was measured around the clock at different gestational ages to obtain reference values and to examine whether women on the path to gestational hypertension and/or pre-eclampsia differed from uncomplicated pregnancies. Design. Observational study. Setting. A health maintenance organization in Minnesota. Results. Even when the 24-hour blood pressure average is within acceptable limits, an excessive circadian amplitude constitutes a harbinger of risk warranting attention and the institution of preventive measures. In one case reviewed herein, failure to do so led 8 weeks later to severe pre-eclampsia necessitating premature delivery and hospitalization of the infant for most of the first 26 months of life. Analyses of vital signs reported in the hospital chart reveal the expression of prominent about-weekly and about-monthly changes in early extrauterine life and the development of a circadian variation, already demonstrable at the time of birth, albeit with a small amplitude. On a group basis, MESOR differences of the order of 8 mm Hg are found between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies well within the range of currently acceptable values. Conclusions. Time-specified reference limits, derived as 90% confidence limits from around-the-clock records of clinically healthy women in each trimester of pregnancy, are more sensitive than the currently used fixed thresholds to detect risk elevation. Such reference standards are also useful to detect abnormal blood pressure patterns. The danger associated with an excessive circadian blood pressure amplitude illustrated in a case report is fully supported by clinical outcome studies on 297 and 424 patients, respectively.

AB  - Measures of brain waves and eye movements change their characteristics as a function of a host of relatively slow components in the spectral element of our ever-broader time structures that also contain chaos and trends, the chronomes. These chronomes are of particular interest to pediatricians, caring for us in the formative stage of life, examining records obtained with different density for various lengths of time, depending upon the chronome element investigated. Associations of chronomes with behavior are found far below the Berger range of the human electroencephalogram. A broader spectral element of chronomes than that of the conventional rhythms is here resolved. Structural and functional redundancy may serve for the adjustment to changes in the environment and is related to learning. With increasing age, with the accumulation of structured information, the order-to-noise ratio increases, suggesting that the making of order out of chaos may define the course of healthy human development in time. More recently, the analysis of the chaotic dynamics of the EEG during parabolic flights confirmed the earlier view of the significance of looking at a complete chronome of brain waves, including chaos and trends as well as a broad spectral element of eye movements.

AB  - In 2001, Unicef procured 70 000 bednets and insecticide treatments to be distributed free to pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in 35 (of 69) districts in Kenya. 1 year later, we interviewed 294 pregnant women who had received a free net. 267 (91%) nets had remained in the target homesteads, and only one of the nets had been sold. In a district with high malarial transmission, 93 (84%) of 111 women who had not previously been sleeping under a bednet had used the net while pregnant, and 97 (91%) of the 107 surviving babies were also protected; in another district, which had low transmission, 73 (58%) of 126 women used the nets during pregnancy and 91 (80%) of 114 infants were protected by the nets. These data suggest that bednets given free to pregnant women are used by recipients and their newborn children, and should be regarded as an important delivery system in increasing access to and use of insecticide-treated bednets in vulnerable groups.

AB  - Muskox farming is an emerging industry in Alaska. For such an endeavor to succeed, it is necessary to develop fundamental husbandry tools specifically for this species. This study examined the role of the bull in the onset of seasonal ovarian activity and the synchrony of estrus and tested the efficacy of a radiotelemetric estrus detection system. Twenty parous female muskoxen, ranging in age from 4 to 15 yr, were divided into three groups (balanced by age and body weight). Groups received early bull exposure (EBE; August 1, n = 7), late bull exposure (LBE; August 22, n = 6), or remained physically isolated from a bull (NBE; n = 7). Just before bull introduction, radiotelemetry transmitters were attached to the rump of muskox cows in the EBE and LBE groups. Plasma samples were collected from all the cows twice weekly and analyzed for progesterone (P4). The mean date of onset of seasonal ovarian activity was earlier in the EBE and LBE groups than in the NBE group (P &lt; 0.001) and was earlier in EBE (P &lt; 0.021) than in LBE. All EBE and LBE cows conceived to the first fertile cycle, giving 100% fertility. The time interval for the onset of ovarian activity between the first and last cow within each group was 7 d in the EBE group, 12 d in the LBE group, and 24 d in the NBE group. Radiotelemetry correctly identified estrus 95% of the time (18 of 19 instances). Mean length of estrus for each cow, calculated from the time of first mount until last mount, was 771 Â± 98 min (range = 4 to 1,508 min). Mean number of mounts during estrus was 8.89 Â± 1.29 (range = 3 to 25 mounts). Length of estrus at the first short cycle did not differ from the length of the first fertile estrus between, or within, individuals. Estrous behavior was initiated more frequently during the night (2300 to 0500; P &lt; 0.05). Bull introduction can be used as a simple, low-cost management tool for synchronizing estrus in farmed muskoxen. Radiotelemetry was an effective tool for identifying breeding behavior in this species. Â©2003 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sleep disordered breathing can occur during pregnancy due to the development of hormonal changes and respiratory function abnormalities that perturb patency of the upper airways. Habitual snoring has been described in 25 p. 100 of the women during the third trimester of pregnancy. The incidence of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome is unknown due to the lack of longitudinal epidemiological data, and results of the main studies are in favor of upper airway resistance syndrome. However, these sleep-related breathing disorders are more frequently associated with maternal and fotal complications such as maternal hypertension, pre eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. This article points out the importance of such associations because of the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure on the regression of these nocturnal respiratory and vascular complications.

AB  - Severe maternal neurologic injury during pregnancy has the potential for fetal demise without advanced critical care support to the mother. Brain death is the unequivocal and irreversible loss of total brain function, whereas patients in a vegetative state, by contrast, have preserved brain stem function but lack cerebral function. They can appear to be awake, have sleep-wake cycles, be capable of swallowing, and have normal respiratory control, but there are no purposeful interactions. These conditions have different maternal prognoses, but both have resulted in near-normal neonatal outcomes with long latencies from maternal injury to delivery in previously published cases. This article compares and contrasts the 11 cases of brain death with 15 cases of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy. We found that the mean latency between maternal brain injury and delivery was significantly shorter in the brain-dead patients as compared with those in a vegetative state (46 days vs. 124 days, Pâ¤.001). Correspondingly, the gestational ages at delivery (29.7 weeks vs. 33.2 weeks, Pâ¤.01) and the birth weights (1380 g vs. 2145 g, Pâ¤.01) were shorter in duration and smaller in size in the brain-dead group. We also present a case of persistent vegetative state in pregnancy at our institution with both maternal and neonatal death in the context of previously published literature with a focus on obstetric and ethical management. We hope this information will help elucidate the issues for providers confronted with these unique and challenging cases.

AB  - Sertraline (Zoloftâ¢, Pfizer Inc.) is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) which has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMDD is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) which affects at least 5 - 8% of women of reproductive age. It is characterised by cyclic appearance at the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and disappearance following the beginning of menses, with no symptoms during at least 1 week of the cycle - usually during the mid-follicular phase. Due to the cyclic luteal occurrence of PMDD, luteal phase dosing of SSRIs has been suggested and proven effective for sertraline as well as several other SSRIs. The clinical response of sertraline is reported to be within several days following initiation of treatment. Despite repeated cyclic discontinuation, no significant discontinuation adverse effects have been reported. In addition to its proven clinical efficacy, luteal-phase dosing may offer the advantages of minimising adverse effects of SSRIs while reducing the personal and economic burden of taking a prescription medication continuously for long periods and thus increasing compliance.

AB  - In the estrous female rat, mating stimulation induces an acute surge of prolactin (PRL) within 20 min after mating followed by the onset of twice-daily PRL surges which persist for an 8- to 13-day period of acyclicity called pseudopregnancy. In Experiment 1, we examined whether the release of adrenal hormones after mating modulates mating-induced PRL secretion during the first 38 h after mating. Ovariectomized females were adrenalectomized (Adx) or sham-operated (Sham) and were implanted with jugular vein catheters 2 days later. They were given estrogen and progesterone and mated 6 days after the last surgery until they received 15 intromissions or 15 mounts-without-intromission from a male. Blood samples were collected beginning 20 min before mating at 23:00 h and continuing for 38 h. Plasma PRL concentrations were measured using radioimmunoassay. Mating that included intromissions induced an acute (20-min) PRL response which was higher in Adx than in Sham animals, and advanced in the Adx animals in the onset of the first daily PRL surge to 10:00 h, some 18 h before the surge was observed at 04:00 h in the Sham-mated animals. A small but measurable nocturnal surge was observed in Adx and Sham groups 18-24 h later at 04:00-10:00 h. In Experiment 2, Adx- and Sham-cycling animals received 5 (5I) or 7 (7I) intromissions from a male 12-16 days after surgery. Adx animals receiving 5I showed a significantly higher incidence of pregnancy or pseudo-pregnancy (%P/PSP) than did Sham 5I animals, while there was no difference in %P/PSP in the 7I groups. We conclude that adrenal gland secretions normally suppress plasma PRL concentrations immediately post-mating and before the onset of the nocturnal mating-induced PRL surge and also inhibit pseudopregnancy when females receive a subthreshold number of intromissions normally required for its induction.

AB  - Intranasal corticosteroids and intranasal antihistamines are efficacious topical therapies in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. This review addresses their relative roles in the management of this disease, focusing on their safety and tolerability profiles. The intranasal route of administration delivers drug directly to the target organ, thereby minimising the potential for the systemic adverse effects that may be evident with oral therapy. Furthermore, the topical route of delivery enables the use of lower doses of medication. Such therapies, predominantly available as aqueous formulations following the ban of chlorofluorocarbon propellants, have minimal local adverse effects. Intranasal application of therapy can induce sneezing in the hyper-reactive nose, and transient local irritation has been described with certain formulations. Intranasal administration of corticosteroids is associated with minor nose bleeding in a small proportion of recipients. This effect has been attributed to the vasoconstrictor activity of the corticosteroid molecules, and is considered to account for the very rare occurrence of nasal septal perforation. Nasal biopsy studies do not show any detrimental structural effects within the nasal mucosa with long-term administration of intranasal corticosteroids. Much attention has focused on the systemic safety of intranasal application. When administered at standard recommended therapeutic dosage, the intranasal antihistamines do not cause significant sedation or impairment of psychomotor function, effects that would be evident when these agents are administered orally at a therapeutically relevant dosage. The systemic bioavailability of intranasal corticosteroids varies from <1% to up to 40-50% and influences the risk of systemic adverse effects. Because the dose delivered topically is small, this is not a major consideration, and extensive studies have not identified significant effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with continued treatment. A small effect on growth has been reported in one study in children receiving a standard dosage over 1 year, however. This has not been found in prospective studies with the intranasal corticosteroids that have low systemic bioavailability and therefore the judicious choice of intranasal formulation, particularly if there is concurrent corticosteroid inhalation for asthma, is prudent. There is no evidence that such considerations are relevant to shorter-term use, such as in intermittent or seasonal disease. Intranasal therapy, which represents a major mode of drug delivery in allergic rhinitis, thus has a very favourable benefit/risk ratio and is the preferred route of administration for corticosteroids in the treatment of this disease, as well as an important option for antihistaminic therapy, particularly if rapid symptom relief is required.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of melatonin and/or diazepam on the endogenous rhythm in cultured myocardiocytes and in that connexion to inquire into the mechanism of circadian oscillation level. Methods: The beating rate of cultured myocardiocytes was dynamically monitored by an inverted phase-contrast microscope coupled to high speed CCD camera and computer system. Under the culturing condition of artificial light L:D = 12:12, the circadian rhythm variation of cultured myocardiocytes beating frequencies was measured, and then the effect exerted by melatonin and/or diazepam on that circadian rhythm was studied. Results: It was found that under the L:D = 12:12 culturing condition, the cultured myocardiocytes exhibited prominent circadian rhythm. With the use of melatonin and or diazepam, the circadian rhythm of those myocardiocytes changed, not only the amplitude and mesor decreased, but also the acrophase delayed. Conclusion: The modulation of circadian rhythm in cellular level is not only related with endogenous control but also affected by external factors.

AB  - Narcolepsy is a disabling disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and disturbed nocturnal sleep. Traditionally, a wide variety of substances are used in the symptomatic pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy. Several generally more-tolerated substances have been added to the therapeutic repertoire after extensive testing in large patient populations during recent years. This review addresses the state-of-the-art knowledge about the pharmacological treatment of narcolepsy along with the personal view of the authors. The recent discovery that narcolepsy is caused by deficient hypocretin (orexin) transmission opens a perspective on causal therapy.

AB  - The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides, Canidae, Carnivora) is a middle-sized omnivore with excessive autumnal fattening and winter sleep. We studied adaptations of the species to boreal climate and photoperiod by following the plasma reproductive and thyroid hormone concentrations of farm-bred raccoon dogs (n=32) for 12 months. On August 16, 2000, and February 8, 2001, half of the raccoon dogs received continuous-release melatonin implants (the MEL group). The other half was sham-operated (the SHAM group). Between November 27, 2000, and January 25, 2001, half of the animals of both groups were fasted. The plasma testosterone concentrations of the MEL males peaked in February, a month earlier than in the SHAM males. Autumnal melatonin treatment also advanced the gestation period reflected by the plasma progesterone concentrations by seven weeks. Food deprivation in winter seems to accentuate the sex steroid response during the mating as the fasted males had higher testosterone concentrations than the fed males in February and March.

AB  - Objective. To document the practice of light and heavy physical activities, especially sports and exercise, among women from 12 to 49 years old in Mexico, and to evaluate the association that that has with some sociodemographic characteristics. Methods. A sample of 2 367 women 12 to 49 years old living in Mexico in 1999 was studied through secondary analysis of data from Mexico's 1999 National Nutrition Survey (Encuesta Nacional de NutriciÃ³n). The Survey used a clustered stratified multi-stage sampling scheme, with a final sample of 21 000 homes in the entire country. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the time that the women spent on various forms of physical activity, with the activity measured on a scoring scale in terms of metabolic equivalents (METs). The dependent variables in the study were the time spent on heavy physical activities (those that require an energy expenditure of at least 5 METs/hour) and the time devoted to light or sedentary activities (such as sitting while on the job or elsewhere; watching television, a video, a movie, or a theater presentation; or sleeping). The independent variables were age, schooling, parity, region of the country, area of residence (urban or rural), socioeconomic level (measured through an index prepared based on housing conditions and household possessions), and marital status. The association between the independent variables and practicing sports was evaluated, and gross odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In order to identify the association between practicing sports and the independent variables a logistic regression model was used, adjusted for the effects of possible confounding variables. Adjustments were also made in the probability of a woman's being selected for the sample, using a weighting factor. In addition, adjustments were made to control for the design effect produced by the grouping of the observations in the sample, using the "svy" complex-samples routine of the Stata version 7.0 statistical analysis computer software. Results. The 2 367 women whose information was analyzed spent an average of 0.08 hours per day practicing sports and 1.25 hours per day on heavy physical activities. Only 16% of the women reported that they regularly practiced some sport. After adjusting for all the independent variables, the women older than 30 years had a lower OR of practicing sports in comparison to women who were 20 years of age or less (OR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.33 to 0.84), as was also true for women 21-30 years old (OR = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.54). Having the highest level of schooling and not having had children were both directly associated with practicing a sport. While the area of residence (urban or rural), marital status, and socioeconomic level showed differences among the groups, such differences were not significant after adjusting for the other study variables. In terms of physical activity measured in METs, the time spent on sports made up 10% of the total for heavy activity and 0.7% of the overall total. In terms of the possibility of being among the 10% of the women who expended the fewest METs per day, that was more likely for women under 21 years of age than it was for women 31 or older, and it was also more likely for women who had a primary level of schooling than for women with a secondary education. Conclusions. This study showed that practicing sports is not a frequent form of physical activity among women of childbearing age in Mexico, especially those who are over 20 years of age and those with a low level of schooling. This situation could contribute to increases in the prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases.

AB  - Study Objectives: To clarify the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnant women living in Japan and to analyze the relationship between sleep problems and RLS, in order to discuss ways for pregnant women to obtain comfortable sleep and to improve the health of both the mother and child. Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey Setting: 500 clinical institutions with maternity services were randomly sampled from a list of organizations identified in a survey by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Of these 500 institutions, 260 participated in the survey. Participants: 16,528 pregnant women living in Japan Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: In this survey of pregnant women, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%. An analysis was conducted on the relationship between RLS and other factors such as subjective evaluation of sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early morning awaking, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The result of this analysis suggested that women with these sleep-related problems were more likely to have RLS than those without. In addition, RLS was more prevalent in the later stages of pregnancy. Conclusion: In the pregnant women in our survey, the prevalence of RLS was found to be 19.9%, which is higher than the prevalence of RLS that has been found in the general public in a previous study. This suggests that RLS-related sleep problems may be an important public health issue among pregnant women in Japan. This finding may have implications for attempts to improve sleep hygiene in this group.

AB  - Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated rhythms with a period length of about 24-hrs. Evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that the circadian timing system develops prenatally and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a circadian clock, are present by mid-gestation in human and non-human primates. Recent evidence also shows that the circadian system of primate infants is responsive to light at very premature stages and that low intensity lighting can regulate the developing clock. After birth, there is progressive maturation of the circadian system outputs, with pronounced rhythms in sleep-wake and hormone secretion generally developing after two months of age. With the continued elucidation of circadian system development and influences on human physiology and illness, it is anticipated that consideration of circadian biology will become an increasingly important component of neonatal care.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is known to occur more frequently at night. In two studies it has now been shown that a prone sleep position is more strongly associated with SIDS occurring during the day, whereas night-time deaths are more strongly associated with maternal smoking and illness. Conclusion: This variation, although unexplained, does suggest at least two SIDS subtypes: one related to sleep position and possibly a thermal mechanism, and one related to an uncontrolled inflammatory response to infection predominantly occurring at night. In addition, there are probably other mechanisms that do not show a circadian variation.

AB  - Paternal care is rare in mammals, occurring mainly in carnivores and neotropical primates, in which the difficulties of long generation time and large individuals lead to small sample sizes. Here, the authors show that paternal care can be easily studied in the four-striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) because (a) captive males show all the patterns of parental care as do females, with the obvious exception of nursing; (b) in the field, wild males act amicably toward juveniles and retrieve pups experimentally presented to them; (c) the striped mouse facilitates experimental approaches in captivity because it has a short generation period and can be kept in large numbers; and (d) the striped mouse is diurnal, not only making observations in captivity easier but also enabling direct observations in the field.

AB  - Aim: To study circadian variation in the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and possible associations with risk factors for SIDS. Methods: A questionnaire-based case-control study matched for place of birth, age and gender was conducted in Denmark, Norway and Sweden: The Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study. The study comprised 244 SIDS victims and 869 control infants between September 1992 and August 1995. The main outcome was hour found dead. Results: A significant circadian pattern was observed among the 242 SIDS victims with a known hour found dead, with a peak at 08.00-08.59 in the morning (n = 33). Of the SIDS victims, 12% were found dead at 00.00-05.59, 58% at 06.00-11.59, 21% at 12.00-17.59 and 9.0% at 18.00-23.59. When comparing night/morning SIDS and day/evening SIDS (found dead 00.00-11.59 and 12.00-23.59, respectively), the proportion of night/morning SIDS was high among infants of smoking mothers (81% vs 53%, p < 0.001), infants with a reported cold (82% vs 64%, p = 0.007) and infants sleeping side/supine (81% vs 60%, p < 0.001). No associations were observed between hour found dead and other sociodemographic risk factors for SIDS. Risk (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval) of night/morning SIDS and day/evening SIDS was 7.0 (4.5-10.9) and 1.5 (0.8-2.5), respectively, for maternal smoking, 2.2 (1.5-3.1) and 0.6 (0.3-1.3), respectively, if the infant had a reported cold, 3.7 (2.1-6.6) and 3.1 (1.1-8.4), respectively, if the infant was put to sleep in the side position (supine reference), and 11.0 (5.9-20.2) and 21.6 (7.6-60.8), respectively, if the infant was put to sleep in the prone position. Conclusion: The observed higher proportion of night/morning cases in SIDS if the mother smoked, if the infant was reported to have a cold and if the infant was sleeping side/supine may contribute to the understanding of some epidemiological characteristics of SIDS.

AB  - Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to malaria infections. Multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum seriously compromises treatment in some endemic areas. Between April 1999 and October 2001, we treated and prospectively followed 27 Karen pregnant women with multiple recrudescent P. falciparum infections who were resistant to all other antimalarials with a triple combination of artesunate-atovaquone-proguanil. The treatment was well tolerated and we found no evidence of toxicity for the mothers and the fetus. All but 1 woman were cured (cure rate 96%, 95% CI 89-100). The triple combination of artesunate (4 mg/kg/d), atovaquone (20 mg/kg/d), and proguanil (8 mg/kg/d) may provide a much needed, albeit expensive, 3-d rescue treatment for pregnant women exposed to multidrug- resistant P. falciparum malaria.

AB  - Background: Progress in perinatal medicine has made it possible to increase the survival of very or extremely low birthweight infants. Developmental outcomes of surviving preterm infants have been analysed at the paediatric, neurological, cognitive, and behavioural levels, and a series of perinatal and environmental risk factors have been identified. The threat to the child's survival and invasive medical procedures can be very traumatic for the parents. Few empirical reports have considered post-traumatic stress reactions of the parents as a possible variable affecting a child's outcome. Some studies have described sleeping and eating problems as related to prematurity; these problems are especially critical for the parents. Objective: To examine the effects of post-traumatic reactions of the parents on sleeping and eating problems of the children. Design: Fifty families with a premature infant (25-33 gestation weeks) and a control group of 25 families with a full term infant participated in the study. Perinatal risks were evaluated during the hospital stay. Mothers and fathers were interviewed when their children were 18 months old about the child's problems and filled in a perinatal post-traumatic stress disorder questionnaire (PPQ). Results: The severity of the perinatal risks only partly predicts a child's problems. Independently of the perinata(risks, the intensity of the post-traumatic reactions of the parents is an important predictor of these problems. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the parental response to premature birth mediates the risks of later adverse outcomes. Preventive intervention should be promoted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most common nongenetic cause of mental retardation. Peptides NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (SAL), related to activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), prevent alcohol-induced damage in a mouse model of FAS. Our objective was to characterize ADNP in this model to relate this protein to the mechanisms of damage and peptide neuroprotection. STUDY DESIGN: Timed, pregnant C57BI6/J mice were treated on day 8. Groups were control, alcohol, peptide pretreatment, or peptide alone. Embryo and decidua were harvested at 6 and 24 hours and 10 days. To evaluate ADNP expression, real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed with results presented as the ratio of ADNP-to-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) concentration. Analysis of variance was performed for overall comparisons with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: At 6 hours, there was no difference in ADNP between alcohol-exposed embryos compared with control embryos. At 24 hours, there was an increase in ADNP in alcohol-exposed embryos compared with controls (P < .001); these findings persisted at 10 days (P < .001). In the decidua at 6 hours, there was no difference between alcohol and control. At 24 hours, there was greater ADNP in alcohol-exposed decidua compared with controls (P < .001), which did not persist at 10 days (P = .97). Peptide pretreatment did not prevent the alcohol-induced increase in ADNP in embryo or decidua. CONCLUSION: Alcohol increased embryonic and decidual ADNP expression at 24 hours and it persisted in the embryo for 10 days. Because ADNP is a known neuroprotectant, these findings suggest that it may be released as a protective mechanism in FAS. Changes in the embryo were persistent suggesting that the embryo is more vulnerable to alcohol-induced damage than the mother.

AB  - Postpartum psychic disorders can be mainly divided into 3 groups: The so-called postpartum blues, the postpartum depression and the postpartum psychosis. The postpartum blues occurs 3-5 days postpartum in 50-70% of deliveries mostly disappearing after one week without specific therapy. However, 20-30% of patients will develop a depression in their further postpartum course so that a thorough evaluation concerning depression is warranted, if blues symptoms persist more than 2 weeks. Postpartum depression can be found in 10-15% of deliveries and mostly occurs several weeks or months after delivery with symptoms of depressive mood, sleeping disorders, anxiety, loss of interest and accord and feelings of guilt up to suicidal ideas. In order not to misinterpret them as postpartum blues specific questions concerning the mood of the young mother during the postpartum examination - if necessary using the Edinburgh scale - are recommended. In patients with known risk factors for a postpartum depression (i.e. postpartum depression or psychosis in previous pregnancies, depression disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar illness), a thorough survey is mandatory and - if necessary - a prophylactic treatment in cooperation with the psychiatrist. Less severe forms of postpartum depression can mostly be treated with psychotherapy and sociotherapy on an outpatient basis. In more severe cases, antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs or some tricyclic drugs) are indicated. Postpartum anxiety and compulsive disorders respond well to psychotherapy; besides in anxiety disorders benzodiazepines are recommended, in compulsive disorders SSRIs. Postpartum psychoses (about 0.1-0.2%) most often occur in bipolar or schizoaffective disorders or after postpartum psychosis. They require a hopitalization mainly because of the danger of suicide and homicide toward the newborn; ideally this is performed in mother-child-units.

AB  - From 1979 to 1993 Turkish infants had a significantly higher cot death risk compared to Dutch infants. In contrast Moroccan infants had a risk of cot death that was approximately three times lower compared to Dutch infants during the same period. This study shows that these differences have disappeared, while differences still exist in infant care practices between these ethnic groups. At 28 well-baby clinics, questionnaires were distributed for this sample selection. The response was 82%. Data were collected on 55 Turkish, 54 Moroccan, and 210 Dutch families. Less than 7% of these three ethnic groups still placed infants in the prone position. Moroccan mothers hardly smoked. Turkish people used pillows and Moroccan people used soft mattresses more often. Moroccan families practised swaddling more widely. Length of maternal residence influenced some care giving practices. As a result of this study, subgroup specific intervention campaigns for safe sleeping can be developed for Turkish and Moroccan families.

AB  - We report three consecutive hydropic fetuses with fetal tachyarrhythmias treated with amiodarone - two in combination with digoxin and one with digoxin, procainamide, and propranolol. Sinus rhythm was achieved in one case and ventricular rate control was achieved in two cases. All fetuses treated with amiodarone gradually improved. Observed side effects of amiodarone were a maternal rash in one mother and transient neonatal hypothyroidism in one infant. We conclude that amiodarone might be effective and safe for fetal tachyarrhythmias and impending hydrops. The small number of patients suggests that a multicenter cooperative approach is required in order to determine if this is correct.

AB  - We studied the children of mothers who were confined to bed during pregnancy for more than 15 consecutive days (mean 3.69 months) in the years 1986-1990 (bed rest offspring; BRO). We studied 86 children: 43 BRO and 43 control children. Data were obtained by means of a 20-item questionnaire filled in by the mothers. The BRO group differed from the control group in incidence of allergies (p = 0.005), motion sickness (p = 0.03), and need to be rocked to fall asleep (p = 0.01). More BRO born at term than controls played musical instruments later in life. Two possible explanations for more allergies among the BRO group are the use of beta-stimulating drugs against premature delivery and the effects of prolonged stress on the developing immune system. Understimulation of the developing vestibular system during gestation may affect some aspects of its development and may explain the higher incidence of motion sickness and need for vigorous rocking in BRO.

AB  - Lithium medication during pregnancy is uncommon and the problems of a neonate who has been exposed to lithium represents a rare situation in neonatology. The clinical presentation and management of a newborn whose mother received lithium during pregnancy is presented. The newborn manifested a four day course of lethargy with unexplained high lithium levels in the adult toxic range. The infant improved clinically under intravenous hydration therapy, nevertheless lithium serum levels increased again and we did not know for certain if our clinical instinct or the actual figures were correct. Finally we noticed that our confusion had resulted from test tubes containing lithium heparine.

AB  - Pregnancy is associated with significant alterations in respiratory function. Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and residual volume (RV), increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen (A-Î±PO2) and in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleep-related apneas or hypopneas, these could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because of the conflicting data from sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 11 pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the PaO2, every 2h. The frequency of apneas and hypopneas was significantly lower during pregnancy compared with that on the postpartum control night. PaO2 levels in the supine position, during sleep, were also significantly lower during pregnancy compared to the postpartum period. No correlation was observed between PaO2 levels and apneas or hypopneas or percent of REM sleep. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Even operative deliveries defined as "urgent" show marked diurnal variation with a significant increase during regular working hours. Objective: To investigate the diurnal variation of urgent operative deliveries and its potential implications on the outcome of newborns. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of all deliveries in a public hospital from 1 January 1990 to 31 December 1998. Delivery mode variables analyzed were spontaneous vaginal delivery, urgent cesarean section and operative vaginal delivery. Deliveries were stratified hourly throughout the day. The rate of operative deliveries was calculated and the analysis was then performed according to the daily routine shifts of the medical staff. Birth weight and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were retrieved as outcome measures. Results: The rate of urgent cesarean deliveries increased significantly between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. (150%-230%) from that predicted. The lowest rate of urgent cesarean sections was found between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. (5.3%). Mean birth weight in spontaneous deliveries was higher in the morning hours than during the night shift (3,293 Â± 520 g vs. 3,277 Â± 510 g, respectively, P < 0.005). Apgar scores of newboms delivered by urgent cesarean section during the morning were higher compared to those delivered during night shifts and the rate of low Apgar scores was lower in the morning than in evening and night shifts. Conclusions: Our results indicate a marked diurnal variation in urgent operative deliveries, caused perhaps by varying definition of "urgency" according to the time of day.

AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effect of different lighting conditions during lactation on the functioning of the circadian pacemaker in the adult rat in absence of the retinal input. We reared one group of rats under constant light (LL-rats) and the other under constant darkness (DD-rats). After weaning they were placed under light-dark cycles of 24h period for 29 days to eliminate the aftereffects of the previous lighting. All the animals were then binocularly enucleated and motor activity was recorded. Results reveal that, before and after the enucleation, the expression of the circadian rhythm was stronger in DD- than in the LL-rats. Our results indicate that lighting conditions during lactation modify the functioning of the circadian pacemaker.

AB  - NAPVSIPQ (NAP), an active fragment of the glial-derived activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, is protective at femtomolar concentrations against a wide array of neural insults and prevents ethanol-induced fetal wastage and growth retardation in mice. NAP also antagonizes ethanol inhibition of L1-mediated cell adhesion (ethanol antagonism). We performed an Ala scanning substitution of NAP to determine the role of ethanol antagonism and neuroprotection in NAP prevention of ethanol embryotoxicity. The Ser-Ile-Pro region of NAP was crucial for both ethanol antagonism and protection of cortical neurons from tetrodotoxin toxicity (neuroprotection). Ala replacement of either Ser-5 or Pro-7 (P7A-NAP) abolished NAP neuroprotection but minimally changed the efficacy of NAP ethanol antagonism. In contrast, Ala replacement of Ile-6 (I6A-NAP) caused a decrease in potency (>2 logarithmic orders) with only a small reduction (<10%) in the efficacy of NAP neuroprotection but markedly reduced the efficacy (50%) and the potency (5 logarithmic orders) of NAP ethanol antagonism. Ethanol significantly reduced the number of paired somites in mouse whole-embryo culture; this effect was prevented significantly by 100 pM NAP or by 100 pM P7A-NAP, but not by 100 pM 16A-NAP. The structure-activity relation for NAP prevention of ethanol embryotoxicity was similar to that for NAP ethanol antagonism and different from that for NAP neuroprotection. These findings support the hypothesis that NAP antagonism of ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion plays a central role in NAP prevention of ethanol embryotoxicity and highlight the potential importance of ethanol effects on L1 in the pathophysiology of fetal alcohol syndrome.

AB  - This longitudinal study investigated sleep-wake behavior patterns during and after pregnancy, using an actimeter worn on the non-dominant wrist and a sleep log. Records were obtained from ten mothers, from the 34th week of gestation until the 15th week postpartum. Ten non-pregnant women were used as a control group, data being collected from them for 2 weeks. The sleep-wake behavior after delivery, obtained from wrist actigraphy, was greater in the postpartum period. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and circadian amplitude decreased in the weeks immediately following parturition, but wake after sleep onset increased. Subsequently, all the sleep and circadian variables improved slightly, but they had not returned to the levels of the non-pregnant control group even by the 15th postpartum week. The length of daytime naps increased, in order to make up for nocturnal sleep deprivation when the number of awakenings during nighttime had increased. There were significant positive correlations between total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and the length of daytime naps, but the numbers of awakenings at night and daytime naps did not show this correlation. The total sleep time indicated by sleep logs tended to be greater than that indicated by actigraphy, but wake after sleep onset tended to be underestimated by the sleep logs. The implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - The resting metabolic rates (RMRs) of six adult Goeldi's monkeys (Callimico goeldii) were measured using standard methods of open circuit respirometry during both the active (daytime) and inactive (nighttime) circadian phases for this species. One subject was measured both while she was pregnant and after she delivered a full-term, stillborn infant. Inactive-phase RMR within thermal neutrality (above 27.5Â°C) averaged 288.5Â±30.8 ml O2/hr; active-phase RMR within thermal neutrality averaged 416.3Â±60.9 ml O2/hr. These values are 74.6% and 107.6%, respectively, of the mammalian expected for animals of this body mass. During the inactive phase, metabolic rate increased an estimated 4.3% for every degree decline in temperature below 27.5Â°C. The RMR in Goeldi's monkey is similar quantitatively and qualitatively to those of other captive callitrichids that have been studied, with active-phase RMR being at or slightly above the mammalian expected, and inactive-phase RMR being significantly reduced. We propose that this circadian pattern of RMR is a consequence of small body size, and is not a specific metabolic adaptation within the Callitrichidae. Thus we predict that metabolic studies measuring both circadian phases in other small primates will also find this pattern of reduced RMR during the inactive phase. The inactive-phase RMR within thermal neutrality of the pregnant female was not different from that measured after the stillbirth, despite an almost 15% difference in body mass. During pregnancy, however, the female was more metabolically responsive to temperature below thermal neutrality, and had a lower upper critical temperature (i.e., was less tolerant of heat).

AB  - Until present, fundamental studies on cortisol secretory patterns have not been conducted in cetaceans. The objectives of this study were: (1) to examine diurnal changes in serum cortisol concentrations in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins Tursiops aduncus and killer whales Orcinus orca, (2) to investigate annual cortisol changes in killer whales, and (3) to investigate the relationship between cortisol and sex steroids (testosterone and progesterone) concentrations in killer whales. Diurnal changes in serum cortisol concentrations were investigated at various intervals in the two species. In Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, serum cortisol levels exhibited the same episodic fluctuations for 24h as did diurnal terrestrial mammals: cortisol levels were lower at 18:00h and higher in the early morning. In killer whales, cortisol concentrations continued to decrease until 18:00h, after which they fluctuated, and then increased in the next morning. Annual changes in cortisol levels were investigated by collecting blood samples every two weeks from two male killer whales and a pregnant female one twice per day (during 09:00-10:00 and 16:00-17:00h) throughout a one-year period. Regarding sera collected during 09:00-10:00h from the female, cortisol concentrations showed cyclic changes having about 4-month intervals. In males, cortisol showed higher concentrations in winter and lower concentrations during the summer season. There was a negative correlation between cortisol and progesterone levels in the female and a negative correlation was also observed between cortisol and testosterone in male no. 2. In the female and male no. 1, cortisol levels during 09:00-10:00h were significantly higher than those during 16:00-17:00h, and their data are considered to support observations regarding diurnal changes in cortisol levels in the two cetacean species.

AB  - Background: Increased perinatal and neonatal mortality rates have been previously reported in night-time births compared with births during the day. This effect has been attributed to decreased quality of medical care during the night. However, alternative explanations exist such as decreased birth-weight of night births. The objective of this study was to further investigate this relationship. Materials and Methods: Data from 590 332 low risk births (singleton births, â¥ 2500 g birth-weight, no major congenital anomaly) were obtained from the perinatal birth register of Hesse, Germany, 1990-2000. Outcome was defined as either death during labour or within 7 days of life. Night-time births were defined as births between 9.00 p.m. and 6.59 a.m., otherwise day-time births were assumed. Subgroup analyses and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess whether the excess mortality of night-births might be explained by other factors. Results: Mortality rates were increased in night-time births (RR = 1.26; 95% Cl = 0.94-1.70). This relationship was more pronounced in spontaneous births (RR = 1.58; 95% Cl = 0.96-2.61) and emergency cesarean sections (RR = 1.76; 95% Cl = 1.10-2.82). Significance persisted after adjusting for numerous potential confounders. Conclusion: Our results confirm an increased mortality risk for night-time births which could not be explained by other accessible risk factors. This suggests that the increased risk at night might be attributable to a reduced availability to provide appropriate medical care in delivery units at night. Discussion: As mainly the presence of staff is decreased during the night, introduction of better designed shifts can be expected to reduce neonatal mortality.

AB  - Approximately 30% of women experience some type of anxiety disorder during their lifetime. Women with these disorders may experience profound changes in their symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition, some evidence exists that anxiety disorders can affect pregnancy outcomes. It is important that physicians understand the course of these disorders during pregnancy and available treatments so they can appropriately counsel women who are or intend to become pregnant. This article reviews the literature on the course of anxiety disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum period and presents guidelines for management.

AB  - Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is not only a problem of the upper airway but is a systemic condition with endocrine and metabolic interactions. The accumulating body of evidence shows that SDB induces changes in the serum levels or secretory patterns of several hormones. Conversely, various endocrine disorders and hormone therapies may induce, exacerbate or alleviate SDB. Much of the understanding of the interactions between hormones and sleep-disordered breathing derive from intervention studies with nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Better understanding of hormones and breathing may open new perspectives in developing strategies to prevent, alleviate or cure sleep-disordered breathing and its systemic consequences.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate prenatal to postnatal changes in first-time parents' physical and mental health, and to describe social and health predictors of parents' postpartum health. Methods: This prospective study surveyed 261 expectant fathers and mothers during pregnancy and again at 6 months' postpartum regarding their health, partner, and work characteristics. Postpartum changes in health were evaluated by paired t tests, and predictors of postpartum health were determined using multiple regression analyses. Results: Both fathers and mothers experienced significant postpartum declines in perceived quality of life. In addition, fathers reported an increase in the number of days ill and a decrease in general health and vitality after childbirth. Mothers perceived an increase in vitality despite their diminishing sleep. Parents' postpartum health was associated with mothers' partner satisfaction, fewer illness days, and certain work characteristics, such as total work time and the balance of work between mothers and fathers. Conclusions: Both mothers and fathers experienced declines in health that persisted at least 6 months after the birth of their first child. Notably, postpartum health was associated with partner satisfaction and work characteristics. This information might be used to develop interventions for improving parents' health during this vulnerable time.

AB  - We report a description of two mothers who scrupulously followed clinical controls and tests advised during pregnancy within a hospital environment, and who then gave birth to babies with serious deformation pathologies. In both cases, the seriousness of the psychiatric damage, is obviously useful for the medico-legal assessments. We have studied in both cases their mental make-up, understood as stable relationships between parts of the mind (thought, language, perception...). We have observed that in a fragile make-up a non significant event in many ways can cause an extremely violent reaction, whilst on the contrary, a serious event in "solid" people may not cause damaging consequences. The assessment of the mental make-up, conditions the degree of psychiatric damage, which is useful to the medical examiner, and is of fundamental importance for the individual choice of a therapeutic process.

AB  - Thirty-four experts and a literature supervisor got together in order to reach a 'consensus' regarding the definition, diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of insomnia. Insomnia is a subjective perception of dissatisfaction with the amount and/or quality of sleep. It includes difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep or early awakening with inability to fall asleep again. It is associated with complaints of non-restorative sleep and dysfunction of diurnal alertness, energy, cognitive function, behaviour or emotional state, with a decrease in quality of life. The diagnosis is based on clinical and sleep history, physical examination and additional tests, although polysomnography is not routinely indicated. Therapy should include treatment of the underlying causes, cognitive and behavioural measures and drug treatment. Hypnotic therapy can be prescribed from the onset of insomnia and non-benzodiazepine selective agonists of the GABA-A receptor complex are the drugs of first choice. It is recommended that hypnotic treatment be maintained in cases where withdrawal impairs the patient's quality of life and when all other therapeutic measures have failed. Experience suggests that intermittent treatment is better than continuous therapy. The available data do not confirm safety of hypnotics in pregnancy, lactation and childhood insomnia. Benzodiazepines are not indicated in decompensated chronic pulmonary disease but no significant adverse effects on respiratory function have been reported with zolpidem and zopiclone in stable mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in treated obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Data for zaleplon are inconclusive. If the patient recovers subjective control over the sleep process, gradual discontinuation of hypnotic treatment can be considered.

AB  - One hundred sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anxiety during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high anxiety women also had high scores on depression and anger scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high anxiety women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high anxiety mothers' high prenatal norepinephrine and low dopamine levels were followed by their neonates having low dopamine and serotonin levels. The high anxiety mothers' newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high anxiety mothers spent more time in deep sleep and less time in quiet and active alert states and showed more state changes and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (motor maturity, autonomic stability and withdrawal). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated anxiety symptoms during pregnancy. Â© 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The mare exhibits nocturnal uterine contractions in the last 6 days of gestation. It is hypothesized that estradiol 17Î² (O17Î²) may be associated with the nightly increase in uterine contractions. The 24-h secretion pattern of plasma O17Î² was measured in 3 pony mares in late gestation to identify changes in release as the mare neared parturition. Blood was collected weekly at 08:00 hours beginning on day 240 and every third day from day 330 until delivery. Serial blood samples were collected from each mare every 30-min for 24-h beginning on gestation day 310 and every sixth day thereafter until parturition. Concentrations of O17Î² were elevated at night with lowest concentrations occurring directly before sunset (p < 0.01). The natural log of the variance was increased at sunset (p < 0.01) and was decreased during the 6-h period immediately after sunrise. This pattern was especially evident in the 6 days that preceded parturition. The contrast between nocturnal and daytime concentrations of O17Î² in the last 6 days of gestation may contribute to night-time delivery in the mare.

AB  - The interest in studying the brain electrical activity as a function of the development of intelligence has been spurred by the need to understand how the brain responds to environmental information. The description of sleep in mentally retarded children reveals deviant patterns of the EEG-spindles and of the eye movement activity (REM sleep) when compared to normal children. The patterns may be considered as a valuable index of mental function. According to experimental evidence, the distribution of the eye movements of sleep appears either as random or ordered. The latter are altered in the mentally handicapped in whom the appearance out of chaos, of the order which is needed for intelligence and memory to function, is altered. The sleep signs are redundant as from birth. Their pattern is also related to the psychomotor development of the infant. If their distribution remains random, or appears in long uninterrupted sequences of waves as in epilepsy, intelligence does not develop. A similar strategy appears to function in the foetus when nature organizes the structures that will lead to the development of intelligence. The eye movement patterns of sleep change in the pregnant women as a function of term and resemble those of premature babies of a similar gestational age. They also change as a function of the menstrual cycle and more generally as a function of age. The hypothesis that attention is the diurnal equivalent of REM sleep is discussed. Attempts at modelling the eye movement patterns of REM sleep as a function of near zero gravity environments have been made. 1) By means of a Montecarlo simulation using the semi Markov model during the Spacelab 1 flight. 2) With the method of the single and multiple g-phase transition analysis of the strange attractor dimension (d) during parabolic flights. The implication of the latter for the neural processes involved in learning is that the central nervous system can preserve intact, from input to output, over a period of several days, all the information it receives 3) The relation between spindles and eye movements has also been viewed by a quantum approach which is another medium between the information and the way of describing it.

AB  - Aims and method: The Department of Health would like to see serious prescribing errors reduced by 40% by 2005. Little is currently known about prescribing errors made by psychiatrists. The aim of this study was to describe prescribing errors within psychiatry by analysing interventions made by pharmacists. Members of the South-East Thames Psychiatric Pharmacists' Network were asked to record details of prescribing errors made in their trusts during the month of May 2002. Results: Five hundred and seventy-nine errors were reported during the study period. The majority of errors were due to clerical oversights or failure to apply clinical knowledge. In 63 cases (11%), the error could have resulted in a serious outcome. Clinical implications: Prescribing errors are a daily occurrence in Mental Health Trusts, and a potentially serious error is likely to occur on a weekly basis in an average trust. Steps need to be taken to minimise the chances of errors occurring.

AB  - Present-day knowledge asserts that ageing is not programmed, since there is no known active mechanism that causes death. However, life expectancy should be influenced by the "longevity" genes that control and repair the somatic cells. There are several maintenance mechanisms that loose their aptitude with age. With the involution of the thymus gland called "the biologic clock", the immune system decreases its function due to the functional reduction of the T cells. With age the function of the T effector cell is lost and the immunoregulator cells (T-helper and T-suppressor) decrease. Oxidative phosphorilation, a complex redistribution of electrons that permit adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, the chemical energy necessary for cellular activity, takes place in the mitochondria. The reason for which the genome of mitochondria is degraded so quickly, hence influencing in the process of ageing. Another cause of the ageing process is the hypothesis of the telomeres. In each cellular division the chromosomes shorten and as the end part is lost (telomeres), the, stick to each other, undergo alterations and loose some decisive genes, thus preventing an adequate replication. While evaluating that unicellular organisms should be protected against this process, the idea of a "lengthening " enzyme of the telomeres, the telomerase, came about. Bodnar and his group were able to demonstrate that as human telomerase is added to a culture of fibroblasts offibroblasts, these were capable of dividing to at least 20 times more than their life expectancy. Generally speaking, ageing is a progressive decline in homeostasis and the incapacity of the organism to respond to stress. The apoptosis, or programmed cellular death, is an important homeostatic mechanism and protector against stress. The loss of the efficiency of the apoptosis with age contributes to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. The human species have a very early reproductive senescence, taking into account their longevity. Reproductive ageing is definitely the ageing of the ovaries. The fact that women have their menopause in maturity distinguishes humans from other primates or mammals. There are some hypotheses that explain the necessity of menopause in the human species. In the species in which maternal care was crucial for the survival of the offspring, the mothers that stopped before reproducing could end up with more live descendents. If their babies were not able to survive the death of their mothers, and pregnancy and childbirth were more and more debilitating with age, therefore it would be better if the older mothers didn't have children. This hypothesis of Williams (stopping early) is very interesting but has some criticisms. In the human species to wean a baby would mean substituting its nourishment. A chimpanzee on the contrary, after weaning, the young could obtain its own food. It is evident that longevity is greater in women than in men and, although the ageing process affects both, there are differences in gender in the incidence, clinical manifestations, mortality and origin of some diseases. If we analyzed cardiovascular diseases we would find that in the risk factors (tobacco, exercise, overweight) there are differences in gender. In Spain there is a decrease in nicotinism in men, but this tendency in reduction does not occur in women (40% of the young Spanish women of 15 to 25 years are smokers). The prevalence of overweight and obesity is also greater in women (28% of the women with equal or greater MCI of 30 versus 18% of men). Myocardial infarct in women is more severe, with a greater mortality and morbidity. With regards to osteoporosis, it is known that the loss of ovaric function during menopause represents the most important factor for its development. Estrogen deficit following menopause causes severe disorders in the conjunctive tissue of women, mainly in the skin, bones and blood vessels. It is accepted that the loss of bone mass, the thinning of the skin and the reduction of collagen in the skin can have a common etiology. Studies of our group of a period of 10 years demonstrated that collagen decrease within the skin in ageing is due, not only to a degradation process of this protein, but also to a selective decrease in the synthesis of new collagen (the volume of dense chromatin of keratinocytes of the human skin increases with age). The chondroitin sulphate content, a glucosaminoglucanate of the skin, also diminishes with age (data not published) and in some body locations the quantity in women is less than in men.

AB  - Intermittent hypoxia (IH), one of the hallmarks of obstructive sleep apnea, occurs more frequently during pregnancy. We hypothesized that IH may lead to persistent postnatal changes in respiratory responses to acute hypoxia and may also lead to adverse effects on spatial function learning as revealed by the Morris water maze. To examine this issue, time-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to IH and room air (IHRA; 21 and 10% O2 alternations every 90 seconds) or to normoxia (RARA) until delivery. Ventilatory and metabolic responses to a 20-minute acute hypoxic challenge (10% O2) were conducted at postnatal ages 5, 10, 15, and 30 days. In addition, spatial task learning was assessed in the water maze at 1 and 4 months of age. Normoxic ventilation was higher at all time points in IHRA rats than in RARA rats (p &lt; 0.01). Peak hypoxic ventilatory responses were attenuated in IHRA rats at 5 days of age and hypoxic ventilatory depression was accentuated at this age as well. However, ventilatory equivalents (minute ventilation/oxygen consumption) revealed significant reductions in peak hypoxic ventilatory responses of IHRA rats and hypoxic ventilatory depression at all postnatal ages (p &lt; 0.01). Acquisition and retention of a spatial task were similar in the IHRA and RARA groups at both 1 and 4 months of age. We conclude that gestational intermittent hypoxia elicits long-lasting alterations in the control of breathing. We postulate that such IH-induced respiratory plasticity may create selective vulnerability to hypoxia during development.

AB  - The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and target of treatment for bipolar disorder. They are based explicitly on the available evidence and presented, similar to previous Clinical Practice guidelines, as recommendations to aid clinical decision-making for practitioners. They may also serve as a source of information for patients and carers. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the available evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were drawn up after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. The strength of supporting evidence was rated. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management and strategies for the use of medicines in short-term treatment of episodes, relapse prevention and stopping treatment.

AB  - This paper gives an overview of present scientific knowledge in health research on the effects from radio and microwave frequency radiation, at levels to which the general population is typically exposed. The review is based on human experimental and epidemiological studies investigating the effects of radiation in the frequency range between 100 kHz and 10 GHz. The relevant studies were identified via systematic searches of the databases Medline and ISI Web of Science. The review concludes that the existing scientific knowledge base is too limited to draw final conclusions on the health risk from exposure in the low-dose range. Only few studies have investigated the effect of long-term exposure on the general population in the normal environment. Accordingly, little can be predicted regarding long-term health risks. Various studies observed an increased risk for tumours in the hematopoietic and lymphatic tissue of people living in the proximity of TV and radio broadcast transmitters. However, methodological limitations to these studies have been identified and their findings are controversial. In studies of a possible association between brain tumours and mobile phone use, the average period mobile phones use was short compared to the known latency period of brain tumours. Although these studies did not establish an overall increased risk of brain tumours associated with mobile phone use, there were some indications of an association. Immediate effects associated with mobile phone use have been observed in human experimental studies that cannot be explained by conventional thermal mechanisms. The observed effects are within the normal physiological range and are therefore hard to interpret with respect to an increased risk to health. However, it can be concluded that mechanisms other than the established thermal mechanisms exist. Because of the present fragmentary scientific database, a precautionary approach when dealing with radio and microwave frequency radiation is recommended for the individual and the general population.

AB  - The physiological significance of spectral and fractal components of spontaneous heart rate (HR) variability in the fetus remains unclear. To examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different measures of HR variability, R-R interval time series obtained by fetal ECGs were recorded continuously over 24 h in five pregnant sheep at 116-125 days gestation. Conventional measures of short-term (STV) and long-term variability (LTV), low-frequency (LF; 0.025-0.15 cycles/beat) and high-frequency (HF; 0.2-0.5 cycles/beat) spectral powers, the LF-to-HF ratio, and fractal dimension values were calculated from 24-h ECG recordings and quantified every 60 min. STV, LTV, and LF and HF spectral powers were minimal during the day but increased significantly to their highest values at night. We found a significant positive correlation between these measures, whereas the cosinor method showed significant similarity between their circadian rhythm patterns. Fetal R-R intervals also exhibited fractal structures. Fetal HR variability had a fractal structure, which was similar between day and night. These results suggested that the circadian rhythms exhibited by STV and LTV during the day were mainly due to changes in frequency components rather than to fractal components of fetal HR fluctuation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether stress, sleep disturbance, or fatigue at 22 to 26 weeks of gestation is related to the incidence of preterm labor and birth in military women. Data were collected prospectively by questionnaires measuring factors contributing to preterm labor and birth. Hours worked per week were ascertained by telephone until the participants delivered. Postpartum medical records were reviewed for pregnancy outcomes. There was a trend for preterm labor to be associated with lower perceived fatigue severity, low sleep disturbance, and more negative life events. Officer rank was related to both preterm labor and delivery. Findings indicate that the perception of fatigue may be protective against preterm birth and that military officer rank is a risk factor for preterm labor and birth.

AB  - Aim: To determine any variation in the respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia of infants born small for gestational age (SGA) to smoking and to non-smoking mothers. Methods: A total of 70 average for gestational age (AGA) infants (&gt;36 weeks gestation, &gt;2500 g, &gt;25th centile for gestational age, and no maternal smoking), and 47 SGA infants (&lt;10th centile for gestational age) were studied at 1 and 3 months of age, in quiet and active sleep. Respiratory test gases were delivered through a Perspex hood to simulate face down rebreathing by slowly allowing the inspired air to be altered to a CO2 maximum of 5% and O2 minimum of 13.5%. The change in ventilation with inspired CO2 was measured over 5-6 minutes of the test. The slope of a linear curve fit relating inspired CO2 to the logarithm of ventilation was taken as a quantitative measure of ventilatory asphyxial sensitivity (VAS). Results: There was no significant difference in VAS between the AGA and SGA infants (0.25 v 0.24). However within the SGA group, VAS was significantly higher (p = 0.048) in the infants whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (0.26 (0.01); n = 24) than in those that did not (0.23 (0.01); n = 23). The change in minute ventilation was significantly higher in the smokers than the non-smokers group (141% v 119%; p = 0.03) as the result of a significantly larger change in respiratory rate (8 v 4 breaths/min; p = 0.047) but not tidal volume. Conclusions: Maternal smoking appears to be the key factor in enhancing infants' respiratory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia, irrespective of gestational age.

AB  - Objective. To examine risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) with the goal of reducing SIDS mortality among blacks, which continues to affect this group at twice the rate of whites. Methods. We analyzed data from a population-based case-control study of 260 SIDS deaths that occurred in Chicago between 1993 and 1996 and an equal number of matched living controls to determine the association between SIDS and factors in the sleep environment and other variables related to infant care. Results. The racial/ethnic composition of the study groups was 75.0% black; 13.1% Hispanic white; and 11.9% non-Hispanic white. Several factors related to the sleep environment during last sleep were associated with higher risk of SIDS: placement in the prone position (unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-3.4), soft surface (OR: 5.1; 95% CI: 3.1-8.3), pillow use (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.5-4.2), face and/or head covered with bedding (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.3-4.6), bed sharing overall (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.8-4.2), bed sharing with parent(s) alone (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.2-3.1), and bed sharing in other combinations (OR: 5.4; 95% CI: 2.8-10.2). Pacifier use was associated with decreased risk (unadjusted OR: 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2-0.5), as was breastfeeding either ever (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.3) or currently (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1-0.4). In a multivariate model, several factors remained significant: prone sleep position, soft surface, pillow use, bed sharing other than with parent(s) alone, and not using a pacifier. Conclusions. To lower further the SIDS rate among black and other racial/ethnic groups, prone sleeping, the use of soft bedding and pillows, and some types of bed sharing should be reduced.

AB  - The use of the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire as a means of determining prevalence of psychiatric disorders in early pregnancy is described. Two hundred and seventy-three women attending their first antenatal appointment completed the instrument. Positive cases identified by both the GHQ scoring method (cut-off score 5/6) and the Likert method (cut-off score 23/24) were compared. Using the GHQ method, 44.3% of the women scored 5 or above; 50.5% scored 4 or above. Using the Likert method, 39.6% scored 24 or above. The GHQ method identified 21 cases undetected by the Likert (17%) and the Likert method identified eight cases undetected by the GHQ (7.4%). The results indicate higher prevalence rates than found in community samples. Pending further research, it is recommended that the GHQ be used with caution in antenatal settings.

AB  - PPD is a treatable and underrecognized illness that affects 10% to 20% of new mothers and may have significant repercussions for the health and well-being of women and their children. Pediatricians may help mothers to identify, cope with, and seek treatment for PPD by routinely screening new mothers for depression, identifying high-risk maternal attitudes and behaviors, providing referrals to mental health specialists, and assisting with the risk-benefit analysis of medication treatment during breastfeeding. By becoming actively involved, pediatricians can help their pediatric patients.

AB  - Background and Objective: Changes in circadian variation of blood pressure could be used either to predict preeclampsia or to assess its severity. With the objective of identifying potential differences in blood pressure at the early stages of pregnancy, we examined and compared the characteristics of circadian variability in blood pressure in healthy and complicated pregnant women who were systematically monitored throughout gestation. Subjects and Method: We analyzed 2,014 blood pressure series sampled through ambulatory monitoring for 48 hours once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit until delivery. The study included 205 women with uncomplicated pregnancy, 92 with gestational hypertension and 31 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group and trimester of gestation was established by means of a population multiple-components analysis. Results: Differences in the 24-hour mean between healthy and complicated pregnancies were highly significant in all trimesters (p < 0.001), with values of 15.1 and 9.1 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood presure, respectively, in the third trimester of pregnancy. The 24-hour mean of systolic/diastolic blood pressure for complicated pregnancies was always below 120/72 mmHg. Results further indicated similar circadian characteristics between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these two groups in the 24-hour mean was significant in the second trimester for systolic (3 mmHg; p = 0.002) but not diastolic blood pressure (0.9 mmHg; p = 0.230). In the third trimester, the difference between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia was significant for both variables (5.4 and 3.7 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; p < 0.001). Conclusions: The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies, which are observed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, are detected when both systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements in women with a late diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia fall within accepted ranges of normotension. These differences offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic interventions.

AB  - The pattern of locomotor activity across development was assessed in male and female spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Open field activity did not indicate hyperactivity in the SHR. Instead, the SD strain was generally more active. Strains and sexes did not differ in open-field locomotor response to drug challenges. When short-term (10-12 min) activity in different apparatuses was compared, the SD were most active in the open field, the SHR in the residential figure-eight maze, and the WKY in the running wheel. Long-term tests indicated hyperactivity in the SHR in the residential figure-eight maze and hypoactivity in the SD in the running wheels. Until such strain differences in activity are thoroughly defined, the use of the SHR as a model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is limited.

AB  - We tested in Siberian hamsters the nature of the maternal signal that relays photoperiodic information to the developing fetuses. As previous investigations have identified maternal hormonal and circadian components in this process, the specific goal of this presentation is to determine quality of the signal that connotes daylength when it is imparted to the fetus. Does the function of the signal received by the fetus best support the coincidence or duration hypotheses of photoperiodic induction? Pregnant hamsters received 1 or 8 hr melatonin or vehicle infusions everyday. Juveniles of intact mothers gestated on 16 hr of light per day (16L) experienced maximal suppression of testicular development when reared on 14L. However, when intact mothers gestated on 10L received a 1-hr melatonin infusion daily at 20:00-21:00 hr, their young responded to 14L with greatly accelerated testicular development. In the absence of the maternal pineal gland (and, therefore, the maternal melatonin signal), the effects of maternal melatonin infusions were reversed. Here, only the juveniles of 16L-gestated females infused at 20:00-21:00 hr daily responded to 14L with enhanced testicular development. All other groups showed the same extent of gonadal development, independent of the time or type of infusion their mothers received. Testicular development on 14L of all juveniles from pinealectomized mothers gestated on 10L was of the same magnitude, regardless of the type and time of infusion their mothers received during pregnancy. The results suggest that the maternal signal transferred to the fetuses during gestation consists not only of the daily melatonin signal, but also some circadian-based component that greatly affects the effect of the former. The timing, and not the duration, of the maternal melatonin signal with respect to the animals' (mother and fetus) circadian day is of crucial importance in the transfer of photoperiodic information from mother to fetus.

AB  - The interactions of 3-month-old infants and their depressed mothers were classified as intrusive, withdrawn or good interactions. Analyses of retrospective data suggested that all depressed groups scored higher on depression (CES-D) and anxiety (STAI) scales and had similarly elevated cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine during pregnancy. The depressed mothers and their newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation. Despite these group similarities, the infants of the "good interaction" mothers did not show high amounts of indeterminate sleep and they received better scores on the Brazelton scale. The more organized behaviors of these newborns may have contributed to the better interaction ratings of the "good interaction" depressed mothers. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The epidemic of obesity requires an intervention that is both effective and broadly acceptable. Conventional medical programs have been ineffective. Traditional surgical approaches, such as gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion, are accepted by less than 1% of the severely obese each year. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) has been in clinical use for 8 years and it is timely to look at the developments in technique and to look at the outcomes for safety, effectiveness, and acceptability. Data are based on our clinical experiences and research reports derived from 1145 patients treated to date by laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. We have also drawn on the published literature and on a systematic review of the literature about LAGB published by the Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures-Surgical. Generally reports that have included more than 100 patients and 3 or more years of follow-up have been selected. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has proved to be a safe procedure, 7 to 10 times safer than gastric bypass in terms of mortality, and associated with few perioperative complications. Late events have been more frequent with prolapse of the stomach through the band occurring in 15% of our initial patients and erosion of the band into the stomach in 3.2% of our initial patients. Both complications are treatable laparoscopically and have become less common with modifications of technique. Weight loss is gradual but progressive over the first 2 years and has stabilized at about 50% of excess weight lost for the next 4 years. There are major associated improvements in the multiple comorbidities of obesity including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sleep disordered breathing, comorbidities of pregnancy, and the quality of life (QOL). Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has several attributes that potentially will enable it to overcome the community's resistance to bariatric surgery. It has proved to be safe. It is highly effective in achieving good weight loss, major improvements in health, and improved QOL. Because of the laparoscopic placement, adjustablity, and the easy reversibility, LAGB can provide these benefits in a gentle and safe way.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of clozapine in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Method: 101 patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia (N = 34); schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (N = 30); or bipolar disorder with psychotic features (N = 37) were naturalistically treated with clozapine at flexible doses over a 48-month period. Data were collected from 1994 to 2000. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale total predicted scores over time were estimated with random-effects regression models. Time to response to clozapine, defined as 50% reduction of BPRS score, was analyzed in the 3 diagnostic groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Results: The BPRS total predicted score halved its baseline value in 3 months for bipolar disorder patients, in 6 months for schizoaffective disorder patients, and in 24 months for schizophrenia patients. The proportion of subjects who satisfied the criterion for response to clozapine after 48 months of follow-up was significantly (p < .01) higher in the schizoaffective and bipolar disorder groups (90.0% and 83.8%, respectively) than in the schizophrenia group (64.7%). Baseline scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) showed low levels of psychosocial and occupational functioning in all 3 groups. After 48 months of treatment, GAF scores showed a functional improvement in all 3 groups, with significantly (p < .01) greater improvement in the bipolar disorder group compared with the other groups. Conclusion: The findings of this study confirm the efficacy and safety of clozapine for treatment-resistant patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Patients with schizoaffective disorder and those with bipolar disorder show greater clinical improvement than those with schizophrenia. Patients with bipolar disorder have the shortest time to response and the highest psychosocial and occupational functioning levels. Patients with schizoaffective disorder have the lowest treatment discontinuation rate.
Indications:101 patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (n=34), schizoaffective disorder (n=30), or bipolar disorder with psychotic features (n=37).
Patients:101 patients. Schizophrenia group: n=34, 22 males and 12 females, mean age 33.3 Â± 11.7 years. Schizoaffective disorder group: n=30, 23 males and 7 females, mean age 32.0 Â± 7.4 years. Bipolar disorder group: n=37, 25 males and 12 females, mean age 37.2 Â± 14.0 years. 5 dropouts due to side effects.
TypeofStudy:An open, naturalistic, prospective 48-month follow-up study evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of Leponex in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features.
DosageDuration:Starting dose at 25 mg daily increased to a maximum of 600 mg daily. Duration: 48 months.
Results:101 patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia (N = 34); schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (N = 30); or bipolar disorder with psychotic features (N = 37) were naturalistically treated with clozapine at flexible doses over a 48-month period. The proportion of subjects who satisfied the criterion for response to clozapine after 48 months of follow-up was significantly (p < .01) higher in the schizoaffective and bipolar disorder groups (90.0% and 83.8%, respectively) than in the schizophrenia group (64.7%).. 54 patients (53.5% of the sample; 20 (58.8%) of those with schizophrenia, 11 (36.7%) of those with schizoaffective disorder, and 23 (62.2%) of those with bipolar disorder) discontinued Leponex treatment during the 48-month follow-up period: 18 (17.8 %) discontinued Leponex during the first 12 months of treatment; 17 (16.8%), between 12 and 18 months; 3 (3.0%), between 18 and 24 months; 6 (5.9%), between 24 and 36 months; and 10 (9.9%), between 36 and 48 months. Reasons for discontinuation were inadequate response to treatment (worsening of symptomatology, relapse, or rehospitalization) in 15 subjects (14.9%); noncompliance in 17 subjects (16.8%); side effects (sedation, sleep cycle inversion, weight gain, leukopenia) in 5 subjects (5.0%); and other reasons in 17 subjects (16.8%): inability to regularly reach to center due to distance (n=13), pregnancy (n=2), or spontaneous treatment interruption due to improvement (n=2). Inadequate response to Leponex was experienced by 7 patients (20.6%) with schizophrenia, 2 patients (6.7%) with schizoaffective disorder, and 6 patients (16.2%) with bipolar disorder. The mean daily dose of Leponex did not differ within each of the 3 diagnostic groups over the 48-month period and were significantly lower in patients with bipolar disorder (137 mg) than in patients with schizoaffective disorder (228 mg) or schizophrenia (236 mg). During the 48-month follow-up period, adjunctive agents were added to Leponex for patients from each diagnostic category. Overall, mean baseline BPRS total score did not significantly differ between those treated with Leponex monotherapy (18/101; 17.8%) and those treated with a combination of Leponex and typical neuroleptics (43/101; 42.6%).The predicted BPRS total scores showed that Leponex induced a significant improvement over time. Although their values at baseline were similar, patients with bipolar disorder showed significantly (p <.05) more rapid improvement than patients in the other 2 groups during the first 3 months of treatment, while patients with schizoaffective disorder showed significantly (p <.05) more rapid improvement than patients with schizophrenia during the first 6 months of treatment. It is worth noting that all patients who achieved the psychosocial and occupational functioning outcome measure also achieved the clinical outcome measure. Patients with bipolar disorder showed the most rapid improvement in BPRS score and achieved the highest percentages of improvement within 18 months. After 48 months of treatment, GAF scores showed a functional improvement in all 3 groups, significantly (p < .01) higher in those with bipolar disorder compared with the other groups. Patients with schizoaffective disorder showed a steady improvement that was more rapid than that of patients with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia showed the slowest improvement as measured by total BPRS score throughout the 48 months, significantly (p < .01) less than that of the other 2 groups, and the lowest psychosocial and occupational functioning level at 48 months.
AdverseEffects:5 patients experienced sedation, sleep cycle inversion, weight gain, and leukopenia.
AuthorsConclusions:The findings of this study confirm the efficacy and safety of clozapine for treatment-resistant patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Patients with schizoaffective disorder and those with bipolar disorder show greater clinical improvement than those with schizophrenia. Patients with bipolar disorder have the shortest time to response and the highest psychosocial and occupational functioning levels. Patients with schizoaffective disorder have the lowest treatment discontinuation rate.
FreeText:Severity of psychopathology was assessed at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months using the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), scored on a 0-to-6 scale. The Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale (CGI-S) was also administered at baseline and after 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Psychosocial and occupational functioning were measured using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), which contains questions referring to the patient's status over the past year. The GAF was administered at Leponex therapy first intake and after 48 months of treatment. In the schizophrenia group, patients were administered typical neuroleptics (47.1%; 16/34), anticonvulsants (17.6%; 6/34), antidepressants (47.1%; 16/34), and benzodiazepines (8.8%; 3/34). In the schizoaffective disorder group, patients were administered typical neuroleptics (43.3%; 13/30), lithium (6.7%; 2/30), anticonvulsants (13.3%; 4/30), antidepressants (60.0%; 18/30), and benzodiazepines (23.3%; 7/30). In the bipolar disorder group, patients were administered typical neuroleptics (37.8%; 14/37), lithium (27.0%; 10/37), anticonvulsants (35.1%; 13/37), antidepressants (37.8%; 14/37), and benzodiazepines (8.1%; 3/37). The changes in the dosages and/or number of adjunctive agents (converted to standardized equivalent doses of chlorpromazine, sodium valproate, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)fluvoxamine, and imipramine) over the whole period of follow-up were evaluated, only the patients who completed the study (n=47) were considered.

AB  - The circadian system in mammals generates endogenous circadian rhythms and entrains them to external cycles. Here, we examine whether the lighting conditions under which rats are reared affect the properties of the circadian pacemaker. We maintained three groups of rats under constant darkness (DD-rats), constant bright light (LL-rats) or light-dark cycles of 24 hours (LD-rats) during lactation. We then studied motor activity rhythm under constant light of four intensities, and under seven light-dark cycles with periods ranging between 22 and 27 hours. Results show that neither the tau nor the phase angle to the external cycle differed between groups. Differences were found in the amplitude of the circadian rhythm and in the number of rats that became arrhythmic under LL. We conclude that the light received during lactation affects the strength of the circadian pacemaker and its sensitivity to light.

AB  - Despite poor sensitivity and specificity, office blood pressure (BP) determinations are still the "gold standard" for diagnosing gestational hypertension. This prospective blind study evaluates the prognostic value of office values as compared with ambulatory monitoring in pregnancy. We analyzed 2175 BP series systematically sampled from 355 non-preeclamptic pregnant women for 48h every 4wks from the first hospital visit until delivery. Women were divided for comparative purposes into three groups: "detected" gestational hypertension, defined on the basis of casual clinical BP > 140/90 mm Hg after 20 wks of gestation and hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of a time-specified tolerance interval adjusted for the circadian pattern of the reference population) consistently above the threshold for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy; "undetected" gestational hypertension, women with office BP < 140/90 mm Hg but hyperbaric index consistently above the threshold for diagnosis; and normotension, women with both office values and hyperbaric index below the respective thresholds for diagnosis. Small and insignificant differences in the 24h mean BP between "detected" and "undetected" gestational hypertension is observed in all trimesters, in contrast with highly significant differences between these two groups and normotensive pregnancies. Normotensive women are characterized by highly significant lesser incidence by 60% in preterm delivery, 70% in intrauterine growth retardation, and 50% in delivery by cesarean section (p < 0.001) compared with women with "detected" and "undetected" gestational hypertension (p > 0.715). In pregnancy, the hyperbaric index is markedly superior to office BP measurements for diagnosis of what should be truly considered gestational hypertension, and for prediction of the outcome of pregnancy.

AB  - Î²-Ionone (BI) is a degraded (C 13) sesquiterpene found in plant essential oils. It has been used in the synthesis of perfume chemicals and vitamin A. Recently, it was reported that BI is a rather potent in vitro inhibitor of CYP2B1-catalysed reactions in rat liver microsomes. The present study was performed to investigate whether inhibition of CYP2B1 reactions by BI could lead to an attenuation of cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced embryotoxicity in the rat. In a preliminary experiment, a dose-dependent prolongation of pentobarbital sleeping time in male and female Wistar rats suggested that BI inhibits CYP2B1 in vivo as well. In a second experiment, rats were treated by gavage with BI (0, 250, 500, 750 or 1000 mg/kg body wt) 45 min prior to a subcutaneous injection of either CP (7.5 mg/kg body wt) or its vehicle (saline) on day 11 of pregnancy. BI alone, at the highest dose tested, caused a high proportion of resorptions. Lower doses of BI, however, clearly attenuated CP-induced embryolethality and teratogenicity. These results seem to support the view that, as far as rats are concerned, CYP2B1 plays an important role in the conversion of CP into its embryolethal and teratogenic metabolites.

AB  - The effects of shift work on physiological function through disruption of circadian rhythms are well described. However, shift work can also be associated with specific pathological disorders. This article reviews the evidence for a relationship between specific medical disorders and working at night or on shift systems. The strongest evidence exists for an association with peptic ulcer disease, coronary heart disease and compromised pregnancy outcome.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate and analyse circadian variations of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAA) activity in blood of goats and the influence of late pregnancy on the circadian variations of RAA system. The study was carried out on a group of 17 non-pregnant and 9 pregnant goats. The animals were kept in uniform environmental conditions, (9 h light/15 h darkness). Blood samples were collected seven times over a period of 24 h, every 4 h. Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone (PA), sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations were determined. PRA and PA of both groups changed during 24 h, with the highest values in the dark phase and with higher RAA system activity (especially during the night) in the pregnant goats. In the non-pregnant goats, no circadian changes in PRA and PA were observed. The circadian changes in PRA and PA found in pregnant goats had acrophases at 06:27 h and 01:13 h, respectively. Plasma electrolyte concentrations in both groups of goats also changed during 24 h. These results suggest that circadian changes of potassium concentration in plasma of goats during late pregnancy may be one of the main factors affecting the RAA system. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The belief that fertility problems derive from maternal age, increasing markedly at 35, reflects social constructions of biology in developed nations. These constructions perpetuate a negative view of female aging. However, research since 1985 can be interpreted to suggest that there is no, or minimal, association between maternal age and problems associated with fertility. Differences in problems between pre- and postmaternal age 35 fertility can be explained by social conditions occurring with fertility, notably, parenting decisions, physical problems with the male and the potential child, and medical intervention. Once we look at fertility as a relationship among the woman, the man, and the potential child, rather than the woman only, we can see these factors. These components suggest that maternal age may be related only tangentially to successful fertility. Â© 2003 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Background: Changes in circadian variation of blood pressure (BP) could be used either to predict preeclampsia or to assess its severity. We examined and compared characteristics of circadian variability in BP in women with both healthy and complicated pregnancies who were systematically monitored throughout gestation. Methods: We analyzed 2430 BP series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for 48 h once every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit until delivery in 235 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 128 with gestational hypertension, and 40 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP variation for each group and trimester of gestation was established by population multiple-components analysis. Results: The differences in 24-h mean and amplitude between healthy and complicated pregnancies were highly significant in all trimesters (P < 0.001). Results further indicated similar circadian characteristics between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these two groups in 24-h mean was statistically significant for systolic (P = .002) and diastolic BP (P = .038) in the second trimester and, to a larger extent, in the third trimester (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The differences in BP between healthy and complicated pregnancies that can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy are found when both systolic and diastolic BP for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted range of normotension. These differences offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic intervention.

AB  - In order to clarify the relationship between the diurnal variations in baseline fetal heart rate (BFHR) and maternal factors, simultaneous 24 h recordings of fetal heart rate, maternal heart rate (MHR) and maternal movement (MM) were made on one pregnant woman with a monochorionic twin pregnancy at 31, 34 and 36 weeks. The diurnal variations in BFHR of twins were highly correlated with no phase-lag. Although BFHR was correlated with MHR and MM at 31 and 36 weeks with phase-lag, there was no correlation between them at 34 weeks, despite the synchronization of BFHR between twins. It was suggested MHR and MM might not drive the diurnal variation of BFHR directly, because BFHR, MHR and MM did not always correlate. Â© 2003, Japanese Society of Sleep Research.

AB  - This study prospectively investigates the potential influence of low-dose aspirin on blood pressure in pregnant women who were at a higher risk of developing preeclampsia than that of the general obstetric population and who received aspirin at different times of the day according to their rest-activity cycle. A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 341 pregnant women (181 primipara) randomly assigned to 1 of 6 possible groups according to treatment (either placebo or aspirin, 100 mg/day, starting at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation) and the time of treatment: on awakening (time 1), 8 hours after awakening (time 2), or before bedtime (time 3). Blood pressure was automatically monitored for 48 consecutive hours every 4 weeks from the day of recruitment until delivery, as well as at puerperium. There was no effect of aspirin on blood pressure at time 1 (compared with placebo). A blood pressure reduction was highly statistically significant when aspirin was given at time 2 and, to a greater extent, at time 3 (mean reductions of 9.7/6.5 mm Hg in 24-hour mean for systolic/diastolic blood pressure at the time of delivery as compared with placebo given at bedtime). Differences in blood pressure among women receiving aspirin at different circadian times disappeared at puerperium (P>0.096). Results indicate a highly significant effect of aspirin on blood pressure that is markedly dependent on the time of aspirin administration with respect to the rest-activity cycle, Timed use of aspirin at low dose effectively contributes to blood pressure control in women at high risk for preeclampsia.

AB  - Muscle cramps are involuntary, painful, sudden contractions of the skeletal muscles. They are present in normal subjects under certain conditions (during a strong voluntary contraction, sleep, sports, pregnancy) and in several pathologies such as myopathies, neuropathies, motoneuron diseases, metabolic disorders, hydroelectrolyte imbalances or endocrine pathologies. There has been considerable uncertainty in the literature regarding the classification and nomenclature of muscle cramps, both because the term "cramp" is used to indicate a variety of clinical features of muscles, leading to its use as an imprecise "umbrella" term that includes stiffness, contractures and local pain, and because the spectrum of the diseases in which it appears is wide. The purpose of the present study is to propose a simple classification to provide a framework to better recognize the full spectrum of phenomenology of muscle cramps.

AB  - The problems of coping with adolescence are greatly increased by an additional chronic disorder. This is particularly so for those with epilepsy, where there is social stigma and the need for potentially sedative and damaging medication. Epilepsy is the most common neurological condition among patients transferred from paediatric to adult care. Many of the problems encountered in the teenager with epilepsy are shared by those with other chronic disabilities. This review considers the paediatric environment that the adolescent is leaving, the rationale for a teenage clinic, and the facets of this which make it a desirable facility.

AB  - Objective: The issue of a quantitative and qualitative impoverishment of dream activity in alexithymic subjects was assessed by analysis of the 14-day dream reports of two groups of accurately selected alexithymic and nonalexithymic subjects. Methods: Ten alexithymic and 10 nonalexithymic women were selected from a larger sample of 160 undergraduate students. The transcriptions of their audio-recorded dream reports on 14 consecutive morning awakenings were compared with regard to their length and emotional content. Self-ratings obtained from sleep and dream diaries were further considered to assess between-groups differences in dream recall frequency and in the emotional valence, vividness, and bizarreness of dreams. Results: Dream recall frequency and mean length of dream reports were lower in alexithymic than in nonalexithymic subjects, There were no significant between-groups differences in emotional valence, vividness, bizarreness, and emotions scored according to the Hall and Van de Castle coding system. Conclusions: The results suggest a general difficulty of alexithymics in accessing (recalling) their dreams.

AB  - Self-administered psychosocial treatments for child health problems have the potential to circumvent barriers to traditional models of care. They are convenient and inexpensive to families and, for some types of problems, may be as effective as therapist-based care. In a review of past research on child- and parent-facilitated self-administered treatments, it was found that a stronger evidence base exists in support of some formats (manual- and multimedia-based treatments) than for others (inspirational literature and support groups). The practical, ethical, and legal issues associated with self-administered treatments are discussed as well as avenues for future research. How psychologists and health care systems respond to the opportunities associated with self-administered treatments for children will likely affect the face of the profession and the health of children in the future.

AB  - The author begins by describing the topographic location and qualification of the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) which is the well point (jingxue) of the kidney channel and, being one of the "acupuncture points associated with the three areas Heaven, Earth and Man" (tiandiren sancai xue), is very widely used. The author illustrates his clinical experience with the help of seven comprehensively described case studies. In the first case study, a patient's fainting condition was attributed to an affection of wind (apoplexy, vento percussio, zhongfeng), which caused both the qi and xue to rise to the surface and to block the sensory openings. The treatment consisted of "drastic lowering" (jiangce fa) achieved at the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan). In the case of a patient who had suffered chronic headaches over a number of years as a result of the reversal (jue) of the kidney functional system, the moistening and nourishment of the kidney functional system achieved by the author by suppletive needling of the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) showed beneficial effect. A patient suffering from epistaxis owing to the drying-out of the "active juices" (jin) and heat (re) in the pulmonal functional system received acupuncture treatment using the point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) and drawing blood at point LU 11 "Lesser Yang" (metallum structivum, shaoshang) in order to cool and drain the heat (re) in the main lung channel. In another patient infertility was attributed to depletion of the kidney qi. This was remedied by suppletion via the acupuncture points KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan), REN 7 "Yin Intersection" (copulatio yin, yinjiao), REN 4 "Gate of Origin" (prima clusarum, guanyuan) and SP 6 "Three Yin Intersection" (copulatio trium yin, sanyinjiao). In this case moxibustion was also used in addition to acupuncture. This treatment is also recommended in the incidence of male fertility disorders such as erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders and oligozoospermatism. In the case of another patient with sleep disorders resulting from inadequate harmony between the heart and kidney functional systems, the kidney system was supplemented using acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan); at the same time the author used the points HE 7 "Spirit Gate" (porta shen, shenmen), P 6 "Inner Pass" (clusa interna, neiguan) and SP 6 "Three Yin intersection" (copulatio trium yin, sanyinjiao) in order to cool the evolutive phase Fire. A further patient, after severe emotional upset, was suffering repeated attacks of vomiting because of a contraflow (contravection, ni) of the liver qi which had also affected the stomach functional system. In his course of therapy the author combined the acupuncture points KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) and LIV 3 "Great Rushing" (impedimentale maius, taichong) in order to free up the liver functional system and to enrich the kidney functional system. In the treatment of emesis, particularly during pregnancy, he recommends the additional use of the further points "Golden Liquid" and "Jade Fluid" (jinjin, yuye). The final case study focuses on an infant with oral candidiasis (thrush in the mouth) as a result of glare (huo) from the heart functional system blazing to the surface. Here the author describes the stimulation of the acupuncture point KID 1 "Gushing Spring" (fons scatens, yongquan) using a paste made of pulverized Evodia fruit (Wuzhuyu) and vinegar. The article closes with an examination of the effect of this compound when used on adults.

AB  - In the mammal, melatonin regulates the seasonal and/or circadian rhythm of PRL levels. Since several members of the PRL gene family are expressed during late pregnancy, we investigated the relationship between the expression of placental lactogen (PL)-II-one member of the PRL family- and melatonin, as well as the placental expression of one of the receptors for melatonin, melatonin receptor 1a (Mel1a). Herein we provide the first demonstration that Mel1a is not only expressed in the rat placenta, but that it is spatially and temporally regulated throughout late pregnancy. In situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses show that Mel1a mRNA is localized in the rat placenta on gestational day 19, and is mainly restricted to the spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cells. Interestingly, the junctional zone of the placenta at this time showed the strongest gene expression when the tissue was obtained at 16:00 h (daytime) and showed the least expression when it was obtained at 04:00 h (night-time). In contrast, the labyrinth zone showed the strongest expression in tissue obtained at night and showed the least expression in tissue obtained during the day. PL-II gene expression also exhibited a circadian rhythm but the direction of the fluctuation was exactly opposite to that of the Mel1a gene, such that at night the junctional zone had the strongest expression, while the labyrinth zone had the weakest. In vitro treatment of placental tissue with an melatonin agonist, chloromelatonin, greatly decreased PL-II mRNA levels. That Mel1a plays a regulatory role in the expression of PL-II in the late-pregnancy rat placenta is strongly suggested by the pattern of its own spatial and temporal expression.

AB  - The circadian timing of spontaneous human deliveries results in births occurring statistically more often during the nocturnal phase of the 24-h cycle. The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying this physiological phenomenon are not understood. In an effort to test the hypothesis that melatonin may serve as an endocrine signal for coordinating myometrial events in the human, we determined the mRNA expression of both MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptor isoforms in pregnant as well as nonpregnant myometrial biopsies by means of RT-PCR and in situ hybridization histochemistry. Additionally, we could demonstrate specific, high affinity iodomelatonin binding to myometrial tissues of both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Primary cultures of myocytes responded differentially from melatonin in terms of cAMP signaling depending on the reproductive state. These results imply that melatonin may have the potential to modulate myometrial function in the human, a finding that could open up new possibilities for the development of novel therapeutic agents.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of continuous light and darkness on plasma levels of melatonin in relation to the extremely large and active pineal gland typically found in newborn seals. Plasma levels of melatonin in captive newborn harp (Phoca groenlandica) and hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) were generally extremely high, with peak concentrations ranging from 0.8 ng/ml to 62.3 ng/ml. Moreover, plasma melatonin showed a similar, pronounced rhythmicity, both outdoors under natural light conditions (hooded seal only) and indoors under either 30 h of continuous light (490 lux) or 30 h of darkness (0 lux). In all animals, the melatonin rhythm was closely associated with the outdoor light-dark cycle. We suggest that the melatonin rhythmicity in newborn seals is mainly under circadian control and that it originates by maternal influence in the foetus. Daytime plasma concentrations of melatonin were also measured in foetal hooded seals and their mothers. The foetal melatonin level was similar to daytime levels in newborns and was about five times higher than in their mothers, which indicates a significant flow of foetal melatonin to the mother. We speculate that the large pineal gland and high melatonin levels in the newborn seals are temporary consequences of a foetal strategy to affect the maternal blood supply during diving.

AB  - The fibrinolytic system plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hemostasis and the prevention of thrombosis. There are no drugs that will increase the plasma fibrinolytic activity for a lasting duration to prevent thrombotic events effectively. Despite the ability of vasoactive agents such as nicotinic acid and metformin to release PA from the vessel wall, this therapeutic effect has not been evaluated adequately. The PAs are short-acting and indicated only for thrombolysis and not for prophylaxis. Future directions are directed at finding agents that can enhance plasminogen activator release or inhibit PAI-1 activity. As there are multiple factors involved in the pathogenesis of thrombosis, there are a number of conditions in which abnormal fibrinolysis is only a contributory factor. Examples are seen in pregnancy, especially during puerperium, when the thromboembolic risk is at its highest. The levels of inhibitors of fibrinolysis, both PAI-1 and PAI-2, are also at their highest. Another example was seen recently in the antiphospholipid syndrome, where antibodies against Annexin II, a receptor for tPA, were found to be higher than in healthy controls [82]. Thus, a thorough investigation into other hereditary and acquired risk factors for thrombosis is recommended.

AB  - Objective. To study the effects of a critical illness and hospitalization of a newborn on family functioning and child behavior during the subsequent 12 years. Methods. With the use of a randomized stratified cluster sampling, a follow-up of 1443 pregnant women was started at early pregnancy. These pregnancies resulted in 1294 deliveries. A total of 170 infants were admitted to neonatal units and were classified according to their medical risk, and 1112 healthy-born infants were eligible for the control group. After excluding the children with disabilities at 3 years of age, 134 remained in the risk groups and 952 children remained in the control group. The follow-up examinations were performed at the ages of 3 and 9 months and at 3 and 12 years. The main outcome measures were parents' subjective well-being and adjustment to the child, family functioning, and child's behavioral problems. Results. The families with a critically ill newborn experienced more need for support and maladaptation during the first year after delivery. They reported more child behavior problems at 3 years, but no differences were found at 12 years of age. The families with a hospitalized, low-risk infant coped as well as the controls. Conclusions. A critical illness of a newborn had long-lasting effects on the family and child behavior. The hospitalization of a newborn with a low medical risk did not have any negative consequences on family or child behavior. This is encouraging for a large group of families that experience early separation from their newborn infant as a result of hospitalization.

AB  - Objectives. To determine whether blood pressure (BP) differed between very low birth weight (VLBW; birth weight â¤1500 g) subjects and normal birth weight (NBW; birth weight >2499 g) subjects in late adolescence, and to determine whether growth restriction in utero was related to BP in VLBW survivors at this age. Methods. This was a cohort study of 210 preterm survivors with birth weights <1501 g born from January 1, 1977, to March 31, 1982, and 60 randomly selected NBW subjects from the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne. BP was measured at 18+ years of age in 156 (74%) VLBW subjects and 38 (63%) NBW subjects with both a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and an ambulatory BP monitor. Results. VLBW subjects had higher sphygmomanometer systolic and diastolic BPs than NBW subjects (mm Hg; mean difference [95% confidence interval]; systolic, 8.6 [3.4, 13.9]; diastolic, 4.3 [1.0, 7.6]). VLBW subjects also had significantly higher mean systolic ambulatory BPs (mm Hg; mean difference [95% confidence interval]) for the 24-hour period (4.7 [1.4, 8.0]), and for both the awake (5.0 [1.6, 8.5]) and asleep (3.6 [0.04, 7.1]) periods. There were no significant differences between the birth weight groups for any ambulatory diastolic BPs. Within the VLBW subjects, there was no significant relationship between birth weight standard deviation score and any measure of BP. Conclusions. BP was significantly higher in late adolescence in VLBW survivors than in NBW subjects. Growth restriction in utero was not significantly related to BP in VLBW survivors.

AB  - Snoring is common in pregnancy, and snoring pregnant women have increased rates of pre-eclampsia. Patients with pre-eclampsia show upper airway narrowing during sleep. The present study aimed to compare upper airway dimensions in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in patients with pre-eclampsia. A total of 50 women in the third trimester of pregnancy and 37 women with pre-eclampsia were recruited consecutively from the antenatal service and matched with 50 nonpregnant women. Upper airway dimensions were measured using acoustic reflection. Comparisons were made by analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Snoring was reported by 14% of nonpregnant women, 28% of pregnant women, and 75% of pre-eclamptic women (p &lt; 0.001). When seated, pregnant women had wider upper airways than non-pregnant women (p &lt; 0.02), but there was no difference when supine. Oropharyngeal junction area in the seated position was less (p &lt; 0.01) in the women with pre-eclampsia (mean Â± SD: 0.9 Â± 0.1 cm2) than either nonpregnant (1.1 Â± 0.1 cm2) or pregnant women (1.3 Â± 0.1 cm2). Supine oropharyngeal junction area was less in the women with pre-eclampsia than in the nonpregnant women (0.8 Â± 0.1 versus 1.0 Â± 0.1 cm2; p = 0.01) but similar in women with pre-eclampsia and pregnant women (0.9 Â± 0.1 cm2; p &gt; 0.3). The study showed that women with pre-eclampsia have upper airway narrowing in both upright and supine postures. These changes could contribute to the upper airway resistance episodes during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may further increase their blood pressure.

AB  - The percent of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreases dramatically between 10 and 30 days postnatally in the rat. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is known to modulate waking and REM sleep. We recorded intracellularly from 127 neurons in the PPN in 12-21-day rat brainstem slices maintained in warmed, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. We identified three types of PPN neurons based on intrinsic membrane properties, type I (LTS), type II (A) and type III (A+LTS), as previously described. The percent of type I neurons increased from 6% at 12 days to 17% by 21 days, while the percent of type III neurons decreased from 21% at 12-17 days, to 4% after 17 days. Thus, PPN neurons may differentiate into type I bursting neurons and type II slow-firing neurons across this critical stage in development. The 5-HT1 receptor agonist 5-carboxyamido-tryptamine (5-CT) was found to hyperpolarize 58% of 12-16-day PPN neurons, did not affect 25% and depolarized 17%. However, a higher percentage of 17-21-day PPN neurons were hyperpolarized (85%), and a lower percentage unaffected (10%) or depolarized (5%), suggesting that serotonergic responses switched from both excitatory and inhibitory before, to almost purely inhibitory after, 17 days. These findings indicate a reorganization of PPN intrinsic membrane properties and serotonergic responses occur across this stage, in keeping with the proposed presence of a REM sleep inhibitory process during development. We suggest that disturbances in this developmental process may lead to disorders marked by increased REM sleep drive. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Development of neurotensin (NT), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), vasopressin (AVP) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY) expressing neurons was investigated in the human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus of nine subjects ranging from 20-40 weeks of gestation using immunocytochemistry and morphometry. Results obtained showed that NT expressing neurons developed earlier than VIP, AVP and NPY expressing neurons. Consistent with results obtained from animal studies, we also found VIP expressing neurons were born earlier than AVP expressing neurons. Whether the NT expressing neurons play a role in generating circadian rhythms in the early life of humans needs to be further investigated. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The origin of sleep and circadian rhythms development is found during the fetal period. Both quiet (NREM) and active (REM) sleep are distinguishable during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Comparable to fetuses, low risk preterm infants recorded at 30-40 weeks postconceptional age, had a similar development of sleep i.e. an increase in quiet sleep and a decrease in indeterminate sleep. A further development in sleep organization characterized by increased slow wave and spindle activity during quiet sleep and coupling with circadian rhythm takes place during the first 6 months of life in both term and preterm infants. Circadian rhythm of fetal heart rate synchronized with maternal rest-activity, heart rate, cortisol, melatonin, and body temperature rhythms is present during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Although maternally influenced, circadian rhythm antenatally becomes ultradian at birth. Both preterm and term infants show a significant increase in circadian body temperature rhythm amplitude during the first 3 months of life. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thirty-eight 1st-time mothers were recruited from childbirth classes and were assessed at 4 different time periods: the last trimester of pregnancy, 2-4 weeks postpartum, 12-16 weeks postpartum, and 12-15 months postpartum. Measures included a daily sleep-wake diary and a depression scale (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, CES-D). Results reveal significant differences in week-day night sleep schedules (rise time, time awake due to disruptions, and nap time) at 2-4 weeks postpartum in comparison to other times of measurement. Total sleep time and bedtime was not significantly different between times of measurement. More depressive symptoms were reported at 2-4 weeks postpartum than at later postpartum measurements. Mothers who developed clinically elevated depressive symptoms (CES-D > or = 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum reported more total sleep time, later rise times, and more time napping at the end of pregnancy in comparison to those mothers that reported fewer depressive symptoms (CES-D < 16) at 2-4 weeks postpartum.

AB  - Investigations on using of index possibilities of L-arginin/NO system in evaluation of sanatorium-resort treatment effectiveness of pregnant with cardiovascular disorders were conducted. It was analyzed the dynamics of twenty four hour cycle rhythm of L-arginin and total nitrites and nitrates constance in saliva of 58 pregnant, 20 of which were suffering from metabolic cardiomyopathy, 23-from neurocirculatory dystonia and 15 were healthy pregnant. As the result of examination there were found out considerable changes of parameter values of biological rhythms: duration of rhythm, average twenty four hour cycle range of activity, amount of difference between max index per twenty hour cycle and average index per twenty hour cycle, period of max and min activity. Analysis of tendencies of twenty four hour cycles rhythms concerning dynamics of sanatorium-resort treatment will give possibility to define characteristic features of recovering values of this parameter.

AB  - Shift work has become a part of everyday life in industrialized nations. Not all workers can adjust to the disruption of the circadian rhythm and the solar day. A complete evaluation before the initiation of shift work can identify workers who are at high risk for the negative health effects that are related to shift work. Clinicians must identify and evaluate shift workers for maladaptation syndrome and must intervene when the signs of maladaptation are present. Clinicians must be aware of the normal circadian physiology and the consequences that occur with desynchronization. Patients with preexisting medical problems may experience an exacerbation of their disease when shift work is instituted. Ethnicity also seems to have a significant role in the risk for an abnormal physiologic response to shift work. Clinicians regularly should assess for the medical, social, and psychologic consequences of shift work as part of routine history and physical examination. They should help to structure a work environment that is shift worker ftiendly. Ongoing research and refinement of working hours, the workforce, and the work environment must continue to minimize the negative health consequences of shift work and circadian-solar disruption.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to carry out a metasynthesis of the scientific literature on the Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH), in order to highlight its importance during human pregnancy. CRH, derived from the placenta, has been defined as "a placental clock" controlling the length of pregnancy, the timing of labour and delivery. Placental CRH plasmatic concentrations rise dramatically in the last trimester of pregnancy, reaching peak values just before the onset of labour. In human beings, like in other primates, there is a functional connection between the peculiar presence of placental CRH and the foetal zone of the foetal adrenal glands. The foetal zone is the major source of the precursor (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) of the estrogens produced by the placenta. In primates, placental CRH stimulates the release of ACTH and the adrenal function, satisfying the necessity of dehydroepiandrosterone before delivery. Placental CRH also stimulates the production of cortisol and this positive feedforward circuit represents the engine of the biological clock guiding the foetal development and the growth of labour factors such as oxytocin receptors, gap junctions and prostaglandins.

AB  - Studies performed over the past 20 years have revealed that mother rodents can provide photoperiod information to their developing fetuses. In adult mammals, the pattern of pineal melatonin secretion changes in relation to changes in day length, and the melatonin pattern is a key part of the photoperiodic mechanism. Melatonin crosses the placenta, and fetal rodents can respond to the maternal melatonin rhythm. Thus, the mother's melatonin rhythm provides day-length information to the fetus, and this information is used, along with photoperiod information that is obtained after birth, to influence juvenile development. The transfer of photoperiod information from mother to fetus may be part of an adaptive system. When young are born early in the spring or summer breeding season, the increase in day length between the times of fetal and postnatal life results in rapid reproductive maturation, allowing these early-born animals to reproduce later during the same breeding season. In contrast, for young born late in the breeding season, the decrease in photoperiod between fetal and postnatal life results in delayed maturation of the gonads, and reproduction is delayed until the beginning of the next year's breeding season.

AB  - Background: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-induced multiorganic disease. The incidence is 5-7% in all pregnant women. To assess the value of circadian blood pressure rhythm in preeclamptic women, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring might be useful. The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive value of circadian blood pressure rhythm for the maternal and obstetrical outcome in patients with mild preeclampsia. Patients and Methods: Sixty-six patients with mild preeclampsia underwent 24-hour blood pressure monitoring between 29 and 39 weeks gestation. Twenty-eight patients with normal circadian blood pressure rhythm were compared with thirty-eight patients with suspended circadian blood rhythm. Results: There was no difference in age, body mass index, gravidity, parity, miscarriage, or fetal outcome between the two groups. The rate of secondary caesarean section was 39.5% in the suspended circadian blood pressure group and 21.4% in the normal circadian blood pressure group, respectively (P = 0.03). Conclusions: In patients with mild preeclampsia, the circadian blood pressure rhythm appears to be unsuitable as a screening test. Further research is required for more etiological and pathophysiological insights into the development of clinically useful tools with predictive value.

AB  - AIMS: The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) was used to examine whether shift work is associated with reduced fecundity as estimated by time to pregnancy (TTP). METHODS: From 1 March 1998 to 1 May 2000, 39 913 pregnant women were enrolled in the DNBC. Data on job characteristics and TTP (0-2, 3-5, 6-12, and >12 months) were used for 17 531 daytime workers and 3907 shift workers who had planned the pregnancy. Fecundity odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals using the discrete time survival analysis techniques performed by logistic regression. An OR above 1 expresses a shorter TTP and then a higher fecundity. Potential confounders, such as age at conception, gravidity, prepregnant body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption, as well as occupational characteristics, were also included in the model. RESULTS: Fixed evening workers and fixed night workers had a longer TTP. Compared with daytime workers, the adjusted ORs were 0.80 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.92) for fixed evening workers, 0.80 (95% CI 0.63 to 1.00) for fixed night workers, 0.99 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.07) for rotating shift (without night) workers, and 1.05 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.14) for rotating shift (with night) workers. When analysis was restricted to nulliparous women, the estimates remained unchanged. The proportions of unplanned pregnancies and contraceptive failures were higher among fixed evening and fixed night workers. CONCLUSIONS: There was no unequivocal evidence of a causal association between shift work and subfecundity. The slightly reduced fecundity among fixed evening workers and fixed night workers may be mediated by pregnancy planning bias or differential options for sexual contacts.

AB  - Objective: To examine circadian variation in deaths among infants â¤32 weeks' gestation admitted to Canadian neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Study Design: We examined all infants (n = 5192) between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation with complete data, who were admitted to 17 tertiary Canadian Neonatal Network NICUs from January 1996 to October 1997. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare risk-adjusted early neonatal mortality rates (death within 7 days of NICU admission) of infants admitted during daytime (8 AM to 5 PM) with infants admitted at night. Results: Sixty percent (n = 3131) of infants were admitted to the NICU at night, Patient risk factors significantly (P < .05) predictive of early neonatal death from multivariable logistic regression were male sex, outborn status, APGAR score <7 at 5 minutes, presence of congenital anomalies, low gestational age, arid high admission Score for neonatal acute physiology, version II (SNAP-II). For inborn infants, in-house presence of a neonatal fellow or attending neonatologist at night (odds ratio, 0.6) and NICU admission at night (odds ratio, 1.6) were also predictive. Conclusions: Risk-adjusted early neonatal mortality odds was 60% higher among inborn infants â¤32 weeks' gestation admitted to NICUs at night compared with during daytime, equivalent to 29 excess deaths per 1000 infants.

AB  - Large variations exist in thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormones in serum. The components of variation include preanalytical, analytical, and biologic variation. This is divided into between- and within-individual variation. The latter consists of circadian and seasonal differences although there are indicators of a genetically determined starting point. The ratio of within- to between-individual variation describes the reliability of population-based reference ranges. This ratio is low for serum TSH, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) indicating that laboratory reference ranges are relatively insensitive to aberrations from normality in the individual. Solutions are considered but reducing the analytical variation below the calculated analytical goals of 7%, 5% and 12% for serum T 3, T4, and TSH does not improve diagnostic performance. Neither does determination of the individual set-point and reference range. In practice this means that population-based reference ranges are necessary but that it is important to recognize their limitations for use in individuals. Serum TSH responds with amplification to minor alterations in T4 and T3. A consistently abnormal TSH probably indicates that T 4 and T3 are not normal for the individual even when inside the laboratory reference range. This underlines the importance of TSH in diagnosis and monitoring of thyroid dysfunctions. Also, it implies that subclinical thyroid disease may be defined in purely biochemical terms. Under critical circumstances such as pregnancy where normal thyroid function is of importance for fetal brain development, subclinical thyroid disease should be treated. Even TSH within the reference range may be associated with slightly abnormal thyroid function of the individual. The clinical importance of such small abnormalities in thyroid function in small children and pregnant women for brain development remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate and quantify the effect of glucocorticosteroid administration on fetal movements and biophysical profile scores. Methods: Eighteen women at 32-34 weeks' gestation were enrolled. Inclusion criterion was an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy not considered to be at high risk. Patients participated for 3 consecutive days. On day 1, the patients underwent a baseline biophysical profile including a non-stress test followed by a 12-mg betamethasone intramuscular injection. On day 2, the patients received a non-stress test and a second dose of betamethasone. On day 3, a biophysical profile with non-stress test was performed. Maternal counts of fetal kicks were also recorded before, during and after the study period. Each test was conducted at approximately the same time of day to control for diurnal variation. Comparison was made between pre-betamethasone biophysical profile scores and fetal movement and post-betamethasone biophysical profile scores and fetal movement. Results: Biophysical profile scores were reduced in 28% of the study population after betamethasone administration (p < 0.05). Amniotic fluid index on day 3 was decreased from baseline in 72% of patients after betamethasone administration (p < 0.05). Forty-four per cent of patients reported a decrease in fetal movement. Of these patients, 87% had a decreased amniotic fluid index when compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Fetal movements and breathing motion were decreased after glucocorticosteroid administration, as evidenced by biophysical profile scores and kick counts. The decrease in the amniotic fluid index observed after glucocorticosteroid administration may have been the result of decreased fetal breathing and, therefore, decreased efflux of alveolar fluid into the amniotic sac.

AB  - Follistatin-related gene (FLRG) was first identified as a target of a chromosomal translocation in a human B-cell leukemia. Because FLRG protein binds to activins and bone morphogenetic proteins, FLRG is postulated to be a regulator of these growth factors. However, physiological aspects of FLRG are unclear. To elucidate the physiology of FLRG, we examined expression of FLRG in reproductive tissues of the rat. FLRG mRNA was abundantly expressed in the placenta. FLRG mRNA was also expressed in the ovary, uterus, testis, lung, adrenal gland, pituitary, kidney, small intestine, and heart. During the second half of pregnancy, expression of FLRG in the placenta continuously increased, whereas follistatin mRNA levels decreased from Day 12 to Day 14 and remained low thereafter. FLRG was also expressed in decidua. Levels of decidual FLRG mRNA remained low from Day 12 to Day 16 and then noticeably increased until Day 20. In contrast, follistatin mRNA was highly expressed in the decidua on Day 12, continuously decreased until Day 16, and then remained at relatively low levels thereafter. During the rat estrous cycle, levels of ovarian FLRG mRNA fluctuated diurnally, with highest levels during daytime, and did not change relative to the day of the estrous cycle. The present results suggest that FLRG may play a role in the regulation of reproductive events.

AB  - Several dopamine-related neurochemical and behavioral responses are influenced by the time of day. The light-dark shift is a major zeitgeber for various functionally important hypothalamic monoaminergic systems. However, these influences are modulated by reproductive state and by reproductive experience (RE) in females. Early pregnancy in rodents generates diurnal and nocturnal prolactin surges that are reduced in intensity in a second pregnancy. Dopamine (DA) is a major inhibitory factor of prolactin synthesis and secretion. Other neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5HT) and norepinephrine (NE) can modulate prolactin secretion as well. Previous works have demonstrated that RE induces changes in central concentrations of both dopamine and serotonin. In addition, RE modulates the responses of both dopaminergic and serotoninergic nerve terminals. The present investigation was designed to examine the possible effects of RE on hypothalamic concentrations of DA, NE, 5HT and their major metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxy mandelic acid (VMA) and 5-hydroxyindole 3-acetic acid (5HIAA), respectively. These parameters were measured in pregnant rats during the light-dark shift and the prolactin surges. Primi- and multigravid rats were sacrificed on the 7th-8th day of pregnancy between 1700 and 1900 h (light-dark shift and diurnal prolactin surge) or 0200 and 0400 h (nocturnal prolactin surge), and hypothalamic concentrations of DA, NE and 5HT and their metabolites were measured by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ED). Trunk blood was collected and serum prolactin measured by radioimmunoassay. The prolactin surge was confirmed and multigravid rats showed significantly lower serum prolactin levels as compared to primigravid rats between 0200 and 0400 h. During the light-dark shift DA and NE concentrations increased while DOPAC/DA, HVA/DA and 5HIAA/5HT ratios decreased in multigravid rats compared to primigravid rats. Except for 5HIAA/5HT, these differences were not observed during the prolactin nocturnal surge. These results suggest that a previous reproductive experience induces central functional changes during pregnancy which are expressed differently according to the time of day.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify: 1) what kinds of sleep problems that pregnant women experience in Japan; and 2) the relationships between sleep problems and month of pregnancy, sleep problems and the number of pregnancies, and sleeping hours, by means of a questionnaire given to pregnant women in Japan. Conditions to assure good quality sleep were studied. METHODS: Of 500 obstetric facilities which were randomly selected from areas surveyed by the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 260 finally agreed to participate in this study. Women who had their pregnancy confirmed and were on a revisit to the 260 obstetric facilities were enrolled. These pregnant women completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires during the waiting time for treatment and submitted them to the obstetric facilities in sealed envelopes. The questionnaire covered personal attributes such as age and highest level of education, pregnancy status, working status, and patterns of smoking and alcohol drinking. Sleep-related items such as 1) subjective sleep quality, 2) difficulty in getting to sleep, 3) frequent awakenings, 4) waking up too early, 5) sleeping hours and 6) daytime drowsiness were also included. RESULTS: The month of pregnancy was significantly related to four sleep-related items, including difficulty in getting to sleep and waking up too early. With respect to the relationship between the number of pregnancies and sleep problems, significance was found for five sleep-related items, including subjective sleep quality and waking up too early. Poor subjective sleep quality was significantly related to sleeping less than seven hours and whether or not pregnant women had a regular job. It was also suggested that the greater the number of pregnancies, the shorter the sleeping hours. When responses to each sleep-related item were compared between pregnant women and the general population, the former were more likely to have sleep problems. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that as well as the number of pregnancies and month of pregnancy with sleeping hours may be factor intimately related to sleep problems during pregnancy. A good quality sleep during pregnancy is vital for normal maternal health and fetal growth and sufficient sleeping hours are therefore needed. Attention should therefore be paid to the finding that pregnant women were more likely to have sleep problems than the general population.

AB  - Programmed cell death or apoptosis is an essential component of human ovarian function and development. During early fetal life approximately 7 Ã 106 oocytes are formed in the human ovary. However, the number of oocytes is dramatically reduced already before birth through apoptotic cell death. In reproductive life, a number of primordial follicles start growing during each menstrual cycle. Usually only one will ovulate and the fate of the rest of the follicles is atresia through the mechanism of apoptosis. Ultimately, only around 400 follicles will ovulate during a woman's reproductive life. After ovulation, the dominant follicle forms the corpus luteum, a novel endocrine gland that is responsible for the production of progesterone and maintenance of endometrium during early pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, corpus luteum action must cease so that new follicles can resume growing during the next menstrual cycle. Apoptosis is also responsible for corpus luteum regression in the human ovary. In recent years, new knowledge of the role and regulation of apoptosis in the ovary has been acquired through the use of knockout and transgenic animals. Apoptosis seems to be the mechanism that makes the female biological clock tick. The following review will discuss the role of apoptosis and its regulation of human ovarian function.

AB  - The principal modulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP). Corticotropin-releasing hormone is not exclusively produced in the hypothalamus. Its presence has been demonstrated at peripheral inflammatory sites. Ovulation and luteolysis bear characteristics of an aseptic inflammation. CRH was found in the theca and stromal cells as well as in cells of the corpora lutea of human and rat ovaries. The cytoplasm of the glandular epithelial cells of the endometrium has been shown to contain CRH and the myometrium contains specific CRH receptors. It has been suggested that CRH of fetal and maternal origin regulates FasL production, thus affecting the invasion (implantation) process through a local auto-paracrine regulatory loop involving the cytotrophoblast cells. Thus, the latter may regulate their own apoptosis. During pregnancy, the plasma level of circulating maternal immunoreactive CRH increases exponentially from the first trimester of gestation due to the CRH production in the placenta, decidua, and fetal membranes. The presence in plasma and amniotic fluid of a CRH-binding protein (CRHbp) that reduces the bioactivity of circulating CRH by binding is unique to humans. Maternal pituitary ACTH secretion and plasma ACTH levels rise during pregnancy - though remaining within normal limits - paralleling the rise of plasma cortisol levels. The maternal adrenal glands during pregnancy gradually become hypertrophic. Pregnancy is a transient, but physiologic, period of hypercortisolism. The diurnal variation of plasma cortisol levels is maintained in pregnancy, probably due to the secretion of AVP from the parvicellular paraventricular nuclei. CRH is detected in the fetal hypothalamus as early as the 12th week of gestation. CRH levels in fetal plasma are 50% less than in maternal plasma. The circulating fetal CRH is almost exclusively of placental origin. The placenta secretes CRH at a slower rate in the fetal compartment AVP is detected in some neurons of the fetal hypothalamus together with CRH. AVP is usually detectable in the human fetal neurohypophysis at 11 to 12 weeks gestation and increases over 1000-fold over the next 12 to 16 weeks. The role of fetal AVP is unclear. Labor appears to be a stimulus for AVP release by the fetus. The processing of POMC differs hi the anterior and intermediate lobes of the fetal pituitary gland. Corticotropin (ACTH) is detectable by radioimmunoassay in fetal plasma at 12 weeks gestation. Concentrations are higher before 34 weeks gestation, with a significant fall in late gestation. The human fetal adrenal is enormous relative to that of the adult organ. Adrenal steroid synthesis is increased in the fetus. The major steroid produced by the fetal adrenal zone is sulfoconjugated dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS). The majority of cortisol present in the fetal circulation appears to be of maternal origin, at least in the nonhuman primate. The fetal adrenal uses the large amounts of progesterone supplied by the placenta to make cortisol. Another source of cortisol for the fetus is the amniotic fluid where cortisol converted from cortisone by the choriodecidua, is found. In humans, maternal plasma CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels increase during normal labor and drop at about four days postpartum, however, maternal ACTH and cortisol levels at this stage are not correlated. In sheep, placental CRH stimulates the fetal production of ACTH, which in turn leads to a surge of fetal cortisol secretion that precipitates parturition. The 10-day-long intravenous administration of antalannin, a CRH receptor antagonist, significantly prolonged gestation compared to the control group of animals. Thus, CRH receptor antagonism in the fetus can also delay parturition. The HPA axis during the postpartum period gradually recovers from its activated state during pregnancy. The adrenals are mildly suppressed in a way analogous to postcure Cushing's syndrome. Provocation testing has shown that hypothalamic CRH secretion is transiently suppressed at three and six weeks postpartum, normalizing at 12 weeks.

AB  - Purpose of review: Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy. The spectrum of association between pregnancy and sleep disturbances ranges from an increased incidence of insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, and parasomnias (especially restless legs syndrome) to snoring and excessive sleepiness. These disturbances occur as a result of physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes associated with pregnancy. Although the timing and occurrence of different sleep disorders varies, they are most prevalent during the third trimester. Despite reports of the various sleep problems, the exact nature and incidence of sleep disorders in pregnancy is not known. Given that limitation, we are presenting an up-to-date review of the current understanding of the relation between sleep and pregnancy. Recent findings: Studies suggest that pregnancy affects sleep in multiple ways. There are hormonal changes, physiologic changes, physical factors, and behavioral changes in a pregnant woman-all of which may affect her sleep. They may affect the duration and quality of sleep and lead to a variety of sleep disorders. Pregnancy may also affect an existing sleep disorder. Particular attention may be given to obese pregnant women who would gain more weight during pregnancy or those who develop hypertensive conditions (eg, preeclampsia). Snoring may be more common in women with preeclampsia and the pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep may be enhanced in preeclamptic women when compared with those with obstructive sleep apnea alone. Several investigators have suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be common in pregnant women despite the presence of intrinsic mechanisms that seem to be geared towards preventing sleep apnea. However, the exact incidence and prevalence of sleep apnea in pregnant women is uncertain. In addition, it is unclear if criteria that are used to define sleep apnea in the general population should be applied to pregnant women. Further investigations are needed to determine if lower thresholds for management of OSA should be used in pregnant women to prevent harm to the fetus. Summary: In conclusion, sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy though the full extent of this relation remains undefined. Large, multi-center, prospective studies are needed for better understanding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand prevalence of sleep problems and presence of improper sleep habit of children aged one to 23 months in Shanghai, and to identify their related factors. METHODS: Totally, 1 252 normal children, without severe illness and abnormal delivery history, aged one to 23 months were randomly selected from five districts of Shanghai. Under strict quality control system, their parents were interviewed with questionnaire to look into their familial and social environment, as well as sleep-related factors. RESULTS: Fully-completed information was obtained in 1 129 of 1 252 children, with a response rate of 90.18%. Prevalence of sleep problems in children was 65.90% in Shanghai, remarkably higher than in the other areas. Prevalence of nightmare, level of fright at night, snore and sleep apnea in boys were significantly higher than those in girls. Prevalence of improper sleep habit in children was also higher, including sleeping with their parents, parental presence at sleep onset and irregular sleep time. Main risk factors related to children's sleep problems were maternal anxiety, children's irregular sleep time, parental presence at sleep onset, difficulty-type temperament and maternal poor sleep during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: In Shanghai, prevalence of sleep problems in children aged one to 23 months was relatively higher and main risk factors for them were social, cultural and familial environment, especially negligence of cultivating proper sleep habit and parental improper response to children's poor sleep behavior.

AB  - Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone (3Î±-hydroxy-5Î±-pregnan-20-one) influence central nervous system (CNS) excitability by increasing GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) inhibitory activity. Allopregnanolone concentrations are higher in the fetal compared to the adult ovine brain, suggesting that this neurosteroid may have a role in regulating fetal CNS activity during gestation. We examined the localisation of allopregnanolone-sensitive GABAA receptors in the fetal brain to determine if their sensitivity to allopregnanolone changed during late gestation. The binding of [35S] tert-butylbicyclophosothionate (TBPS) was used to identify the GABA-chloride ion receptor complex in fetal sheep brains at 90-95, 115-120 and 140-145 days gestational age (GA; term â¼147 days), by autoradiography. Allopregnanolone (200 nM) reduced [35S]TBPS binding by 70-100% throughout the brain at all fetal ages examined. The levels of [35S]TBPS binding increased with advancing gestation in all regions examined except some areas of the medulla. Functionally related nuclei and brain areas associated with regulating somato/viscerosensory functions displayed high levels of [35S]TBPS binding from mid-gestation. These results indicate that allopregnanolone may interact with GABAA receptors to inhibit fetal CNS activity from mid-gestation. This inhibition may contribute to maintaining the sleep-like behaviour and low incidence of arousal-type activity typical of fetal life, and may be neuroprotective by limiting excitatory neurotransmission.

AB  - Studies of sleep across the life cycle in women have utilized both survey and polysomnographic techniques, but have tended to be of small sample size with diverse methodology. As a result, definitive conclusions about the impact of the menstrual cycle and use of oral contraceptives on sleep parameters cannot yet be made. Sleep disruption during pregnancy and postpartum is nearly universal, but effective and practical countermeasures are still needed. Longitudinal studies of sleep in the postpartum period are also lacking. Menopause is associated with insomnia due to several factors including hot flashes, mood disorders and increased sleep-disordered breathing. The use of hormone replacement therapy to treat sleep and other variables is an active area of investigation. In summary, much research is required to fully elucidate the impact of the life cycle on sleep parameters in women. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a support binder for low back pain in pregnancy. DESIGN: Pilot study, using a prospective, two-group design with repeated measures. SETTING: Ambulatory maternity clinic in a tertiary care teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Women of at least 20 weeks gestation with low back pain, but no preexisting back or disc disease. Thirty women assigned to the intervention group and 10 to a comparison group. INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a pain assessment at pretest. Intervention participants received a maternity support binder to wear while awake for 2 weeks. At an appointment 2 weeks later, a posttest questionnaire and a taped interview were administered. The comparison group participants received the support binder after the second appointment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Back pain intensity, duration, and effect on daily activities were assessed using a pain in pregnancy questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group had significant reduction in mean pain scores and effect of pain on daily activities, including family, house and yard, recreational, exercise, and sleep. Interaction of group by time was significant for change in pain and effect on family, house and yard, and exercise activities. CONCLUSION: The use of a support binder for pregnancy-related low back pain is a promising intervention and was well-accepted by the participants.

AB  - This study was part of a large departmental performance improvement initiative to implement and evaluate developmental and family-centered care as "best practice" in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The goal was to evaluate the safety, effect on infant clinical and developmental outcomes, and maternal satisfaction of co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants compared to traditionally bedded infants/mothers. A secondary purpose was to evaluate co-bedding and American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended "back to sleep" behaviors in the same infants/mothers after discharge. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive design was used. Chart reviews and mailed written surveys were used to collect study data. Findings showed no significant differences in demographic variables or clinical and developmental outcomes between the total traditionally bedded and co-bedded groups. All mothers reported positive experiences with the NICU. Co-bedding may promote maternal bonding and has no negative clinical or developmental outcomes. Once policies and education are in place, parents should be offered the option to co-bed multiple-gestation infants in the NICU. There is a performance improvement opportunity regarding the education provided to parents of multiple-gestation infants before discharge on the "back to sleep" recommendations.

AB  - Headache is a frequent symptom in women of childbearing age and during pregnancy. Benign and pathologic headaches may change in response to changes in estrogen after conception. Expected patterns of change are described for headaches that occur commonly during pregnancy. In addition, although treatment options are limited during pregnancy, a variety of effective medication and nonmedication treatments are available and should be offered to women with benign headaches that persist into the second trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the physiological stability and behavioral effects of co-bedding with those of single-bedding premature multiple-gestation infants in incubators as well as the psychological effects on their parents. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, repeated measure. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 16 infants and 8 parents in the co-bedded group, and 21 infants and 11 parents in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: Infants in the study group were co-bedded in incubators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline and posttesting for parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction measures; infant sleep-wake synchronicity; physiological measures; and stress cue measures during baseline and activity. MAIN RESULTS: Repeated measures 5 (time) x 2 (group) analysis of variance found significant differences in infant daily weight, feeding amount, and high-activity heart rate. There was no difference in parental state anxiety, maternal attachment, and parental satisfaction scores by group, except for higher baseline parental satisfaction scores in the co-bedded group. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the safety of co-bedding multiple-gestation infants in incubators but did not find any significant clinical improvement in infant or parental outcomes with co-bedding. Neonatal intensive-care unit providers should educate staff and parents about the potential benefits of co-bedding and consider developing policies and procedures for co-bedding in both incubators and cribs. Co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants may be provided as an adjunctive developmental care strategy if parents desire this intervention.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about sex differences in human fetal heart and behaviour. Patients and methods: One hundred twenty-three nulliparous healthy women carrying a male (n=56) or female (n=67) fetus participated in this study. All pregnancies remained uncomplicated and delivery was uneventful. Ultrasound observation of fetal general movements (GM) was performed for 1 h at 15-17 (T1) and 27-28 (T2) weeks of gestation and for 2 h at 37-39 weeks (T3). Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring occurred simultaneously with fetal ultrasound observations at T2 and T3. The incidence of GM (percentage of time), FHR and its variability, and the incidences of fetal heart rate patterns (HRP) A-D and behavioural states 1F-4F were compared between boys and girls. Results: There were no significant differences between males and females in the distribution of HRP A-D, overall behavioural state distribution, and basal FHR, FHR variability or the presence of GM during quiet and active sleep (or during HRP A and HRP B, respectively). A TimeÃSex interaction effect for GM assessed for total record length and a higher %GM in male fetuses at term age were the only significant findings. However, these observations lost statistical significance after adjustment for the effects of fetal wakefulness, which occurred to a higher extent in male than in female fetuses. Conclusion: Our data do not provide evidence for a difference in fetal functional development or maturation between the two sexes. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - And so, if it is there that he is lying, quiet sleeps Count Buttler of PÃ¡rdÃ¡ny. It is a good place to sleep, that peaceful vault at DobÃ³ruszka. There is a stillness all around. Even in the forests there is no more singing; for the forests are gone. Only from the nearby swamps there is sometimes heard the croaking of the frogs: âClerics are crooked! Clerics are crooked!â So ends KÃ¡lmÃ¡n MikszÃ¡th's Strange Marriage, which appeared in 1900. In the novel, the unscrupulous Baron DÅry, in order to avoid a scandal, forces the young Count Buttler to marry his pregnant daughter. The young woman is carrying the child of the local priest, who, to make matters worse, also turns out to be an ardent Slovak patriot. Though MikszÃ¡th set the story in the early nineteenth century, its anticlericalism is more a reflection of the bitter churchâstate struggles that dominated Hungarian political life in the 1890s. Tensions had long existed between the Catholic church and the state, and they intensified following the Ausgleich of 1867 and the subsequent rise to power of the Liberal Party, which governed Hungary uninterruptedly from 1875 to 1905. The spark came in 1890, when the minister of religion and public education, Count Albin CsÃ¡ky, issued an ordinance calling for administrative enforcement of existing laws concerning the children of mixed marriages, thereby threatening non-compliant Catholic priests with fines and prison sentences.

AB  - Aims: A failure of the arousal mechanism is a key feature in the apnoea theory for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In infants studied at an age when the incidence of SIDS is highest, we evaluated whether in utero smoke exposed infants have altered arousal response to standardised auditory stimuli, and/or sleep pattern, as recorded on overnight complex sleep polysomnography. Methods: A standardised sequence of audiology stimuli was applied binaurally to 20 in utero smoke and non-smoke exposed infants aged 8-12 weeks during a rapid eye movement (REM) and NREM epoch, in a controlled (temperature, position, pacifier use, noise) sleep environment. Infants were monitored for 10-12 hours using complex sleep polysomnography. Results: Five infants exposed to in utero tobacco smoke did not have behavioural arousal response, whereas all non-smoke exposed infants aroused during NREM (p = 0.016). There was, however, no difference in REM sleep, and the groups did not differ in routine overnight complex sleep polysomnography parameters. Conclusion: At the age when the incidence of SIDS is at its peak, infants of smoking mothers are less rousable than those of non-smoking mothers in NREM sleep; this may partly explain why such infants are more at risk of SIDS.

AB  - Many mental and behavioural disorders during childhood and adolescence are associated with sleep difficulties. A polysomnography is seldom needed but indicated in following cases: In a general view when there is suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), excessive daytime sleepiness or suspected nocturnal seizures. Specific mental disorders with indication of polysomnography are: Diagnostic unclear and dangerous parasomnias, emotional disorders in case of differing sleep perception, Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette Syndrome with suspected (additional) OSAS, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) or Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD). Further indications are -therapy-resistant insomnia and sleep-wake-rhythm-disorders.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that autonomic dysfunction may be involved in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The major risk factors for SIDS are the prone sleeping position and maternal smoking. Our aim was to examine the effects of sleeping position and maternal smoking on the postnatal maturation of autonomic function by examining heart rate responses following arousal in healthy term infants. Twenty-four infants (11 born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and 13 to mother who did not smoke) were studied using daytime polysomnography and multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cm H2O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). We demonstrated no difference between smoking and non-smoking groups of infants in any of our measurements, and thus combined data from the groups. Baseline (BHR) was elevated in the prone compared to the supine position in quiet sleep (QS) at 2-3 weeks (p&lt;0.001) and 5-6 months (p&lt;0.001), and in active sleep (AS) at 2-3 and 5-6 months (p&lt;0.05). BHR was significantly elevated in AS compared to QS in the supine position at all ages (p&lt;0.01) and in the prone position at 2-3 (p&lt;0.001) and 5-6 months (p&lt;0.05). Increases in heart rate (ÎHR%) following arousal were significantly greater in the supine compared to the prone position in QS at 2-3 weeks (p&lt;0.05) and in AS at both 2-3 (p&lt;0.01) and 5-6 months (p&lt;0.05). ÎHR% was significantly greater in AS compared to QS in both supine (p&lt;0.05) and prone (p&lt;0.001) positions at 2-3 weeks and in the supine position at 2-3 months (p&lt;0.001). We conclude that sleep state, sleep position and postnatal age affect the cardiac responses following arousal from sleep in healthy term infants. Impairment of heart rate control in the prone position may be important in understanding the increased risk for SIDS in this position. Â© 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine health problems of citizens of the city of Obihiro with reference to the Healthy Japan 21 plan. METHOD: The subjects were a total of 2,000 men and women (6-74 years old) who were selected at random from the resident ledger of Obihiro. The questionnaire included the 6 fields (nutrient intake/dietary habits, physical activity/exercise, rest/mental health, tobacco, alcohol, dental health) of Healthy Japan 21. The path-analysis model was used by sex, in order to examine the relationship between lifestyle factors (dietary habits, restful sleep, stress, smoking habits, alcohol intake) and subjective health. RESULTS: A total of 979 subjects (49.0%) responded. The items that showed a higher proportion than for all Japan were as follows: the proportions of persons who felt stress, required a drug or alcohol to sleep, drank heavily, and were female smokers. In questions about the harm caused to health by smoking, the following items showed lower awareness than deserved: bronchitis, gastric ulcer, problems with regard to pregnancy, and periodontitis. The following characteristics were found in the path-analysis: 1) If sleep rest is sufficient, subjective health is unaffected by stress in men and women; 2) Smoking affects dietary habits in men and women, especially in the latter; 3) Heavy smoking affects subjective health in men and women independent of whether dietary habits are good; 4) There is a positive relation between drinking and subjective health in women. CONCLUSION: This study showed that stress and smoking are problems for the health of citizens of the city of Obihiro, and suggested that the best measure to counter stress is sufficient sleep, while to counter smoking spread of knowledge about the harm to health caused by smoking is best.

AB  - The published evidence on the risk of sudden unexpected death in infants after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is reviewed, together with the relevance of the various identified potentially modifiable post-natal risk factors, particularly sleeping position. Infants of low birthweight, short gestation, and those with adverse perinatal histories are at substantially increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), but the potential benefits from following the measures designed to reduce the risk of SIDS are proportionally greater than for term infants. The use of home apnoea monitors has not been shown to be of value in preventing SIDS, but the importance of maintaining adequate oxygenation in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia is emphasised. Evidence based recommendations for care of infants after discharge from the NICU with a view to reducing the risk of SIDS are presented, and do not differ significantly from those for low-risk infants.

AB  - Substance use disorders are common problems that all primary care physicians will encounter. These disorders have a significant impact on the health of all affected women throughout their lifespan. It is important to know the effects of drug use on women, so primary care residents need to be prepared to discuss substance use disorders with their patients. Residents also need to know that brief interventions can reduce risky behaviors even if they do not result in abstinence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct, in a randomized placebo-controlled manner, social behavior testing on mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam. STUDY DESIGN: A previously described, clinically relevant dose of 0.32 mg/kg of alprazolam (n = 8 mice) or a placebo (n = 9 mice) was given to gravid C57BL/6 mice by gavage on gestational day 18. Social play, sleep/ wake patterns, and male aggression of the exposed offspring were assessed during prejuvenile, juvenile, and adult periods. RESULTS: Alprazolam did not produce treatment differences in pregnancy outcomes or in dam-pup interactions. Compared with the placebo group, alprazolam-exposed offspring demonstrated less desire to escape (P<.01), more desire to remain alone (P<.02), and shorter periods of being awake (P<.03) on PND 17. Alprazolam-exposed male offspring exhibited more aggression on food restriction (P<.01) and on cage changing (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Mice offspring that were exposed prenatally to alprazolam demonstrated more individual rather than group activities, avoidance of open areas, and aggression in males. Correlation of these findings in humans is encouraged.

AB  - Adipose tissue is essential for the normal development of female reproductive function, however, obesity causes menstrual disturbances and subfertility. The severity of obesity and the distribution of fat tissue are important factors that influence the female reproductive system. Obesity results from combined genetic and environmental factors and is one of the most frequent diseases and is encountered all over the world. A body mass index (BMI) that is either high or low is associated with reduced probability of achieving pregnancy in women. Body mass affects reproduction by causing menstrual disturbance and anovulation. During the last decades the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms of this relationship were gradually elucidated. The obesity influences the reproductive cycle by impaired estrogen metabolism, changes in the concentration of sex hormone binding (SHBG) globulin, hyperinsulinaemia, and probably also leptin levels. The role of leptin still remains unclear in human reproduction, though there is growing evidence that it seems to play an important role. This increased BMI is also associated with the risk of several diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular diseases, sleep apnoea syndrome, breast cancer, cancer of the uterus and besides impairment of reproductive functions.

AB  - To examine the baroreceptor reflex function, a beat-to-beat analysis between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and R-R interval fluctuations was studied in 10 stable appropriate-for-gestational age preterm infants (range, 27.2-33.7 wk) in the first postnatal week during quiet sleep. Spectral power analysis, using fast Fourier transform, and transfer functions (gain and phase difference) between SBP and R-R fluctuations were estimated in a low-frequency band (LF, 0.03-0.2 Hz) and high-frequency band (HF defined as the frequency band between the 10th and 90th centiles of the individual respiratory frequency). The LF/HF ratio reflects the sympathovagal balance. The mean frequency (Â±SD) of LF peaks was centered at 0.07 Â± 0.02 Hz. The mean frequency (Â±SD) of the individual HF band was 0.82 Â± 0.21 Hz. The LF/HF ratio in the R-R interval series [median, 29; interquartile range (IQR), 16-40] was higher than in the SBP series (median, 8; IQR, 4-14). The gain between R-R interval and SBP fluctuations (median, 4.2 ms/mm Hg; IQR, 2.4-5.0) in the LF band was higher than in the HF band (median, 1.7 ms/mm Hg; IQR, 1.4-3.0). SBP fluctuations lead R-R interval fluctuations in the LF band with a median phase difference of +96Â° (IQR, 67-132). At LF the fluctuations in SBP precede changes in R-R interval with a time delay of 3.8 s. These observations indicate a dominant role of the sympathetic system in stable preterm infants in comparison with published adult values. Cross-spectral analysis allows a test for tracking the development of the sympathetic system in neonates.

AB  - Behavioral/sleep state activity may impact on synthetic processes within the brain, thus accounting for the developmental change in such activity and suggesting a role in the brain's growth and development. We have therefore determined the cerebral uptake of leucine and [14C] leucine during continuous tracer infusion as measures of leucine metabolism in relation to behavioral state activity, as well as the regional flux of leucine into brain tissue in the ovine fetus near term. The cerebral fractional protein synthetic rate and the absolute protein synthetic rate averaged â¼20%/day and â¼1 g/day, respectively, as measured for the whole brain, which is considerably higher than anticipated protein accretion and indicates a high rate of protein turnover with protein synthesis closely linked to protein degradation. Measures of protein synthesis were significantly higher in the pituitary gland, which may be attributed to the active synthesis and export of peptide hormones from this region. Cerebral leucine and [14C] leucine uptakes averaged â¼630 and â¼1,000 nmolÂ·100 g-1Â·min-1, with the latter higher than leucine unidirectional flux and thus supporting a degree of leucine oxidation by the brain. Cerebral leucine metabolism as studied was affected by behavioral state activity, with uptake measurements for both leucine and [14C]leucine significantly increased during the high-voltage electrocortical/non-rapid eye movement state by 1.7-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively, indicating that protein synthesis and degradation must also be increased at this time, and supporting a role for behavioral state activity in the brain's growth and development.

AB  - The rate of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among American Indian infants in the Northern Plains is almost 6 times higher than in U.S. white infants. In a study of infant mortality among Northern Plains Indians, we tested the hypothesis that receptor binding abnormalities to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) in SIDS cases, compared with autopsied controls, occur in regions of the medulla oblongata that contain 5-HT neurons and that are critical for the regulation of cardiorespiration and central chemosensitivity during sleep, i.e. the medullary 5-HT system. Tritiated-lysergic acid diethylamide binding to 5-HT1A-D and 5-HT2 receptors was measured in 19 brainstem nuclei in 23 SIDS and 6 control infants using tissue receptor autoradiography. Binding in the arcuate nucleus, a part of the medullary 5-HT system along the ventral surface, in the SIDS infants (mean age-adjusted binding 7.1 Â± 0.8 fmol/mg tissue, n = 23) was significantly lower than in controls (mean age-adjusted binding 13.1 Â± 1.6 fmol/mg tissue, n = 5) (p = 0.003). Binding also demonstrated significant diagnosis X age interactions (p &lt; 0.04) in 4 other nuclei that are components of the 5-HT system. These data suggest that medullary 5-HT dysfunction can lead to sleep-related, sudden death in affected SIDS infants, and confirm the same binding abnormalities reported by us in a larger dataset of non-American Indian SIDS and control infants. This study also links 5-HT abnormalities in the arcuate nucleus with exposure to adverse prenatal exposures, i.e. cigarette smoking (p = 0.011) and alcohol (p = 0.075), during the periconceptional period or throughout pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke and/or alcohol may contribute to abnormal fetal medullary 5-HT development in SIDS infants.

Failure to address these specific health maintenance concerns may lead to misdiagnoses and failure to reach the highest level of function possible. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Patients with Down syndrome who have legitimate, treatable diagnoses may be misdiagnosed as having behavior problems or dementia. Failure to identify abnormalities such as cardiac problems or sleep apnea may shorten life and interfere with ability to live life to the fullest.

AB  - Before initiating treatment to induce ovulation in cases of PCOS, an appropriate evaluation of the patient and her partner, based on individual considerations, is important to optimize outcome. For obese patients who have PCOS, weight loss measures should be pursued before pharmacologic treatment is initiated. For most patients, the pharmacologic agent of choice to induce ovulation is clomiphene citrate, alone, or in combination with a glucocorticoid. Treatment with metformin, alone, or in combination with clomiphene citrate, may also be beneficial. For patients who are not responsive to clomiphene citrate, injectable gonadotropin treatment is usually warranted, although depending on individual circumstances, laparoscopic ovarian drilling may be appropriate.

AB  - Seizures are not the only obstacles that individuals with epilepsy must overcome. Treatment of epilepsy must take into consideration that patients with epilepsy often face some form of depression, such as peri-ictal depression, ictal depression, interictal depression, or postictal depression, as well as an elevated risk of suicide. Elderly patients, in particular, require special consideration, since aging affects pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; women of childbearing age also require additional counseling. Treatment strategies that focus only on seizure reduction are inadequate and unsuccessful in up to one half of all patients with epilepsy. Epilepsy requires broad treatment strategies that address the needs of the whole patient. Age, genetic factors, gender, diet, use of alcohol and nicotine, comorbidities, and polypharmacy all are important factors to consider in determining a successful epilepsy treatment strategy. Epilepsy affects many aspects of psychosocial function, and optimal outcomes require that the needs of the whole patient be adequately addressed.

AB  - Prematurity, an important risk factor for cerebral palsy, is not diminishing. Critical steps in development of the cortical brain occur between the 22nd and 36th weeks after conception, and research is ongoing to identify which practices optimize outcomes. Prematurity, however, is not the only risk factor, and current evidence supports a multifactorial basis for the disorder. Since presently we can neither prevent nor cure cerebral palsy, we need to optimally manage it. Parents of children with cerebral palsy look to their pediatrician for information, medical treatment, guidance, and support over years of developmental and functional transitions. However, pediatricians report a lack of training and confidence in caring for children with disabilities. More than 70% report having received no training in the prescription of durable medical equipment and more than 50% lacked training in prescribing specific therapies. Anticipatory guidance for the child and family is critical, from the time of diagnosis and throughout the child's life. Parents need to know that although cerebral palsy is defined as static encephalopathy, it is not a clinically static condition. They need to know that musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and digestive systems may be affected as their child grows and that children with chronic health conditions are 3 times more likely to be hospitalized when compared with the general pediatric population. Functionally dependent children with severe cerebral palsy and feeding tube dependency have the lowest estimated mental age, use the most medications, encounter the most respiratory problems, and miss more days of usual activities. The parents are the experts regarding their child and need to be empowered with knowledge and support to make the best decisions possible. The pediatrician, in cooperation with the child, family, and interdisciplinary team, can coordinate a complex care system to the maximal benefit of each child.

AB  - Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use [40]. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies [30,43] and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that Is safe when administered directly to infants Has a low milk:plasma ratio Has a short half-life Has a high molecular weight Has high protein binding in maternal serum Is ionized in maternal plasma Is less lipophilic 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

AB  - Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) represent a growing population of patients. Medical and surgical advances have increased the number of CHD adult survivors, which may create quality-of-life (QOL) issues not previously considered. Quality-of-life issues pertinent to this patient population involve health and life insurance acquisition, birth control, genetic counseling, pregnancy concerns, employment, and independent living arrangements. The purpose of this study was to describe the QOL of adults with CHD. The study used a prospective cross-sectional case-control design to examine QOL using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). The study participants were a sample of 124 adults with CHD from an outpatient cardiology clinic in a metropolitan university-affiliated teaching hospital in the Northeast and 124 matched healthy control subjects. Between the participants and the matched control subjects, there was a significant difference in the total mean SIP score, the physical and psychosocial dimension scores, and all the category scores (P < 0.05). The areas of life the adults with CHD reported as lacking in quality involved the categories of work (SIP of 11.1, moderate disability) and sleep and rest (SIP of 9.03, mild disability). The results of this study indicate that the SIP can be used for quantitative and subjective QOL assessment of adults with CHD. It is suggested that cardiac advanced practice nurses use the results of this study to develop appropriate information, counseling, and anticipatory guidance for this patient population.

AB  - The postpartum period is a time of risk for mood disturbance in women. Postpartum blues occurs commonly, but is self-limited. Postpartum depression occurs in 13% of postpartum women. However, it is estimated that nearly one-half of all cases go undetected. Postpartum psychosis is rare, affecting 1-2 per 1000 women. Postpartum mood disorders can have far-reaching consequences and have been shown to affect the social and psychological development of children. It is critical that healthcare providers understand these disorders and their risk factors to increase detection and to educate women about the risks and treatments of postpartum mood disorders. This review is intended to provide healthcare providers with a better understanding of the descriptive epidemiology, risk factors, and treatments of postpartum mood disorders. The utility of specific screening instruments is also discussed.

AB  - Objectives: To review the etiologies, diagnosis, and treatment options of adolescent endometriosis. Methods: Review of publications relating to adolescent endometriosis. Results: Endometriosis occurs in adolescents as young as 8 years of age; furthermore, there have been documented cases of endometriosis occurring prior to menarche. Adolescents presenting with pelvic pain are treated with cyclic combination oral contraceptive pills and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. If the pain does not respond to these therapies, then in adolescents as in adults, an operative laparoscopy is recommended for the diagnosis and surgical management of endometriosis. The operating gynecologist should be familiar with the appearance of the complete spectrum of various morphologies of endometriosis, as adolescents tend to have clear, red, white, and/or yellow-brown lesions more frequently than black or blue lesions. Subtle clear lesions of endometriosis may be better visualized by filling the pelvis with irrigation fluid so that the clear lesions can be appreciated in a three-dimensional appearance. Young women who are found to have endometriosis by laparoscopy may present with acyclic, cyclic, and constant pelvic pain. Adolescents with pelvic pain not responding to conventional medical therapy have approximately a 70% prevalence of endometriosis. It is known that endometriosis is a progressive disease and since there is no cure, adolescents with endometriosis require long-term medical management until the time in their lives when they have completed childbearing. Psychosocial support is extremely important for this population of young women with endometriosis. Conclusions: Endometriosis occurs in adolescents, and presenting symptoms may vary from those seen in adult women with the disease. All health care providers must be aware of the existence of adolescent endometriosis. They should also be aware of the presenting symptoms so that the adolescent can be appropriately referred to a gynecologist comfortable with medical and surgical treatment options in this patient population. If laparoscopy is to be undertaken, the gynecologist must be prepared not only to diagnose but to surgically manage endometriosis. In addition, the subtle laparoscopic findings of endometriosis in adolescents must be recognized for an appropriate diagnosis. Long-term medical therapy will hopefully decrease pain and the progression of the disease, thus decreasing the risk of advanced-stage disease and infertility.

AB  - Purpose. This evaluation was conducted as part of a protocol entitled Evaluation of the Menicon Z Rigid Gas Permeable Contact Lens for up to 30 Days Extended Wear. The purpose of the protocol was to compare corneal endothelial morphology changes after wearing rigid gas-permeable (RGP) Menicon Z contact lenses, continuously for up to 30 days, with ACUVUE (Johnson & Johnson Vision Care) hydrogel contact lenses, worn for up to 6 nights of extended wear. Methods. Sixty patients, who were adapted to RGP daily wear and soft contact lens daily wear, were recruited at two study sites. The thirty subjects who wore RGP daily wear lenses were fitted with the Menicon Z (tisilfocon A, oxygen permeablility [Dk] = 163) RGP contact lens comprised the test group. The control group subjects (n = 30 former users of daily wear soft contact lenses) were fitted with ACUVUE (etafilcon A, Dk = 28) hydrogel contact lenses. After a 2-week adaptation period of daily wear, subjects began extended wear. Endothelial imaging was performed at the two study sites in this multicenter study (University Hospitals of Cleveland/Case Western Reserve University Department of Ophthalmology [CWRU] and The Ohio State University [OSU]). The hydrogel lens group was instructed to wear their lenses for 7 days and 6 nights before discarding the lenses and to sleep with no lenses on the seventh night. The RGP group was permitted to wear the lenses for up to 30 days and 29 consecutive nights before removing the lenses for cleaning and overnight soaking. Results. CWRU had 24 patients (12 soft contact lens and 12 rigid contact lens) and OSU had 21 patients (12 soft contact lens and 9 rigid contact lens) who completed the study and were included in the analyses. Patients who were withdrawn from the study at CWRU included one RGP patient dropped out because of pregnancy; one RGP patient developed vascularized limbal keratitis and discomfort; one could not be fitted with a bitoric RGP; two soft lens patients moved from the area, and one dropped out because of dry eyes. At OSU, four patients dropped out due to discomfort (two in each lens type); one moved from the study area; one decided not to participate soon after the consent visit; one had worries of reduced vision at 6 months; one subject's attitude changed prior to the 6 month visit; and one subject was withdrawn for reasons of poor study schedule compliance. Conclusion. The Menicon Z lens wearers in this study did not show significant endothelial cell morphology changes after 1 year of nearly continuous contact lens wear. This finding is particularly important considering the RGP wearers in this study were older by a average of 10 years (mean age approximately 40) and had worn their contact lenses an average of almost 10 years longer than the soft contact lens wearers.

AB  - Apparent life-threatening episodes (ALTE) can be the first manifestation of an epileptic seizure in children. However, the diagnosis of ALTE is generally delayed because the interictal EEG often appears normal and the presence of gastroesophageal reflux may mislead the diagnosis of the epileptic manifestation. We report 6 children with epilepsy who presented an ALTE as their first seizure manifestation. The retrospective analysis of our cases demonstrated that ictal EEGS, when available, appeared to be the most helpful test to confirm the diagnosis, although an abnormal-appearing cerebral imaging was also contributive in the patients when only interictal EEGs were available.
Patients:Case 1: 2 years and 10 months-old white male. Case 2: 4 months-old white male. Case 3: 8 months-old white male. Case 4: 2 months-old white male.
TypeofStudy:Case series of 6 reports describing Tegretol treatment in 4 patients with epilepsy who experienced an apparent life-threatening episode (ALTE) with marked apnea as their first seizure manifestation, of whom 3 responded and 1 did not.
DosageDuration:Cases 1: unspecified dose for over 3 years. Case 3: 30 mg/kg daily for 9 years. Cases 2 and 4: unspecified dose and duration.
Indications:4 patients with epilepsy who had apparent life-threatening episode with marked apnea.
Results:Case 1: After Tegretol treatment he experienced initial control of seizures. He was required to continue Tegretol treatment for seizures control up to the present time (age 6 years). Case 2: At 4 years of age seizures changed to absence-like type and were triggered by visual stimulation (when he watched television). All subsequent EEGs appeared mildly abnormal with focal discharges. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and also showed bitemporal and frontal opercular dysplasia. Follow up at age 10 years showed motor and language delay, hyperactivity, refractory epilepsy, sleep disturbances, and left hemiparesis. Case 3: 2 years later the episodes recurred and a repeat EEG showed left temporal paroxysmal discharges. A brain MRI showed left frontal pachygyria. Clinical follow-up indicated mild developmental delay until age 4 years. At age 7 years he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. At the present time (age 9 years) he is still being treated with Tegretol (30 mg/kg/day) and the parents reported 1 seizure per year characterized by staring and cyanosis followed by pallor. He now has normal findings from neurologic examination. Case 4: After Tegretol reached therapeutic levels, apneic episodes ceased. During the last follow-up visit at age 18 months, he had normal findings from neurologic examination and has remained seizure free.
AdverseEffects:No adverse events were mentioned.
AuthorsConclusions:Carbamazepine was the drug of choice in our patients. However, inadequate control with this antiepileptic drug has previously been reported.
FreeText:Case 1: Patient had a normal perinatal history and no health problem was 2.5 years when he started vomiting after ingestion of food. After 2 months these episodes were followed by severe flexor spasms interpreted as ALTEs. Initial investigation showed severe gastroesophageal reflux that improved with specific treatment. 3 months later he developed nocturnal episodes of global hypertonia, apnea, cyanosis, and arousal. He was submitted to a polysomnographic study, and an ictal seizure associated with obstructive apnea was registered. He was started on Tegretol. Case 2: Patient was a product of an uneventful pregnancy followed by a difficult vaginal delivery and perinatal asphyxia. Developmental delay was diagnosed during the first year of life. At age 4 months he experienced an ALTE and was referred for investigation. Cardiorespiratory monitoring showed episodes of decreased oxygen saturation and apnea. Radiologic studies confirmed gastroesophageal reflux and a left hiatal hernia. A brain computer assisted tomography (CT) suggested partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and cerebral atrophy. After surgery for correction of gastroesophageal reflux he had 1 ALTE that required resuscitation. The electroencephalogram (EEG) following this episode showed rolandic-temporal discharges. He started Tegretol treatment. Case 3: Patient was born at gestational age 33 weeks by emergency cesarean section because of maternal uterine rupture. At age 8 months he had an ALTE characterized by prolonged apnea, hypotonia and cyanosis requiring resuscitation with ventilation by ail endotracheal tube. The clinical neurologic examination produced normal findings except for mild hypotonia and developmental delay. The EEG appeared normal, but there were short episodes of central apnea without bradycardia or decrease in oxygen saturation. A brain CT showed mild dilatation of all 4 ventricles. As the episodes recurred, repeat EEG showed discharges in the rolandic and parietal regions (right hemisphere); he was started on Tegretol. Case 4: Patient present seizures at the first day of life and was controlled with phenobarbital. Seizures did not recur, but at 2 months of age he began experiencing apneic episodes. These resembled breath-holding spells as they were triggered by intense unmotivated crying followed by cyanosis, opisthotonus, and apnea. A cardiac Holter monitor study showed sinus arrhythmia with an appropriate QT interval. Mild gastroesophageal reflux was diagnosed but treatment did not improve symptoms. The first interictal EEG appeared normal. However, during a polysomnographic recording, an apneic episode was observed associated with mild irregularities of the cardiac rhythm and apnea, but no epileptogenic activity. As the episodes recurred daily, usually requiring resuscitation, a cardiac pacemaker was placed. Episodes did recur but without accompanying bradycardia. Because the neurologic and general investigation did not provide more information and the episodes recurred, he started Tegretol treatment.

AB  - In a wide sense, a palliative agent is a remedy that attenuates some symptoms associated with a disease, whereas a therapeutic agent is the one capable of curing a disease. Marihuana (Cannabis sativa) is a plant from Central Asia and its main active components (cannabinoids) are three: tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabinol and cannabidiol. They possess psychotropic and vegetative effects and, empirically, are reputed to exert some supposedly therapeutic actions involving the control of pain, vomiting, intraocular pressure and many other ailments. In agreement with official data from the "Consejo Nacional contra las Adicciones" (CONADIC, Mexico), during 1998-2000, the most extensively abused substances were marihuana, cocaine and industrial solvents. The consumption of marihuana in Mexico has increased with time. The average prevalence of the use of cannabis among the urban population from 12 to 65 years of age is 5.3%. The cities with the highest consumption of marihuana are Tijuana (14.7%), Ciudad JuÃ¡rez (9.2%), Guadalajara (7.5%), Mexico City (7.3%), Monterrey (4.1%) and Matamoros (3.6%), a fact that indicates that the north-central region of Mexico is the most affected. Marihuana is the main drug consumed by almost all age groups without any distinction of gender. The consumption is predominantly higher in males (13.9%) than in females (6.9%), and among children from 12 to 17 years old who do not live with their families. The percentage of adolescents consuming marihuana is larger among youths who are not students (4.2%) than in the student population (1.3%). Thus, marihuana consumption is a real problem of public health in Mexico. The existence of at least two receptors to cannabinoids is well known, as well as a group of substances synthesized by the organism itself, denominated endocannabinoids, whose pharmacological properties resemble those of the plant. These observations have caused some parliamentary discussions that have led some countries to approve the use of the synthetic cannabinoid-related substances for therapeutic purposes. In the present review, recent literature was analyzed in order to offer an objective scientific perspective about the use of marihuana. Five relevant observations are pointed out: 1) Studies with positive findings, lack adequate controls. 2) The standards of comparison used, are not the most suitable, for example, the supposed analgesic property of cannabinoids is commonly compared with codeine, and the possible antiemetic capability of cannabinoids is not compared with well-known commercial and safe drugs with verified potency, such as the 5HT 3 receptor subtype agonist, odansetron. 3) Some authors claim that the plant may acts as a whole, and therefore some of the synthetic cannabinoids approved in other countries for therapeutic uses might not produce notable effects. 4) Only a few patients experience some improvement in their symptoms; however most of them experience the psychotropic actions of cannabinoids. And, 5) there are ethical aspects to reconsider in the case of patients who never before had consumed cannabinoids. The following aspects of the clinical use of cannabinoids are discussed in this review. For example, diverse reports suggest that marihuana increases food intake through CB1 receptor-stimulation producing hyperphage by itself, as well as anorexia related to immunodeficiency syndrome and cancer treatment. However, these patients also experience the psychotropic side-effects of marihuana and which lead them to leave the treatment. Regarding pain, cannabinoids produce spinal analgesia in experimental animals, which might be mediated by suppression of neuronal nocyceptive activity and the activation of opioid receptors. Nevertheless, most researchers who are exploring the efficacy of cannabinoids in pain treatment employ codeine as a reference, although codeine is in disuse due to its vegetative effects and poor potency, and do not compare it with other powerful analgesics such as opioids or prostaglandin inhibitors. In the immunologic system, cannabinoids act on CB2 receptors, decreasing the function of immune T and B cells, killer cells and macrophages. Therefore, infection processes might be increased in debilitated patients. By contrast, the immunosuppressant action of cannabinoids could be useful in hyperactivity of the immunologic system, as in the case of multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, recent findings suggest that a lipid imbalance (mainly with arachidonic acid) is a primary factor in the etiology of cystic fibrosis. Since the endocannabinoids are fatty acid derivatives, it has been hypothesized that the patients who suffer cystic fibrosis can receive benefits by the administration of cannabinoids (i.e. restoring the balance between fatty acids, reducing the symptoms and increasing life expectancies). Regardind reproduction research, prenatal cannabinoid exposure has been associated with a high perinatal morbidity but the possible long-term consequences are still poorly understood. Therefore, animal models of perinatal cannabinoid exposure have provided a useful tool for examining the developmental effects of the offspring. Results show alteration in the ontogeny of spontaneous locomotor activity and exploratory behavior. Adult animals exposed during pregnancy and lactation exhibited persistent alterations of the behavioral response to novelty, social interactions and sexual behavior. However, available data regarding the long-term behavioral and cognitive effects in humans are scarce to be compared with animal results. In other studies, some endocannabinoids generated in monocytes and platelets show that they are potent vasodilators and related to hypotension following hemorrhagic shock. Thus, animals treated with anandamide reduce their survival rate. In contrast, administration of the CB1 antagonist (SR141716A) increases the arterial pressure, the respiratory frequency and the survival rate in a dose-response manner. Thus, inhibition of the endogenous cannabinoids reverts the hemorrhagic shock with notorious efficacy, similar to endogenous opioids. In this sense, some other reports suggest that cannabinoids are useful to treat glaucoma, because cannabis reduces intraocular pressure in 60% of the users, although there are other drugs lacking psychotropic effects with proved and accepted efficacy in the treatment of glaucoma. Marihuana may also have certain anticonvulsivant properties; however delta-9THC alters sleep patterns in humans and could not be recommendable. In spite of some positive reports on the treatment of partial or tonic-clonic seizures, there is a lack of controlled studies.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS), first described in 1672 and given its name in 1945, is one of the most common sleep and movement disorders. Modern population-based studies demonstrate a prevalence between 5% and 15% in adult white populations. According to the diagnostic criteria, RLS is defined as an irresistable desire to move limbs, usually associated with paresthesias/dysesthesias and motor restlessness. The symptoms start or worsen at rest and improve with activity. Additionally, the symptoms worsen in the evenings and/or nights, which often results in disturbance of sleep with daytime tiredness. There is often a family history of RLS. Initially, the disease course is usually fluctuating and later may become continuous or chronic-progressive. The diagnosis is based on the patient history and is supported by a normal neurological examination. RLS is confirmed by the finding of periodic limb movements (PLM) in polysomnographic investigations and by a response to dopaminergic medication. A large number of studies have confirmed the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) in the treatment of RLS. A majority of the patients treated over a longer period of time with L-dopa, however, develop problems with an effect called augmentation, where the RLS symptoms begin appearing earlier during the day and involve new parts of the body with increasing severity. A large number of studies have now confirmed that dopamine agonists can also be effective in RLS therapy, and that this treatment seems to involve less risk for augmentation. This paper provides a general review of RLS with a focus on current treatment options.

AB  - Because smoking during pregnancy is a major risk factor for late fetal death and the sudden infant death syndrome, we investigated cardiorespiratory defense mechanisms to hypoxia in 7 prenatally nicotine-exposed (N) lambs (approximate maternal dose: 0.5 mg/ kg/day) and 11 control (C) lambs all at an average age of 5 days. The ventilatory response to 10% oxygen (hyperpnea) was significantly attenuated during quiet sleep in N lambs compared with C lambs and in N lambs aroused from sleep later compared with C lambs (161 Â± 90 versus 75 Â± 66 seconds, p < 0.05). The ventilatory response to hypoxia was similar in the two groups during wakefulness (W), whereas the heart rate response (tachycardia) was significantly lower in N lambs compared with C lambs during both activity states. The ventilatory response to hyperoxia was significantly lower in N lambs compared with C lambs during both activity states. Transition from W to quiet sleep was associated with a significant decrease in ventilation in C lambs but not in N lambs. In conclusion, prenatal nicotine exposure, at a dose comparable with moderate smoking, blunts major elements of the cardiorespiratory defense to hypoxia, i.e., the heart rate and ventilatory and arousal responses, and abolishes the normal decrease in ventilation during sleep compared with W.

AB  - Hypertension in pregnancy is diagnosed when pressures in excess of 140/90 mmHg are repeatedly measured. A differentiation is made between pregnancy-independent hypertension, i.e. pre-existing hypertension and gestational hypertension occurring for the first time after the 20th week of the pregnancy. If hypertension is accompanied by proteinuria, the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is made. Feared complications are eclampsia and the HELLP syndrome. For blood pressure measurement, a number of peculiarities must be noted:thus,for example, in severe pre-eclampsia the circadian rhythm may reverse, with pressure increases in particular in the evening and at night. Ambulatory management may be permissible only in the case of pre-pregnancy and gestational hypertension, provided the blood pressure can be kept below 160/100. Restricting physical activity, and regular monitoring of weight, blood pressure and laboratory investigations usually suffice. If pre-eclampsia or the HELLP syndrome is suspected, the patient should be hospitalized without delay. A hypertensive crisis must prompt immediate measures to lower the blood pressure - but not too quickly, in order to avoid severe consequences for the fetus caused by inadequate uteroplacental perfusion.

AB  - Context Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal mortality among American Indians, a group whose infant death rate is consistently above the US national average. Objective To determine prenatal and postnatal risk factors for SIDS among American Indians. Design, Setting, and Participants Population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living controls among American Indians in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa enrolled from December 1992 to November 1996 and investigated using Standardized parental interview, medical record abstraction, autopsy protocol, and infant death review. Main Outcome Measures Association of SIDS with maternal socioeconomic and behavioral factors, health care utilization, and infant care practices. Results The proportions of case and control infants who were usually placed prone to sleep (15.2% and 13.6%, respectively), who shared a bed with parents (59.4% and 55.4%), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7% and 54.6%) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7% of case infants and 45.5% of control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of clothing on the infant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-26.5), any visits by a public health nurse (aOR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.8), periconceptional maternal alcohol use (aOR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.6-23.3), and maternal first-trimester binge drinking (aOR, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.9-35.3). Conclusions Public health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and first trimester, and layers of clothing are important risk factors for SIDS among Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.

AB  - Down's syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation and although known for more than a hundred years, the underlying pathomechanisms for the phenotype and abnormal brain functions remain elusive. Performing protein hunting in fetal Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) brain we detected aberrant expression of several proteins. Fetal brain cortex from controls and Down's syndrome at the early second trimester of gestation was used for expressional analysis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis with subsequent in-gel digestion of spots and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization spectroscopical identification followed by quantification of spots with specific software was applied. The nuclear matrix protein matrin 3, cytoskeletal motor protein HMP, and the circadian clock protein hlark were significantly decreased in fetal DS brain. C8ORF2 protein was reduced but did not reach statistical significance. Prox1 and predicted protein Dj149A16.6 were comparable between groups. Reduction of brain proteins may represent or cause deficient cytoskeletal structure, transcription machinery and exocytosis, functions already known to be deteriorated in DS brain. Some of the described proteins were only predicted and we here show the existence of the corresponding proteins in fetal human brain.

AB  - Morningness-eveningness preference by the self-rated Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) has earlier been shown to be associated with the subjects' season of birth. Here, we obtain this result for a new sample of 2,125 university students and for the sample obtained by pooling the data with the earlier study, yielding totally 3,709 Italian and Spanish subjects. An nonlinear regression of MEQ as a cosine curve according to the month of birth, adjusting for age and gender, gave a maximum (morningness) around the transition between the birth months December and January, and a minimum (eveningness) around the transition between the birth months June and July. Multiple logistic regressions showed that for females as well as for males, the group born during the half-year April to September containing summer had a significantly lower proportion of morning types as compared with the group born during the half-year October to March containing winter. This was more pronounced for males. Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of morning types among females compared with males was found only in the group born during April to September, but not in the group born during October to March. There was a weak but statistically significant positive correlation between MEQ and age in the sample's limited age range of 17-30 years. We discuss the results in terms of the mutually inhibitory systems of melatonin and dopamine, and find further support for a hypothesis that it is the variation in the length of photo-period during the gestational or perinatal period that contributes significantly to the season of birth variation found in the morningness-eveningness preference among adults.

AB  - Naturally fluctuating hormones (menstrual cycle, through pregnancy or menopausal transition) are not related to marked sleep disturbances in women. It is likely, however, that subsets of women will display a central nervous system vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations so that sleep disturbances manifest as a part of a complex of discomforting symptoms. Sleep is impacted directly through the circadian system or brain sleep regulation or through the development of concurrent functional changes and symptoms. Women are susceptible to sleep-related disorders that are also common in men, such as primary insomnia and SBD although the contributing factors and manifestations may not be the same. General summary of practice implications: The prevalence of sleep problems, especially in midlife women, warrants attention to assessment. It is important to rule out possible primary sources of insomnia, such as medical (eg, chronic illness), psychiatric (eg, mental illness) and pharmacologic types, as well as contextual factors (eg, divorce, job loss, bereavement). Screening for insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, narcolepsy, and other sleep-related disorders can be done quickly, but gender differences in common manifestations must be considered. Effective nursing interventions for sleep problems fall into the realms of behavioral coaching, or education for self-care sleep improvement, and screening for referral of serious sleep-related disorders. Treatments for insomnia will depend on the type (acute or chronic, primary or secondary), context within which the insomnia occurs (social and menopausal status), and the severity of the daytime functional impairment. Acute insomnia treatments can include short-term prescriptions of sleeping pills, eg, zolpidem tartrate (AmbienÂ®, Searle, Chicago) or short acting benzodiazepines, to break a cycle of sleeplessness, but behavioral treatments are foundational for sustained improvements. Behavioral treatments can be readily incorporated into primary or tertiary care nursing practice for insomnia unrelated to SDB or other sleep disorders. These include counseling people to engage in good sleep hygiene and to ritualize the bedtime routine, or in more severe cases of insomnia, to practice stimulus control or sleep restriction (see Table 1 for summary). Screening and recognition of chronic, severe insomnia, SDB, narcolepsy, or periodic limb movements during sleep warrant referral to an accredited sleep disorders center to help prevent the negative health outcomes that can emanate from disturbed sleep.

AB  - Evidence suggests that shiftwork is associated with menstrual irregularities, reproductive disturbances, risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and sleep disturbances in women, yet little has been done to evaluate the effects of shiftwork on menstrual function and fertility. The purpose of this study was to evaluate menstrual function, fertility, and pregnancy outcome in nurses working shiftwork, and to examine the relationship of sleep to menstrual function. Sixty-eight nurses < 40 years old completed a survey evaluating sleep, menstrual function, and pregnancy outcome. Fifty-three percent of the women noted menstrual changes when working shiftwork. Women noting menstrual changes reported more physiological symptoms (p < 0.003), slept approximately one hour less when working nights, and reported lengthened time to fall asleep (p < 0.01) when working nights. Findings suggest that sleep disturbances may lead to menstrual irregularities, and changes in menstrual function may be a marker of shiftwork intolerance. Copyright Â© 2002 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Monitoring fetal movement serves as an indirect measure of central nervous system integrity and function. The gradual coordination of whole body movement in the fetus, which requires complex neurologic control, is similar to the coordination of movement in the preterm newborn infant. Monitoring has its greatest value when placental insufficiency is long-standing; its routine role in low-risk pregnancies requires further clinical investigation. The presence of a vigorous fetus is reassuring. Perceived inactivity is a screening method that requires a reassessment of any underlying antepartum complication and a more precise evaluation by FHR testing or real-time ultrasonography. Evidence is lacking that monitoring fetal movement is an effective independent surveillance technique for predicting fetal growth, malformation, and stillbirth.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or crib or cot death are synonyms for the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an infant. The incidence of SIDS has been estimated to be from 1-2% to 3%. Protracted intrauterine hypoxia or recurrent hypoxic insults during fetal life undoubtedly influence the development of the central nervous structures as a tissue most susceptible to hypoxia, although well developed mechanisms of defense against hypoxia exist during the fetal life. The mechanisms underyling SIDS include neurologically compromised infants who are deprivred of compensatory mechanisms during sleep, sustaining a hypoxic insult with alterations in neurotransmitter receptors within the regions involved in chemoreception and cardiovascular control. Changes in the brain result from perinatal prolonged hypoxia (persistent reticular pathways in the pons and medulla, astroglia in the brainstem, gliosis of brain nerve nuclei, defects in neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal apoptosis, microthrombosis, and hypoxic ischemic lesion). Hypoxic perinatal risk factors for SIDS included passive and active exposure to cigarette smoking in pregnancy, abuse of drugs, alcohol, coffee and medication in pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal hypoxia with or without resuscitation, preeclampsia, anemia in pregnancy, prematurity, multiparity, multiple pregnancy, pregnant women aged < 20 years and > 35 years, cardiocirculatory, pulmonary and endocrine diseases in pregnancy, and short time interval between two pregnancies. As cigarette smoking has been demonstrated to lead to fetoplacental insufficiency, which results in fetal hypoxia, it is concluded that hypoxia is a precondition for the occurrence of SIDS. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke decreases maternal red blood cell count, and concentrations of tyrosine and selenium, reduces fetal and neonatal cerebral blood flow, and increases moternal MCV, leukocytosis, especially neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes, maternal and fetal heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resistance index in umbilical artery, fetal hemoglobin, cytokine, serotonine, dopamine, catecholamine, hypoxanthine, endorphin and interleukin-6. Pregnancy at a risk of hypoxia, especially in heavy smokers, is a major risk factor for SIDS, and such pregnancy requires close and intensive antenatal monitoring.

AB  - The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. In the United States, in 1999, 27% of adults had a body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2, almost double the prevalence of 20 years earlier. The estimated mortality from obesity-related diseases in the United States is approximately 300,000 annually and growing. In the future, mortality related to obesity is expected to exceed that of smoking. Numerous diseases are caused or made worse by obesity. These include type 2 diabetes; hypertension; dyslipidemia; ischemic heart disease; stroke; obstructive sleep apnea; asthma; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; gastroesophageal reflux disease; degenerative joint disease of the back, hips, knees, and feet; infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome; various malignancies; and depression. Type 2 diabetes is perhaps the most visible obesity-related problem. Present in at least 14 million Americans, it leads to serious complications and premature death. It is largely caused by obesity, and is generally cured by weight loss. The quality of life of the obese is markedly reduced, and the costs to health care systems are great. Preventive programs have yet to affect the rising prevalence. An effective solution is needed. Â© 2002 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: This article is a critical review of the efficacy of selected alternative treatments for unipolar depression including exercise, stress management techniques, acupuncture, St. John's wort, bright light, and sleep deprivation. Issues related to women across the life span, including pregnancy and lactation, are highlighted. Data Sources: Evidence of efficacy is based on randomized controlled trials. A distinction is made between studies that address depressive symptoms and studies that address depressive disorders. The review emphasizes issues related to effectiveness, such as treatment availability, acceptability, safety, and cost and issues relevant to women, Data Synthesis: Exercise, stress reduction methods, bright light exposure, and sleep deprivation hold greater promise as adjuncts to conventional treatment than as monotherapies for major depression. The evidence to date is not sufficiently compelling to suggest the use of St. John's wort in favor of or as an alternative to existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-regulated compounds. Initial evidence suggests that acupuncture might be an effective alternative monotherapy for major depression, single episode. Conclusion: This review indicates that some unconventional treatments hold promise as alternative or complementary treatments for unipolar depression in women and have the potential to contribute to its long-term management. Additional research is needed before further recommendations can be made, and there is an urgent need to carefully document and report the frequency of minor and major side effects.

AB  - Possibly the most important outcomes of bariatric surgery involve changes in obesity-related illness, quality of life (QOL), and psychologic well-being. Dramatic improvement or resolution of serious medical comorbidity accompanies the weight loss following laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with the LAP-BAND (INAMED Health, Santa Barbara, CA). There are major improvements in the conditions of the metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Improvement in insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta-cell function associated with weight loss induces remission in the majority of type 2 diabetics and reduces the risk of others developing type 2 diabetes. Improvement in dyslipidemia is characterized by raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride concentrations. Together with lower blood pressure, these changes provide a substantial reduction in cardiovascular risk. Other medical conditions caused or aggravated by obesity are also significantly improved, including sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux. Weight loss is associated with improved fertility and more favorable pregnancy outcomes. All aspects of QOL improve substantially, especially physical disability, and post-weight-loss QOL measures approximate those of the general population. There are also major improvements in body image and reduction in depressive illness. These changes provide perhaps the most compelling data regarding the value of LAP-BAND surgery and underlie the great satisfaction experienced by patients. Â© 2002 Excerpta Medica Inc.

AB  - Long before the advent of modern chemoprophylaxis drugs, many practitioners successfully prevented the debilitating and fatal outcomes associated with infection by the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Today, with effective insect repellents and several excellent medications available for chemoprophylaxis, there has never been a better array of quality products to prevent mosquito bites and infection and to suppress parasites once in the blood stream; however, there are thousands of imported cases into nonendemic countries and scores of deaths and near-fatal outcomes every year in returning travelers, soldiers, immigrants, and refugees. In this article, the author focuses on practical uses of currently available prevention tools.

AB  - To understand the effects of in utero cocaine exposure on the developing fetus, we studied the heart rate and the heart rate variability (HRV) in near and full term cocaine-exposed infants during quiet sleep supine and following orthostatic stress. 21 cocaine-exposed and 23 control infants were studied within 120 hours of birth. 30-minute segments of the electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded with the infant, horizontal followed by the infant in a 25Â° head-up tilt. The cocaine-exposed group, as compared with the control group, had a trend toward an increase in heart rate in the horizontal position and a significant increase in heart rate following the tilt. The frequency components of the heart rate were lower in the horizontal position and increased following the orthostatic stress. These results are consistent with the known pharmacological actions of cocaine and demonstrate the possible adverse neonatal effects of cocaine abuse during pregnancy.

Methods: We studied 21 cocaine-exposed and 23 control infants within 120 hours of birth. Two 30-minute segments of the electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded and analyzed in the time and frequency domain; the first with the supine infant, horizontal followed by the infant in a 25Â° head-up tilt. Results: The cocaine-exposed group, as compared with the control group, had a trend toward an increase in heart rate in the horizontal position and a significant increase in heart rate following the tilt in the cocaine-exposed group. The frequency components of the heart rate were lower in the horizontal position and increased following the orthostatic stress. Conclusions: These results are consistent with the known pharmacological actions of cocaine and demonstrate the dangers of cocaine abuse during pregnancy.

AB  - From antiquity, in the human societies were used psychoactive substances, which in the modern society are widely used, with a purpose of euphoria. Some of these substances are acceptable from the society, when their use don't exceed the measure, such as alcohol, caffeine and tobacco, while some others, because of their guidance in dependence of a human from these substances and in uncontrollable antisocial behavior, are considered illicit substances, such as narcotic substances. Tobacco smoking is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in the World. These risks have been shown to be related to the nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco smoke. Lang cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are obvious health hazards to the smoker. In addition, respiratory diseases are increased in smokers; these include emphysema and chronic bronchitis as well as pulmonary tuberculosis, influenza and bacterial bronchitis and pneumonia. Smokers have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, aortic aneurysm, arterial thrombosis and stroke. Furthermore, smokers have a higher incidence of peptic ulcer disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and wrinkling. In passive smokers, studies have shown an increased incidence of lung cancer, exacerbations of asthma, coronary artery disease, nasal carcinoma, brain tumor and breast cancer. In children, exposure to parental smoking clearly increases the incidence of acute respiratory diseases. The direct role of nicotine in the pathogenesis of disease has not been completely defined. Its effects on cardiovascular disease may be mediated by direct increases in heart rate and blood pressure, depression of the magnitude of the increase in coronary blood flow that occurs in response to increased metabolic demand, including coronary artery spasm in susceptible people, causing platelet hyperaggregability and relative hypercoagulability and producing endothelial damage. In cancer pathogenesis, nicotine is not carcinogenic, but, when burned, may produce nicotine-derived nitrosoamines in amounts sufficient to contribute to cancer. In pregnancy, nicotine blocks the cholinergic receptor and blocks the acetylcholine-facilitated amino acid transport; however, more importantly, placental hypoxia induced by carbon monoxide and other tobacco gases depress energy-dependent processes such as transport of amino acids and other nutrients. Once absorbed, nicotine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and is distributed throughout the brain within seconds. Experimentally, nicotine in low doses causes ganglionic stimulation and, therefore, causes a centrally mediated cardiovascular stimulation, while high doses cause ganglionic blockade with subsequent hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting and pallor. However, tolerance to these effects, although not complete, develops within 1 day. Cigarette smoking and tobacco use meet the criteria for drug dependence. Considerable behavioral and pharmacologic evidence show that nicotine is dependence-producing constituent of tobacco. Nicotine produces an euphoriant effect and provides the reinforcement for the smoking of cigarettes. Following abrupt smoking cessation or attempts to reduce consumption, withdrawal symptoms occur within hours. The symptoms include restlessness, irritability, anxiety, tension, stress intolerance, drowsiness, frequent awakenings from sleep, fatigue, depression, impatience, confusion, impaired concentration, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Effective treatments for tobacco dependence exist and all tobacco users should be offered those treatments. Five first-line pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence (sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patch) are effective and at least 1 of these medications should be prescribed in the absence of contraindications.

AB  - Hepatoblastoma is the most common malignant liver tumor in children. The tumor tends to develop in children less than 5 years old, and 68% occur in the first 2 years of life. Several predictive risk factors associated with tumor development include parental factors (maternal contraceptive and alcohol abuse), congenital anomalies (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis and hemihypertrophy) and chromosomal abnormalities. We report a low-birthweight infant who developed hepatoblastoma with congenital anomalies and chronic lung disease.

AB  - As a service to healthcare professionals, Aventis Pasteur MSD UK Ltd. operates a telephone-based Vaccine Information Service, providing information on all aspects of vaccination. In the UK it is the primary means by which spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports are received by the company. It was brought to the attention of the Pharmacovigilance Department that a significant number of calls related to people seeking advice following inadvertent administration of vaccines. To inform our advice it was decided to collect details of such episodes, to enquire whether an adverse drug reaction had already occurred, and to encourage reporting of adverse drug reaction that may occur subsequently. Inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy was not included in this survey since these data were already being collected separately. During the period from 1 September 1999 to 31 August 2000 the Vaccine Information Service received 124,010 enquiries. Of these, 302 (0.2%) concerned inadvertent administration of one or more vaccines (all age groups), 161 (53.2% of total inadvertent administration) of them in children (<18 years). These 161 reports involved the inadvertent administration of 221 vaccines. In six cases (3.8%) one or more adverse drug reaction were reported following the inadvertent administration. Five of these six cases involved a DTP-containing vaccine: one case where DTP was given instead of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DT) vaccine as a pre-school booster, one case where a fourth dose of DTP-Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib) was given at 20 weeks of age and three cases where DTP was mixed with DTP-Hib. The sixth case involved a child given an adult dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Data are available for five of these six cases - all adverse drug reactions were non-serious and resolved without sequelae. Inadvertent administration of vaccines in childhood, although worrying for both the healthcare professionals and the parents involved, seems rarely to result in adverse reactions.

AB  - The rare association of Cushing's syndrome and pregnancy is explained by the amenorrhea and sterility inherent to the syndrome. In the literature, 125 cases have been reported: 30 cases of early diagnosis and 95 others diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy. At the start of pregnancy When hypercorticism exists before pregnancy it is hardly secretory. Its diagnosis, at an early stage, is not hindered by the hormone modifications of pregnancy. Its aetiological treatment raises the problem of the compatibility in pursuing the latter. In the second half of pregnancy The positive and aetiological diagnoses of Cushing's syndrome are difficult and its prevalence may therefore be underestimated. The evocative clinical signs are unspecific: excessive weight gain, hypertension of pregnancy and gestational diabetes. The 24-hour free hypercortisoluria and the absence of dexamethasone inhibition are of little diagnostic value after the 14th week of amenorrhea. The positive diagnosis therefore relies essentially on the abolition of the circadian rhythm of cortisol. The biological hyperandrogenia commonly observed is not discriminating. Adrenal aetiologies are frequent. Imaging must be performed to eliminate an adrenocortical tumor. Prognosis The maternal prognosis depends on the hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes and the complications of Cushing's syndrome. It depends on the activity of the hypercorticism and its early aetiological treatment, which must not be delayed after pregnancy. The foetal prognosis depends on the maternal prognosis. It is represented by preterm delivery, hypotrophy and death of the foetus in utero. The therapeutic management must be symptomatic and aetiologic, maternal and obstetrical. Â© 2002, Masson, Paris.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the site of the generation and entrainment of circadian rhythms. Similar to other structures, it develops throughout gestation but is still immature for some time after. This suggests that the SCN could be vulnerable to maternal influences, such as poor nutrition, stress and drugs, all of which can affect neuronal development. Evidence is accumulating that suggests that this is the case, with body size at birth influencing melatonin production in adult humans and maternal malnutrition, and stress affecting sleep in rodents. Interestingly, the maternal environment affects the phase of rhythms and the response of the circadian timing system to light pulses. The nature of these changes in adult rhythmicity is similar to those commonly associated with depression in humans. Thus, abnormal fetal programming might predispose adults to depressive illness.

AB  - Iodine deficiency (ID) is associated with increased prevalence of goiter, increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, and is the world's leading cause of intellectual deficits. Iodine nutritional status of a population is assessed by measurements of urinary iodine concentrations which are also used to define, indicate, survey and monitor iodine deficiency and consequently its treatment. Several methods are available for urinary iodine determination. Discussed here are some of the limitations and controversies related to urinary iodine determinations, and recent findings with emphasis on measurements of urinary iodine concentrations in children and during pregnancy.

AB  - Adult female Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) spend 84% of their lifetime either sleeping underground at night during the active season or hibernating underground. To assess their use of subterranean sites, 46 females were radiocollared for periods ranging from a few days to 4.5 years. Adult females typically slept in 6-11 different chambers throughout the 15-week active season and used a single site for the 37-week hibernation season. For the 1st half of the active season, which encompassed mating, pregnancy, and lactation, squirrels usually slept in 5-6 different chambers, with each sleep site generally used once for a prolonged period of consecutive nights. In contrast, in the latter half of the active season, females moved back and forth between 5-6 sleep sites. For both females that did and did not wean a litter, this switch in sleep-site usage occurred abruptly, about 40 days before entry into hibernation. Females always slept in the future parturition chamber for some or all of gestation, and they always continued to sleep in the parturition site for some or all of lactation. In contrast, adult females never slept in the future hibernation site on any night during the preceding active season. Only 50% of the females used the hibernaculum for sleeping after hibernation, and then only for 1-5 nights. The marked contrast in prior usage of the parturition site and hibernation site indicates that the hibernaculum chamber of adult female Richardson's ground squirrels is dedicated to the forthcoming hibernation period, whereas the parturition site is a multipurpose chamber used for sleeping during gestation, for parturition, and for sleeping and litter rearing during lactation.

AB  - Hyperprolactinemia is the most common endocrine disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. A prolactinoma is the most common cause of chronic hyperprolactinemia once pregnancy, primary hypothyroidism, and drugs that elevate serum prolactin levels have been excluded. Patients can present with hypogonadism, infertility, galactorrhea, osteopenia, and mass effects of the tumor. When hyperprolactinemia is confirmed, a cause for the disorder needs to be sought. This involves a careful history and examination, followed by laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging of the sella turcica. The goals of treatment are to normalize prolactin levels, restore gonadal function, and reduce the effects of chronic hyperprolactinemia. Dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice for the majority of patients. Transsphenoidal surgery is usually reserved for patients who are intolerant of or resistant to dopamine agonists or when hyperprolactinemia is caused by non-prolactin-secreting tumors compressing the pituitary stalk. Cabergoline has been shown to be more effective and better tolerated than bromocriptine. However, there are more data on the safety of the latter drug during pregnancy and bromocriptine, therefore, remains the treatment of choice in hyperprolactinemic women wishing to conceive.

AB  - The position of the abomasum in six cows was examined by ultrasonography at regular intervals for six weeks after they had calved. Its position was established by determining the distance between the margin of the left side of the abomasum and the ventral midline at two sites. During the last weeks of pregnancy, the abomasum was positioned in a small region of the left ventral side of the abdominal cavity. At parturition it was positioned high on the left side and then descended. The abomasum was furthest from the midline immediately after parturition. Its position was related to the interval after calving, the cow's feed intake, and the pH and osmotic pressure of the rumen fluid. There was considerable variation between the cows in the position of the abomasum, which was in part due to analytical variation, and in individual cows it had a circadian rhythm.

AB  - We investigated whether secretion of insulin occurred in the absence of feeding in a ruminant. Serum insulin, glucose and lactate concentrations were measured in three adult non-pregnant reindeer at hourly intervals during an 18-h fast (17:30-11:30 h) in October. Mean serum insulin concentration was 39Â±3 Î¼IU/ml (range 2-100). The insulin profile of two animals was characterized by a nocturnal rise and an early morning trough, followed by a mid-morning rise. Within the larger peaks, short-term oscillations occurred at 2-3-h intervals. Serum glucose concentrations significantly increased during the fast and exceeded feeding values by 31-45% at 18 h post feeding. Serum lactate concentrations declined significantly in all three animals. Residuals for serum glucose concentrations were significantly negatively correlated to residuals of serum lactate in two animals, but not the third. Serum glucose and lactate concentrations were not related to serum insulin. In conclusion, insulin secretion in reindeer shows a 2-3-h periodicity in the absence of feeding. The periodicity is of similar duration as the inter-meal interval for pen-fed reindeer during winter (2.5 h). Although not necessarily causal, the results are consistent with a hypothesized role for insulin in meal initiation. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/rationale. Preterm infants in mechanical ventilation are vulnerable and may manifest physiological instability and a disorganized behavioural state when responding to external stimuli. Adequate positioning strategies may play an important role in protecting infants from environmental stressor and assisting quality of sleep. However, no study has examined effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch responses for ventilated preterm infants during the critical first week postbirth. Aim of the study. The purpose of this study was to compare effects of prone and supine positions on behavioural state and stress responses in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. Design/methods. The infants were aged 25-36 weeks of gestation, â¤ 7 days of age, and without sedation or congenital abnormalities. Using a crossover design, 28 infants were randomly assigned to supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. Behavioural state and frequencies of stress signs including startle, tremor, and twitch were systemically recorded and analysed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Findings. Infants when prone compared with supine had (a) less crying, less active sleep, and more quiet sleep states, and (b) fewer stress responses of startle, tremor, and twitch. Conclusion. Results indicate that prone positioning improves the quality of sleep and decreases stress tor ventilated preterm infants during the first week postbirth. These may conserve energy and assist infants' extrauterine adaptation.

AB  - Epidemiologic and clinical studies have shown gender differences between men and women in unipolar depression, mainly related with hormonal variables that would determine women's specific organization and/or activation of the central nervous system from intrauterine to postmenopausal life. It is recognized that there are a higher prevalence of unipolar depression among women, a predominance of atypical depressive symptoms, a better response to MAOI and SSRI between menarche and menopause, and a higher frequency of rapid cycling and seasonal pattern. Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum, as well as the higher prevalence of thyroid diseases and stronger reactivity to stress of the axis that regulates the secretion of CRF, ACTH and cortisol, support the hipotheses of hormonal etiologies in these pictures and give an explanatory base to the observed differences. The appropriate distinction between unipolar and bipolar depression, the correct election of an antidepressive treatment and the exploration of the efficacy and efectiveness of other therapeutic strategies, such as light-therapy, sleep deprivation and thyroid and/or gonadal steroids supplementation or replacement therapy, are factors that must be taken into account when treating a depressive woman.

AB  - The highly effective antibody has been obtained by immunizing rabbits with recombinant leptin many times. The leptin is iodinated with the chloramine-T method and purified with a Sephadex-G25 chromatography column. The reaction between antigen and antibody is carried out by a one-step balance method and cultured at 4Â°C for 24h; the binding and free antigen was then separated by PR reagent. The determining range of this method is about 0.5-24 ng/mL; limited detection level is 0.45 ng/mL, relative standard deviation in a group, and among groups, are less than 5.4% and 8%, respectively. The level of blood leptin in 277 samples of normal persons, in 112 samples of overweight persons (weight/hieght m2 â¥ 25) and 224 samples of hyperlipidemic patients have been measured by this method. It is demonstrated that the level of blood leptin in males is much lower than that of the females, and becomes elevated with increased age. Serum leptin level in overweight persons and hyperlipidemic patients is also much higher than that of normal groups (P &lt; 0.01). Serum leptin of 21 workers in our lab at 8:00AM and 4:00PM has been tested. It was found that there are no differences between the two time points. The same results are obtained within age groups. Leptin levels of pregnant women's serum is higher than those of the control group (P &lt; 0.001). Leptin in newborn's serum is significantly lower than those of mothers (P &lt; 0.01). There is no obvious correlation between leptin level of mother and newborns by correlation analysis (r = 0.19, P &gt; 0.05). The body weight and body weight index of pregnant women are well correlated with their serum leptin levels (r = 0.33 and 0.35, P &lt; 0.05). The body weight and body weight index of newborns are well correlated with their serum leptin levels (r = 0.54 and 0.49, P &lt; 0.001). The serum leptin level of pregnant women is not correlated with newborn's body weight (r = 0.10). These results have shown that the proposed method is stable, simple, and specific, being sensitive enough to determine leptin levels in human serum or plasma.

AB  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has dropped significantly in most countries following the development of education campaigns on the avoidance of risk factors for SIDS. However, questions have been raised about the physiological mechanism responsible for the effects of these environmental risk factors. Since 1985, a series of prospective, multicentric studies have been developed to address these questions; over 20,000 infants were recorded during one night in a sleep laboratory and among these, 40 infants eventually died of SIDS. In this review, the following methods were employed: sleep recordings and analysis, monitoring procedure, data analysis of sleep stages, cardiorespiratory and oxygen saturation, scoring of arousals, spectral analysis of the heart rate and the determination of arousal thresholds, and statistical analysis and the results including sleep apneas, arousals and heart rate and autonomic controls in both future SIDS victims and normal infants were introduced separately. In addition, the physiological effect of prenatal risk factors (maternal smoking during gestation) and postnatal risk factors (administration of sedative drugs, prone sleeping position, ambient temperature, sleeping with the face covered by a bed sheet, pacifiers and breastfeeding) in normal infants were analyzed. In conclusion, the physiological studies undertaken on the basis of epidemiological findings provide some clues about the physiological mechanisms linked with SIDS. Although the description of the mechanisms responsible for SIDS is still far from complete, it appears to involve both arousal responses and cardiac autonomic controls during sleep-wake processes.

AB  - Background: Organisms have developed endogenous mechanisms for keeping track of time which allow them to adjust to environmental changes. Entrainment of endogenous rhythms to the day-night cycle is of elementary importance for the regulation of physiological processes. How environmental changes influence the manifestation of cicradian rhythms during intrauterine and extraurterine growth depend on complex networking of molecular, physiological and sensory mechanisms. This work reports on development of circadian rhythms in the infant, with particular emphasis on the roles of times cues to which the infant is exposed. Subjects and Methods: Activity data of 12 families were continously recorded during the first 4 months after birth using non-invasive actigraphs. Recordings of parental activity started at the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Time series analysis was used to investigate the periodic structure of the data. In addition, we review the literature on the ontogenesis of circadian rhythms in humans. Results: During the 3rd trimester, daily variation of physiological functions in the fetus showed a high degree of correspondence with maternal circadian rhythms. Early behaviour of most infants was highly variable between individuals but could be asigned to different entrainment patterns. Good correspondence of mother-infant activity patterns during the early postnatal period, when the infant was not yet entrained to the day-night-cycle, was correlated with the rapid development of an entrained daily pattern in the infant a few weeks later. Conclusion: Understanding the emergence of periodic structures at physiological and behavioural level during human ontogenesis will be an asset in the successful intervention and treatment during neonatal care.

AB  - Oestrus and calving records of Anatolian buffaloes were analyzed to investigate influence of climatic conditions on oestrus occurrence and postpartum period. Oestrus records showed a seasonal pattern concentrated between July and September which is the warmest period of the year. Likewise, more than half (52.7 %) of the total calvings occurred between May and August. Month of calving significantly influenced the length of calving to first oestrus interval and open period (P < 0.01). The average length of open period was significantly shorter in autumn and summer calvers compared to those calved in spring and winter (P < 0.05) during long days. The humidity rate was negatively correlated with both calving to first oestrus interval and open period (P < 0.05). In conclusion, exposure to high environmental temperatures around 20 Â°C exerted no suppressive influence on ovarian activity in Anatolian buffaloes. Although humidity rate (P < 0.05) and ambient temperature (P < 0.01) was found to be correlated with the duration of postpartum period, day length might be the main factor regulating reproductive biorhythm and postpartum events in Anatolian buffalo cows.

AB  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharamcokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.

AB  - Background: The effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the developing fetal central nervous system (CNS) and related functional outcomes in infancy remain unexplored. Sleep and wake states of newborns provide a tool for assessing the functional integrity of the CNS. Objective: We investigated whether CNS integrity in newborns, measured with sleep recordings, was associated with maternal concentrations of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA. Design: Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations were measured in 17 women at parturition. On postpartum day 1 (P1) and day 2 (P2), a pressure-sensitive pad under the infants' bedding recorded body movements and respiratory patterns to measure sleep and wake states. Results: Maternal plasma phospholipid DHA ranged from 1.91% to 4.5% by wt of total fatty acids. On the basis of previously published data and the median DHA concentration, the women were divided into 2 groups: high DHA (>3.0% by wt of total fatty acids) and low DHA (â¤3.0% by wt of total fatty acids). Infants of high-DHA mothers had a significantly lower ratio of active sleep (AS) to quiet sleep (QS) and less AS than did infants of low-DHA mothers. Furthermore, the former infants had less sleep-wake transition and more wakefulness on P2. Correlations of maternal DHA status with infant sleep states were consistent with these data. Also, the ratio of maternal n-6 to n-3 fatty acids on P1 was inversely associated with QS and positively associated with arousals in QS. On P2, maternal n-6:n-3 was positively associated with AS, sleep-wake transition, and AS:QS. Conclusion: The sleep patterns of infants born to mothers with higher plasma phospholipid DHA suggest greater CNS maturity.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate whether a history of maternal tobacco smoking affected the maturation of arousal responses and whether sleeping position and infant age alters these relations. Design: Healthy term infants (13 born to mothers who did not smoke and 11 to mothers who smoked during pregnancy) were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) two to three weeks after birth, (b) two to three months after birth, and (c) five to six months after birth. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold in response to air jet stimulation were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) when infants slept both prone and supine. Results: Maternal smoking significantly elevated arousal threshold in QS when infants slept supine at 2-3 months of age (p<0.05). Infants of smoking mothers also had fewer spontaneous arousals from QS at 2-3 months in both prone (p<0.05) and supine (p<0.001) sleeping positions. In infants of non-smoking mothers, arousal thresholds were elevated in the prone position in AS at 2-3 months (p<0.01) and QS at 2-3 weeks (p<0.05) and 2-3 months (p<0.001). Conclusions: Maternal tobacco smoking significantly impairs both stimulus induced and spontaneous arousal from QS when infants sleep in the supine position, at the age when the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome is highest.

AB  - Purpose: Our aim was to monitor the use of gabapentin (GBP) by patients prescribed this drug by primary care physicians in England soon after it was marketed in the United Kingdom. Methods: A noninterventional observational cohort study was conducted by using the technique of prescription-event monitoring. Patients were identified from dispensed National Health Service prescriptions. Outcome data were obtained from questionnaires sent to the doctor â¼6 months after the initial prescription. These data included demographic information, events reported since starting GBP, and reason for stopping the drug, if it was stopped. Incidence rates were calculated for given periods for all events reported. Additional information was requested for selected events of medical interest, including pregnancies. Standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated. Results: The cohort comprised 3,100 patients, of whom 136 (4%) were children. The median duration of treatment was 8.1 months. The most frequently reported adverse events reported during the first month of treatment, drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, and malaise/lassitude, also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing GBP and reported as suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). There were no congenital anomalies in the 11 babies born to women who used GBP during the first trimester of pregnancy. Crude mortality rate was 5 times that in general population but similar to that in other published studies. Conclusions: Neurologic-related events were the most frequently reported adverse events. They also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing treatment and reported as suspected ADRs. No previously unrecognised adverse events were detected in this large cohort of patients who were among the first treated with gabapentin in England.

AB  - Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease. Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include Î²-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

AB  - To evaluate risk factors for a first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) in adults (â¥15 years), we performed a multicenter, case-control study involving eleven first-referral neurological departments in north-western Italy. The study enrolled 278 patients with a first GTCS, and 556 age- and sex-matched hospital controls. Cases and controls were interviewed through a questionnaire (inter-rater and index-proxy agreement varied between 75% and 100% for the different questions). Risk factors significantly associated with a first GTCS were: severe head trauma (odds ratio 9.9; 95% confidence limits 2.0-67.1), siblings with seizures (5.7; 1.7-21.4), alcohol intake >50 grams/day (4.9; 3.1-7.9), history of stroke (3.8; 1.8-8.0), complications of delivery (2.7; 1.5-5.1), other relatives with seizures (2.4; 1.3-4.6), sleep deprivation (2.4; 1.4-4.1), low gestational age (1.9; 1.1-3.4), mild-moderate head trauma (1.8; 1.2-3.0), and low birth weight (1.6; 1.0-2.7). Genetic and late acquired factors and life habits are major risk factors for a first GTCS in adults, while pre- and perinatal events play only a minor role.

AB  - Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common and have been treated with apparent success with antimicrobials for many years. However, there is a paucity of placebo-controlled clinical trials. Aim: To measure the symptomatic and bacteriological short-term effect of nitrofurantoin treatment versus placebo, in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in adult non-pregnant women. Design of study: Randomised placebo-controlled trial in general practice. Setting: Non-pregnant women, aged between 15 and 54 years old, consulting a general practitioner for symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated lower UTI and with pyuria (positive for leucocyte esterase test). Method: A dipslide was inoculated in first-void midstream urine and sent for examination. The patients were randomised to receive nitrofurantoin 100 mg or placebo four times daily for three days. After three, seven, and 14 days a new dipslide was inoculated and symptoms of UTI were checked for the disappearance or improvement of symptoms and bacteriuria. Results: Of 166 women consulting with symptoms suggestive for UTI, 78 had pyuria and agreed to participate in the study (the clinically suspected UTI group); of these, 40 received nitrofurantoin and 38 received placebo. The result for combined symptomatic improvement and cure after three days was 27/35 in the nitrofurantoin group and 19/35 in the placebo group (c2 with Yates' correction P = 0.08; number needed to treat [NNT] = 4.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.3 to 79). After seven days, combined improvement and cure was observed in 30/34 and 17/33 respectively (P = 0.003, NNT = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.8 to 6.0). At inclusion, 56 women had bacteriuria of â¥105 CFU/ml (the bacteriologically proven UTI group). Of these, 29 received nitrofurantoin and 27 received placebo. After three days the bacteriological cure was 21/26 in the treatment group, compared with 5/25 in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001; NNT = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2 to 2.6). After seven days the bacteriological cure rate was 17/23 in the intervention group and 9/22 in the placebo group (P = 0.05, NNT = 3, 95% CI = 1.7 to 17). Conclusion: In women with bacteriologically proven UTI, nitrofurantoin was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving bacteriological cure and symptomatic relief in just three days; this was still present after seven days. In patients with clinically suspected UTI the symptomatic effect was statistically significant after seven days; after three days there was a trend towards significance.

AB  - Although infants have been noted to have greater relative right or left frontal EEG as early as the neonatal period, other ways in which these newborns differ have not been reported. In this study, 48 newborns were divided on the basis of greater relative right versus greater relative left frontal EEG to determine whether these groups differed in other ways at the neonatal period including behavior, physiology, and biochemistry. We also were interested in whether these EEG patterns were related to any prenatal maternal variables including mood states (depression, anxiety, anger) and biochemistry as well as fetal activity. The greater relative right frontal EEG newborns had mothers with lower prenatal and postnatal serotonin and higher postnatal cortisol levels. The mothers of the greater relative right frontal EEG newborns also had greater relative right frontal EEG activation and lower vagal tone. The greater relative right frontal EEG newborns themselves had elevated cortisol levels, showed a greater number of state changes during sleep/ wake behavior observations, and performed less optimally on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment (T. B. Brazelton, 1973) including the habituation, motor, range of state, excitability, and depressive symptoms scales. These data suggest that greater relative right frontal EEG newborns may be at greater risk for developmental problems than those with greater relative left frontal EEG activation. In addition, a discriminant function analysis correctly classified 67% of the newborns' EEGs by prenatal maternal variables, suggesting that these might be used to target pregnant women for prenatal intervention.

AB  - Serotonin (5-HT) and glutamate are concerned with the input pathways to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a center of biological rhythms in mammals. Arg-vasopressin (AVP) is one of the output paths from the SCN to other brain areas. Functional relations of 5-HT on glutamate release, which stimulates AVP release, were therefore analyzed in an SCN slice culture using a glutamate biosensor. Spontaneous release of glutamate from the SCN culture was higher during the light period than the dark period. The 5-HT-stimulated increase in glutamate release was also larger at 0900h than at 2000h. In addition, glutamate, but not 5-HT, increased the AVP release. These findings suggest the possibility that the 5-HT has no direct facilitatory functions in AVP release via liberation of glutamate from the SCN. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that prenatal hypoxia in rats might lead to consistent changes in the entrainment of the circadian clock by light. Pregnant female rats were placed in a chamber provided with hypoxic gas (10% O2-90% N2) at gestational day 5 and returned to normoxia before delivery. Once adult, rats born to hypoxic mothers had significant alterations in their circadian rhythm of locomotor activity (recorded in freely accessible running wheels). Under a regular 12/12 light/dark (LD) cycle, they showed a phase advance of their rhythm of activity (mean phase advance of 87 min) and were less active than control rats. After an abrupt 6 h phase delay in the LD cycle, rats from the prenatal hypoxic group (PNH) took significantly more time to resynchronise to the new LD cycle compared to controls (+53%; 6.0 Â± 1.5 vs. 9.2 Â± 0.5 days respectively). Under constant darkness, PNH and control rats had a similar period of activity (24.27 Â± 0.20 vs. 24.40 Â± 0.13) but the response of PNH rats to a light pulse in the early subjective night was less marked than that of control rats (101 Â± 9 vs. 158 Â± 13 min). When submitted to acute restraint stress, PNH rats had a prolonged secretion of corticosterone compared to controls. These results indicate that prenatal hypoxia is a factor that has long lasting consequences for the functional output of the biological clock and the hormonal response to stress.

AB  - TT-235 is a potent oxytocin (OT) antagonist that blocks the action of OT at the receptor level. Previous studies have shown that pregnant baboons demonstrate nocturnal uterine contractions induced by OT as they near delivery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in plasma OT levels following uterine contraction blockage with TT-235. A tethered pregnant baboon model in its last trimester of pregnancy was used. Three blocks of arterial blood samples, immediately before, plus 1 h and plus 2 h following an OT antagonist injection, were collected once nocturnal uterine contractions were detected. Each block consisted of a continuous 10 min withdrawal with 10 samples per block (1 ml/min). A TT-235 dosage of 300 Î¼g/kg and saline for control were utilized. Uterine activities were monitored as pressure changes in the amniotic fluid, and the frequency and mean amplitude of contractile activity per 10 min intervals were expressed as contractile force. Plasma OT levels were determined by a radioimmunoassay following plasma extraction with petroleum ether. The contractile force was decreased by 77% (p < 0.05) within 2 h after TT-235 administration while it increased 23% following saline infusion. Plasma OT levels were unchanged following saline infusion while they increased 82% (p < 0.05) 2 h after the administration of TT-235. If a positive feedback existed between uterine contractions and OT release, one would expect plasma OT levels to be decreased with contractile activity following TT-235 infusion. Since this is not the case in the present study, the data suggest that there is either a negative feedback or an independent relationship between nocturnal uterine contractions and OT release.

AB  - We established the procedures for cryopreservation and primary culture of fetal cerebral neurons of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Three developmental stages of fetuses (80, 93, and 102 days of gestation) were compared to determine the optimal stage of cerebrum development for primary culture. Among the three fetuses, the 80-day-old fetus produced the most process-rich neurons with the highest survival. The number of total recovery cells from the cryopreserved 80-day-old fetus corresponded to 83.4% of that from fresh tissue. Besides, synchronous oscillations of intracellular calcium were first seen in primate cerebral neurons, which suggested the formation of synapse-networks. Cultured neurons expressed synaptophysin protein. Successful cryopreservation and subsequent cell culture of primate neurons would be useful tools for neuroscience research with species specificity.

AB  - A complete inventory of pituitary trophic responses depends on precise estimates of mitotic activity and apoptotic events, and accurate characterization and quantification of pituitary cell subtypes irrespective of previous and current physiological demand. For a discrete structure that has been so extensively studied, it is disappointing but perhaps not surprising that none of these measures is available and therefore that the relative contributions to changes in the proportions of pituitary cellular subpopulations of trophic activity, differentiation of pluripotent cells and variations in the secretory profiles of apparently committed cells remain almost impossible to determine. To fully appreciate the extent of this dilemma, it should be remembered that conservative estimates of the proportion of corticotrophs in the rat anterior pituitary under basal conditions vary over twofold and that it is still not clear whether the apparent threefold increase in mammotrophs during pregnancy is the result of maturation of uncommitted cells, transdifferentiation of other cells such as somatotrophs, cell division, or a mixture of all three. Equally, while it has been known for some time that adrenalectomy results in a transient increase in anterior pituitary mitotic activity and appropriately timed supraphysiological glucocorticoid replacement with a wave of apoptosis, the precise identity of the cells involved in both of these responses is open to question. Thus, although many of the physiological stimuli associated with apparent changes in the proportions of pituitary cellular subpopulations are known, the precise mechanism of the changes and the consequences of the same remain obscure. This review summarizes the limited literature on pituitary trophic activity and asks what, if anything, analysis of pituitary trophic activity using current technology can tell us.

AB  - The cause of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is unknown, but a genetic etiology is strongly suspected. We report a 25-year-old woman with CCHS (no Hirschsprung's disease) who gave birth to a daughter who also has CCHS. This suggests a dominant mode of inheritance for CCHS in this family. Pregnancy can be associated with physiologic challenges in CCHS. The increase in endogenous progesterone may stimulate breathing and may possibly improve symptoms of hypoventilation. Although this patient did not have any worsening in symptoms, her hyperoxic hypercapnic rebreathing ventilatory response was not different when pregnant versus when not pregnant. Ventilatory support for the patient was successfully managed with diaphragm pacing throughout the pregnancy without the need to adjust settings, despite the enlarged abdomen during pregnancy. We conclude that CCHS may be an inherited disorder. Increased endogenous progesterone during pregnancy has no effect on the ventilatory response, and diaphragm pacing can successfully provide adequate ventilation throughout pregnancy.

AB  - The questions addressed in this study were whether prenatal depression effects on the foetus and neonate varied by ethnicity and socio-economic status. Eighty-six depressed pregnant women were compared by ethnic group, Hispanic and African-American, and by socio-economic status (upper/lower) on prenatal and neonatal outcome variables. The Hispanic mothers were older, had a higher SES and had higher prenatal norepinephrine levels. Their foetuses were also more active. At the neonatal period they had higher anger scores, but also higher serotonin levels, and their infants had higher dopamine and lower cortisol levels and they spent less time in deep and indeterminate sleep. The comparison by middle/lower socio-economic status revealed that the middle SES group was older, had more social support and showed less depressed affect but had higher norepiephrine levels prenatally. At the postnatal period the middle SES mothers had lower depression, anxiety and anger scores and lower norepinephrine levels. Their infants also had lower norepinephrine levels, fewer postnatal complications and were less excitable on the Neonatal Behaviour Assessment Scale.

AB  - Background: This paper is part of a prospective, epidemiologic study concerning postpartum depression (PPD). The women were first examined during pregnancy; after delivery they were seen with their infants at 3 and 18 months. The present study focuses on the 3-months-postpartum results. Methods: A sample of 570 women and their infants were examined 3 months after delivery. Using the EPDS (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Cox et al., 1987. Br. J. Psychiatry 150:782-786), 10.2% of these new mothers presented PPD. The focus of the study concerned the effects of this neurotic disorder on the mother, the infant and on the mother-infant relationship. Results: The deleterious effects concerning the infant were functional disorders such as eating or sleeping difficulties. The 'depressed' dyads presented less vocal and visual communications, less corporal interactions and less smiling. Conditions surrounding delivery and tiredness at 3 months are linked to difficulties in mother-infant relationship for the non-depressed mothers. Logistic models showed that primiparous PPD mothers have difficulties bathing their infants, whereas multiparous PPD mothers are more tired. Limitation: This study did not take into account either protective factors or the effects of the infant himself. Clinical relevance: Knowledge of the mothers' and infants' difficulties may help caregivers to detect these at-risk dyads and initiate therapeutic measures. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In order to assess the specific sympathetic reactivity in premature infants at term, we designed a study to evaluate the peripheral vasomotor response of such infants when exposed to auditory challenges. Testing was performed in 29 premature neonates at term in both quiet and active sleep during a morning session. Two types of noises were used (click and continuous tones) at three frequencies (250, 1,000 and 6,000 Hz) and at three intensities (60, 85 and 110 dBA). Vasomotor response was studied by analyzing with MathlabÂ® software the variability of the plethysmographic wave of the oxymetric pulse. No behavioral awakening was observed in response to any stimulation. When a tachycardia or a bradycardia reaction to the stimuli was observed, all neonates responded with a vasoconstriction. The global mean of the vasoconstrictive response was 18.45%. The overall ANOVA on the vasomotor response revealed significant effects for sleep stages (t: 1.98; p < 0.05), for frequency (t: 3.3; p < 0.001) and for intensity of noise (t: 3.01; p < 0.03) but no significant response with heart rate variability. From these results, we could conclude that the assessment of the vasomotor response is a very sensitive procedure to determine the reactivity of the autonomic nervous system in neonates, and could be used to study such vegetative responses in other stressful situations with good accuracy.

AB  - To understand the sleep-wake behaviours from the fifth pre-partum week to the 15th post-partum week by the number of actigraphic activities and sleep logs were evaluated in 10 women. It was found that total sleep time shortened, sleep efficiency decreased, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) increased in the weeks immediately after delivery. Compared with late pregnancy, total sleep time and sleep efficiency deteriorated significantly from the delivery week to the 12th post-partum week and there was a longer period of WASO until the 11th postpartum week. The after-delivery sleep parameters estimated by the actigraph were worse than those estimated from sleep logs.

AB  - Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a crucial cytokine for establishing pregnancy. It has been demonstrated previously in rats that sleep increases during early pregnancy and that centrally administered GM-CSF promotes both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Therefore, whether GM-CSF is involved in pregnancy-enhanced sleep was investigated using the anti-GM-CSF antibody. Female rats received an intracerebroventricular infusion of either anti-GM-CSF or control IgG (10 Î¼g each) for four nights from the first day of pregnancy (PD1-PD4). Although sleep amounts on PD1 were not affected, anti-GM-CSF decreased non-REM and REM sleep significantly during PD2-PD4 compared with the control baseline of the IgG group. The results demonstrated that anti-GM-CSF treatment suppresses pregnancy-enhanced sleep, suggesting that GM-CSF contributes to sleep regulation during pregnancy.

AB  - To determine the influence of diurnal variation in maternal movements (MM) on fetal heart rate (FHR) accelerations, 24-hour maternal heart rates (MHR), MM and FHR recordings were made simultaneously on nine healthy pregnant women at 36-39 weeks of gestation. Correlations between the diurnal variations in maternal factors and FHR parameters; that is, baseline FHR, amplitude, duration and hourly percentage of time spent in accelerations, were examined. Only a few cases showed a significant correlation between acceleration parameters and the diurnal variation of MHR or MM, while most cases indicated a high correlation between the diurnal variation in baseline FHR and that of maternal factors. In conclusion, the occurrence and form of accelerations might be independent of maternal activity.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an actigraph can be a tool for measuring fetal movements in sheep. Actiwatchesâ¢ were placed on a fetal forelimb and the maternal uterine wall in near-term pregnant sheep. No significant correlation was found between fetal and maternal activity counts for periods of 1 min. The patterns of fetal activity counts were characterized by ultradian rhythms, with bursts of activity every 20-30 min; however, there was no evidence of diurnal changes in fetal activity counts. The results suggest that fetal movements can be measured by using an actigraph in chronically prepared fetal sheep.

AB  - The largest number of antidepressant treatment trials in premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) have been conducted with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine and other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) clearly reduce premenstrual emotional and physical symptoms and improve premenstrual psychosocial functioning. Fluoxetine was the first SSRI to be approved by the FDA as a treatment for the emotional and physical symptoms of PMDD. Fluoxetine 20 mg has been reported to be effective for emotional and physical premenstrual symptoms with continuous daily dosing (every day of the menstrual cycle) and with luteal phase daily dosing (from ovulation to menses). In addition, premenstrual emotional symptoms have been reported to improve with fluoxetine 10 mg in luteal phase daily dosing and with 90 mg 2 and 1 weeks prior to menses. Fluoxetine is generally a well-tolerated treatment for PMDD and discontinuation effects have not been reported with intermittent dosing regimens.

AB  - Hypocapnia is neither a benign clinical entity nor an epiphenomenon. On the contrary, increasing evidence suggests that hypocapnia appears to induce substantial adverse physiological and medical effects. Thus, the decision to institute hypocapnia for therapeutic purposes should be undertaken only after careful consideration of the risks and benefits and should in general be limited to emergency management of life-threatening increases in intracranial pressure or pulmonary-vascular resistance. The risk of accidental hypocapnia should be recognized and measures taken to prevent it. Prophylactic induction of hypocapnia currently has no clinical role.

AB  - Tidal fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE NO) changes were investigated in healthy, unsedated infants with or without prenatal tobacco exposure. Tidal flow (VÌ), FE NO, and CO 2 were measured in 20 healthy, unsedated infants [age: 25-58 days, length: 56.5 Â± 2.5 (SE) cm]. NO output (VÌNO) was calculated (VÌNO = FE NO Ã VÌ). Two approaches were used to investigate within-breath changes of FE NO and VÌNO. First, we identified phases II and III from the expiratory capnogram. Second, we divided expiration into time-based quartiles. Tidal FE NO (range: 14.5 Â± 1.6 to 17.6 Â± 2.1 parts/billion: quartile 4 and phase II, respectively) was not different between portions and exhibited significant negative VÌ dependence. VÌNO was significantly dependent on the expiratory portion, with quartile 4 being significantly lower than the remaining expiratory portions. Infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke (n = 7) exhibited significantly lower FE NO and VÌNO compared with nonexposed (n = 13) infants. We conclude that tidal FE NO is VÌ dependent and that VÌNO may be a more suitable outcome parameter in variable VÌ conditions. Prenatal tobacco exposure resulted in a decreased FE NO and VÌNO in infants.

AB  - Stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is known to induce changes in arousal and postural/locomotor states. Previously, PPN stimulation was reported to induce prolonged responses (PRs) in extracellularly recorded PnC neurons in the decerebrate cat. The present study used intracellular recordings in semihorizontal slices from rat brain stem (postnatal days 12-21) to determine responses in PnC neurons following PPN stimulation. Two-thirds (65%) of PnC neurons showed PRs after PPN stimulation. PnC neurons with PRs had higher amplitude afterhyperpolarizations (AHP) than non-PR (NPR) neurons. Both PR and NPR neurons were of mixed cell types characterized by "A" and/or "LTS," or neither of these types of currents. PnC cells showed decreased AHP duration with age, due mostly to decreased AHP duration in NPR cells. The longest mean duration PRs were induced by stimulation at 60 and 90 Hz compared with 10 or 30 Hz. Maximal firing rates in PnC cells during PRs were induced by PPN stimulation at 60 Hz compared with 10, 30, or 90 Hz. BaCl 2 superfusion blocked PPN stimulation-induced PRs, suggesting that PRs may be mediated by blockade of potassium channels, in keeping with increased input resistance observed during PRs. Depolarizing pulses failed to elicit, and hyperpolarizing pulses failed to reset, PPN stimulation-induced PRs, suggesting that PRs may not be plateau potentials. Pharmacological testing revealed that nifedipine superfusion failed to block PPN stimulation-induced PRs; i.e., PRs may not be calcium channel-dependent. The muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol induced depolarization in most PR neurons tested, and the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine reduced or blocked PPN stimulation-induced PRs in some PnC neurons, suggesting that some PRs may be due to muscarinic receptor activation. The nonspecific ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid failed to block PPN stimulation-induced PRs, as did the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (R, S)-Î±methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, suggesting that PRs may not be mediated by glutamate receptors. These findings suggest that PPN stimulation-induced PRs may be due to increased excitability following closing of muscarinic receptor-sensitive potassium channels, allowing PnC neurons to respond to a transient, frequency-dependent depolarization with long-lasting stable states. PPN stimulation appears to induce PRs using parameters known best to induce locomotion. This mechanism may be related to switching from one state to another (e.g., locomotion vs. standing or sitting, waking vs. non-REM sleep or REM sleep).

AB  - Thalidomide was first introduced to the market in Germany under the brand name of Contergan in 1956, as a "non-barbiturate hypnotic", advocated to ensure a good night's sleep and to prevent morning sickness in pregnancy. It was advertised for its prompt action, lack of hangover, and apparent safety. It has been banned from the market since 1963 after it caused the worldwide teratogenic disaster: babies exposed to thalidomide in utero during the first 34-50 days of pregnancy were born with severe life-threatening birth defects. Despite its unfortunate history, thalidomide has attracted scientific interest again because of its recently discovered action against inflammatory diseases and cancer. Its broad range of biological activities stems from its ability to moderate cytokine action in cancer and inflammatory diseases. Early studies examined its anxiolytic, mild hypnotic, antiemetic, and adjuvant analgesic properties. Subsequently, thalidomide was found to be highly effective in managing the cutaneous manifestations of leprosy, being superior to Aspirin in controlling leprosy-associated fever. Recent research has shown promising results with thalidomide in patients with myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, a variety of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and progressive body weight loss related to advanced cancer and AIDS. Here we review the history of its development, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, biologic effects, and the results of clinical trials conducted thus far. Further research in this field should be directed towards better understanding of thalidomide metabolism, its mechanism of action, and the development of less toxic and more active analogs.

AB  - It has been proposed that prostaglandin (PG) D2 induces physiological sleep in mammals by acting on sleep centers located in the anterior hypothalamus. In fetal sheep, definitive rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement sleep states appear at â¼125 d gestation (term is â¼147 d). In adult animals, PGD synthase (PGDS) (functionally and structurally homologous to Î²-trace protein) is secreted into CSF with a circadian pattern, with the highest concentrations present during sleep. In this study we show that PGDS/Î²-trace protein is present in fetal sheep CSF at 125 and 135 d gestation but not at 90 d gestation. SeCl4, a specific inhibitor of PGDS, was given to unanesthetized fetal sheep (130-140 d gestation) by intracere-broventricular infusion at a dose of 25, 100, 500, or 1000 pmol/min for 4 hr. Artificial CSF was infused in control experiments. Arousal behavior, defined as the presence of nuchal muscle electromyogram activity, electro-ocular activity, and breathing movements during low-amplitude electrocortical activity, increased from 3.8 Â± 1 min/hr to 6.6 = 0.5 and 7.0 Â± 0.3 min/hr at doses of 100 and 500 pmol/min, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). SeCl4 at 25 and 1000 pmol/min had no significant effect on arousal activity. Infusion of PGD2 at 500 pmol/min intracere-broventricularly for 4 hr decreased the incidence of arousal from 3.8 Â± 0.5 min/hr to 0.7 Â± 0.3 min/hr (p &lt; 0.05). When 500 pmol/min PGD2 was infused immediately after a 4 hr infusion of SeCl4 (500 pmol/min), the SeCl4-induced increase in arousal behavior was abolished. Together, the presence of PGDS/Î²trace protein in fetal CSF in late gestation and the effects of SeCl4 in increasing the incidence of arousal-like behavior suggest that PGD2 has a role in the induction and maintenance of prenatal sleep.

AB  - Programmed cell death or apoptosis plays a central role during the development of the brain, but can also be activated by hypoxic/ischemic insult. The purpose of the present study was to determine the regional distribution of apoptotic cells in the preterm and near term ovine fetal brain and thus in relation to the maturation of neurobehavioural activity, and the effect of intermittent umbilical cord occlusion (UCO), which might then contribute to adverse neurodevelopment. Fetal sheep (control and experimental groups at 0.75 and 0.90 of gestation) were studied over 4 days with UCOs performed in the experimental group animals by complete inflation of an occluder cuff for 90 s every 30 min for 3 to 5 h each day. Animals were then euthanized and the fetal brain perfusion-fixed and prepared for subsequent histology and apoptosis staining using the TUNEL assay method. The number of TUNEL positive cells for both the preterm and near term control group animals was low but with a significant regional hierarchy whereby values were higher in the cerebellar peduncle and cortex and lower in the cortical grey and white matter, hippocampus, and pons. While the apoptotic indices (expressed as TUNEL positive cells/1000 cells or high powered field) for most brain regions were not significantly changed between the preterm and near term control group animals, that for the hippocampus and pons were increased â¼5- and 4-fold, respectively, (both P<0.05), in the near term animals. Intermittent UCO with severe but limited hypoxemia and no cumulative acidosis to ensure longer term survival, had no significant effect on apoptotic indices in the brains of either the preterm or near term animals, although hippocampal values for both occlusion groups were increased â¼2-3-fold. Levels of apoptosis noted for the ovine fetal brain at 0.75 to 0.90 of gestation are thus low and likely approaching the basal levels of later life, but there are regional differences and changes over this period although little change in response to intermittent cord occlusion as studied, with implications for behavioural state activity and antenatal hypoxic insults in the brain's development.

AB  - Many changes in the respiratory system occur during pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, which can alter respiratory function during sleep, increasing the incidence and severity of sleep disordered breathing. These changes include increased ventilatory drive and metabolic rate, reduced functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients, and changes in upper airway patency. The clinical importance of these changes is indicated by the increased incidence of snoring during pregnancy, which is likely also to reflect an increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome. For the respiratory physician asked to review a pregnant patient, the possibility of sleep disordered breathing should always be considered. This review first examines the normal physiological changes of pregnancy and their relationship to sleep disordered breathing, and then summarises the current knowledge of sleep disordered breathing in pregnancy.

AB  - One hundred and sixty-six women were classified as experiencing high or low anger during the second trimester of pregnancy. The high-anger women also had high scores on depression and anxiety scales. In a follow-up across pregnancy, the fetuses of the high-anger women were noted to be more active and to experience growth delays. The high-anger mothers' high prenatal cortisol and adrenaline and low dopamine and serotonin levels were mimicked by their neonates' high cortisol and low dopamine levels. The high-anger mothers and infants were also similar on their relative right frontal EEG activation and their low vagal tone. Finally, the newborns of high-anger mothers had disorganised sleep patterns (greater indeterminate sleep and more state changes) and less optimal performance on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (orientation, motor maturity and depression). These data highlight the need for prenatal intervention for elevated angry mood during pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Children born of mothers who abused illegal substances during pregnancy can present with signs and symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome, including irritability, jitteriness, diarrhoea. Usually these symptoms appear from a few hours up to a few days after birth. It is frequently followed by a post-withdrawal period of several weeks duration with crying, excitability, sleep irregularities and feeding difficulties. The purpose is to report the presence of nystagmus in infants born from drug-addicted mothers. Methods: Five children born from drug-addicted mothers were examined. Results: Three children (case 1-3) presented with congenital horizontal pendular nystagmus. Two other children (case 4-5) presented with a peculiar transient horizontal nystagmus, lasting 6 months and 7 months respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, transient horizontal pendular nystagmus has never been reported in the literature. It was detected in two children who suffered from a post-natal withdrawal syndrome necessitating substitution therapy, including morphine. This may represent a form of morphine midbrain toxicity.

AB  - By investigating 336 gynaecological patients we wanted to explore the question if there is any relationship between gynaecological and sexual problems. The women were investigated by a long structured biographic interview as well as questionnaires. Both the interview and the questionnaires focussed on the topics relationship, love and sexuality. The most enriching materials we got were the very intimate life-stories of these women. In addition to the clinical results we found out that 30% of our patients suffered from different sexual problems. There were no particular correlations between specific gynaecological and specific sexual problems. Nevertheless, there was high prevelance in sexual problems in women with chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis and adhesions. Also those women who suffered from complications during pregnancy suffered significantly more from sexual problems than the other women. Those who had experienced sexual violence complained twice as much as others of sexual problems. A highly significant result was that those women who suffered from gynaecological as well as sexual problems much more also suffered from psychosomatic problems such as gastrointestinal, anxiety, eating, body-image, depressive and sleeping disorders. Conclusion: There is a compelling need to talk about sexuality in the gynaecological field.

AB  - Objective: Compare responses of nonexposed and drug-exposed newborns to auditory, tactile, visual, and vestibular (ATVV) intervention. Study design: Prospective design with random assignment of drug-exposed (N=45) and nonexposed (N=72) newborns to control and experimental groups. Methods: Experimentals received 15 minutes of ATVV twice after birth. Infant behavioral state (IBS) and pulse rate (PR) were measured. Results: The nonexposed and drug-exposed control groups (p=0.021) differed on the distribution of IBS yet no differences were noted between the two experimental groups. Nonexposed and drug-exposed experimentals experienced more alertness and less quiet sleep than controls (p<0.05). PR and IBS were significantly correlated for all but the drug-exposed control group (nonexposed control, r=0.938, p=0.006; nonexposed experimental, r=0.979, p=0.001; drug-exposed experimental, r=0.955, p=0.003). Within the combined (control + experimental) drug-specific groups, only polydrug-exposed infants demonstrated such a correlation (r=0.584, p=0.046). A significant correlation was also identified within the cocaine-exposed group for the experimentals only (r=0.992, p<0.001). Conclusion: The ATVV promoted normal physiologic and behavioral function.

AB  - About a billion of Moslem fast every year during the holy month of Ramadan. This ritual consists in abstaining from drinking and eating from sunrise to sunset. The length of the fast varies 10 to 18 hours and is function of the geographical location and the season in which it takes place. The brutal change of the life style and the necessity to feed itself at night entail behavioral modifications and diminish vigilance, and can modify eating habits and the balance of the diet as well as biologic variations among healthy individuals. Studies bringing back these effects remain rare. Inspite of the temporary exonerations granted by the religion to children, pregnant women, travellers and sick people some still prefer to fast. It is important that the doctors caring for Moslem patients become aware of modifications misled by this practice and means to correct them. Diabetic patients and especially type 1, who fast, expose themselves to risks of hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis. Fasting is allowed for type 2 diabetics whose diabetes is well under control and without degenerative complications whereas it is contraindicated in type 1 diabetics and, in all insulin-treated patients. Nevertheless, when these patients are fasting during the Ramadan, it is necessary to counsel an increased glucose monitoring and an adaptation of the therapeutic remedy. Diabetics will be advised on a sufficient hydration, a well balanced nutrition in 2 or 3 meals, avoiding to many carbohydrates and especially sweets and correct amount of sleep. In the case of oral treatment, biguanids are indicated. If the patient is on oral hypoglycaemic agents, we'll choose those with a short action and give 2/3 of the dose on the evening. In the case of insulin, 2 injections (intermediate + regular or analogs) seem suitable, giving 2/3 of the dose in the evening. Analogs are interesting because the better metabolic control and less hypoglycaemia.

AB  - Background: Nocturnal leg cramps are common and distressing. The only treatment of proven effectiveness is quinine, but this has a number of side effects. Magnesium salts have been shown to reduce leg cramp distress in pregnancy. This study tests whether magnesium citrate is effective in the treatment of leg cramps in non-pregnant individuals by conducting in a randomised, double-blind, cross-over placebo-controlled trial. Material/Methods: Volunteers suffering regular leg cramps were recruited. Magnesium citrate equivalent to 300 mg magnesium and matching placebo were given for 6 weeks each. The number of cramps recorded in the cramp diary during the final 4 weeks of magnesium and placebo treatment, severity and duration of cramps and the participants' subjective assessment of effectiveness were analysed. Results: In subjects who started with placebo (n=29) the median (95% CI) number of cramps was 9 (6- 17) on placebo and 5 (4-8) on magnesium. For the group starting with magnesium (n = 17) the median no of cramps was 9 (5-13) on magnesium and 8 (4-14) on placebo. There was no significant carry-over effect (p=0.88), but a highly significant period effect (p=0.008). There was a trend towards less cramps on magnesium (p=0.07). There was no difference in cramp severity and duration between the groups. Significantly more subjects thought that the treatment had helped after magnesium than after placebo 36 (78%) and 25 (54%) respectively, (p=0.03). Diarrhoea was recorded as a side effect of magnesium. Conclusion; The results suggest that magnesium may be effective in treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. Further evaluation is recommended.

AB  - End-organ damage associated with hypertension is more closely related to ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) than clinic or casual blood pressure measurements. ABP measurements give better prediction of clinical outcome than clinic or casual blood pressure measurements. The technique of ABP monitoring (ABPM) is specialised; validated monitors and appropriate quality control measures should be used. Interpretation of ABP profile should include mean daytime, night-time (sleep) and 24-hour measurements, and consideration of diary information and time of drug treatment. Reports may also include ABP "loads" (percentage area under the blood pressure curve above set limits) for daytime and night-time periods. Normal blood pressure values for adults are <135/85 mmHg for daytime, <120/75 mmHg for night-time, and <130/80 mmHg for 24 hours. ABPM is indicated to exclude "white coat" hypertension and has a role in assessing apparent drug-resistant hypertension, symptomatic hypotension or hypertension, in the elderly, in hypertension in pregnancy, and to assess adequacy of control in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. White coat hypertension requires continued surveillance; patients who display this phenomenon may, in time, develop established hypertension. Appropriate use of ABPM may result in cost savings. Randomised controlled trials comparing management based on clinic or casual versus ABP measurements are needed.

AB  - Assessment of seasonal variations in expression of brain neuropeptide mRNA is complicated by concurrent circadian variations. Because entrainment of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) based rhythms differs in long versus short day lengths, valid seasonal comparisons must be made at equivalent circadian phases. We used a novel experimental design which permitted sampling at identical circadian phases of animals exhibiting opposite seasonal reproductive responses to the same intermediate day length. This allowed us to test whether seasonal changes in arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) mRNA expression in the SCN occur in the absence of the pineal gland. Juvenile Siberian hamsters were gestated and maintained postnatally in either a long photoperiod (16 h light/day) or short photoperiod (10 h light/day). At the time of weaning (18 days of age), the hamsters were pinealectomized and either transferred to a new photoperiod (10-, 16- or 14-h light/day) or left in the original photoperiod. Hamsters from 10L had substantially smaller and lighter testes than those from 16L. If photoperiodic modulation of AVP and VIP mRNA expression occurs in the absence of the pineal, then transfer of pinealectomized hamsters from a longer (16L) or shorter (10L) photoperiod to an intermediate photoperiod (14L) should result in a differential response with respect to SCN AVP and VIP mRNA expression but not testis size. When sampled at an identical circadian phase (3 h after lights on) in 14L there was no difference in the expression of AVP or VIP mRNA in the SCN between animals previously housed in long versus short day lengths. In contrast to a previous study that did not carefully control for circadian phase, the present findings suggest that seasonal photoperiodic control of SCN neuropeptide mRNA expression depends upon the pineal gland. In addition, the present findings demonstrate a significant, negative correlation between AVP mRNA expression in the SCN and the length of the daily active phase (alpha).

AB  - Circadian rhythmicity in mammals is under the control of a molecular pacemaker constituted of clock gene products organized in transcriptional autoregulatory loops. Phase resetting of the clock in response to light involves dynamic changes in the expression of several clock genes. The molecular pathways used by light to influence pacemaker-driven oscillation of clock genes remain poorly understood. We explored the functional integration of both light-and clock-responsive transcriptional regulation at the promoter level of the Period (Per) genes. Three Per genes exist in the mouse. Whereas mPer1 and mPer2 are light-inducible in clock neurons of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, mPer3 is not. We have studied the promoter structure of the three mPer genes and compared their regulation. All three mPer promoters contain E-boxes and respond to the CLOCK/brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-like protein 1 (BMAL1) heterodimer. On the other hand, only mPer1 and mPer2 promoters contain bona fide cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) that bind CRE-binding protein (CREB) from suprachiasmatic nucleus protein extracts. The mPer1 promoter is responsive to synergistic activation of the cAMP and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, a physiological response that requires integrity of the CRE. In contrast, activation of mPer promoters by CLOCK/BMAL1 occurs regardless of an intact CRE. Altogether, these results constitute strong evidence that CREB acts as a pivotal endpoint of signaling pathways for the regulation of mPer genes. Our results reveal that signaling-dependent activation of mPer genes is distinct from the CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription required within the clock feedback loop.

AB  - Background: Awareness about the extent of maternal physical and emotional health problems after childbirth is increasing, but few longitudinal studies examining their duration have been published. The aim of this study was to describe changes in the prevalence of maternal health problems in the 6 months after birth and their association with parity and method of birth. Methods: A population-based, cohort study was conducted in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia. The study population, comprising women who gave birth to a live baby from March to October 1997, completed 4 questionnaires on the fourth postpartum day, and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks postpartum. Outcome measures were self-reported health problems during each of the three 8-week postpartum periods up to 24 weeks. Results: A total of 1295 women participated, and 1193 (92%) completed the study. Health problems showing resolution between 8 and 24 weeks postpartum were exhaustion/extreme tiredness (60-49%), backache (53-45%), bowel problems (37-17%), lack of sleep/baby crying (30-15%), hemorrhoids (30-13%), perineal pain (22-4%), excessive/prolonged bleeding (20-2%), urinary incontinence (19-11%), mastitis (15-3%), and other urinary problems (5-3%). No significant changes occurred in the prevalence of frequent headaches or migraines, sexual problems, or depression over the 6 months. Adjusting for method of birth, primiparas were more likely than multiparas to report perineal pain and sexual problems. Compared with unassisted vaginal births, women who had cesarean sections reported more exhaustion, lack of sleep, and bowel problems; reported less perineal pain and urinary incontinence in the first 8 weeks; and were more likely to be readmitted to hospital within 8 weeks of the birth. Women with forceps or vacuum extraction reported more perineal pain and sexual problems than those with unassisted vaginal births after adjusting for parity, perineal trauma, and length of labor. Conclusions: Health problems commonly occurred after childbirth with some resolution over the 6 months postpartum. Some important differences in prevalence of health problems were evident when parity and method of birth were considered.

AB  - This review highlights recent studies investigating the role of prostaglandin (PG)D2 in reproduction. PGD2 induces sleep, allergic responses, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and relaxation of vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle, and has some roles in reproduction. Two types of PGD2 synthase are known. Lipocalin-type PGD synthase is present in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma and may play an important role in male reproduction. Another PGD synthase, hematopoietic PGD synthase is present in the spleen, fallopian tube, endometrial gland cells, extravillous trophoblasts and villous trophoblasts, and perhaps plays an important role in female reproduction. Recent studies demonstrate that PGD2 is probably involved in multiple aspects of inflammation through its dual receptor systems, DP and CRTH2. CRTH2 but not DP is a chemo-attractant receptor for PGD2. Interestingly, CRTH2 is a most reliable marker for the detection of human T helper type 2 (Th2) and T cytotoxic type 2 (Tc2) cells, and the percentages of CRTH expressing CD4+-T cells and CD8+-T cells were significantly higher in the decidua especially at the implantation site, suggesting that Th2 and Tc2 cells recruit into the materno-fetal interface, in a PGD2-mediated manner. PGD2 has a very unique effect to inhibit antigen presentation by inhibition of dendritic cell (DC) migration through DP but not CRTH2. PGD2 might appear to contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy by controlling the Th1/Th2 balance and antigen presentation by DCs through its dual receptor systems, CRTH2 and DP.

AB  - The first 3 postpartum months represent a high-risk period for psychiatric illnesses. This article reviews the prevalence and diagnostic criteria for postpartum illnesses, including the "maternal blues," postpartum depression, and postpartum psychosis. Pharmacologic treatment of these disorders is often complicated by a patient's desire to breast-feed, yet there are no controlled trials of anti-depressant treatment during lactation. Infant exposure and limitations to monitoring infant sera are reviewed. Lastly, a model and guide for reducing fetal and infant exposures is presented.

AB  - Population-based epidemiologic studies have uncovered the high prevalence and wide severity spectrum of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, and have consistently found that even mild obstructive sleep apnea is associated with significant morbidity. Evidence from methodologically strong cohort studies indicates that undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, with or without symptoms, is independently associated with increased likelihood of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, daytime sleepiness, motor vehicle accidents, and diminished quality of life. Strategies to decrease the high prevalence and associated morbidity of obstructive sleep apnea are critically needed. The reduction or elimination of risk factors through public health initiatives with clinical support holds promise. Potentially modifiable risk factors considered in this review include overweight and obesity, alcohol, smoking, nasal congestion, and estrogen depletion in menopause. Data suggest that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with all these factors, but at present the only intervention strategy supported with adequate evidence is weight loss. A focus on weight control is especially important given the expanding epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States. Primary care providers will be central to clinical approaches for addressing the burden and the development of cost-effective case-finding strategies and feasible treatment for mild obstructive sleep apnea warrants high priority.

AB  - Fifty-two pregnant women recruited during their second trimester were given EEGs and divided into greater relative right and left frontal EEG activation groups. The greater relative right frontal EEG women had lower dopamine levels during their second trimester and lower dopamine and higher cortisol levels during the neonatal period. The newborns of the right frontal EEG mothers also showed greater relative right frontal EEG, had lower dopamine and serotonin levels, spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had inferior Brazelton scores. A discriminant function analysis based on the mothers' prenatal depression scores and biochemical measures correctly classified 74% of the women as greater relative right or left frontal EEG group members.

AB  - Selective deprivation of paradoxical (or rapid eye movements) sleep (REMS) in protein malnourished young male rats, results in circadian and homeostatic alterations. By means of electrocorticographic recordings, we have examined the sleep-wake cycle as a functional maturity index, and its circadian and homeostatic mechanisms in prenatal (PM) and chronically (CM) protein malnourished young male rats. The effects of rapid eye movements sleep-deprivation (REMS-D), by the platform technique in a "conflict experiment" (i.e. recovery from REMS-D begun during the circadian phase of activity), revealed that in PM animals, wake (WAK) was increased significantly during recovery days 1 and 2 (RD1, RD2); and slow wave sleep (SWS) was reduced significantly during these days. Prenatal protein-malnutrition altered the phase of WAK and REMS rhythms, and the amplitude of SWS rhythm was decreased. The REMS compensatory increase after REMS-D (REMS rebound) was confined to the first 4-h block of the activity phase in all experimental groups and 24 h later another REMS rebound was displayed in PM animals. The paradoxical sleep-rebound in CM animals was significantly higher than control and PM rats and it was only shown at the first 4-h block after REMS-D. Before and after REMS-D the circadian distribution of both sleep states, and the electrocortical frequency bands showed different circadian phases at the same day-time in control, PM and CM rats. The aforementioned indicates that protein malnutrition exerts important effects on the circadian and homeostatic mechanisms driving sleep. Therefore, the temporal structure of the malnourished rats may not allow proper synchronization of some sleep parameters, particularly REMS, to the environmental time cues.

AB  - Objectives. The Back to Sleep campaign has been credited with recent declines in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome. Using survey data for the 1996-1998 birth cohorts, this epidemiologic study examines infant sleep position in a large, population-based sample. Data and Methods. Data concerning infant sleep position are drawn from the 1996-1998 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System for 15 states. Weighted multiple logistic regression analysis is used to examine correlates of infant sleep position. Results. The prevalence of prone infant sleeping significantly declined between 1996 and 1998 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.63, 0.78]). African Americans were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone, (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.33,1.59), and were less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.48, 0.57). Hispanic/Latinos were less likely overall than non-Hispanic whites to sleep prone (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.95), but were also less likely to sleep supine (AOR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.69, 0.87). Adherence to sleep position recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics increased sharply among Hispanic/Latino infants. Very low birth weight infants and infants in larger families were less likely to sleep in the recommended supine position. Infants born between 1001 and 1500 g (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.79), and extremely low birth weight infants between 500 and 1000 g (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.45, 0.72) were especially unlikely to sleep supine. Infants in households with more than 3 other children (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.74) were more likely to sleep prone. Conclusions. The prevalence of supine infant sleep increased between 1996 and 1998. Low adherence to sleep position recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics among African Americans, very low birth weight infants, and infants in large families remain public health concerns.

AB  - Objective. The introduction of the "Back to Sleep" campaign for the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) brought with it concern that there might be an increase in the incidence of aspiration-related deaths. The objective of this analysis was to describe the trends in postneonatal mortality and proportionate mortality ratios for the United States for the years 1991 to 1996 for aspiration-related deaths and other causes to which a SIDS death could conceivably be reclassified. Methods. Linked birth and infant death vital statistic files for the United States were used for the years 1991, 1995, and 1996. US Vital Statistic Mortality files for the years 1992, 1993, and 1994 were used because of the absence of linked files for those years. Results. The overall postneonatal mortality rate between 1991 and 1996 declined 21.9%, whereas the SIDS rate declined 38.9%. The proportion of the postneonatal mortality (PNPMR) contributed by SIDS declined from 37.1% in 1991 to 28.8% in 1996. There was no significant increase in the PNPMR for aspiration, asphyxia, or respiratory failure. There was, however, a significant increase in the PNPMR for suffocation in bed or cradle from 0.9 to 1.3. Conclusions. These data show no evidence of an increased risk of death from aspiration as a result of the "Back to Sleep" program. Although there has been an increase in the proportion of postneonatal mortality attributable to suffocation, this represents a very small proportion of postneonatal mortality and thus potentially a very small number of SIDS deaths reclassified as suffocation.

AB  - Objective: About 5% of pregnant women meet criteria for major depression. No pharmacotherapy is specifically approved for antepartum depression; novel treatment approaches may be welcome. The authors explored the use of morning bright light therapy for antepartum depression. Method: An open trial of bright light therapy in an A-B-A design was conducted for 3-5 weeks in 16 pregnant patients with major depression. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders Version, was administered to assess changes in mood. A follow-up questionnaire was used to assess outcome after delivery. Results: After 3 weeks of treatment, mean depression ratings improved by 49%. Benefits were seen through 5 weeks of treatment. There was no evidence of adverse effects of light therapy on pregnancy. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that morning light therapy has an antidepressant effect during pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to test this alternative to medication.

AB  - The pineal hormone melatonin is the mediator of external light to physiologic adaptation to day and night rhythms, it regulates reproduction in animals but attempts to utilize melatonin in women for contraception have failed. Melatonin seems to be the natural hormone to facilitate sleep in insomniac patients and causes no hang over. When applied together with benzodiazepine it allows reduction of benzodiazepine without withdrawal effects. It should be applied 2 h before sleeping time in doses between 3 and 5 mg. Melatonin acts via the Î³-aminobutyric acid- and benzodiazepine receptor explaining its success in treatment of seizures in children and in adults. Constant application of benzodiazepine reduced the production of natural melatonin in rats, supporting the evidence that long-term application of benzodiazepine in humans does not restore sleeping habits but reduces natural sleeping habits even more. Low melatonin levels were seen in bulimia or neuralgia and in women with fibromyalgia; replacement reduced pain, sleeping disorders, and depression in fibromyalgia and bulimia. Melatonin profiles are a diagnostic tool to distinguish between several forms of depression, like major depression, winter depression (SAD), unipolar depression, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). In patients with a major depression success with antidepressants correlated with an increase in their melatonin profiles but only patients suffering from DSPS can be successfully treated with melatonin. In perimenopausal women melatonin administration did produce a change in LH, FSH and thyroid hormones. Some oncostatic properties are supported by cell culture work and studies in animals. In Nordic countries indigenous people suffer less from breast and prostate cancer, winter darkness seems to protect. The supposedly increased melatonin levels created the 'melatonin hypothesis'. Epidemiological studies did show that blind people indeed have half the rate of breast cancers, supporting the hypothesis. Controversial results concerning melatonin and insulin resistance and glucose tolerance have been published. In postmenopausal women application of melatonin reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Pregnant women should avoid melatonin, since its teratogenic effect is not known. Patients suffering from non-hormone dependent tumors, like leukemia, should avoid melanin, since tumor growth was promoted in animal experiments. It can be expected that melatonin will receive wide consideration for treatment of sleeping disturbances, jet lag, and fibromyalgia once an oral formulation becomes available in Europe.

AB  - Late-gestation blockade of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) activity in pregnant mice produces discrete morphological abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of offspring. We investigated the functional implications of this lesion on the behavioural arousal response to moderate hypoxia. Pregnant mice received twice-daily injections of 200 Î¼l saline (control), or saline + 50 Î¼g VIP antagonist (anti-VIP) on embryonic days 17 and 18. Offspring were studied unrestrained at 6-7 weeks after birth, in a bias-flow whole-body plethysmograph during behavioural quiet sleep. Arousal was defined by movement (MVT) lasting â¥1 s. Hypoxic ventilatory (HVR) and arousal responses were measured during a 5 min exposure to 10% O2-3 % CO2 (hypoxia); peripheral chemoreflex drive was estimated by transient hyperoxia administered at rest and end-hypoxia (Dejours-type test). MVTs increased in all mice during hypoxia, but in anti-VIP mice: (a) MVT onset was delayed (174 Â± 90 vs. 108 Â± 59 s from the start of hypoxia, anti-VIP vs. control; P = 0.008); and (b) MVTs were less frequent, and total MVT time in hypoxia was less (8 Â± 7 vs. 15 Â± 9 %; P = 0.03). The HVR, and peripheral drive at rest and end-hypoxia were comparable in control and anti-VIP mice. In conclusion, a significant arousal deficit was evident in anti-VIP mice. This was not associated with obviously deranged peripheral or brainstem-mediated responses to hypoxia during sleep. This may signal a general deficit in the way hypoxic distress is monitored and processed, and arousal initiated and sustained in these mice.

AB  - Using a prospective design over three complete menstrual cycles, 147 heterosexual and 89 lesbian women made daily recordings of their basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus status, menses, and completed a daily checklist of various sexual behaviors (including sexual self-stimulation and sexual activity with a partner). They also gave their age, height, weight, age at menarche, number of pregnancies, duration of sleep, tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol use, and whether they had a live-in sexual partner. Using BBT, cervical mucus status, and menses information, cycle days were grouped into five discrete phases: menses, follicular, ovulatory, early luteal, and premenstrual. Daily frequencies of sexual behavior with a partner and autosexual behavior were computed for each phase. Mixed ANOVAs on the resultant proportional data revealed similar patterns for autosexual behavior across the phases for both heterosexuals and lesbians who did not have a live-in partner, in which autosexual behavior was highest during the follicular and ovulatory phases. For those with live-in partners, autosexual behavior did not vary across the phases. Lesbians engaged in more autosexual behavior overall. Allosexual behavior peaked during the follicular phase for both heterosexuals and lesbians, and the phasic pattern was unrelated to live-in partner status. Additional analyses suggest that the observed patterns were unrelated to anticipated changes in sexual activity due to menses. Results are discussed in terms of social variables and hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the 24-h pattern of blood pressure in adults with growth hormone deficiency using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. We therefore evaluated the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures, systolic and diastolic blood pressure loads and diurnal blood pressure rhythm. We used an auscultatory-type monitor, the measurements being made at 10-15 min intervals during the day and 20-30 min intervals at night. We included patients with a growth hormone peak of less than 3 ng/ml in at least two stimulation tests: the insulin tolerance and glucagon tests. The exclusion criteria were mental illnesses, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure higher than 160/90 mmHg, the use of growth hormone in the previous 12 months, severe acute illnesses, chronic liver or kidney disease and a history of malignancy. The results were interpreted according to the II Brazilian Consensus for the utilization of ambulatory monitoring. The study population comprised 27 adult patients with growth hormone deficiency, 11 male and 16 female, with an age range of 21-62 years. Five had developed the condition during childhood, whereas the remainder had adult-onset growth hormone deficiency. The mean systolic (115 Â± 16.7 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure loads (75.51 Â± 1.90 mmHg) were normal. There was a tendency towards a lower blood pressure in patients with childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency when compared with their adult-onset counterparts. Men had a lower systolic blood pressure than women, the same pattern being found for mean diastolic blood pressure. Multiple regression analysis showed that age was the only independent variable with the statistical power to explain the variance of blood pressure in this group of patients. The incidence of non-dippers was 37.03%. Growth hormone deficiency thus seems to be associated with a change in the 24-h blood pressure pattern, with a high incidence of non-dippers.

AB  - Background: Mefloquine is a clinically important antimalaria drug, which is often not well tolerated. We critically reviewed 516 published case reports of mefloquine adverse effects, to clarify the phenomenology of the harms associated with mefloquine, and to make recommendations for safer prescribing. Presentation: We postulate that many of the adverse effects of mefloquine are a post-hepatic syndrome caused by primary liver damage. In some users we believe that symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs, either independently or as a secondary consequence of the hepatocellular injury. The mefloquine syndrome presents in a variety of ways including headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, nervousness, fatigue, disorders of sleep, mood, memory and concentration, and occasionally frank psychosis. Previous liver or thyroid disease, and concurrent insults to the liver (such as from alcohol, dehydration, an oral contraceptive pill, recreational drugs, and other liver-damaging drugs) may be related to the development of severe or prolonged adverse reactions to mefloquine. Implications: We believe that people with active liver or thyroid disease should not take mefloquine, whereas those with fully resolved neuropsychiatric illness may do so safely. Mefloquine users should avoid alcohol, recreational drugs, hormonal contraception and co-medications known to cause liver damage or thyroid damage. With these caveats, we believe that mefloquine may be safely prescribed in pregnancy, and also to occupational groups who carry out safety-critical tasks. Testing: Mefloquine's adverse effects need to be investigated through a multicentre cohort study, with small controlled studies testing specific elements of the hypothesis.

AB  - During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, activity of non-retinal origin is propagated into central visual-system pathways in a manner similar, in pattern and intensity, to central visual-system activity that is exogenously generated in waking. It has been hypothesized that REM sleep, which is more abundantly represented early in life than later, functions to provide adjunct 'afferent' input for shaping synaptic connectivity during brain maturation. Here we present data that support this proposal. Recent studies have described a developmentally regulated form of in vitro long-term potentiation (LTP) in the visual cortex that is experience- and age-dependent. In immature rats, suppression of retinal activation of the visual system by removal of visual experience (dark rearing) extends the age when the developmentally regulated form of LTP can be produced. This study tests whether suppression of REM-state activation of the visual system also lengthens the developmental period in which this specific form of LTP can be elicited. Young rats were deprived of REM sleep by the multiple-small-platforms-over-water method during the typically latest week for induction of such LTP in slices of visual cortex. After this week, we could still induce LTP in slices from nearly all the REM-sleep-deprived rats (8/9) but not from age-matched rats that had not lost REM sleep (0/5). The control rats had been housed on large platforms that allow the animals to obtain REM sleep. Only body weights and the concentration of thyrotrophin-releasing hormone in the hypothalamus distinguished home-caged, normal-sleeping controls from both groups of platform animals. On all measures, stress levels were not dissimilar in the two platforms groups. After 7 days of behavioral suppression of REM sleep in immature rats, and consequent reduction of the intense, extra-retinal activity endogenously generated during this sleep state, we found that the period was extended in which developmentally regulated synaptic plasticity (LTP) could be elicited in slices of visual neocortex. These studies support the role of REM sleep and its associated neuronal activity in brain maturation. Â© 2002 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A temporal pattern of the kinetics of local anesthetics is demonstrated in dental and skin anesthesia, with an important variation in the duration of action related to the hour of administration. The aim of this study is to determine whether the hour of injection influences the duration of epidurally administered ropivacaine during labor. Methods: One hundred ninety-four women in the first stage of labor were assigned to one of four groups throughout the day period: group 1 (night: from 1:01 to 7:00 AM), group 2 (morning: from 7:01 AM to 1:00 PM), group 3 (afternoon: from 1:01 to 7:00 PM), and group 4 (evening: from 7:01 PM to 1:00 AM). Each patient received 14 ml ropivacaine, 0.17%, epidurally, and analgesia duration was measured. Results: Pain assessed by a visual analog score was not different among groups before the first injection of local anesthetic. Analgesia duration was greater in the diurnal period (group 2: 110 Â± 25 min and group 3: 117 Â± 23 min) compared with the nocturnal period (group 1: 94 Â± 23 min and group 4: 91 Â± 23 min) (P < 0.01). The largest intraday variation of analgesia duration among groups reached 28%. Conclusions: Epidural analgesia duration exhibits a temporal pattern with important differences among diurnal and nocturnal phases. The authors emphasize that the lack of consideration of the chronobiologic conditions in epidural analgesia studies may create significant statistical bias. Future studies dealing with epidural local anesthetics should consider the time of drug administration.

AB  - Objectives: To survey the effects of pregnancy on mothers' sleep. Methods: Mothers were interviewed during and after pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess alterations in their sleep. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last the 3 months after delivery. The study was carried out in a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community. Altogether, 325 pregnant women completed all five questionnaires. Results: The total amounts of reported sleep and of nocturnal sleep increased significantly during the first trimester of pregnancy, began to decrease thereafter and were shortest during the 3 months after pregnancy. During late pregnancy expectant mothers over 30 years of age reported less sleep than those under 30. During the whole pregnancy, but increasingly toward the end of pregnancy, sleep became more restless and fragmentary and its subjective quality worsened, due at least partly to increased restless legs and nightly awakenings increasing with advancing pregnancy. Conclusions: The subjective quality of sleep is disturbed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy, although total sleeping time increases. The amount of reported sleep begins to decrease in the second trimester. The frequency of reported sleep disturbances, such as restless legs syndrome and nocturnal awakenings, is maximum in the third trimester but is about normal within 3 months after delivery.

AB  - Aims: This study was carried out to investigate how the locus of control (LOC) varies between those who stop smoking in connection with pregnancy and those who do not. The LOC reflects the extent to which a person is in control of her or his life events. Methods: One hundred and two women who were regular smokers at the time of conception and paid their first visits to the antenatal clinic (ANC) on account of the current pregnancy participated. The study was quantitative and questionnaire based, covering background factors, smoking habits, and the LOC. One hundred of the women were met a second time after the delivery. Smoking habits were monitored by the content of carbon monoxide in expired air. The LOC was recorded on a VAS scale (0-10). A lower index was consistent with a more internal LOC and a higher with a more external LOC. Results: The median LOC found was 4.0 (range 1.1-7.9). The LOC was not correlated to the CO in expired air. Younger age was linked to a more internal LOC, while worse sleep was correlated to a more external LOC (p<0.05). No differences were found between those who stopped smoking and those who did not. This was the case in both light and heavy smokers. Conclusion: The LOC does not seem to influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy. Â© Taylor & Francis 2002.

AB  - Toxoplasma infection during pregnancy is widely treated with oral spiramycin to reduce the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in the infant. Failures of therapy have been observed, however. In this study, a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography technique was used to measure concentrations of spiramycin and neospiramycin, one of the major metabolites of spiramycin, in maternal serum and amniotic fluid. Samples were obtained from 18 women who underwent amniocentesis for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis of fetal infection 5-109 days following the prescription of spiramycin therapy (3 g/day). Concentrations of spiramycin and neo-spiramycin in both serum and amniotic fluid were highly variable, ranging from nondetectable values to 1 Î¼g/ml. None of the concentrations measured were within the range reported to inhibit growth of the parasite in vitro. Consistent with previous reports, part of the observed variability in maternal and fetal drug concentrations could be explained by individual differences in several pharmacokinetic parameters: intestinal absorption, tissue distribution, cellular uptake, metabolism, transfer across the placenta, drug accumulation in fetal tissue, and maternal and fetal drug elimination. The heterogeneity of the data could also be related to differences in patient compliance with the medication prescribed. By addressing factors that could impair adequate treatment of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, the data presented call for a larger-scale controlled study to determine individual and diurnal variations in maternal drug levels, patient compliance, and outcomes of the offspring. The activity of neospiramycin against Toxoplasma gondii should be assessed.

AB  - Objective: To determine specific sleep characteristics in neonatal opiate withdrawal, referred to as the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS), by measuring sleep efficiency, deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation in three groups: (i) healthy term neonates; (ii) opiate-exposed neonates who were treated for opiate withdrawal; and (iii) a group of opiate-exposed neonates who did not require treatment. Methods: A cohort study recording sleep patterns of neonates at 2-10 days of age (after 36 or more weeks of gestation) was carried out. Twenty-one neonates were exposed to opiates during pregnancy and 15 neonates were healthy controls. Sleep characteristics were predefined, and treated newborns were divided into early and stabilized treatment groups. Polygraphic recordings of sleep, movement and breathing were made continuously after a daytime feed. Results: Sleep deprivation, disorganization and fragmentation were found in newborns with NAS and were associated with the severity of the withdrawal. Neonates treated for NAS displayed increased wakefulness during early treatment (deprivation), but were similar to controls once stabilized. Both treated and non-treated groups had reduced amounts of quiet sleep (deprivation). Treated newborns showed an increase in indeterminate sleep (disorganization) and arousals-to-wakefulness (fragmentation). Conclusion: This study determined the exact nature and degree of sleep disturbances in newborns during acute opiate withdrawal. The findings contribute to a further understanding of the physiology underlying neonatal opiate withdrawal and suggest that some changes in sleep are due to opiate withdrawal but others may reflect opiate dependency in utero.

AB  - In Siberian hamsters, day length is encoded by the duration of the nocturnal melatonin signal; short and long melatonin signals over the course of several weeks stimulate and inhibit somatic and gonadal development, respectively, in prepubertal males. We sought to determine whether juvenile male Siberian hamsters respond to multiple melatonin signals each day and the manner in which the sequence of melatonin signals and the duration of the melatonin-free interval between signals affects development. Twenty-one day old male Siberian hamsters, gestated and maintained in a short-day photoperiod of 10 h light/day (10 L), were transferred to constant light to suppress endogenous melatonin secretion and received s.c. infusions of melatonin or saline for 12 days. Hamsters infused with saline retained small testes, whereas one short melatonin infusion each day resulted in significant testicular growth. Other hamsters were provided with two melatonin signals each day, one long (9 h) and one short (4 or 5 h); the order in which these signals was administered and the duration of the melatonin-free interval after each signal varied between groups. In asymmetrical melatonin infusions, the first and second daily infusions were followed by 3-h and 7-h melatonin-free intervals, respectively, whereas in symmetrical infusions, each melatonin signal was followed by a 5-h melatonin-free interval. In the asymmetrical sequence, the melatonin signal that immediately preceded the longer melatonin-free interval determined the rate gonadal growth. Equal melatonin-free intervals after each of the long and short daily melatonin infusions produced intermediate increases in gonadal and somatic development. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of Siberian hamsters can respond to multiple melatonin signals each day, with the rate of testicular growth determined primarily by the duration of the melatonin-free interval following each infusion.

AB  - Background: The pathogenesis of neonatal jitteriness (JT) remains unknown. Neonatal JT could be one of the symptoms associated with drug withdrawal syndrome due to maternal medication. To study the influence of chemicals and environment on brain development in the fetal period, Swaab and Mirmiran proposed 'behavioral teratology'. JT could be one of the targets for this concept. Swaab and Mirmiran postulated that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM sleep) is useful for studying behavioral teratology. Aim: We aimed to determine the neurophysiological alterations in infants with JT by investigating REM sleep. Study design: Sleep records were obtained three times for each of six jittery infants. The mothers of three infants had been on medication (either alpha-methyl dopa, reserpine or haloperidol) during pregnancy, whereas the mothers of the other three infants took no medication during pregnancy. REM sleep parameters (the amount of REM sleep against the total sleep time, newly designated indices-tonic inhibition index (TII) and phasic inhibition index-, and the incidences of gross movements, phasic chin muscle activity (PCMA), and bursts of rapid eye movements) in the six jittery infants were compared with those in age-matched controls. Results: Regardless of maternal medication, TIIs, which represent the shortening of PCMA during REM sleep, were higher in the jittery infants than in the controls. No other REM sleep parameters showed constant differences between the patients and controls. Conclusion: Release of the blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the fetal brain is considered to be critical for the occurrence of neonatal JT with elevation of TII. Since the abnormal elevation of TII continued after 6 months of age when our patients did not show JT anymore, we have to keep monitoring jittery infants from the standpoint of 'behavioral teratology'.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate specific pregnancy and labour and delivery events that may increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). A matched case-control study was conducted in five counties in southern California, using California death certificate records. The sample consisted of 239 Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic and Asian mothers of SIDS infants and 239 mothers of control infants matched on sex, race, birth hospital and date of birth. Mothers participated in a detailed telephone interview and provided access to obstetric and paediatric records. More case than control mothers reported a family history of anaemia (OR = 2.12, P < 0.001). Placental abruptions were strongly associated with SIDS (unadjusted OR = 7.94, [95% CI 1.34,47.12]). There was an increased risk of SIDS death associated with maternal anaemia during pregnancy (OR = 2.51, [95% CI 1.25,5.03]), while simultaneously adjusting for maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal years of education and age, parity, infant birthweight, gestational age, medical conditions at birth, infant sleep position and post-natal smoking. Interactions of anaemia and prenatal smoking as well as anaemia and post-natal smoking were not statistically significant. There were no other statistically significant differences between case and control mothers for pregnancy conditions, labour and delivery events (e.g. caesarean sections, anaesthesia, forceps) or newborn complications (e.g. nuchal cord, meconium aspiration). Anaemia and placental abruptions were significantly associated with an increased risk of SIDS; both are circumstances in which a fetus may become hypoxic, thereby compromising the subsequent growth, development and ultimate survival of the infant.

AB  - Background: Pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) are two of the most extensively characterized biochemical bone markers, but the interpretation of results is hampered by biologic and other preanalytical variability. We reviewed factors contributing to preanalytical variation of pyridinium cross-links in urine. Methods: We searched four databases for English-language reports on PYD and/or DPD in urine. Searches were restricted to humans, except for studies of stability, when the search was expanded to other species. The 599 identified articles were supplemented with references from those articles and with articles known to the authors. Results: The mean reported within-day variability was 71% for PYD (range, 57-78%) and 67% for DPD (range, 53-75%). The mean interday variability was 16% for both DPD and PYD (range for PYD, 12-21%; range for DPD, 5-24%). The mean intersubject variabilities across studies were 26% for PYD (range, 12-63%) and 34% for DPD (range, 8-98%) for healthy premenopausal women and 36% (range, 22-61%) and 40%, (range, 27-54%) for postmenopausal women, respectively. Specimen instability and errors in creatinine measurements were additional sources of variability. Conclusions: Intra- and intersubject variability can be reduced by collecting specimens at a specific time of the day and by maintaining similar patient status at each specimen collection regarding factors such as medications and dietary supplements.

AB  - Behavioral and neurochemical effects of perinatal alcohol exposure (3% v/v solution from Day 15 of gestation to Day 7 after parturition) have been investigated in Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and alcohol-nonpreferring (sNP) rat lines, selectively bred for opposite alcohol preference and consumption. In an elevated zero-maze model of anxiety, sucrose-exposed sP rats (sP-S): (i) spent significantly less time on the open arms (TO); (ii) exhibited a significantly lower number of head dips (HDIPS); and (iii) showed a higher number of stretched attend-postures (SAP) than sucrose-exposed sNP rats (sNP-S) at 90 and 180 days of age. The two rat lines displayed different emotional reactivity in response to alcohol exposure. Subtle differences in sexual behavior and ultrasonic emission (latency to the first intromission and to the first 50 kHz call) were observed between sP-S and sNP-S rats. sP-alcohol exposed (sP-A) offspring exhibited a higher latency to the first intromission than sNP-alcohol (sNP-A) treated rats. Moreover, a lower number of sP-A rats exhibited both intromission and ejaculation with respect to sNP-A animals. sP-S rats were significantly slower in recover of the righting reflex than sNP-S animals after a challenge dose of alcohol (3 g/kg, i.p.). Perinatal alcohol did not affect either onset or duration of sleep time in either line. Neurochemical experiments have shown that perinatal alcohol did not influence basal dopamine levels or amphetamine-induced dopamine increase in the prefrontal cortex of either sP or sNP offspring. These results, showing an endpoint-specific differential sensitivity of sP and sNP lines to perinatal low alcohol exposure, indicate that genetic factors could be responsible for selective susceptibility to behavioral alterations induced by developmental treatment with this drug of abuse.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if maternal sleeping position around the time of implantation influences eventual placental implantation site. Between November 1997 and April 1999, women with singleton pregnancies between gestational ages of 15 and 20 weeks presenting for ultrasound examinations were prospectively queried regarding their usual position of sleep during early gestation. Dominant position of sleep was noted as prone, supine, right side, or left side. At ultrasound examination, placental location was categorized as (1) fundal, (2) left high, (3) right high, (4) anterior high, (5) posterior high, (6) anterior low, (7) posterior low, (8) right low, (9) left low, or (10) central low. During the 18 months of this study, data were obtained from 1,500 patients. At the time of conception, front or prone sleeping was the most common (497 of 1,500, 33.1%), followed by right side (439 of 1,500, 29.3%) and left side (360 of 1,500, 24%), with the back being the least frequent position of sleep (204 of 1,500, 13.6%). Women who usually slept supine at the time of conception and implantation were significantly more likely to have a high or fundal placental location compared with those who usually slept in the prone position (p = 0.041). In addition, women who slept exclusively on their right side early in pregnancy were significantly more likely to have a right-sided placental location compared with women who slept exclusively on their left side (p = 0.025). The data from this investigation indicate that sleeping position early in gestation may influence the ultimate placental implantation site.

AB  - During gestation, the perinatal neuroendocrine axis keeps clock time. In primates, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (biological clock in mammals), shows oscillatory function by midgestation. There is evidence in rodents that the mother, during pregnancy, entrains the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and newborn circadian rhythms. We are investigating the role of maternal melatonin as an entraining signal for the newborn circadian time-keeping system in the Cebus apella (New World non-human primate). Twenty-four hour rhythms of temperature and cortisol are present in the 4 days old C. apella newborn. Preliminary data suggests that inhibition of maternal melatonin by exposing pregnant females to constant light alters these rhythms. We have found binding sites for melatonin and expression of mRNA for Mel 1A receptor in hypothalamus, kidney and testis. These preliminary results suggest that maternal melatonin may play a role in relating the perinatal circadian time-keeping system to environmental signals. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective. In part 1 of this investigation, we demonstrated that children of multiple birth pregnancies are at higher risk for development of deformational plagiocephaly. In the current investigation, we explore whether certain prenatal and postnatal risk factors predispose one twin over the other by examining the occurrence and severity of plagiocephaly in both discordant (only 1 affected) and concordant (both affected) twin pairs. Methods. Throughout 1999, we obtained detailed medical histories on 140 sets of twins who had presented for treatment at 1 of 9 treatment centers across the United States. The study cohort consisted of 46 concordant and 94 discordant twin pairs (a total of 280 study participants). Information about prenatal and postnatal history of each infant was obtained through detailed review of the children's medical records as well as analysis of a patient database maintained on all infants who receive treatment. Follow-up interviews were performed to verify the information recorded and to obtain additional information about the child who had not received treatment (if appropriate) or use of reproductive assistance (fertility drugs, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, etc) that had not been previously recorded. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the effects of prenatal and postnatal risk factors (in utero position, in utero orientation, birth weight, neck involvement, sleeping position) with respect to which infant was affected in the discordant twin pairs and to which infant was more severely affected in the concordant twin pairs. Results. Statistical analyses of both discordant and concordant twin pairs demonstrated that the lower in utero infant was significantly more likely to be affected (Ï2 = 17.391). In addition, the more severely affected infant was significantly more likely to have some form of neck involvement (torticollis, neck tightness; Ï2 = 46.380), as well as have been carried in a vertex position (Ï2 = 7.408). Conversely, neither sleeping position nor gender was found to be associated with development of plagiocephaly. Conclusions. The results of this investigation strongly support an in utero cause of plagiocephaly and demonstrate that intrauterine positioning may play a prominent role in determining both the occurrence and severity of deformational plagiocephaly in twins. These findings confirm that the lower in utero infant is at increased risk for the development of plagiocephaly, likely resulting from the more restrictive intrauterine environment encountered during the later part of the pregnancy.

AB  - Aim of the study: To estimate the prevalence and 5-year incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) after the first delivery and to evaluate the impact of pregnancy per se and delivery per se on long-lasting symptoms. Materials and methods: A longitudinal cohort study of 305 primiparae questioned a few days, 3 months, and 5 years after their delivery. The questionnaire used was tested and validated, and the questions were formulated according to the definitions of the International Continence Society (ICS). Maternal, obstetric, and neonatal data concerning every delivery and objective data concerning surgeries during the observation period were obtained from the records. From the sample of 278 women (91%) who responded 5 years after their first delivery, three subpopulations were defined: 1) women without initial LUTS before or during the first pregnancy or during the puerperal period, 2) women with onset of LUTS during the first pregnancy, and 3) women with onset of LUTS during the first puerperium. The risk of LUTS 5 years after the first delivery was examined using bivariate analyses. The obstetric variables in the bivariate tests with a significant association with long-lasting urinary incontinence were entered into a multivariate logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of stress and urge incontinence 5 years after first delivery was 30% and 15%, respectively, whereas the 5-year incidence was 19% and 11%, respectively. The prevalence of urgency, diurnal frequency, and nocturia 5 years after the first delivery was 18%, 24%, and 2%, respectively, whereas the 5-year incidence was 15%, 20%, and 0.5%, respectively. The prevalence of all LUTS except nocturia increased significantly during the 5 years of observation. The risk of long-lasting stress and urge incontinence was related to the onset and duration of the symptom after the first pregnancy and delivery in a dose-response-like manner. Vacuum extraction at the first delivery was used significantly more often in the group of women with onset of stress incontinence during the first puerperium, whereas an episiotomy at the first delivery was performed significantly more often in the group of women with onset of stress incontinence in the 5 years of observation. The prevalence of urgency and diurnal frequency 5 years after the first delivery was not increased in women with symptom onset during the first pregnancy or puerperium compared with those without such symptoms. The frequency of nocturia 5 years after the first delivery was too low for statistical analysis. Conclusion: The first pregnancy and delivery may result in stress and urge incontinence 5 years later. Women with stress and urge incontinence 3 months after the first delivery have a very high risk of long-lasting symptoms. An episiotomy or a vacuum extraction at the first delivery seems to increase the risk. Subsequent childbearing or surgery seems without significant contribution. Long-lasting urgency, diurnal frequency, or nocturia cannot be predicted from onset during the first pregnancy or puerperium. Â© 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The circadian expression of the serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) gene in the rat retina is considered to be generated by an endogenous retinal clock. To investigate the developmental aspects of the clock system in the mammalian retina, we determined daily expression patterns of NAT mRNA in the retina of postnatal rats. Animals were kept under a daily light-dark cycle (LD), or transferred to constant darkness (DD) from LD, and retinal mRNA levels were examined by Northern blot analysis. NAT mRNA had begun to show a daily change in LD as early as postnatal day 2 (P2). Whereas rhythmic variations in DD were not observed until P14, at P20, a circadian oscillation had already occurred. These findings suggest that in the rat retina, even though a daily LD induced rhythmic changes in NAT mRNA levels at the early postnatal stage, it was after P14 that the retinal clock system began to regulate the circadian NAT expression.

AB  - Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) might be due to the fetal consequences of a Mg maternal deficiency, which might be prevented by simple atoxic nutritional Mg intake by the mother. Various stresses in the pregnant women or in the infant may transform a simple Mg deficiency into Mg depletion which may not be cured by nutritional Mg supplement, but requires a correction of its causal dysregulation. Beside the well established risk factors in baby care and in the environment, it is important to stress the possible role of a primary hypofunction of the biological clock. This may be treated by darkness therapy: total light deprivation at night for the infant and atoxic nutritional Mg supplement for the pregnant women. The place in the prevention of SIDS of Mg therapy for the infant and of the use of melatonin, L-tryptophan and taurine is now uncertain yet.

AB  - During the last 25 years, 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has evolved from a research tool of limited clinical use into an important tool for stratifying cardiovascular risk and guiding therapeutic decisions. Until recently, clinical use of ABPM focused on identifying patients with white-coat hypertension, but accumulated evidence now points to greater prognostic significance of ABPM in determining risk for target-organ damage compared with that of office blood pressure measurements. Clinicians involved in the care of patients with hypertension should familiarize themselves with the role of this technology and how to use it in an appropriate and cost-effective manner.

AB  - Based on 1103 lambings the duration of pregnancy was determined for the breeds German Mutton Merino, German Blackhead Mutton and their Booroola crosses. Furthermore the influence of age and body mass of the ewes as well as number, sex and body mass of the born lambs were considered. German Blackhead Mutton have with 145/146 days on average a 4-5 days shorter duration of pregnancy than German Mutton Merino with 150 days. The examined effects influenced the pregnancy duration only insignificantly or not at all. An influence of the breed, however, was determined. In the pen with limited light during the night all genotypes lambed mostly between 9.00 a. m. and 3.00 p. m. During the day time 12-26 % more ewes lambed than during the remaining 12 hours of the day.

AB  - Circadian genes are expressed in some peripheral tissues, but the expression status of the female reproductive tract and the conceptus over the preimplantation period is unknown. Oocytes, uterine, oviducal tissues and preimplantation conceptuses from days 1-4 of mouse pregnancy were analysed for transcript presence by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Transcripts encoded by the seven known mammalian canonical circadian genes (Per1-3, Cry1-2, Bmal1 and Clock), plus the mammalian genetic homologue of the Drosophila canonical gene Timeless, were detected in the uteri and oviducts taken from mice on days 1-4 of pregnancy and in unfertilized oocytes. After fertilization, transcripts for Per1, Cry1, Bmal1, Clock and Tim have been detected unambiguously. Transcript levels for each of these five genes fall at the two-cell stage, but are restored rapidly for Per1, Cry1 and Bmal1, presumptively by zygotic gene expression. In contrast, transcripts for Clock and Tim recover more slowly. It is concluded that circadian genes are expressed, and may therefore have a role, during the early development of the mammal.

AB  - The use of urinary cortisol (UC) as an additional tool to evaluate sows welfare was assessed in two experiments. In a preliminary methodological experiment, the kinetics of cortisol excretion in urine was studied during an Adreno Cortico Trophic Hormone (ACTH) challenge test in 10 pregnant sows. In a second experiment, 96 primiparous sows of an experimental unit were assigned to two different housing systems: 48 animals were housed in individual pens (IP) and 48 animals in collective pens (CP) with 6 animals per pen. UC was measured at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy and compared with other welfare indicators such as behaviour or skin damage. In both experiments, UC was measured using a high pressure liquid chromatography assay. In experiment 1, UC was constant on the day before injection of ACTH, with no variations related to circadian rhythm. It began to rise 2 h after the injection, peaked between 2 to 5 h after then returned to the basal concentration on the day after the injection. In experiment 2, UC concentrations were not different between CP- and IP-housed sows but they were higher in sows exhibiting the less stereotypies in comparison with sows exhibiting the most stereotypies. The results of this study suggest that UC is a good indicator of acute stress, more convenient than plasma cortisol measurement since it is a non-invasive method avoiding restraint or catheterisation of sows. They also suggest that UC could also give additional information on the assessment of chronic stress and improve the evaluation of animal welfare if used in conjunction with other welfare indicators.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to validate the prediction of 24- hour urine protein excretion by a single voided urine protein-to-creatinine (P:C) ratio in a hospitalized pregnant population at our institution. We sought to evaluate the ability of serial single voided P:C ratios to follow the course of proteinuria. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients who were admitted to the antepartum unit at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and who were undergoing a 24-hour urine collection for the quantitation of proteinuria were recruited. A single voided urine specimen was obtained after the completion of the 24-hour urine collection and analyzed for the P:C ratio. RESULTS: Thirty patients completed the study. There was a significant correlation between the 24-hour urine protein and the P:C ratio (r = 0.93, P <.001). The associations of maternal age and gestational age at collection with P:C ratio and 24-hour urine protein were weak and not significant. There was a nonsignificant trend of higher P:C ratios and 24-hour urine protein in nulliparous patients compared with multiparous patients. On the basis of multiple linear regression, there was no confounding effect of maternal age, gestational age, or parity. Eight patients had serial paired urine collections performed. In all of the cases, the trend of increasing or decreasing 24-hour urine protein excretion was predicted by the P:C ratio. CONCLUSION: Our data support the use of single voided P:C ratio in hospitalized pregnant patients to predict the 24-hour urine result. In addition, the P:C ratio appears to predict trends in protein excretion over time.

AB  - Background: Withholding gonadotrophins (coasting) can reduce the risk of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in patients having assisted reproduction therapy. This requires daily serum estradiol (E2) measurements, which occasionally have been seen to decline suddenly and sharply. Methods: To increase the sensitivity of the coasting programme we measured serum FSH in parallel with E2 in patients at risk of developing OHSS. Results: Out of a total of 1240 cycles, 106 were coasted and in 89 both serum E2 and FSH were measured at least twice during the coasting period. One case of late severe OHSS was encountered in the study group. The serum FSH declined by a rate of 24.3 Â± 4.5% per day. Serum E2 level reached a 'safe level' of &lt;10 000 pmol/l when the serum FSH declined to 5 IU/l or less. Conclusion: The results from this study show that measuring serum E2 and FSH can assist in predicting the point at which serum E2 has declined to a level safe enough to administer the trigger HCG.

AB  - There are specific pharmacology issues related to women's unique physiology, including the hormonal changes that occur throughout their life span. Studies have shown alterations in drug metabolism in relation to phase of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or after menopause. In the brain, hormones can alter the response to drugs through various mechanisms. Estrogen and other compounds can bind to the estrogen receptor and modulate a wide range of activities within the cell. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated sexual dimorphism in the brain in terms of both the type of response to estrogen and the response as related to timing of administration. Many normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These changes during pregnancy are dramatic rises in levels of estrogen and progesterone, increases in maternal blood volume, altered protein binding resulting from a drop in albumin levels, and a rise in levels of other plasma proteins. The field of chronobiology offers a way to study these changes in biological functions. Chronopharmacology is the study of how biological rhythms, particularly 24-hour, menstrual cycle, and annual rhythms, impact the pharamcokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs as a function of their timing. Chronopharmacokinetics is the study of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of medicines according to the time of day, menstrual cycle, or year. In addition to applying chronobiology to the study of drugs used in women, new technologies were addressed from computer modeling, pharmacogenetics (genetics of the response to drugs), and in vivo drug metabolism studies.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether the diurnal blood pressure profiles in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia and/or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) differ from those in normal pregnant controls, and, if so, to establish whether such a difference is accompanied by altered diurnal rhythms of fetal heart rate (FHR) and its variation. Methods: Twenty-two women in the third trimester of pregnancy with pre-eclampsia, IUGR, or both, entered the study. Eleven healthy pregnant women served as controls. Maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate (MHR) were determined automatically at 30-min intervals during a period of 26 h starting at 09.00. During the study period, nine 1-h recordings of FHR were made at predetermined timepoints. FHR was analyzed numerically. Results: Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and MHR showed diurnal patterns, with the highest values during the day and a trough during the night in all women. Daytime and night-time blood pressures were higher in pre-eclamptic women (p < 0.001), and the day-night difference was smaller than in controls (p < 0.001). Diurnal patterns of FHR and its variation did not differ qualitatively between the three study groups. However, FHR was affected by the maternal blood pressure profile, and all FHR parameters and their diurnal ranges were quantitatively different in IUGR fetuses (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In pre-eclamptic women, there was blunting of the diurnal blood pressure profile. This altered maternal hemodynamics was associated with a similar reduction in FHR amplitude during the 26-h period but not with FHR variation. Although diurnal rhythms of FHR and its variation persisted qualitatively in the IUGR fetuses, they seemed to have been reset quantitatively, leading to a flattened diurnal pattern.

AB  - Background: Progesterone is central to the maintenance of pregnancy, and is thus the ideal target for fertility regulation. Two mechanisms by which progesterone can be targeted are: receptor blockade and reduction of progesterone production through enzyme inhibition. Mifepristone, a receptor blocker, is usually given as 'pretreatment' prior to prostaglandin administration in mid-trimester termination of pregnancy (TOP). Unfortunately, there are difficulties accessing mifepristone in developing countries and TOP is therefore performed using prostaglandins alone, which results in unacceptably long induction-to-abortion intervals. Trilostane is a 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibition which reduces progesterone production. In these mid-trimester studies it is evaluated as a method of pretreatment prior to misoprostol administration. Methods: Three consecutive randomized controlled trials comparing different trilostane regimens for pretreatment were performed. In study 1, trilostane was compared with placebo; in study 2, two doses of trilostane were compared (1080 mg and 720 mg); in study 3, the effect of adding danazol to trilostane as combination therapy was evaluated. The primary outcome in all the studies was the induction-to-abortion interval. Serum progesterone, estradiol and cortisol were measured serially during treatment. Results: In study 1, 48 women were randomized. The median induction-to-abortion interval was 9 h in the trilostane group and 18.5 h in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Progesterone and estradiol production was significantly reduced in the women receiving trilostane, with maintenance of diurnal cortisol variation. Twenty-eight women were randomized in study 2, which demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the induction-to-abortion interval using 1080 mg and 720 mg trilostane when compared with the higher doses used in study 1. Study 3, in which 40 women were included, failed to show any additional benefit using combination therapy with danazol and trilostane. Conclusions: Trilostane is an effective pretreatment agent in mid-trimester TOP.

AB  - The gold standard for clinical blood pressure measurement continues to be readings taken by a physician using a mercury sphygmomanometer, but this is changing as mercury is gradually being phased out. The oscillometric technique, which primarily detects mean arterial pressure, is increasingly popular for use in electronic devices. Other methods include ultrasound (used mainly to detect systolic pressure) and the finger cuff method of Penaz, which can record beat-to-beat pressure noninvasively from the finger. The preferred location of measurement is the upper arm, but errors may occur because of changes in the position of the arm. Other technical sources of error include inappropriate cuff size and too rapid deflation of the cuff. Clinic readings may be unrepresentative of the patient's true blood pressure because of the white coat effect, which is defined as the difference between the clinic readings and the average daytime blood pressure. Patients with elevated clinic pressure and normal daytime pressure are said to have white coat hypertension. There are three commonly used methods for measuring blood pressure for clinical purposes: clinic readings, self-monitoring by the patient at home, and 24-hour ambulatory readings. Self-monitoring is growing rapidly in popularity and is generally carried out using electronic devices that work on the oscillometric technique. Although standard validation protocols exist, many devices on the market have not been tested for accuracy. Such devices can record blood pressure from the upper arm, wrist, or finger, but the arm is preferred. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring has been found to be the best predictor of cardiovascular risk in the individual patient and is the only technique that can describe the diurnal rhythm of blood pressure accurately. Ambulatory monitoring is mainly used for diagnosing hypertension, whereas self-monitoring is used for following the response to treatment. Different techniques of blood pressure measurement may be preferred in certain situations. In infants the ultrasound technique is best, whereas in pregnancy and after exercise the diastolic pressure may be hard to measure using the conventional auscultatory method. In obese subjects it is important to use a cuff of the correct size.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the association between fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram patterns during overnight sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected prospectively between December 1, 1999, and June 30, 2001. Initially, the participating patients were asked to complete a 66-question survey for the assessment of maternal perception of sleep quality that was referred to as the sleep disturbance score: a continuous score from 0 (no evidence of sleep disturbance) to 110 (extreme sleep disturbance). Second, a subgroup of patients was monitored overnight by concomitant fetal heart rate and maternal electroencephalogram tracings. Statistical analysis included the Student t test, chi2 test, logistic regression, and Cramer's V contingency correlation. RESULTS: One hundred two singleton pregnancies formed the study population. The mean sleep disturbance score was 26.7 +/- 9.9. Maternal age was the only variable that correlated with sleep disturbance score. A subgroup of 11 patients was studied overnight. A significant correlation between active fetal sleep and maternal wakefulness was demonstrated in 6 patients. The mean sleep disturbance score for these patients was significantly higher than for patients without such correlation (P =.04). CONCLUSION: This study establishes an association between fetal activity and maternal wakefulness, which explains many of the maternal awakenings during sleep in the third trimester.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on the pregnant women. METHOD: 465 women in pregnancy were studied by random. The snoring rate, the relation with hyper blood pressure and preeclamptism, and the influence on infant were observed. RESULT: The magnificent statistics shows total snoring rate is 24.7%(115/465). 21.3%(92/442) is after pregnancy, of them, 28.7% meet the standard of OSAS, 12.17% with hyper blood pressure, 7.8% with preeclamptism, 5.2% infant with aplasia. CONCLUSION: Diseases incidence with OSAS is more oboious than that with normal pregnant women. OSAS has a marked1 influence on pregnancy. Pregnant women with obvious OSAS can be regard as an independent factor of high risk pregnancy. We should pay more attentions to them in their early stage.

AB  - Objectives - A survey of the effects of pregnancy on parasomnias. Material and methods - In an area of a central hospital and the maternity care units in the nearby rural community, women were interviewed during and after their pregnancy with a series of five questionnaires to assess the frequency of their parasomnias. The first questionnaire covered the 3 months before becoming pregnant, the next three the trimesters of pregnancy and the last one the 3 months after delivery. Altogether 325 mothers filled all the five questionnaires and constitute the study group. Results - The total number of parasomnias declined (P < 0.001) during pregnancy and even more among the primiparas than among the multiparas (difference until third trimester, P = 0.02). Among various parasomnias reported, sleep talking and sleepwalking decreased from the prepregnant period to the second trimester (22.8 vs 12.6%, change P = 0.003), and the reported sleep starts also diminished from the prepregnant time to the first trimester (78.5 vs 63.1%, P < 0.001), but these phenomena did not change further during the follow-up. Altogether 55.7% of the women reported having nightmares 3 months before the pregnancy, and 47.7, 49.5, 41.2 and 40.3% (change from the prepregnant period, P < 0.001), respectively, at first, second and third trimester and after the delivery. Reported hypnagogic hallucinations decreased from the prepregnant time to the first trimester (9.8 vs 6.5%, P = 0.027), but returned thereafter to the previous level. During the prepregnant period, 25.8% of the women reported bruxism and only 19.9% during the first trimester (P = 0.009). Though the prevalence of sleep paralysis decreased during the first trimester of pregnancy, it was the only parasomnia that increased during later pregnancy (from 5.7 to 13.3% in the second trimester, P < 0.013). Conclusions - The reported frequency of most parasomnias decreases during pregnancy and even more in primiparas than multiparas.

AB  - Interest in cobedding multiple-gestation infants has grown as focus has increased on the developmental approach to the care of the neonate. Little data, however, exist on the infants' response to cobedding. It is important to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and physiologic impact of this practice. Cobedding was offered to parents of twin infants < 37 weeks gestation, without arterial lines or ventilator requirements, by the health care team according to standard practice in our nursery. After parental informed consent, infants were placed on an event-recording cardiorespiratory monitor for 12 hours before cobedding and for the first 12 hours of cobedding. Recordings were evaluated by an investigator blinded to the bedding status of the infant. Apnea (a pause of respiration > 10 seconds, central apnea), bradycardia (a decline in heart rate to < 80 beats per minute), periodic breathing (a respiratory pattern in which there are â¥ 3 pauses in respiration of â¥ 3 seconds with < 20 seconds of breathing between pauses), adverse events (changes in medication, changes in oxygen requirements, temperature instability, the need for sepsis evaluation, or death) were evaluated. Other physiologic parameters were obtained through the use of standard bedside monitoring. Eleven sets of preterm infants, n = 22, with a mean gestation of 31.8 Â± 2.9 weeks and a mean birth weight of 1,698.7 Â± 552.0 grams were studied. Infants were evaluated at a corrected gestational age of 33.5 Â± 1.9 weeks and a mean weight of 1,713.2 Â± 484.0 grams. The number of events of central apnea before cobedding (57) was greater than those recorded during cobedding (18), p<0.05. There was no difference found in any of the other parameters compared. The numbers of events recorded before and during cobedding were compared by Student's t-test and significance was determined by p < 0.05. No adverse events (AE) were noted, and all infants remained cobedded throughout the study. This preliminary study suggests that cobedding of healthy preterm twins showed no increase in adverse events. Of the physiologic parameters studied, only the occurrence of central apnea changed with cobedding. This decrease in central apnea may reflect a change in sleep pattern due to more frequent arousal by the twin. Alternatively, a more regular breathing pattern may reflect a positive physiological response to contact between twins.

AB  - Preterm infants have traditionally been considered at risk for positional deformities and delayed or atypical development. During the last decade, however, similar problems have increasingly been documented in normal infants born at term gestation, with recommendations of supine sleeping for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome often implicated as a causal factor. This article seeks to inform and educate neonatal and pediatric nurses on positional and postural influences in normal and delayed infant development, including the relationship of sleep and play positions to developmental issues. An observant nurse who understands normal development, can recognize atypical postures, and is knowledgeable about potential developmental consequences is in a position to intervene at the earliest interaction with the family. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) sleep position guidelines, however, must not be compromised in the process. Current AAP rationale and guidelines for prevention of sudden infant death syndrome are summarized to facilitate nursing efforts to correctly model and teach infant caregivers. Common-sense suggestions for hospital and community-based nurses to help parents avoid preventable developmental delay while reinforcing current sleep position guidelines are presented.

AB  - PURPOSE: To present guidelines for the recognition, management, and referral of pregnancy rhinitis with a goal of improving the quality of the pregnancy experience for women afflicted with this condition. DATA SOURCES: A case study illustrating the presentation of a severe case of pregnancy rhinitis is followed a literature review of etiology, diagnosis, and management strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy rhinitis is a condition of clinical importance that is frequently exacerbated by use of intranasal decongestant sprays. The resulting rhinitis medicamentosa exacerbates the nasal obstruction, with resulting sleep disruptions that negatively impact the experience of pregnancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurse practitioners may miss opportunities to provide support, anticipatory guidance, and symptom relief. Anticipatory guidance that stresses the critical necessity of avoiding nasal spray decongestants, environmental modification, use of intranasal saline, moderate exercise, and nasal strips for subjective relief may have the potential to markedly decrease escalation of the condition to a serious disorder.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of body position on sidestream, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) wave measurements in maturing infants. Sidestream EtCO2 wave patterns were analysed longitudinally in 20 preterm infants (born at â¥32 wk) at 32-37 wk gestation, and in 39 full-term controls. Capnography measurements included maximal EtCO2, inspired CO2 and frequency of apnoea events (&gt;3 s) in the supine, supine with inclination, side and prone positions. Apnoea frequency decreased during maturation, and was less prevalent in the prone than in the supine and side positions in preterm as well as in term infants (p &lt; 0.05). No clinically significant apnoea episodes were found in our cohort. EtCO2 in term infants was lower than that in preterm infants (p &lt; 0.05) and was not affected by sleep position in the most premature (&lt;33 wk) and in term infants (&gt;36 wk). EtCO2 was higher in the prone position than in supine or side positions in infants between 33 and 35 wk gestation (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Short apnoeic episodes decrease during maturation, and are less prevalent in the prone position in maturing infants (32-37 wk). Only modest changes in EtCO2 were recorded in the different positions during maturation.

AB  - Malaria is a major cause of illness and an indirect cause of mortality in pregnant women. It can also cause stillbirths and low-birthweight babies. We have shown previously that pregnant women attracted twice as many Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the principal African malaria vector, as their non-pregnant counterparts over distances of about 15 m. In the current study (in 1998/99) we compared the short-range attractiveness of both pregnant and non-pregnant women sleeping under untreated bednets in Gambian villages. First, we measured the rate of mosquito entry under bednets and, second, we calculated the proportion of mosquitoes biting mothers under each bednet compared to their children. The feeding preference of An. gambiae collected under nets was determined by DNA fingerprinting blood samples from human subjects sleeping under each bednet and comparing these to fingerprints obtained from mosquito bloodmeals. Pregnant women were more attractive to An. gambiae mosquitoes than non-pregnant women under an untreated bednet. The number of mosquitoes entering bednets each night was 1.7-4.5 times higher in the pregnant group (P = 0.02) and pregnant women also received a higher proportion of bites under the bednets than did non-pregnant women (70% vs 52%, P = 0.001). This study clearly demonstrates that pregnant women are more exposed to malaria parasites than other women, which contributes to the greater vulnerability of pregnant women to malaria.

AB  - Background: Failure to arouse from sleep has been postulated as a mechanism to explain the final pathway of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Methods: We have reviewed the effects of the major risk factors for SIDS, prone sleep position, maternal smoking, prematurity and recent infection on arousability from sleep. In human infants it has been consistently demonstrated that arousal from sleep in response to a variety of stimuli is more difficult to induce from quiet sleep (QS) compared to active sleep (AS) over the first 6 months of life. Results: In the prone position both stimulus-induced and spontaneous arousability from both QS and AS were impaired at 2-3 weeks and 2-3 months, but not at 5-6 months of age in both term and preterm infants. In term infants exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy both stimulus-induced and spontaneous arousability were impaired when infants slept supine in QS at 2-3 months of age. Healthy preterm infants showed no impairment in arousability compared with term infants at matched postconceptional ages. However, preterm infants with a history of apnoea and bradycardia of prematurity showed decreased arousal responses in both QS and AS and this impairment was positively correlated to their 'perinatal risk score'. Infants who had recently suffered an infection requiring hospitalization showed decreased arousability in QS on the day of discharge when compared to 2 weeks later when they were completely well. Conclusions: In summary it has been found that the major risk factors for SIDS identified from epidemiological studies also decrease arousability from sleep in infants. We propose that this decreased arousability from sleep may be involved in the final pathway of SIDS. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More than a third of women experience back pain during pregnancy. The pain can interfere with work, daily activities and sleep. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review was to assess the effects of preventive interventions and treatments for pelvic and back pain in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (October 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2001). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of any treatment to reduce the incidence or severity of pelvic/back pain in pregnancy, or to prevent pelvic/back pain arising in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials are included in this review involving 376 women. One randomized trial compared water gymnastics from 20 weeks with no treatment. The authors report less pain in the treatment group but the data are hard to interpret; there was a difference in rates of absence from work after 32 weeks of pregnancy (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence intervals 0.16-0.88). In another trial, acupuncture was rated as giving 'good' or 'excellent' help more frequently than physiotherapy (odds ratio 6.58, 95% confidence intervals 1.0-43.16) but this may reflect the benefit of individual compared with group therapy. One trial of 109 women compared the use of a special shaped pillow to fit under the woman's abdomen (Ozzlo pillow) with a standard pillow. Fewer women rated the Ozzlo pillow of 'little help' compared with the standard pillow (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.58). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Water gymnastics appear to reduce back pain in pregnancy. More women are able to continue at work. Specially shaped pillows help reduce back pain in late pregnancy and improve sleep. It is a pity that the Ozzlo pillow seems no longer to be available. Both physiotherapy and acupuncture may reduce back and pelvic pain. Individual acupuncture sessions were rated as more help than group physiotherapy sessions.

AB  - Drug treatment of anxiety and insomnia during pregnancy and lactation is emphasized by a high prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders among fertile women and by a high consumption of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. Pregnancy has been associated with anxiety; moreover, pregnancy and postpartum are risk periods for onset or exacerbation of anxiety disorders. The results of studies investigating impact of anxiety on fetus are equivocal. Onset or exacerbation of obssesive compulsive disorder is frequently observed during pregnancy or after childbirth. Previous assumptions that pregnancy protects from panic disorder, have not been confirmed. Posttraumatic stress disorder can occur as a result of delivery, abortion or stillbirth. Tokophobia, fearful avoidance of pregnancy, can be included among specific phobias. Sleep disorders are frequent during pregnancy and postpartum. Administration of benzodiazepines may be associated with congenital malformations, especially oral clefts, although new findings are inconclusive. Similarly, their neurobehavioral toxicity remains questionable. Benzodiazepines in neonates and breast-fed infants may cause sedation, weight loss, dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Well-known is the "floppy infant syndrome". In treatment of anxiety disorders in pregnancy and lactation, non-pharmacological interventions, such as psychotherapy, are preferred. If there is a need for drug treatment, antidepressants, e.g., SSRI's are the first-line choice. Benzodiazepines should be completely avoided during first trimester, short-acting drags can be given in the lowest effective dose and they should be gradually tapered-off prior to the delivery. In lactation, short-acting benzodiazepines can be also administered; low single doses are safe, if the infant is monitored for drowsiness. For insomnia, zopiclon can be prescribed in pregnancy and zolpidem during breast-feeding.

AB  - We report results of the first longitudinal study of outcome correlates of parent-child bedsharing. Two hundred five families in nonconventional and conventional family lifestyles have been followed since 1975. A target child in each family was followed from the third trimester of mother's pregnancy through age 18 years. Bedsharing in early childhood was found to be significantly associated with increased cognitive competence measured at age 6 years, but the effect size was small. At age 6 years, bedsharing in infancy and early childhood was not associated with sleep problems, sexual pathology, or any other problematic consequences. At age 18 years, bedsharing in infancy and childhood was unrelated to pathology or problematic consequences, nor was it related to beneficial consequences. We discuss these results in light of widespread fears of harm caused by parent-child bedsharing. We suggest that such fears are without warrant if bedsharing is practiced safely as part of a complex of valued and related family practices.

AB  - Objective: to describe women's experiences and perceptions of their first pregnancy. Design, setting and participants: a qualitative study, using grounded theory. Data were obtained from 13 women whose interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Interviews were conducted in the women's homes on three occasions during pregnancy. Findings: the women's experiences were varied and diverse. Most had difficulty coping with the physical and emotional symptoms of pregnancy. Loss of control caused anxiety. Need for support emerged as important. Antenatal education classes were favourably commented upon, however, the women wanted more information on breast feeding, baby feeding/sleeping patterns and behaviour, and self-care. Key conclusions and implications for practice: midwives committed to a wellness, woman-centred model of care and willing to provide continuity of care should endeavour to implement this model in the hospital environment. Teaching in the ward or childbirth/parenting programmes should not be compromised by midwives who believe that pregnant women cannot learn. A comprehensive review of the philosophy, content, delivery and evaluation of current childbirth/parenthood programmes should be undertaken. Also, a review of the qualifications and aptitude of educators conducting the programmes. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a disease of unknown cause. The occurence of SIDS is rare during the first month of life, increases to a peak between 2 and 4 months old, and then declines. The following have been consistently identified across studies as independent risk factors for SIDS: prone sleep position, sleeping on a soft surface, maternal smoking during pregnancy, young maternal age, bedsharing, prematurity and/or low birth weight, and male sex. Although the cause of the sudden infant death syndrome is multifactorial, contemporary hypotheses include defects in arousal or cardiorespiratory control. The interesting is hypothesis that prolongation of the QT interval may have a role in the pathogenesis of SIDS.

AB  - Pulmonary embolism (PE) and amniotic fluid embolism are uncommon complications during pregnancy, but they nonetheless require rapid diagnosis and treatment because of their high mortality rates. Heparin is the treatment of choice for PE, and prophylactic heparin is indicated for women who had PE during a previous pregnancy. Low molecular weight heparin is a safe and effective alternative to unfractionated heparin. Women with amniotic fluid embolism typically present with sudden dyspnea and hypotension. The mortality rate is 50% to 60% within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms. Women who have cystic fibrosis or pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis often experience a decline in pulmonary function during pregnancy, while those with sarcoidosis may show improvement. Regardless of the pulmonary disorder, the goal is to avoid hypoxemia, which can result in profound adverse maternal and fetal effects.

AB  - Methods. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed on 40 women (20 hypertensive, 20 normotensive) on a hospitalised and non-hospitalised day. Mean blood pressure differences Results. Mean heart rate was higher at home (1.79, p = 0.04) than in hospital, but there were no significant differences in mean systolic (1.30 mmHg, p = 0.06), diastolic (0.78 mmHg, p = 0.21) or mean arterial blood pressure (0.81 mmHg, p = 0.19) between the hospitalised and non hospitalised day for the group overall. Nevertheless, the range of individual responses was wide (-8.5 mmHg to 15.4 mmHg mean arterial blood pressure). Hypertensive women receiving antihypertensive therapy had significantly greater differences in mean arterial blood pressure between the hospital and non-hospital day when compared to the rest of the group (5.8 mmHg, compared to 3.3 mm Hg, p = 0.02). Conclusions. Although hospitalisation does not significantly lower blood pressure in pregnant women as a group, women receiving antihypertensive therapy demonstrate significant differences in blood pressure between hospital and home. Based on conventional blood pressure measurements alone, these women may be at risk of either under treatment, or over treatment, of blood pressure.

AB  - PROBLEM/CONDITION: Various maternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy (e.g., unintended pregnancy, late entry into prenatal care, cigarette smoking, not breast-feeding) are associated with adverse health outcomes for both the mother and the infant. Information regarding maternal behaviors and experiences is needed to monitor trends, to enhance the understanding of the relations between behaviors and health outcomes, to plan and evaluate programs, to direct policy decisions, and to monitor progress toward Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This report covers data from 1993 through 1999. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver a live-born infant. PRAMS employs a mixed-mode data collection methodology; up to three self-administered surveys are mailed to a sample of mothers, and nonresponders are followed up with a telephone interview. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS analysis data sets. PRAMS generates statewide estimates of various perinatal health topics among women delivering a live infant. Data for 1999 from 17 states are examined. In addition, trend data are examined for 12 states that had at least 3 years of data during 1993-1999. RESULTS: In 1999, the prevalence of unintended pregnancy resulting in a live birth ranged from 33.7% to 52% across the 17 states. During 1993-1999, only one state reported a decreasing trend in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy. Women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report unintended pregnancy. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care ranged from 16.1% to 29.9%. The prevalence of late or no entry into prenatal care significantly decreased over time in seven of the 12 states with trend data. In general, women aged <20 years, black women, women with less than a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were more likely to report late or no entry into prenatal care. The prevalence of smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy ranged from 6.2% to 27.2%, and the prevalence decreased in five states from 1993 to 1999. Overall, smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy was associated with younger age (<25 years), non-Hispanic ethnicity, having less than or equal to a high school education, receiving Medicaid, and delivering a low birthweight infant. The prevalence of physical abuse by a husband or partner during pregnancy ranged from 2.1% to 6.3%. No trends were observed for physical abuse from 1996 to 1999, the only years for which these data were available. Across the 17 states, only Medicaid status was consistently associated with experiencing physical abuse during pregnancy. The prevalence of breast-feeding initiation ranged from 48% to 89%. Ten of 12 states with trend data reported increases in the prevalence of breast-feeding initiation. Overall, women aged <20 years, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were less likely to breast-feed. The prevalence of breast-feeding duration for at least 4 weeks ranged from 34.9% to 78.1%. From 1993 to 1999, increases in levels of breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks were observed in eight states. Women aged <25 years, black women, women with less than or equal to a high school education, and women receiving Medicaid were generally less likely to breast-feed for at least 4 weeks. The prevalence of back sleep position for infants ranged from 35.1% to 74.6%. Increases in the use of the back sleep position were observed in all 12 states with trend data from 1996 to 1999. Black race and having less than or equal to a high school education were consistently associated with not using the back sleep position. INTERPRETATION: For surveillance during 1993-1999, the majority or all states observed increases in breast-feeding initiation, breast-feeding for at least 4 weeks, and back sleep position. Approximately one half of the states observed decreases for late or no entry into prenatal care and smoking during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Little or no progress was observed in the prevalence of unintended pregnancy or physical abuse during pregnancy. With few exceptions, the 17 states failed to meet the Healthy People 2000 objectives for the seven reported behaviors in 1999. Certain de

AB  - Background: This article is a critical review of the efficacy of selected alternative treatments for unipolar depression including exercise, stress management techniques, acupuncture, St. John's wort, bright light, and sleep deprivation. Issues related to women across the life span, including pregnancy and lactation, are highlighted. Data Sources: Evidence of efficacy is based on randomized controlled trials. A distinction is made between studies that address depressive symptoms and studies that address depressive disorders. The review emphasizes issues related to effectiveness, such as treatment availability, acceptability, safety, and cost and issues relevant to women. Data Synthesis: Exercise, stress reduction methods, bright light exposure, and sleep deprivation hold greater promise as adjuncts to conventional treatment than as monotherapies for major depression. The evidence to date is not sufficiently compelling to suggest the use of St. John's wort in favor of or as an alternative to existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration-regulated compounds. Initial evidence suggests that acupuncture might be an effective alternative monotherapy for major depression, single episode. Conclusion: This review indicates that some unconventional treatments hold promise as alternative or complementary treatments for unipolar depression in women and have the potential to contribute to its long-term management. Additional research is needed before further recommendations can be made, and there is an urgent need to carefully document and report the frequency of minor and major side effects.

AB  - Fatigue is a common complaint of patients seen in primary care. Factors that contribute to fatigue in a patient population include poor health status, psychological stress, poor nutrition, and pregnancy. Less well understood are factors that contribute to fatigue among healthy, nonpregnant individuals. Within the framework of the theory of unpleasant symptoms, 40 healthy young smoking and nonsmoking adults between the ages of 18 and 35 were evaluated to determine self-report level of fatigue and contributing physiological, psychological, and situational factors. Results indicate that while self-report of fatigue did not vary in this population based on gender, subjects who were moderate to heavy cigarette smokers were significantly more fatigued than were nonsmokers (F= 10.24, df = 1, 38, P < 0.01), with the effect being specific to male smokers. Self-report of fatigue did not correlate with body mass index, baseline inflammatory or immune status, or blood pressure. Positive psychological and situational predictors of fatigue included depression (r = 0.556, P < 0.001), state anxiety (r = 0.569, P < 0.001), sleep quality (r = â0.399, P < 0.05), and sleep quantity (r = â0.411, P < 0.05). These results suggest that psychological and situational factors are key contributors to fatigue in young adults and that smoking is a risk factor for fatigue in men. Â© 2002, Sage Publications.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to determine whether S100B protein levels in cord blood and the development of fetal behavioral states were altered and interrelated in small-for-dates (SFD) fetuses. Methods: Umbilical cord blood samples were collected from 12 SFD fetuses with normal umbilical artery (UA) Doppler findings, from six SFD fetuses with abnormal Doppler waveform patterns and from 36 controls matched for gestational age. S100B protein levels were measured by means of a specific radioimmunoassay. Fetal behavioral state recordings were made before delivery by Cesarean section and data were expressed as percentage of quiet sleep coincidence (C1F), of activity state coincidence (C2-4F) and of no coincidence (NOC). Flow velocimetry waveforms were recorded from the uterine artery, UA and fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA). Results: Mean S100B protein levels in umbilical plasma were significantly higher in the six SFD infants with abnormal prenatal Doppler findings (3.31 Â± 0.65 Î¼g/l) than in SFD infants with normal Doppler findings (1.56 Â± 0.35 Î¼g/l) and in controls (1.23 Â± 0.43 Î¼g/l). Similarly in these fetuses NOC was higher and C2F significantly lower (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in C1F. S100B concentrations were correlated with the UA pulsatility index (PI) (r = 0.78, p < 0.01), with the MCA PI (r = -0.78, p < 0.01) and with the UA PI/MCA PI ratio (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). Also, NOC and C2F percentages were correlated with the UA PI (r = 0.61, p < 0.01 and r = -0.61, p < 0.01, respectively), with the MCA P1 (r = -0.72, p < 0.001 and r = 0.66, p < 0.01, respectively), and with the UA PI/MCA PI ratio (r = 0.60, p < 0.01 and r = -0.54, p < 0.05, respectively). NOC was also correlated with S100B protein (r = 0.48, p < 0.05); the correlation of S100B protein and C2F almost reached significance (r = -0.47, p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a relationship between a biochemical marker of brain development and/or integrity and the development of fetal behavioral states, offering additional information on brain maturation in normal and high-risk pregnancies.

AB  - Aims : This study was carried out to investigate how the locus of control (LOC) varies between those who stop smoking in connection with pregnancy and those who do not. The LOC refl ects the extent to which a person is in control of her or his life events. Methods: One hundred and two women who were regular smokers at the time of conception and paid their fi rst visits to the antenatal clinic (ANC) on account of the current pregnancy participated. The study was quantitative and questionnaire based, covering background factors, smoking habits, and the LOC. One hundred of the women were met a second time after the delivery. Smoking habits were monitored by the content of carbon monoxide in expired air. The LOC was recorded on a VAS scale (0-10). A lower index was consistent with a more internal LOC and a higher with a more external LOC. Results : The median LOC found was 4.0 (range 1.1-7.9). The LOC was not correlated to the CO in expired air. Younger age was linked to a more internal LOC, while worse sleep was correlated to a more external LOC (p<0.05). No differences were found between those who stopped smoking and those who did not. This was the case in both light and heavy smokers. Conclusion : The LOC does not seem to infl uence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy. Â© 2002, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The AAP has alerted pediatricians to the importance of safe sleep environment for infants. The elements of a safe sleep environment include supine sleep position, safe crib, and avoidance of smoke exposure, soft bedding, and overheating. With the Back to Sleep campaign, prone sleeping among all U.S. infants has decreased to less than 20%, and the incidence of SIDS has decreased 40%. However, the decline in SIDS and prone sleeping has leveled off in recent years. Further declines may be possible with decreasing other modifiable risk factors, such as prenatal and postnatal exposure to cigarette smoking. Prior studies have demonstrated that health care professional advice is influential in determining infant care practices. It is important that physicians caring for infants be aware of the importance of a safe sleep environment and understand other modifiable risk factors for SIDS. We surveyed a random sample of 3,717 physicians in North Carolina and the metropolitan Washington, DC, area to determine knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding SIDS and SIDS risk reduction among physicians caring for pregnant women and infants. Twenty-three percent (835) responded. Most physicians are aware of prone sleeping and cigarette smoke exposure as risk factors for SIDS. Almost all physicians agree that there are measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS, and they consider it important to discuss SIDS and SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents of young infants. In spite of this belief, only 56% of family/general practitioners, 18% of obstetrician-gynecologists, and 79% of pediatricians discuss SIDS routinely. Only 35% of pediatricians, 15% of family/general practitioners, and 16% of obstetrician-gynecologists provide written information. In addition, only 38% of physicians recommend supine, while 50% recommend side or back, 6% side, and 7% prone. Only two thirds of pediatricians and one third of family/general practitioners are aware that the AAP recommends supine as the preferred sleep position for infants. Pediatricians are more likely to be aware of the AAP recommendation (p<0.0001) and to discuss SIDS risk reduction strategies with parents (p=0.03). We conclude that many physicians who care for infants are unaware of the AAP's most current recommendation for sleep position and are incorrectly recommending the side position. Physicians may also be unaware of other sleep environment hazards. Further educational efforts must continue for physicians who provide care to pregnant women and children to ensure a continued decline in the incidence of SIDS.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a frequent medical condition and is associated with cognitive impairments in adults and with hyperactivity and decreased school performance in children. In an adult rodent model, intermittent hypoxia (IH), such as occurs in OSA, is associated with neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus and cortex and with spatial learning deficits. Because a unique developmental window of neural vulnerability to IH is present, we hypothesized that exposure to IH throughout the vulnerable ages would result in increased behavioral impairments in the juvenile rat. Rat pups were therefore exposed to either room air or IH beginning at postnatal (PN) d 10 until PN d 30. Learning and memory were assessed via a standard place-training version of the Morris water maze beginning at PN d 25. Locomotor activity was assessed on PN d 29 and 30. Pups exposed to IH displayed significant spatial learning impairments, and exposed male rats but not female rats displayed increased locomotor activity in the open field. Collectively, these findings indicate that exposure to IH at an age that corresponds to the peak incidence of OSA in children induces substantial learning impairment and gender-dependent behavioral hyperactivity in the juvenile rat. We postulate that this novel experimental model may allow for future exploration of mechanisms underlying the neurobehavioral deficits of children with OSA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: During recent years, coincident with the recommendation to position infants supine, the incidence of posterior deformational plagiocephaly has increased dramatically. The purpose of our study was to determine whether early signs of cranial flattening could be detected in healthy neonates and to document incidence and potential risk factors. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed in healthy newborns. Physical findings, anthropometric cranial measurements, and data on pregnancy and birth were recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of localized cranial flattening in singletons was 13%; other anomalous head shapes were found in 11% of single-born neonates. In twins, localized flat areas were much more frequent with an incidence of 56%. The following risk factors for cranial deformation were identified: assisted vaginal delivery, prolonged labor, unusual birth position, primiparity, and male gender. CONCLUSION: We propose that localized lateral or occipital cranial flattening at birth is a precursor to posterior deformational plagiocephaly. The infant lies supine, with the head turned to the flattened area, and is unable to roll. Intrauterine risk factors for localized cranial flattening are the same as for deformational plagiocephaly. To avoid postnatal progression from a localized cranial flattening to posterior-lateral deformational plagiocephaly, we suggest amending the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics on sleep position: Alternate the head position and allow sleeping on the side and, when awake, supervise prone time.

AB  - Bloodletting was a therapeutic resource issuing from the Galeno-Hippocratical medical tradition. It was applied to purge or deplete one or more humors excessively produced by or accumulated in some organ or part of the body. The bloodletting procedure was introduced in Mexico by the Spaniards during the Conquest. The early medical authors, AgustÃ­n FarfÃ¡n and Alonso LÃ³pez de Hinojosos, recommended it for almost every illness. In Mexico, bloodletting became useless at the end of the XIXth Century, when new physiopathological ideas, including those related to cellular theory, were accepted. In the XIXth Century, the vigent concept about plethoric states was formulated in physiological terms: after initial excitation or irritation steps, the blood vessels responded with vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation, and consequently blood flowed in proportional quantity to inflammation; after that, blood became stagnant and then bloodletting had beneficial effects over plethora and regulation over nervous system. Plethora's symptoms were: torpidity, malaise, cerebral fatigue, headache, flushes, and somnolence. People at risk of having plethora were individuals with sanguineous temperament, sedentary women mainly if they had menstrual disturbances and during pregnancy. Bloodletting was employed in Mexico to treat mental diseases. Ignacio de Bartolachc recommended it to hysterical patients; his reported results were poor. In the XIXth Century, international medical literature consulted by Mexican medical practitioners, as were the works by Pinel, Broussais, Esquirol, Ellis, Morel, bloodletting was indicated in hysteria, mania, melancholical sates, catalepsy, demency, sonambulism, epilepsy, apoplexy, hypocondria, and idiotism. At San Hipolito Hospital, bloodletting was practiced in individuals with sanguineous temperament, apoplectic, with cerebral congestion and its use in mania was restricted. The bloodletting method was leeches application for local extraction or general bloodletting by vessel incision. Bloodletting is a good example to show how medical treatments can adjust to new medical theories.

AB  - Hypericum perforatum is a vegetal compound commonly known as St. John's wort. For decades, it was used in traditional medicine as an astringent, antiseptic and pro-scarring agent externally, and as a treatment for sleep disturbances and depression when orally administered. This plant's mechanism of action is not absolutely clear, but it is seemingly associated with the presence of hypericin, a naphtodianthrone, in its composition. Clinical trials comparing St. John's wort effectiveness versus placebo and standard antidepressants in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression have yielded superior results in the first case, and similar results in the second case. The number of clinical trials, however, is still scarce, and effectiveness extent cannot be definitively concluded. It is well tolerated when administered, and most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue, confusion and sedation. The use of this medicinal plant is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy, because of its abortive properties. On the other hand, the activity of hyperacin and pseudohyperacin - and of flavonoids included in Hypericum perforatum - as inductors of liver enzymes such as CYP1A2 and glutation-S-transferase may stimulate CYP3A4 and glycoprotein P, and may thus interfere with drugs using the CYP1A2, CYP3A4, glutation-S-transferase and glycoprotein P metabolic routes. Blood concentrations of such drugs would be decreased, and it is thus necessary that concomitant drug use be closely monitored. The recommended daily dose for an adult with mild-to-moderate depression is 0.9 to 2.7 mg hyperacin, which is equivalent to 300-900 mg of Hypericum perforatum extract.

AB  - Human breast milk is the best nutrition for human infants. Its advantages over the milk of other species, such as cows, include both a reduced risk for infections, allergies and chronic diseases, together with the full nutritional requirements for growth and development. Breast-feeding is as important for multiples as for singletons. Despite the advantages, multiples receive less breast-feeding than singletons. Common reasons for not breast-feeding multiples include the fear of not fulfilling the infants' needs and the difficulty of coping with the demands on the mother's time. In addition, many multiples are delivered prematurely and by Caesarean section. Maternal pain and discomfort together with anxiety over the infants' condition are not conducive to successful breast-feeding. During lactation, the mother needs to add calories to her daily diet. It has been recommended to add approximately 500-600 kcal/day for each infant. Thus, between eating, nursing and sleeping, life is very busy for the mother of multiples. However, there is evidence that, with appropriate nutrition, one mother can nourish more than one infant. Also, simultaneous breast-feeding can save much time. Combined efforts of parents, close family, friends and the medical team can help to make either full or partial breast-feeding of multiples possible. However, when breast-feeding is not possible, health care workers need to carefully avoid judgmental approaches that may induce feelings of guilt. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estradiol, progesterone and some of their metabolites modulate the activity of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the CNS. The distribution and concentrations of sex steroids in the various CNS regions is partly dependent on the serum levels, but also on the local synthesis of the steroids. In general, estradiol and testosterone exert a stimulatory, progesterone an inhibitory effect on neuronal activities which are mediated by excitatory (e.g. glutamate, aspartate), and inhibitory amino acids (e.g. GABA) and neuropeptides (e.g. Î²-endorphin), respectively. Gonadotropin release is primarily governed by the rhythm of pulsatile secretion of GnRH in the hypothalamus which is controlled by estradiol and progesterone by means of inhibitory or stimulatory modulation of the amplitude and frequency of GnRH pulses. The discharges of GnRH neurons triggered by excitatory amino acids are modulated by estradiol, while the inhibitory effect of progesterone is mediated by GABA and Î²-endorphin which cause hyperpolarization of the GnRH neurons and consequently a reduced pulse frequency. The pulse amplitudes are primarily influenced by estradiol, but neuropeptide Y, neurotensin and noradrenaline contribute to their preovulatory enhancement. The postovulatory rise in core temperature is caused by the increasing level of progesterone and its metabolite 3Î±-pregnanolone, respectively. Despite of this, up to 20% of ovulatory cycles do not show any rise in body temperature. Although 3Î±-pregnanolone has sedative activities, there is no change in sleep quality during the luteal phase due to their low serum levels. It could be demonstrated that performance on tests of articulatory and fine motor skills are enhanced in the late follicular phase as compared to the menstruation phase, while spatial ability was better during menses. Estrogens may influence mood and well-being in a favorable manner, while in predisposed women progesterone may cause symptoms of premenstrual syndrom. In most women there are, however, no cycle-dependent mood changes. An increase in appetite can be observed during the periovulatory phase and before menses, while sexual interest increases in the follicular phase. Somatic complaints (back pain, abdominal pain, breast tenderness) which are highest before and during menstruation, are probably associated with a lowered pain threshold due to a fall in the Î²-endorphin levels in the CNS.

AB  - This article describes infant mental health from two perspectives: why it is relevant and how to implement interventions, including preventive ones. Topics covered are based on evidence available in scientific literature. The first section addresses areas that justify the importance assigned to infants and their emotional well-being. One of them deals with new information about brain development. Recent available information emphasizes the crucial role of sensory/experiential input for the development of the brain in terms of determining the formation of new synapses, influencing cell migration and the "pruning" of refined and dedicated neuronal pathways. Experiences (exposure to language, contingent responses by the caregiver, motion in space) influence the development of the brain. Also, negative and anxiety provoking events as well as psychological trauma cause a negative outcome through this effect. Prolonged and/or severe trauma has been shown to influence negatively the functioning of the limbic system and the capacity of the child to feel empathy and/or compassion, to regulate emotions and to learn new information. New evidence is reviewed from longitudinal research. Several studies have demonstrated that it is possible to "trace back" which elements are necessary during early childhood, to put a child at a high risk of becoming a criminal or severe offender. These include attributes in the child him or herself (restlessness, impulsiveness, lack of fear) together with a history of maltreatment and chronically adverse experiences. Excessive shyness is another fairly persistent trait from early infancy to adulthood. Since these "risk factors" are known, particular children could be targeted for early intervention programs. A follow up study conducted by some of the authors with infants seen in a mental health clinic and followed up to age four, indicates that the strongest predictor of the outcome and functioning of the child at age four is not the severity or type of problems for which the child was originally evaluated. The strongest predictor was the quality of parenting and parenting behaviors of the caregivers as assessed during infancy. This finding suggests the importance of helping parents as early as possible to cope with infant problems in a benign and sensitive way, before negative circles of interaction are entrenched and spiral into an ongoing negative relationship. Together with the studies of risk, those focusing on resilience are summarized. Knowing which traits or experiences are protective against psychopathology is crucial, in order to promote their flourishing in early childhood. Studies with children at high psychosocial risk from Kauai, Hawaii as well as with children from other groups in the world converge in describing resilient traits in early childhood: an easy temperament, a "social orientation", sense of humor, attractiveness and the ability to communicate with others, as well as intelligence. Several experiences are protective, such as having few separations from the mother and having had a sibling when the index child was at least three years old. This knowledge can be used to promote resilient features in children and to develop interventions for those at most risk. Epidemiological evidence suggests that infancy disturbances are not rare, but frequent (15 to 20% of the population). Studies of the prevalence of problems like feeding and sleeping disturbances, excessive crying and disruptive behavior in infancy point in this direction. This justifies the need for early recognition and identification, particularly when they are severe. Excessive crying increases the risk of the child being abused or shaken; likewise sleep disturbance is associated with irritability and hyperactive behavior in the infant. Parents who are deprived of sleep are prone to be more negative and to feel exhausted. Eating disturbances can be associated with failure to thrive. Early malnutrition has been associated with hypertension in middle age, as well as with a higher risk of coronary disease. Maternal depression and domestic violence are rampant in the perinatal period. Maternal depression is associated with more crying and sleeping problems in infancy, and hyperactivity and negative behavior in the school age child. The findings of a survey in a "well-baby clinic" (health surveillance clinic) conducted by some of the authors concur in the finding that parents are worried about their baby's behavior in all these areas and that they readily identify the problems, when asked. Furthermore, their worries are justified. This is in sharp contrast with the tendency in most pediatric settings to "wait and see" hoping that problems in the baby will be solved by themselves. The second part of the review focuses on two issues: techniques of clinical intervention and preventive strategies and their results. There is scant scientific evidence on the efficacy of parent infant psychotherapies. Techniques vary widely in their content and their focus or target population. Strategies like brief parent-infant psychotherapy and the therapeutic consultation are framed psychodynamically and focus on the transgenerational transmission of "fantasmatic" interactions and projections placed on the infant. These appear more suitable for families that are relatively healthier and lacking massive stressors. On the other side of the spectrum, techniques such as interactive guidance and infant-parent psychotherapy are designed for families under more stress, and when the parent child relationship is very negative. These strategies are used with "unreachable families". Interactive guidance attempts to focus on what the parents are doing well through a videotaped feedback given to them, and gradually expanding their repertoire of sensitive and empathic behaviors towards the baby. Infant-parent psychotherapy is long term and involves interventions that are non traditional, like psychotherapy at home, practical help to the parents, and the promotion of a long term relationship of trust between the caregivers and the therapist. The focus is to achieve a "corrective attachment experience" in the parents, which will in turn tender them more sensitive and responsive towards their baby. Multi-modal and flexible techniques are advocated in order to tailor the intervention to the particular needs and style of each family. Finally, evidence on the effectiveness of various prevention programs is reviewed. These are grouped according to the timing of the intervention, from pregnancy to toddlerhood. Evidence suggests that improving marital communication and promoting conflict resolution before the baby is born may enhance maternal sensitivity and lead to a more secure attachment in the infant. There is research on interventions in the perinatal period. These include having psychosocial support during the delivery process. In addition, "bonding" between newborn and mother (without undue intrusion by health care personnel) has positive effects. This involves skin to skin contact and early breast-feeding. These simple interventions have been shown to promote maternal sensitivity, more patience and less behavioral difficulties several months later. The mere demonstration of the abilities of the newborn, his or her uniqueness and preferences as well as an observation of the baby's perceptual abilities, is associated with long term positive behavioral effects. All this points to the importance of conducting an intervention during a "sensitive period". Several meta-analytic studies on home visitation conclude that these programs are most effective if the intervention has a clear focus, is brief and practical help and advice are given to the parents on site. By contrast, with families having a high risk of abusing their child, home visitations are the only hopeful strategy so far.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using a sedative compared to a non-opiate control for NAS due to withdrawal from opiates, and to determine which type of sedative is most effective and safe. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002) and MEDLINE 1966-2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to sedative or control. Control could include another sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included treatment failure (failure to achieve symptom control or use of additional drug treatment), seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies enrolling a total of 285 patients met inclusion criteria (Finnegan 1984, Kahn 1969, Kaltenbach 1986, Khoo 1995, Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in three studies. Phenobarbital compared to supportive care alone has not been shown to reduce treatment failure or time to regain birthweight (one study). However, the duration of supportive care required to be given to infants each day was significantly reduced (MD -162.1 minutes/day, 95% CI -249.2, -75.1). Comparing phenobarbital to diazepam, meta-analysis of two studies found that phenobarbital produced a significant reduction in treatment failure (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24, 0.62). There was no significant difference in duration of treatment or duration of hospital stay. Comparing phenobarbital with chlorpromazine, one study found no significant difference in treatment failure rate. No data for neurodevelopment were available, reported by treatment group as allocated. No trials were eligible that assessed clonidine for NAS. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: In newborn infants with NAS, there is no evidence that phenobarbital, compared with supportive care alone, reduces treatment failure; however, phenobarbital may reduce the daily duration of supportive care needed. Phenobarbital, compared to diazepam, reduces treatment failure. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of chlorpromazine or clonidine in newborn infants with NAS. Clonidine and chlorpromazine should only be used in the context of a randomised clinical trial. The results of this review, taken in conjunction with the related review, Opiate treatment for opiate withdrawal in newborn infants (Osborn 2002), indicate that treatment with opiates is the preferred initial therapy for NAS. It is hypothesised that this is particularly true for infants whose mothers have used only opiates during pregnancy. If a sedative is used, phenobarbital is preferred to diazepam. The results of an ongoing trial of the addition of phenobarbital to an opiate are awaited.

AB  - Prolactine (PRL), a polypeptidic hormone, was first identified in 1970. Synthesised and released by the anterior pituitary gland, this hormone has the physiological role of inducing synthesis and secretion of breast milk. Also, PRL suppresses the gonadotrophinic secretion, being associated with amenorrhoea in women and impotence in men. The neurochemical and hormonal mechanisms involved in PRL release are quite complex. Normally, in a healthy person, the serum level of PRL doesn't exceed 15 ng/ml (Bevan, 1991); in women during pregnancy, PRL levels can reach 200 ng/ml and during lactation even 300 ng/ml (Marken, 1992). PRL level considerably varies in the same individual (up to 4 times in 24 hours) reaching a peak during sleep; also, it presents seasonal variations, of low amplitude, which increases in the spring and autumn. For example, Brown determined PRL levels in 9 healthy men and found the mean PRL values 30% greater in spring and summer than in autumn/winter season. The increased PRL levels found in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics are due probably to side-effects of medication and not to the disease itself; it is accepted the fact that no psychiatric condition increases per se PRL levels. Objective: Prolactin assessment after treatment with Amisulpride, Olanzapine, Risperidone and Quetiapine. Method: This study included 62 inpatients, 32 (51.6%) women, 30 (48.4%) men, aged between 18-65 years, diagnosed with schizophrenia (N=46), acute psychotic disorder (N=5), schizoaffective disorder (N=4), major depressive episode with psychotic features (N=2), bipolar affective disorder-manic episode (N=5), according to DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. Patients were treated with Amisulpride (21 cases, 33.87%), Quetiapine (5 cases; 8.08%), Olanzapine (22 cases; 35.48%), Risperidone (11 cases; 17.74%) and Clozapine (3 cases; 4.83%). Among these patients, 2 (3.22%) diagnosed and hospitalised with major depressive episode with psychotic features have been treated with an association of atypical antipsychotics (Olanzapine) with SSRI (Fluoxetine) and another 5 patients (8.06%) diagnosed with bipolar affective disordermanic episode have been treated with atypical antipsychotics (Quetiapine) associated with a mood stabilizer (Lithium carbonate). Serum PRL levels, determined using the EIA method, were measured basally, at 2 weeks of treatment and/or at the end of the antipsychotic treatment in the hospital. Results: Dynamic assessment of PRL levels showed normal values in 12 cases (19.36%); increased values without clinical symptoms in 25 cases (40.32%) and increased values with clinical symptoms in 25 cases (40.32%). Conclusion: 1) Amisulpride determines frequently a significant and constant increase of PRL levels; this correlates with a minimum dose of 400 mg/day. 2) Risperidone determines a moderate but constant increase of PRL levels, beginning with a dose of 4 mg/day. 3) Olanzapine provoked a moderate and transient increase of PRL levels, at a mean dose of 10 mg/day. 4) Clozapine didn't modify PRL levels, being used in 3 cases (4.83%) as a treatment alternative after using conventional antipsychotics, in patients with hyperprolactinaemia with clinical symptoms. 5) Quetiapine didn't modify PRL levels in our cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to opiate withdrawal may result in disruption of the mother-infant relationship, sleep-wake abnormalities, feeding difficulties, weight loss and seizures. Treatments used to ameliorate symptoms and reduce morbidity include opiates, sedatives and non-pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of using an opiate, compared to a sedative or non-pharmacological treatment, for treatment of NAS due to withdrawal from opiates. The evidence for use of different opiates was assessed in subgroup analyses. SEARCH STRATEGY: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group including searches (up to March 2002) of the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2002), MEDLINE (1966-March 2002), previous reviews including cross references, abstracts, conferences and symposia proceedings, expert informants, journal handsearching mainly in the English language. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials enrolling infants with NAS born to mothers with an opiate dependence, with > 80% follow up and using random or quasi-random allocation to opiate or control. Control could include an opiate, sedative or non-pharmacological treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author assessed study quality and extracted data independently. Primary outcomes included control of symptoms, seizure occurrence, mortality and neurodevelopment. Treatment effect was expressed using relative risk (RR), risk difference (RD), mean difference (MD) and weighted mean difference (WMD). Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. MAIN RESULTS: Six studies enrolling a total of 511 infants met inclusion criteria (Carin 1983, Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986, Kandall 1983, Khoo 1995, Madden 1977); however, two (Finnegan 1984, Kaltenbach 1986) may be sequential reports that include some identical patients. The studies enrolled infants of mothers who had used opiates with or without other drugs during pregnancy. Methodological concerns included the use of quasi-random rather than random patient allocation methods in three studies, and sizeable, largely unexplained differences in reported numbers allocated to each group in four studies. Opiate (morphine) vs supportive care only: One study (Khoo 1995) found no significant effect on treatment failure (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.41, 4.07), a significant increase in hospital stay (MD 15.0 days, 95% CI 8.9, 21.1) and significant reductions in time to regain birthweight (MD -2.8 days, 95% -5.3, -0.3) and duration of supportive care (MD -197.2 minutes/day, 95% CI -274.2, -120.3). Opiate vs phenobarbital: Meta-analysis of three studies found no significant difference in treatment failure (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46, 1.32). One of these studies (Finnegan 1984) reported that opiate treatment resulted in a significant reduction in treatment failure among infants of mothers who had used only opiates; however, as this was a post-hoc analysis, this result should be interpreted with caution. One study (Kandall 1983) reported a reduction in seizures, of borderline statistical significance, with the use of opiate. Opiate vs diazepam: Meta-analysis of two studies found a significant reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23, 0.80) with the use of opiate. No study reported neurodevelopment by allocated treatment group. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Opiates, as compared to supportive care only, appear to reduce the time to regain birth weight and reduce the duration of supportive care, but increase the duration of hospital stay; there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to phenobarbital, opiates may reduce the incidence of seizures but, overall, there is no evidence of effect on treatment failure. When compared to diazepam, opiates reduce the incidence of treatment failure. A post-hoc analysis generates the hypothesis that treatment effects may vary according to whether the population includes infants born to all opiate users (i.e. with or without other drug exposure) or is restricted to infants of mothers who used opiates only. In view of the methodologic limitations of the included studies the conclusions of this review should be treated with caution. Further research is needed.

AB  - Morphological studies suggest that the primate hippocampus develops extensively before birth, but little is known about its functional development. Patch-clamp recordings of hippocampal neurons and reconstruction of biocytin-filled pyramidal cells were performed in slices of macaque cynomolgus fetuses delivered by cesarean section. We found that during the second half of gestation, axons and dendrites of pyramidal cells grow intensively by hundreds of micrometers per day to attain a high level of maturity near term. Synaptic currents appear around midgestation and are correlated with the level of morphological differentiation of pyramidal cells: the first synapses are GABAergic, and their emergence correlates with the growth of apical dendrite into stratum radiatum. A later occurrence of glutamatergic synaptic currents correlates with a further differentiation of the axodendritic tree and the appearance of spines. Relying on the number of dendritic spines, we estimated that hundreds of new glutamatergic synapses are established every day on a pyramidal neuron during the last third of gestation. Most of the synaptic activity is synchronized in spontaneous slow (â0.1 Hz) network oscillations reminiscent of the giant depolarizing potentials in neonatal rodents. Epileptiform discharges can be evoked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline by the last third of gestation, and postsynaptic GABA(B) receptors contribute to the termination of epileptiform discharges. Comparing the results obtained in primates and rodents, we conclude that the template of early hippocampal network development is conserved across the mammalian evolution but that it is shifted toward fetal life in primate.

AB  - A 34-year-old woman was hospitalised with hypotension, lethargy and ventricular tachycardia, five months after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. Laboratory values were compatible with anterior (abnormal concentrations of adrenocorticotropin hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, prolactin) and posterior (diabetes insipidus) pituitary gland insufficiency. An MRI scan revealed that there was no pituitary enlargement and that the pituitary stalk was normal. The prompt recognition of hypophysitis as a potentially fatal condition is important, as a life-saving treatment is available.

AB  - Studies in rats found that alcohol exposure during the early postnatal period, particularly during the brain-growth-spurt period, can result in cell loss in various brain regions and persistent behavioral impairments. Some investigators have speculated that the body's internal clock, which is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the brain, may also be affected by developmental alcohol exposure. For example, alcohol-induced damage to the SCN cells and their function could result in disturbances of the circadian timekeeping function, and these disturbances might contribute to the behavioral impairments and affective disorders observed in people prenatally exposed to alcohol. Preliminary findings of studies conducted in rats suggest that developmental alcohol exposure may indeed interfere with circadian clock function as evidenced by a shortened circadian sleep-wake cycle and changes in the release of certain brain chemicals (i.e., neuropeptides) by SCN cells.

AB  - Focus group research was conducted in four countries to understand how couples who use calendar methods determine when they are at risk of pregnancy, what behavior they adopt during the fertile phase, and whether or not they are satisfied with their method. Calendar and periodic abstinence method users do not all know how to make correct calendar calculations of the fertile period, report being sexually active during the fertile period, and desire a more comprehensive approach to sexual behavior during the fertile period. Men's roles in the methods should be enhanced, and credible resources in the community should be enlisted to improve education, information, and communication. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Individually developing patterns of activity-rest rhythms in infants and the influence of environmental factors in the tuning and synchronisation of parent-infant pairs have important implications for the health of both infant and parents. After discharge from the hospital newborn infants are exposed to patterned influences of maternal and environmental regularities of a family's daily life resulting in varying degrees of social synchronisation. Actigraphic monitoring was used in this longitudinal study to examine how activity patterns of the entire family agree or disagree with each other, and how the infant entrains to the environment. Activity data of 12 families (father, mother and infant) were continuously recorded using non-invasive Actiwatch units. Recordings of parental activity started at the beginning of the 37th week of gestation, and were continued in parallel with the infants' recordings in three series of 21 days each until four months after birth: 1st to 3rd week, 7th to 9th week and 13th to 15th week of life. Fast Fourier transformation and cross correlation techniques were used to determine frequencies of each family member and to quantify the synchronisation of activity between parents and infants. To elucidate differences in social synchronisation between human cultures, synchronisation of a Melanesian family was additionally compared. Results showed the existence of corresponding ultradian frequencies in the activity patterns of mother-infant pairs at 1, 2 and 4 months. Increases in the synchronisation of parental activity were found from prenatal to postnatal and for mother-infant pairs from the first to the second month. Synchronisation between mother and infant always exceeded that of father and infant. Transient mono-, bi- or polyphasic activity patterns emerged in the infants immediately after birth. Good correspondence of mother-infant activity patterns during the early postnatal period was correlated with a rapid development of an entrained daily pattern in the infant.

AB  - Objective: To reach a consensus on the prognostic significance of new techniques of automated blood pressure measurement. Methods: A Task Force on the prognostic significance of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring wrote this review in preparation for the Eighth International Consensus Conference (28-31 October 2001, Sendai, Japan). This synopsis was amended to account for opinions aired at the conference and to reflect the common ground reached in the discussions. Points of consensus: (1) Prospective studies in treated and untreated hypertensive patients and in the general population have demonstrated that, even after adjusting for established risk factors, the incidence of cardiovascular events is correlated with blood pressure on conventional as well as ambulatory measurement. Ambulatory monitoring, however, significantly refines the prediction already provided by conventional blood pressure measurement. (2) White-coat hypertension is usually defined as an elevated clinic blood pressure in the presence of a normal daytime ambulatory blood pressure. Event-based studies in hypertensive patients have convincingly demonstrated that the risk of cardiovascular disease is less in patients with white-coat hypertension than in those with higher ambulatory blood pressure levels even after controlling for concomitant risk factors. Based on prognostic evidence, white-coat hypertension can now be defined as a conventional blood pressure that is persistently equal to or greater than 140/90 mmHg with an average daytime ambulatory blood pressure of below 135/85mmHg. The issue of whether or not white-coat hypertension predisposes to sustained hypertension needs further research. (3) There is a growing body of evidence showing that a decreased nocturnal fall in blood pressure (< 10% of the daytime level) is associated with a worse prognosis, irrespective of whether night-time dipping is studied as a continuous or a class variable. (4) Intermittent techniques of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are limited in terms of quantifying short-term blood pressure variability. Proven cardiovascular risk factors such as old age, a higher than usual blood pressure and diabetes mellitus are often associated with greater short-term blood pressure variability. After adjusting for these risk factors, some - but not all - studies have nevertheless reported an independent and positive relationship between cardiovascular outcome and measures of variability of daytime and night-time blood pressure, for example standard deviation. (5) Reference values for ambulatory blood pressure measurement in children are currently based on statistical parameters of blood pressure distribution. In children and adolescents, functional rather than distribution-based definitions of ambulatory hypertension have yet to be developed. (6) Several studies of gestational hypertension have shown that, compared with office measurement, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a better predictor of maternal and fetal complications. Pregnancy is a special indication for ambulatory monitoring so that the white-coat effect can be measured and pregnant women are not given antihypertensive drugs unnecessarily. (7) Ambulatory pulse pressure and the QKD interval are measurements obtained by ambulatory monitoring that to some extent reflect the functional characteristics of the large arteries. The QKD interval is correlated with left ventricular mass, and ambulatory pulse pressure is a strong predictor of cardiovascular outcome. (8) Under standardized conditions, the self-measurement of blood pressure is equally as effective as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in identifying the white-coat effect, but further studies are required to elucidate fully the prognostic accuracy of self-measured blood pressure in comparison with conventional and ambulatory blood pressure measurement. Conclusions: Ambulatory blood pressure measurement refines the prognostic information provided by conventional blood pressure readings obtained in the clinic or the doctor's office. Longitudinal studies of patients with white-coat hypertension should clarify the transient, persistent or progressive nature of this condition, particularly in paediatric patients, in whom white-coat hypertension may be a harbinger of sustained hypertension and target-organ damage in adulthood. Finally, the applicability, cost-effectiveness and long-term prognostic accuracy of the self-measurement of blood pressure should be evaluated in relation to conventional blood pressure measurement and ambulatory monitoring.

AB  - The effects of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy on behavioral and physiological measures of arousal were examined in a sample of 50 neonates. After the effects of alcohol, caffeine, and maternal demographic variables were statistically controlled, regression analyses showed that maternal smoking during pregnancy was predictive of higher heart rates overall and during quiet and active sleep. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was also predictive of lower heart rate variability and an increased number of tremors and changes in behavioral state. These findings suggest that maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy affects the regulation of spontaneous autonomic activity in neonates.

AB  - Although pregnant women are discouraged from drinking alcohol because of alcohol's detrimental effect on fetal development, the lore of many cultures encourages lactating women to drink alcohol to optimize breast milk production and infant nutrition. In contrast to this folklore, however, studies demonstrate that maternal alcohol consumption may slightly reduce milk production. Furthermore, some of the alcohol consumed by a lactating woman is transferred to her milk and thus consumed by the infant. This alcohol consumption may adversely affect the infant's sleep and gross motor development and influence early learning about alcohol. Based on this science, it would seem that the recommendation for a nursing mother to drink a glass of beer or wine shortly before nursing may actually be counterproductive.

AB  - Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is one of the commonest neurological disorders and causes significant disability, if left untreated. However, it is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice, probably due to lack of awareness and/or lack of necessary diagnostic facilities. Restless leg syndrome (RLS), aging, pregnancy, uraemia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy are some of the common causes of secondary PLMD. Clinical presentation, polysomnographic findings and management of six patients of PLMD have been discussed in this report.

AB  - Besides their binding to cognate intracellular receptors gonadal steroids may also act as functional antagonists at the 5-HT3 receptor. A structure-activity relationship for the actions of a variety of steroids at the 5-HT3 receptor was elaborated that differed considerably from that known for GABAA receptors. Steroids appear to interact allosterically with ligand-gated ion channels at the receptor membrane interface. The functional antagonism of gonadal steroids at the 5-HT3 receptor may play a role for the development and course of nausea during pregnancy and of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we could demonstrate that 3Î±-reduced neuroactive steroids concurrently modulate the GABAA receptor and regulate gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular oxidation. Animal studies showed that progesterone is converted rapidly into GABAergic neuroactive steroids in vivo. Progesterone reduces locomotor activity in a dose dependent fashion in male Wister rats. Moreover, progesterone and 3Î±,5Î±-tetrahydroprogesterone produce a benzodiazepine-like sleep EEG profile in rats and humans. In addition, there is a dysequilibrium of such 3Î±-reduced neuroactive steroids during major depression which is corrected by successful treatment with antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids may further be involved in the treatment of depression and anxiety with antidepressants in patients during ethanol withdrawal. First studies in patients with panic disorder suggest that neuroactive steroids may also play a pivotal role in human anxiety. The genomic and non-genomic effects of steroids in the brain contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. Neuroactive steroids affect a broad spectrum of behavioral functions through their unique molecular properties and may constitute a yet unexploited class of drugs. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - According to the International Disease Classification (MKN 10), cigarette smoking is recognized as one of the substance abuse disorders. Besides temporary nausea when smoking first few cigarettes, the smoker does not experience any acute unpleasant effects. Chronic smoking, however, may be the cause of various disorders, including cardiovascular (20% of cardiovascular diseases are related to smoking), tumours (located namely in lungs, larynx, pancreas, bladder or cervix; 30% of tumours can be attributed to smoking), chronic lung diseases (75% of which are caused by smoking) or gastric ulcers. Smoking in pregnancy may result in lower weight at birth and/or pre-term delivery. Cigarette smoke contains many harmful compounds, including more than 60 proven or potential cancerogenes, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, phenol, N-nitrosamines, ammonia, aromatic hydrocarbons. When compared to the compounds mentioned above, nicotine itself is not so dangerous, it is "just" a compound responsible for the addictive properties of smoking. The problem is that many young people are well aware of the fact that chronic smoking may cause cancer, but they usually do not think about the danger of slowly becoming addicted (psychologically or to nicotine) and unable to quit smoking in the future. Therefore, 80-90% of smokers say they would like to quit, but they "cannot". Nicotine withdrawal is characterized by increased appetite, sleeping disorders, tiredness, irritability, problems with concentration and short-term memory. To prevent these symptoms, pure nicotine is sometimes used as a replacement therapy (NRT) in smoking cessation.

AB  - Clinical depression is diagnosed in 5-15% of women during pregnancy, increasing the risk of negative outcomes. Fluoxetine (FX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is prescribed during pregnancy. In adults, FX alters sleep patterns with single doses decreasing total sleep time and rapid eye movement sleep. The effects of FX on sleep in the fetus are unknown. However, 5-hydroxytryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, has been reported to prolong high-voltage (HV) electrocortical (ECoG) activity and increase the incidence of fetal breathing movements (FBM) in the sheep fetus. We hypothesize that FX exposure will decrease the incidence of LV ECoG in the fetus. Twenty-one pregnant sheep were surgically prepared for chronic study of blood gases, ECoG activity, eye movements and FBM. After 3 days of recovery, ewes received a 70-mg bolus i.v. infusion of FX or sterile water followed by continuous infusion at a rate of 0.036 mg/min for 8 days. The incidence of low-voltage (LV) ECoG decreased from 54Â±4% on the preinfusion day to 45Â±5% on infusion day 1 in the FX group and remained decreased throughout the infusion period. In addition, the incidence of both eye movements and FBM was decreased on infusion day 1 compared to preinfusion day in the FX group. HV ECoG increased from 39Â±3% on preinfusion day to 68Â±14% on FX infusion day 1 and remained elevated throughout the infusion period. These data show that maternal FX administration alters fetal behavioural state. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Self-reported snoring is common in pregnancy, particularly in females with pre-eclampsia. The prevalence of inspiratory flow limitation during sleep in pre-eclamptic females was objectively assessed and compared with normal pregnant and nonpregnant females. Fifteen females with pre-eclampsia were compared to 15 females from each of the three trimesters of pregnancy, as well as to 15 matched nonpregnant control females (total study population, 75 subjects). All subjects had overnight monitoring of respiration, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure (BP). No group had evidence of a clinically significant sleep apnoea syndrome, but patients with pre-eclampsia spent substantially more time (31Â±8.4% of sleep period time, meanÂ±SD) with evidence of inspiratory flow limitation compared to 15.5Â±2.3% in third trimester subjects and <5% in the other three groups (p=0.001). In the majority of pre-eclamptics, the pattern of flow limitation was of prolonged episodes lasting several minutes without associated oxygen desaturation. As expected, systolic and diastolic BPs were significantly higher in the pre-eclamptic group (p<0.001), but all groups showed a significant fall (pâ¤0.05) in BP during sleep. Inspiratory flow limitation is common during sleep in patients with pre-eclampsia, which may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder.

AB  - Hypertension is usually managed on a case-finding basis, and yet continued blood pressure control can be inadequate. Furthermore, hypertension is often a 'silent' condition until comorbid events, target organ damage and subsequent heart failure become manifest, leading to a reactive rather than a proactive approach. Management of the hypertension syndrome becomes complex, because blood pressure control may not be just an isolated concern. This review considers the various options, in addition to existing guidelines, that can help to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Preeclampsia is the most common disease of pregnancy, occurring in up to 10% of the pregnant population. The cause of the disease is as yet undetermined; however, most of the clinical effects are commonly attributed to damage to the endothelial layer, leading to increased pressor activity of all the maternal blood vessels. Therefore, we suspected that if obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) coexisted with preeclampsia in pregnancy, the hemodynamic effects of the OSA would be markedly potentiated. To test this hypothesis, we performed full sleep studies and overnight beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The control patient group included 10 pregnant women with OSA and no evidence of hypertensive disease either before or during their current pregnancy. The test group included 10 women with preeclampsia and coexisting OSA, The pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep were enhanced in preeclamptic patients compared with control OSA patients (21 Â± 2/12 Â± 1 mm Hg and 38 Â± 5/25 Â± 4 mm Hg above baseline in control OSA and preeclamptic OSA patients, respectively, P = .005/.005). In contrast, there was no difference in heart rate responses between the two groups of subjects (34 Â± 5 beats/min and 49 Â± 13 beats/rain above baseline in control and preeclamptic patient groups, respectively, P = .326). We suggest that the augmented pressor responses in preeclamptic women occur as a result of maternal endothelial damage induced by the preeclampsia disease process. These findings may have important implications in the management of preeclamptic patients. Â© 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

AB  - Retrospective studies in humans suggest that chronic maternal stress during pregnancy, associated with raised plasma levels of CRH, ACTH and cortisol may increase the likelihood of preterm birth, developmental delays and behavioural abnormalities in the children. In adulthood, it may contribute to the significant association between the incidence of schizophrenia, increased left or mixed handedness, reduction in cerebral asymmetry and anomalies in brain morphology. Our studies and others have shown that prenatal stress in rats can mimic these developmental and behavioural alterations. These rats show a reduced propensity for social interaction, increased anxiety in intimidating or novel situations and a reduction in cerebral asymmetry and dopamine turnover, consistent with those in schizophrenic humans. Prenatally-stressed (PS) rats also show behaviour consistent with depression, including a phase-shift in their circadian rhythm for corticosterone, sleep abnormalities, a hedonic deficit and greater acquisition of learned helplessness under appropriate conditions. These behavioural abnormalities are associated with impaired regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and increased CRH activity. PS males may show demasculinisation and feminisation of their sexual behaviour. The developmental and behavioural abnormalities in PS offspring could occur through sensitisation of the foetal brain by maternal stress hormones to the action of glucocorticoid and CRH and to neurotransmitters affected by them. This may have long-lasting consequences and could explain the precipitation of depressive symptoms or schizophrenia by psychosocial stress in later life. The character of the behavioural abnormalities probably depends on the timing of the maternal stress in relation to development of the particular neuronal systems. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: To assess awareness of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and risk reducing recommendations in a sample of mothers in North Queensland, Australia, and to examine their infant care practices. Method: Interviews conducted with 195 women using a standardized questionnaire between October 1997 and January 1998. Results: 191 questionnaires analyzed; 134 (70.2%) Caucasian and 57 (29.8%) indigenous women. Four women with previous SIDS experience were excluded from the analysis. Eight (4.2%) had never heard of SIDS. Twenty-nine (15.2%) had heard of SIDS and 154 (80.6%) had heard of SIDS and could list risk recommendations to reduce its incidence. Multivariate analysis identified ethnicity as the only significant predictor of maternal knowledge. Indigenous mothers knew less about SIDS: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 5.4; 95% confidence interval (CI) = [2.1-14.0]. Avoidance of prone sleeping was the most frequently identified recommendation (n = 132), with no smoking in pregnancy (n = 48) and breastfeeding (n = 40) identified least frequently. There were 80.2% of mothers who put their infant in non-prone positions to sleep. Only 48 (25%) women identified smoking in pregnancy, and 93 (48.6%) smoking in the infant's environment as risk factors. Indigenous women were more likely to smoke in their pregnancy (P = 0.004), bed share with their infant (P = 0.0001), and have smokers in the home. Conclusion: There is a high level of awareness of SIDS and the main associated risk factor of infant prone sleeping, but the link between SIDS and smoking requires further emphasis. Future campaigns should ensure the SIDS message is delivered more effectively to the indigenous communities.

AB  - ERG recordings from German cockroaches showed that the amplitude of light-evoked responses have a circadian rhythmicity in adult males that coincided with the locomotor circadian rhythm. The peak of the response occurred during the subjective night, and the circadian period was less than 24 h under DD condition. In contrast, although the locomotor circadian rhythm was masked by the development of ovaries and pregnancy in females, their visual responses displayed circadian rhythmicity. This inconsistency in expression of locomotor and visual sensitivity circadian rhythms in females implied separate pacemakers for these two overt rhythms. After severing the optic nerves, changes in ERG amplitude of the operated cockroaches still displayed a circadian rhythm under DD condition, demonstrating that the visual sensitive pacemaker was located in the eye and independent from the locomotor pacemaker.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurosensory disorder that typically begins in the evening and often prevents a person from falling asleep. It has been associated with iron deficiency anemia and dopaminergic pathways and is often treated with iron infusion or dopamine agonists. The purpose of this secondary analysis of longitudinal data collected on women before, during, and after pregnancy is to document the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy, contrast its effect on sleep and mood state, and explore the role of folate and iron in the expression of RLS, specifically during the third trimester when the syndrome is most distressing. The prevalence increased from 0 during preconception to 23% (n = 7) during the third trimester of pregnancy. Only 1 subject continued to experience RLS after delivery. Compared with those without complaints of restless legs, those with restless legs had low serum ferritin at preconception and significantly lower folate levels during preconception and at each trimester. In addition, time to sleep onset was significantly delayed and depressed mood was significantly higher in the RLS group. Rather than indicators of iron deficiency anemia (serum ferritin, serum iron, and hemoglobin) or pernicious anemia (vitamin B12), it was reduced serum folate level that was associated with RLS in this sample of pregnant women. Findings indicate a need to reconsider recommendations about the normal ranges of serum ferritin and serum folate levels during pregnancy to minimize the complaints of restless legs and promote more consolidated sleep and better daytime mood state during pregnancy.

AB  - Background. Thalidomide was introduced as a non-toxic sleeping pill in 1957 and was prescribed in more than 20 countries. In 1961 the link between congenital limb defects and thalidomide use in pregnancy was proven, resulting in withdrawal of the drug. Material and methods. On the basis of literature searches and personal experience we review the effects and use of thalidomide today. Results. In vitro, thalidomide has immunoregulatory properties. This has lead to the administration of thalidomide in many immunological diseases. In 1964 it was discovered that thalidomide was effective against erythema nodosum leprosum. Thalidomide also has effect on aphthous stomatitis and BehÃ§et's disease. The effect is more uncertain in graft-versus-host-disease, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Thalidomide reduces angiogenesis in experimental animals, and this has led to several studies of thalidomide as a possible anticancer drug. Advanced or resistant multiple myeloma may be a new target for thalidomide; at least 30% of these patients obtain response during treatment. Results indicate that patients with breast cancer and glioma do not benefit from treatment with thalidomide. Interpretation. Thalidomide has proven to be effective in the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum and aphtous stomatitis. It is also effective in advanced multiple myeloma, but not in other cancers.

AB  - Circadian rhythms of mammals are generated endogenously, the master oscillator system residing in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Previous experiments have indicated that the rabbit has a feeding entrainable circadian oscillator (FEO) which is supposed to be of greatest importance during the early infancy of the rabbit. Here we report the course of telemetrically monitored core body temperature of rabbit pups and of their does. Temperature increased from 37.6Â±0.3Â°C on day 2 to 39.5Â±0.1Â°C on day 28 of life. The pups showed a 24 h temperature rhythm even during their first days of life. Temperature increased 21/2-3 h prior to nursing for 0.4-0.8Â°C and rose for an additional 0.4-0.6Â°C immediately after milk ingestion. The anticipatory, but not the postprandial component persisted when nursing was skipped twice. The persistence of a rhythm in the absence of any entraining agent is crucial for its endogenous generation. In the doe, the core body temperature gradually decreased during the last 2/3 of pregnancy. During parturition it steeply rose for 1.5-1.7Â°C and attained a plateau of 39.7Â±0.2Â°C during lactation. The circadian rhythm persisted during the whole course of pregnancy and lactation. Thus, in the rabbit an endogenous, feeding entrainable circadian oscillator appears to operate from the first days of life. It is of functional significance in that it alerts the pup in time so that it is able to utilize the singular short presence of the doe for maximal milk intake.

AB  - During the first weeks of life, preterm neonates show fewer circadian rhythms in their physiological parameters than full-term neonates. To determine whether preterm neonates differ in their temporal adaptation to the day-night cycle from full-term neonates at the early age of 1 week, we compared activity-rest behavior of both groups. Activity-rest behavior of 10 neurologically healthy preterm neonates (born in 34th to 36th week of gestation) and 10 neurologically healthy full-term neonates (born in 37th to 42nd week of gestation) was monitored longitudinally for 8 successive days in the first 2 weeks of life. Actigraphy was used to register and display time patterns of activity and rest in neonates by using small actometers, which resemble a wristwatch. Nursing/feeding was recorded using the actometer's integrated event marker button. Recordings for preterm neonates were conducted in the hospital; recordings for full-term neonates were carried out in the hospital and in their homes. In addition to the actigraphic recordings, a standardized diary was kept regularly. To assess periodic characteristics, frequency components of activity-rest behavior were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Amounts of daily sleep time, nightly sleep time, and sleep time during 24h were compared. Nursing/feeding epochs were also analyzed for 5 preterm and 5 full-term neonates to compare their food intake behavior. The majority of preterm neonates showed a multitude of ultradian frequencies in their spectra. In contrast, several full-term neonates showed a distinct circadian frequency. In preterm neonates, average nightly sleep and average daily sleep of all recorded days were very similar, but after the fourth day of life, only average nightly sleep increased. In full-term neonates, average nightly and daily sleep time of all recorded days differed by about 1h. Average sleep time during 24h for preterm and full-term neonates was similar. Preterm neonates showed longer intervals between events of food intake than full-term neonates. The circadian peaks in the frequency spectra of full-term neonates may indicate the initial adaptation in the first week of life to a 24h day. This is in agreement with our results concerning the different durations of nightly and daily sleep. The increase in nightly sleep time of preterm neonates may be attributed to the progressing adaptation to a circadian activity-rest pattern.

AB  - In previous experiments, we found that rats raised in constant light (LL) manifested a more robust circadian rhythm of motor activity in LL and showed longer phase shifts after a light pulse in constant darkness (DD) than those raised under constant darkness. In addition, we observed that the effects produced by constant light differed depending on the time of postnatal development in which it was given. These results suggest that both sensitivity to light and the functioning of the circadian pacemaker of the rat could be affected by the environmental conditions experienced during postembryonic development. Thus, the present experiment aimed to study whether postnatal exposure to light could also affect the circadian system of the mouse. Three groups of mice were formed: One group was raised under constant darkness during lactation (DD group), the second under constant light (LL group), and the third under light-dark cycles (LD group). After lactation, the three groups were submitted first to constant light of high intensity, then to LD cycles, and finally to constant darkness. In the DD stage, a light pulse was given. Finally, mice were submitted to constant light of low intensity. We observed that the circadian rhythm of the DD group was more disturbed under constant light than the rhythm of the LL group, and that, when light intensity increased, the period of the rhythm of the DD group lengthened more than that of the LL group. No significant differences among the groups were found in the phase shift induced by the light pulse. Therefore, it appears that DD mice are more sensitive to light than their LL counterparts. However, at present there is no evidence to affirm that the light environment experienced by the mouse during postnatal development affects the circadian pacemaker.

AB  - Objective: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increases are reported during normal pregnancy, but the relation to arterial pressure and the renin-angiotensin system is debatable. We assessed whether normotensive pregnancies with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) present an alteration of maternal ANP levels. Design: A total of 11 pregnant women with IUGR, in the absence of any other maternal or fetal pathology, entered the study during the third trimester. They were compared with 12 healthy pregnant women of similar age and characteristics. We monitored all subjects for blood pressure (BP), ANP, aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA), under the same conditions for 24 h. All subjects were submitted to the same regimen of life; with homogenous dark:light periods, salt intake and meal times. Methods: BP was monitored at 20 min intervals for 24 hand blood tests performed at six time points during the 24 h. EDTA plasma samples were immediately centrifuged. Hormone assays were performed by radioimmunoassay. Koch's nonparametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the hormone time-dependent profiles in the two groups. Circadian rhythms were assessed by cosinor analysis. Results: The IUGR group was characterized by higher ANP values compared to normal pregnancy, (205 Â± 24 versus 146 Â± 21 pg/ml: P < 0.05) but not significant differences were shown for PRA, aldosterone and BP circadian rhythms. Conclusions: This study shows higher ANP values in human pregnancy complicated by IUGR, with presence of normal BP, aldosterone and PRA profiles. Â© 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - During embryogenesis cells make appropriately timed developmental decisions. Both 'hourglass-like' and 'clock-like' mechanisms have been demonstrated to act as timers in early development. The cell cycle rhythm, using feedback circuits to drive cells unidirectionally through checkpoints, is an example of a clock-like timer, but how it operates to time developmental events is unclear. In other cell types, cyclic oscillations in K+ channel activity, which parallel cell cycle and circadian rhythms, may be part of the timing mechanism. Changes in K+ oscillations accompany key developmental transitions and oncogenic transformation. Channel blockade interferes pharmacologically with cell cycle initiation or progression, whereas channel over-expression can be oncogenic. K+ channel activity also exists in early mouse oocytes through to at least the blastocyst stage, and it oscillates in phase with the developmental cell cycles, being high in M/G1 and low in S/G2. It resembles physiologically the activity of the K+ channels of the eag- or erg-like families. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of mouse oocytes has revealed the presence of transcripts encoding both EAG- and ERG-like proteins throughout preimplantation development. Channel activity continues to oscillate with a cell cycle periodicity in embryos from which the nucleus has been removed, or after inhibition by puromycin of the cyclin B-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 driven component of the chromosomal cycle. Channel oscillatory activity thus appears to be able to function autonomously of the chromosomal cycle and may represent a distinct oscillatory timing activity with possible developmental significance.

AB  - Mammalian circadian clock genes Per1 and Per2 are rhythmically expressed not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus where the mammalian circadian clock exists, but also in other brain regions and peripheral tissues. The induced circadian oscillation of Per genes after treatment with high concentrations of serum or various drugs in cultured cells suggests the ubiquitous existence of the oscillatory mechanism. These treatments also result in a rapid surge of expression of Per1. It has been shown that multiple signaling pathways are involved in Per1 gene induction in culture cells. We used a dispersed primary cell culture made up of mouse cerebellar granule cells to examine the stimuli inducing the mPer genes and their signaling pathways in neuronal tissues expressing mPer genes. We demonstrated that mPer1, but not mPer2, mRNA expression was dependent on the depolarization state controlled by extracellular KCl concentration in the granule cell culture. Nifedipine treatment reduced mPer1 induction, suggesting that mPer1 mRNA expression depends on intracellular calcium concentration regulated through a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. Transient mPer1 mRNA induction was observed after elevating KCl concentration in the medium from 5 mM to 25 mM. This increased expression was suppressed by a calmodulin antagonist, or CaMKII/IV inhibitor, but not by MEK inhibitors. Addition of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 to the medium also induced transient Per1 gene expression. This induction was mimicked by dibutyryl-cAMP and suppressed by a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, but not by MEK inhibitors. These results suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II/IV- and PKA-dependent pathways are involved in high-KCl and PACAP-induced mPer1 induction, respectively, and neural tissues use multiple signaling pathways for mPer1 induction similar to culture cells.

AB  - Objective To determine (a) the prevalence of hypertension during sleep in pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, and (b) whether women with hypertension during sleep have worse pregnancy outcomes than hypertensive pregnant women with controlled (normal) blood pressure (BP) during sleep. Design Prospective double-blind cohort study. Setting Inpatients and outpatients managed in a day assessment unit (DAU) at St George Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Participants A total of 186 hypertensive pregnant women, 158 of whom had successful 24 h BP monitoring; 40% had proteinuric pre-eclampsia (PE), 43% gestational hypertension (GH) and 17% essential hypertension (EH). Interventions Blood pressure, 24 h non-invasive, monitoring (Spacelabs 90207) was undertaken successfully in 158 women with PE, GH or EH, whether or not they were receiving antihypertensives. Women and clinicians were blinded to results of these BP monitors. Sleep hypertension was defined as BP > 117/68 mmHg at 26-30 weeks or < 123/72 mmHg after 30 weeks gestation. Main outcome measures Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between women with and without sleep hypertension and the prevalence of sleep hypertension was determined. Results Sleep hypertension was present in 59%, more commonly in PE (79%) than GH/EH (45%), P<0.0001. Sleep hypertensives also had higher routine sphygmomanometer BPs [137(10)/91(7) mmHg; mean(SD)] than women with normal sleep BP [130(12)/87(8) mmHg] P = 0.007, and higher awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) BPs [137(8)/88(7) versus 127(7)/79(6) mmHg], P<0.0001. Awake, but not sleep, average heart rate was lower in sleep hypertensives [85(11) versus 91(10) beats per minute, bpm], P = 0.002. Sleep hypertensives had a significantly greater frequency of renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia and episodes of (awake) severe hypertension (P<0.05), as well as lower birth weight babies [2715(808) versus 3224(598) g, P<0.0001]. Conclusions Hypertension during sleep is a common finding in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, particularly pre-eclampsia. These women also have higher awake BPs and a greater frequency of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. These findings are largely explained by the greater likelihood of pre-eclamptics having sleep hypertension. Â© 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Aim - To look for changes in risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) after decrease and stabilisation of the SIDS rate. Methods - Questionnaires were distributed to parents of 174 SIDS infants, dying between 1984 and 1998, and 375 age and sex matched controls in southeast Norway. Results - The proportion of infants sleeping prone has decreased, along with the decrease in SIDS rate for the region during the periods studied, but over half of the SIDS victims are still found in the prone position. As the number of SIDS cases has decreased, additional risk factors have become more significant. Thus, after 1993, a significantly increased risk of SIDS is seen when the mother smokes during pregnancy. After 1993, young maternal age carries an increased risk. Maternal smoking and young maternal age are associated with each other. For SIDS victims, an increase in the number of infants found dead while co-sleeping is seen, and the age peak between 2 and 4 months and the winter peak have become less pronounced. Conclusion - Changes in risk factor profile following the decrease in SIDS rate in the early 1990s, as well as consistency of other factors, provides further clues to SIDS prevention and to the direction of further studies of death mechanisms.

AB  - To date, the phenomenon of maternal transfer of hormones to the young is an enigma. The present study explains for the first time the maternal transfer of melatonin (MEL) to the young, affecting neonatal growth and sexual maturation. The suckling pups of MEL-treated mothers exhibited significant decreases in body, testicular, vas deferens (male pups), ovarian and uterine (female pups) weights and increases in pineal gland activity along with high plasma MEL levels. The plasma level of testosterone decreased significantly in male pups, while estradiol increased and progesterone decreased in female pups of MEL-treated mothers. These results clearly suggest that MEL could be transported from the mothers to their young postnatally via the milk in order to influence neonatal growth and sexual maturation. Our results support the earlier concept and show for the first time that MEL can be transported from the mother to the young either prenatally through the placenta or postnatally via the milk. Therefore, maternal MEL can act as a biological signal for neonatal growth and sexual maturation. Â© 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - To monitor infant care practices associated with risks for sudden infant death, 400 Belgian families with infants less than 6 months old were questioned by 21 paediatricians during routine visits to local paediatric practices and well baby services (11 in urban centres, 10 in rural areas). Because of incomplete information, 35 families were excluded. Of the 365 mothers included in the study, 36.1% had under 7 years of schooling, 38.4% less than 13 years, and 25.5% had a professional school or a university degree. Risk factors for sudden infant death were found in 208 (56.9%) families: a usual non-supine sleep position (31.5% of the infants); sleeping under a duvet (24.1%); mothers smoking during and after gestation (16.4%); a high room temperature (6.6%); use of sedatives (3.8%); necklaces or plastic film in the cot (2.5%); and soft beddings (2.2%). Maternal education, but not the fathers' profession was significantly related to the number of risk factors (mean odds ratio of 4.4; 95% CI: 1.5 to 5.3; P = 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the mother's length of schooling as the single most significant independent factor for the presence of risk (P < 0.005). Conclusion: Less educated mothers report having been informed of risk-educating recommendations as frequently as better educated mothers. It can be concluded that future reduction in risks for sudden infant death syndrome should include new strategies designed to modify infant care pratices.

AB  - Objective. To investigate the acceptability of an ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitor (SpaceLabs 90207) and a self-initiated blood pressure monitor (Omron HEM-705CP) to pregnant women. Methods. Acceptability of the SpaceLabs 90207 and Omron HEM-705CP monitors was evaluated, using a modified British Hypertension Device assessment form, by (1) healthy, pregnant women at <15 weeks (n = 120), 35-37 weeks (n = 81), and 5-9 weeks postpartum (n = 86); and (2) women with preeclampsia (n = 52). Main Outcome Measures. A monitor was acceptable if a woman graded the overall impression as "good" or "very good." Results. Healthy women at <15 and 35-37 weeks' gestation and preeclamptic women reported the SpaceLabs 90207 monitor caused discomfort in 54%, 52%, and 60%, interfered with activities in 38%, 40%, and 23%, and disturbed sleep in 62%, 52% and 31%, respectively. Fewer than 12% in any group reported these problems with the Omron HEM-705CP monitor. In the 78 women who evaluated both monitors at 35-37 weeks, the SpaceLabs 90207 and Omron HEM-705CP were acceptable to 78% and 95% of healthy women, respectively (p = 0.005). Women with preeclampsia rated the Space-Labs 90207 as "bad" or "fair" (14%), "good" (58%), and "very good" (28%) compared with "bad" or "fair" (8%), "good" (28%), and "very good" (64%) for the Omron HEM-705CP monitor (p= 0.009). Conclusions. Pregnant women found the less intensive blood pressure monitoring with the Omron HEM-705CP more acceptable than the 24-h ABP monitoring with the SpaceLabs 90207. If accurate self-initiate blood pressure devices become available, pregnant women would prefer this method of home blood pressure monitoring.

AB  - We evaluated whether melatonin administration to pregnant rats during the final week of pregnancy affects prepubertal secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin in offspring. Melatonin was administered in the drinking water from day 14 to delivery. LH, FSH and prolactin concentrations were determined in plasma sampled from offspring between 5 and 30 days in the dark portion of the diurnal cycle. Administration of 2 or 20 Î¼g/ml melatonin did not affect LH or FSH in male or female offspring. The 20-Î¼g/ml dose caused a significant increase in prolactin in males and females at day 15. In contrast, melatonin, 2 or 20 Î¼g/ml, decreased prolactin at days 25 and 30 in females and day 25 in males. Thus, prenatal melatonin exposure alters prolactin secretion, but not that of LH and FSH in infantile and prepubertal male and female rats. Â© 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Background: Chronic pelvic pain has often been described as a major women's health issue, but no information exists on the extent of the problem in the United Kingdom. Aim: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women. Design of study: Postal questionnaire survey. Setting: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916) randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. Method: The questionnaire response rate (adjusted for non-deliveries) was 74% (2304/3106). Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group. Results: The three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24.0% (95% CI = 22.1% to 25.8%). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago. Recent consulters (32% of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41% of cases) did not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. Irrespective of consulting behaviour, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31%) compared with women with dysmenorrhoea (7%). Conclusions: This study showed a high community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in the degree to which they were affected by their symptoms. The high symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes.

AB  - The immature brain is much more sensitive to abnormal experience, particularly sleep deprivation, drug exposure, and maternal separation. The critical time period during which features in the brain's susceptibility to such experience change, however, has not yet been determined. In previous studies on rats, we found that neonatal treatment with clomipramine (CLI) during postnatal days 8-21 (P8-21) produced behavioral and physiological abnormalities in adult rats that resembled the abnormalities found in human endogenous depression. The objective of the present study is to determine (1) the critical (more specifically, the latest) time frame in which CLI treatment will produce adult depression and (2) the shortest treatment window during which CLI can induce adult depression. Male rats were neonatally treated with CLI (20 mg/kg, sc) twice daily or with an equivolume of saline. The treatment windows were P12-17, P14-20, P16-22, and P12-15. Six variables, including number of mounts, intromission, ejaculation, mount latency, ejaculation latency, and post-ejaculation interval, were measured visually between the ages of 4 and 5 months. Rats treated with CLI showed significant sexual impairment in treatment windows P12-17 and P14-20 and slight sexual deficiency in the short window P12-15. No significant sexual impairment was found in window P16-22. We concluded that P14-20 was the latest window during which CLI treatment produces adult sexual deficiency and that 6 days might be the shortest treatment window to produce significant behavior abnormalities.

AB  - This study's objective was to examine the autonomic control of heart rate and respiration during the neonatal period in human infants with prenatal exposure to cocaine. Four-hour daytime recordings of the electrocardiogram (ECG) were obtained from 15 cocaine-exposed and 13 non-exposed full-term neonates at 2 weeks of age during quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS). For each 1-min epoch of sleep, the power spectrum of the R-R intervals was computed from the ECG to obtain the total power (0-2 Hz), and spectral power in the high-frequency (HFP, 0.3-2 Hz), mid-frequency (MFP, 0.1-0.2 Hz), and low-frequency (LFP, 0.03-0.1 Hz) bands. Respiration was also monitored and processed using similar spectral analysis procedures. Cocaine-exposed neonates showed enhanced heart rate variability reflected by an increase in spectral power across all frequency bands. Spectral power in LFP and MFP was higher in cocaine-exposed neonates during both sleep states, but only in HFP during QS. There were no respiratory patterning differences between the groups to account for these findings. The index of sympathovagal balance (LFP + MFP)/HFP, showed no differences between the groups. We conclude that infants exposed to cocaine in utero show differences in the modulation of heart rate reflecting an increase in both vagal and sympathetic influences.

AB  - A longitudinal study to analyse the diurnal variations in baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) and sustained fetal tachycardia (SFT) in twin pregnancy was performed on one dichorionic twin. Twenty-four hour FHR recordings on twins were made at 32, 34 and 36 weeks of gestation simultaneously. Significant diurnal variations were found in both twins in all gestational weeks. The diurnal variations in baseline FHR of twins were highly correlated with no phase-lag. No coincidence was recognized in the appearance of SFT between twins. These results suggest the maternal influence equally affects FHR in each fetus of dichorionic twin since 32 weeks of gestation, while the appearance of SFT might be independent from maternal influence.

AB  - In order to evaluate two patterns of interrupted and non-interrupted sleep for the post-partum mothers from 9 to 12 weeks after delivery, we compared them with sleep patterns of non-pregnant women. Subjects were 10 primipara and 12 non-pregnant women. Their polysomnographic recordings were made using a Medilog recorder at home. In interrupted sleep, low sleep efficiency, decreased total sleep time, and a decreased percentage of stage 2 were significantly observed compared with non-pregnant women. Sleep parameters of non-interrupted sleep, except for increased percentage of stage 4, did not show any significant differences from non-pregnant women. Mothers' sleep fluctuated between interrupted sleep similar to the early post-partum sleep from 1 to 6 weeks and non-interrupted sleep with increased stage 4.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) on the dynamics of heart rate variability in full-term neonates during sleep. R-R interval (RRI) time series from 9 infants with PCE and 12 controls during periods of stable quiet sleep and active sleep were analyzed using autoregressive modeling and nonlinear dynamics. There were no differences between the two groups in spectral power distribution, approximate entropy, correlation dimension, and nonlinear predictability. However, application of surrogate data analysis to these measures revealed a significant degree of nonlinear RRI dynamics in all subjects. A parametric model, consisting of a nonlinear delayed-feedback system with stochastic noise as the perturbing input, was employed to estimate the relative contributions of linear and nonlinear deterministic dynamics in the data. Both infant groups showed similar proportional contributions in linear, nonlinear, and stochastic dynamics. However, approximate entropy, correlation dimension, and nonlinear prediction error were all decreased in active versus quiet sleep; in addition, the parametric model revealed a doubling of the linear component and a halving of the nonlinear contribution to overall heart rate variability. Spectral analysis indicated a shift in relative power toward lower frequencies. We conclude that 1) RRI dynamics in infants with PCE and normal controls are similar; and 2) in both groups, sympathetic dominance during active sleep produces primarily periodic low-frequency oscillations in RRI, whereas in quiet sleep vagal modulation leads to RRI fluctuations that are broadband and dynamically more complex.

AB  - It is well known that 1/f characteristics in power spectral patterns exist in various biological factors including heart rate variability. In the present study, we tried to elucidate the diurnal variation in spectral properties of eye movement and heart rate variability in the human fetus at term, via continuous 24-h observation of both these parameters. Studied were five uncomplicated fetuses at term. We observed eye movement and fetal heart rate (FHR) with real-time ultrasound and Doppler cardiotocograph, respectively, and analyzed the diurnal change in spectral properties, using the maximum entropy method. In four of five cases, the slope values of power spectra for both eye movement frequency and FHR, ranging approximately between 0.5 and 1.8, indicated diurnal variation, where the slopes tended to have high values during the day and low values at night. These findings suggest that, in the human fetus at term, eye movement and FHR are under the control of a common central mechanism, and this center changes its complexity as seen through diurnal rhythm.

AB  - To elucidate diurnal variations in eye movement and fetal heart rate (FHR) variability in the term fetus, we observed these two parameters continuously for 24 h, using real-time ultrasound and Doppler cardiotocograph, respectively. Studied were five uncomplicated fetuses at term. The time series data of the presence and absence of eye movement and mean FHR value for each 1 min were analyzed using the maximum entropy method (MEM) and subsequent nonlinear least squares fitting. According to the power value of eye movement, all five cases were classified into two groups: three cases in the large power group and two cases in the small power group. The acrophases of eye movement and FHR variability in the large power group were close, thereby implying the existence of a diurnal rhythm in both these parameters and also that they are synchronized. In the small power group, the acrophases were separated. The synchronization of eye movement and FHR variability in the large power group suggests that these phenomena are governed by a common central mechanism related to diurnal rhythm generation.

AB  - One family group of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) maintained in captivity under natural environmental conditions (Natal, Brazil, 05Â°46â²S, 35Â°12â²W) was observed by focal sampling at two non-consecutive days per week during two non-consecutive pregnancies (pregnancy 1: the last 8 fortnights before parturition; pregnancy 2: the last 5 ones) and after parturition (4 fortnights for both). The hourly percentiles of the duration of self-grooming and allogrooming interactions of the reproductive pair were submitted to Cosinor analysis for the 24-h period (p â¤ 0.05). The reproductive female's progesterone was monitored by fecal collection twice a week between 7:00h to 9:00h. Levels of progesterone were determined by ELISA method. During pregnancy 1, all interactions of the reproductive pair showed a 24-h statistically significant period. However, after parturition this periodicity is not present in some behaviors of the reproductive male. This animal presents the 24-h periodicity only toward to the reproductive female, the subadult son and to the newborns. Hormonal levels of the reproductive female showed isolated increases above 100 ng/g at the second and third fortnight after parturition, but did not characterize ovulation. Between pregnancy 1 and 2, the family was increased by the birth of four animals. During pregnancy 2, a statistically significant 24-h period was find only in self-grooming of the reproductive male and female, and in the interactions between the reproductive pair. Also, in the interactions of the reproductive male with only one of the juvenile son. After parturition the reproductive female ovulated at the second fortnight and became pregnant again. At this time, those interactions still have a 24-h period, except in grooming directed to the juvenile son by the reproductive male. As in the first post-partum, grooming directed to the newborns showed statistically significant 24-h period. These results suggest that the reproductive pair performs 24-h rhythmic grooming interactions only with some animals, supposed to be the preferential grooming partners. Furthermore, the temporal grooming expression in common marmosets may be affected by the reproductive condition (progesterone levels) of the reproductive female, by the care of newborn after parturition and the group size.

AB  - Maternal smoking is a major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The mechanisms by which cigarette smoke predisposes infants to SIDS are not known. We examined the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on sleep/wake ontogenesis and central cholinergic receptor gene expression in the neonatal rat. Prenatal nicotine exposure transiently increased sleep continuity and accelerated sleep/wake ontogeny in the neonatal rat. Prenatal nicotine also upregulated nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor mRNAs in brain regions involved in regulating vigilance states. These findings suggest that the nicotine contained in cigarette smoke may predispose human infants to SIDS by interfering with the normal maturation of sleep and wake.

AB  - The demonstration of receptors for luteinizing hormone (LH)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in several parts of rat brain suggested their novel functional role. Subsequent studies tested the effect of hCG (intraperitoneally or intracerebroventricularly) on brain arousal and different types of stress situations in an intact female rat model on the day of proestrus. Treatment resulted in changes of activity and several other behavioral patterns associated with sites of brain hCG/LH receptors,. hCG given peripherally caused a longer sleeping time and a decreased activity level. Whereas administration of indomethacin alone had no effect, coadministration inhibited the effects of hCG. hCG increased immunoreactive prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and decreased PGE2 in brain areas controlling activity and sleep. hCG effects were probably mediated via prostaglandin pathways. After central hCG treatment, animals were less active and showed less exploratory behavior in an open-field box than the control animals. Taste and odor neophobias were dramatically decreased following central injection of hCG. hCG-treated rats were less anxious and exhibited a higher level of maternal interest than the controls. hCG treatment also had a beneficial effect against stress ulcer, which was prevented by pre-treatment with antisense receptor oligonucleotide, suggesting a direct hCG receptormediated effect. In summary, because hCG can cross the blood-brain barrier, both peripheral administration and central administration affect several behavioral patterns. This effect is similar to treatment with anxiolytics and suggests the functional relevance of brain LH/hCG receptors. Some observed behavioral changes have parallels in pregnant women.

AB  - The recent miniaturization of implantable radiotelemetric devices offers the possibility of an accurate, reliable, and simple phenotyping tool for long-term, hands-off measurement of blood pressure in unrestrained, untethered mice; however, use has been limited because of high morbidity and mortality in all but larger-than-average mice. Also, because the device was developed for abdominal aorta implantation at the renal artery level, its use has not been feasible in studies where infrarenal blood flow is critical, i.e., in pregnant mice. We provide details of a very successful alternative approach for implanting radiotelemeters in mice, whereby thoracic aortic implantation of the pressure-sensing catheter is combined with subcutaneous placement of the transmitter body along the right flank. We used female C57/BL6 (C57) or BPH/5 mice, a strain derived from the cross of inbred hypertensive and hypotensive mouse strains. We show that this is a reliable procedure for providing high-fidelity mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings for 50-60 days in mice weighing 22 g on average but as small as 17 g. No morbidity or mortality was observed in either strain using this procedure. Importantly, neither strain fully recovered from anesthesia and surgery, as indicated by a return of normal circadian rhythms, until 5-7 days postsurgery. This was also reflected in significantly elevated baseline MAP and HR levels in both strains during this recovery period. Moreover, strain-related differences in relative increases in MAP during the first 5 days of recovery masked the significant elevation in BPH/5 baseline MAP (vs. C57) observed in fully recovered mice. This suggests that methods must allow at least 5-7 days recovery from surgery to provide accurate cardiovascular (CV) phenotyping in mice. Finally, we show that CV parameters can be monitored continuously before, during, and after pregnancy in mice using this alternative implantation approach. The device did not interfere with conception, gestation, delivery, or postnatal care of pups. These results demonstrate the feasibility of stress-free, long-term monitoring of CV parameters in pregnant or nonpregnant mice of typical size and offer exciting possibilities for application in CV functional genomic research.

AB  - A case of neonatal Myotonic Dystrophy (MD) is presented. A 35 week old 3570 g baby was born to a mother affected by MD and pregnancy-induced unstable diabetes. Soon after birth, he developed apnea, severe hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypotonia and mild respiratory distress. His clinical course improved during the following days, but persistent episodes of desaturation and/or cyanosis did not subside; hypotonia was mild. A polysomnographic recording showed mixed central and obstructive apnea. DNA testing showed trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations diagnostic of MD. The baby was discharged with home-sleep monitoring and breast-feeding. Recurrent apnea/bradycardia was the main clinical feature in this case of congenital MD, with increased risk of an acute life-threatening event.

AB  - This open-label prospective study examined maternal and neonatal safety and efficacy outcome measures during and following prenatal buprenorphine exposure. Three opioid-dependent pregnant women received 8 or 12 mg sublingual buprenorphine tablets daily for 15-16 weeks prior to delivery. Results showed that buprenorphine in combination with comprehensive prenatal care was safe and effective in these women. Prenatal exposure to buprenorphine resulted in normal birth outcomes, a mean of 4.33 days (minimum possible=4) hospitalization, and a 'relatively mild' neonatal abstinence syndrome comprised primarily of tremors (disturbed), hyperactive moro and shortened sleep after feeding. The infants required no pharmacological treatment. Onset of neonatal abstinence signs occurred within the first 12 h after birth, peaked by 72 h and returned to below pre-12 h levels by 120 h. It is concluded that buprenorphine has potential utility for the treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent women. Copyright Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Migraine is approximately three times more common in women than in men. Women tend to have longer attacks and are more likely than men to experience aura with migraine, but both sexes can experience frequent and severe attacks. Treatment principles for migraine and guidelines for the use of prophylactic and abortive therapies are generally consistent between males and females. However, due to hormonal changes induced in the female during menstruation, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and menopause, gender-specific therapeutic strategies are often necessary when treating migraine in females.

AB  - Objective: Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and catecholamines are among the major hormones activated during the adaptive response to stressful stimuli. In pregnant women, serum CRF and catecholamines levels increase during labor and preterm delivery. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether psychosocial stress measures are correlated with serum CRF or urinary catecholamine [ie, epinephrine, norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA)] levels in healthy midtrimester pregnant women. Methods: A large group of white pregnant women (n = 382) participated in the present study. The Work Conditions Questionnaire and the Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview were administered to measure job stress and general life stress, respectively. Urine and blood specimens were collected at 28 weeks of gestation at the time of psychosocial evaluation. Epinephrine, NE, and DA were quantified in the urine by a highly sensitive method based on an amperometric detector. Serum CRF and cortisol levels were measured in blood specimens by using specific radioimmunoassays. Results: Serum CRF and cortisol levels did not vary between patients with high and low scores on psychological tests, and no correlation was found between CRF and cortisol levels. One job stress measure, low job latitude, was significantly associated with a mild increase in NE and DA levels in the afternoon and night (P < .05, analysis of variance). Serum cortisol levels were inversely correlated with NE in the morning (r = -0.447; P = .002) and night segments (r = -0.391; P = .007) and with DA in the night period (r = -0.367; P = .013). Conclusion: The absence of a significant relationship between CRF/cortisol and psychosocial stress measures in pregnant women suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to psychosocial stress may be masked at midtrimester by the constantly high levels of placental CRF, whose control is beyond the influence of environmental stressors.

AB  - Two peptides [NAPVSIPQ (NAP) and SALLRSIPA (ADNF-9)], that are associated with novel glial proteins regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide, are shown now to provide protective intervention in a model of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal demise and growth restrictions were produced after intraperitoneal injection of ethanol to pregnant mice during midgestation (E8). Death and growth abnormalities elicited by alcohol treatment during development are believed to be associated, in part, with severe oxidative damage. NAP and ADNF-9 have been shown to exhibit antioxidative and antiapoptotic actions in vitro. Pretreatment with an equimolar combination of the peptides prevented the alcohol-induced fetal death and growth abnormalities. Pretreatment with NAP alone resulted in a significant decrease in alcohol-associated fetal death; whereas ADNF-9 alone had no detectable effect on fetal survival after alcohol exposure, indicating a pharmacological distinction between the peptides. Biochemical assessment of the fetuses indicated that the combination peptide treatment prevented the alcohol-induced decreases in reduced glutathione. Peptide efficacy was evident with either 30-min pretreatment or with 1-h post-alcohol administration. Bioavailability studies with [3H]NAPVSIPQ indicated that 39% of the total radioactivity comigrated with intact peptide in the fetus 60 min after administration. These studies demonstrate that fetal death and growth restriction associated with prenatal alcohol exposure were prevented by combinatorial peptide treatment and suggest that this therapeutic strategy be explored in other models/diseases associated with oxidative stress.

AB  - Longitudinal quantification of leg movements per minute for human subjects during both fetal and neonatal periods was accomplished from videotapings conducted antenatally (ultrasonography 30, 34, and 37 weeks gestational age) and postnatally (birth and 6 weeks of age). Fetal/neonatal subjects displayed decreasing numbers of leg movements per minute during antenatal development (30 to 37 weeks), followed by increasing numbers of leg movements per minute during postnatal development (birth to 6 weeks of age). Male subjects displayed greater numbers of leg movements per minute than female subjects during both antenatal and postnatal development. Fetal-to-neonatal continuity for numbers of leg movements per minute was found for comparisons between fetal (37 weeks gestational age) and neonatal (during sleep states at birth) measures, and females displayed a stronger and different movement continuity pattern than males. These results indicate a differential time course for neurobehavioral development of male and female fetuses/neonates, and the findings have implications for the clinical assessment of fetal neurobehavioral development and well-being.

AB  - Experiments were carried out to determine the threshold level of maternal nicotine that impairs protective responses of rat pups to hypoxia. From days 6 or 7 of gestation, pregnant rats received either vehicle or nicotine (1.50, 3.00, or 6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate.kg body wt-1day-1) or vehicle continuously via a subcutaneous osmotic minipump. On postnatal days 5 or 6, pups were exposed to a single period of hypoxia produced by breathing an anoxic gas mixture (97% N2 or 3% CO2) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they were exposed to intermittent hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from hypoxic-induced primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the time to last gasp or the total number of gasps when the pups were exposed to a single period of hypoxia. The number of successful autoresuscitations on repeated exposure to hypoxia was, however, decreased in pups whose dams had received either 3.00 or 6.00 mg of nicotine tartrate/kg body wt; these dosage regimens produced maternal serum nicotine concentrations of 19 Â± 6 and 35 Â± 8 ng/ml, respectively. Thus our experiments define the threshold level of maternal nicotine that significantly impairs protective responses of 5- to 6-day-old rat pups to intermittent hypoxia such as may occur in human infants during episodes of prolonged sleep apnea or positional asphyxia.

AB  - Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a well-defined symptom complex and is frequently associated with sleep disturbance and a recognized family history. It occurs either as idiopathic RLS or in association with many medical, neurological or vascular disorders. The neurological examination and routine investigations in idiopathic RLS are normal. Polysomnography supports the diagnosis of RLS by documenting the associated sleep disturbances and periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). Although MRI studies disclose no intracerebral lesions, recent Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies point to some involvement of the basal and red nuclei and the cerebellum. No definitive etiology is known for this condition, but several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. There is supportive evidence that RLS is a Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction, suggesting widespread involvement of the descending dopaminergic (DA) pathways, possibly originating in the diencephalon or upper brainstem. This is corroborated by the successful treatment of RLS with DA agents, sedatives, and neurotransmitters. However, RLS can also occur with spinal disorders and spinal cord lesions implying the existence of a spinal generator. The incidence of RLS in pregnancy is well known and its association with vascular disorders supports another mechanism in some patients. The primary treatment of RLS is largely symptomatic and quite effective with DA agents, DA agonists, opioids and other neurotransmitters. The treatment of RLS associated with various diseases is aimed at the correction of the underlying pathological or deficiency states. Antidepressant medications frequently precipitate or worsen the condition of RLS.

AB  - Three studies were undertaken: (i) a nation-wide case-control study for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), with 393 cases and 1592 controls, examined the association between parental reported apnoea and SIDS; (ii) a case-cohort study, with 84 cases of parental reported apnoea and 1502 controls, aimed to identify risk factors for apnoea; and (ii) national hospital admission data for ALTE and national SIDS mortality data were compared for the years 1986 to 1994. Parental reported apnoea was associated with a significant increased risk of SIDS [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 3.09]. The population attributable risk was 8%. There was a significant increased risk for parental reported apnoea in infants who did not die after adjustment for potential confounders with maternal smokers, short gestation and admission to the neonatal unit. There was no association with prone sleeping position, co-sleeping and bottle feeding. The mean annual admission rate for ALTE was 9.4/1000 live births. This did not change significantly over the study period (1986-1994). In contrast, the SIDS mortality rate decreased from over 4/1000 to 2.1/1000. Admission rates were higher for Maori infants and boys. Conclusion: It may be concluded that the relationship between parental reported apnoea and SIDS is tenuous.

AB  - Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem that occurs in approximately 20 to 25 percent of women. Lactation requires the presence of estrogen, progesterone and, most importantly, prolactin. Stress, suckling, sleep, sexual intercourse and medications may increase prolactin levels, whereas dopamine inhibits its release. The differential diagnosis of galactorrhea includes pituitary adenomas, neurologic disorders, hypothyroidism, numerous medications, breast stimulation, chest wall irritation and physiologic causes. The evaluation includes a thorough history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory and imaging studies to rule out secondary causes such as an intracranial mass or a tumor. Diagnostic studies include a pregnancy test, a prolactin level, renal and thyroid function tests and, if indicated, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Treatment options for prolactinomas include observation, dopamine agonists, surgery and radiation therapy, depending on tumor size and associated symptoms. Fortunately, the prognosis for patients with prolactinomas is good: most prolactinomas remain stable or regress. In pregnant women, prolactinomas must be observed closely because the lesions may greatly increase in size.

AB  - In the newborn, presence of sleep-wake cycles indicates integrity and maturity of the central nervous system. By spectral EEG analysis and polygraphic recordings subtle variations of EEG background activity and behavioural patterns corresponding to early sleep-wake cycles have been found in preterm infants as young as 27 weeks of gestation. The emergence of sleep-wake cycles at early gestational ages may have a positive predictive value for long-term neurological outcome. Sleep-wake cycles and their significance for later outcome have not been studied in very preterm infants so far. Accordingly, we prospectively investigated maturational changes of EEG activity and sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants below 30 weeks of gestational age using the Cerebral Function Monitor, an amplitude-integrated EEG. We present preliminary data on the emergence of sleep-wake cycles in preterm infants from this ongoing study. Of 100 infants enrolled during a 1-year period, 38 infants without neurological complications were included in the reference group. In this group (mean gestational age 27 weeks), we observed cyclical variations of EEG background activity resembling early sleep-wake cycles at a mean gestational age of 28 weeks and a median postnatal age of 6 days. It is hypothesised that these cyclical variations of EEG background activity may represent switches between thalamo-cortical and neo-cortical pattern generators and indicate integrity of central nervous system function. Amplitude-integrated EEG may thus serve as a useful non-invasive test for brain function in preterm infants.

AB  - Aims - To test the hypothesis that plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and markers of cholesterol biosynthesis (lathosterol) and absorption efficiency (campesterol) in children aged 8-12 years are related to birth size and subsequent growth. Methods - A total of 412 girls and boys weighing less than 1850 g at birth were studied. Birth weight, gestation, and weight at 18 months were recorded and followed up at 8-12 years. Plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, triacylglycerol, lathosterol, and campesterol were measured. Results - Birth weight for gestational age was positively related to plasma campesterol, and remained so after adjusting for current body size or fatness. Birth weight was negatively related to current plasma lathosterol but only after adjusting for current body size or fatness. For both lathosterol and campesterol the significant relation with birth size adjusted for current size indicates that the change in size between these points (postnatal upward centile crossing) was influential. These relations were absent for total cholesterol, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and triacylglycerol. Conclusion - Preterm children who were smaller for gestational age at birth had lower predicted cholesterol absorption efficiency 8-12 years later. Among children of the same current size, predicted endogenous cholesterol synthesis was higher and cholesterol absorption efficiency lower in those who showed the greatest increase in weight centile between birth and follow up. This finding was not confined to children with the smallest birth weights for gestational age. We suggest that both fetal and childhood growth relate to programming of cholesterol metabolism in children born preterm.

AB  - Epileptic seizures are one of the most frequent neurologic emergencies of children or young adults. There are several causes for the manifestation of a generalized epileptic seizure in the young adult, like tumors, bleeding, trauma or infectious diseases of the central nervous system, disturbances in the electrolyte homeostatis, metabolic disorders, drug or alcohol abuse as well as sleep deprivation. In only 1% of the cases are the seizures caused by idiopathic epilepsy. We report the case of a seventeen year old female patient who was admitted to the emergency department after a first generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Severe headache occurred for two days that was successfully treated with analgetics. The general physical examination was normal despite adipositas, neurologic examination was also normal, as were laboratory tests and the cranial computed tomographic scan. The patient was treated with antiepileptic drugs under the assumption of idiopathic epilepsia. Despite therapy, a visual-field defect developed, followed by three generalized epileptic seizures during the next three hours. The patient underwent lumbar puncture as well as drug screening and estimation of the thyroid hormones; all were without pathologic results. A more detailed anamnesis and examination of the spot urine sample gave a hint for the cause of repeated seizures, which were finally caused by a severe general disease.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a central circadian oscillator of mammals, contains various peptides arranged in the compartment specific manner. In the present study, we examined a distinct population of neurons in the central part of the SCN. In situ hybridization histochemistry has demonstrated that these neurons coexpressed both preprosomatostatin (PPSS) and preprotachykinin A (PPT-A) mRNAs, but the developmental expression profiles were different among two. PPSS mRNA first appeared in the SCN at postnatal day 1(P1). The intensity and number of PPSS mRNA signals increased and peaked at P7-P14 and gradually decreased as to adult age (P56). However, PPT-A mRNA-positive appeared late at P7, and gradually increased up to P56. These findings suggest that neurons encoding both the PPSS and PPTA genes first express PPSS and then express PPT-A at a later stage of maturation. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A more robust theory of the causation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is needed. The asphyxial theory of SIDS, which encompasses the prone sleeping position, relies on contradictory pathological evidence and fails to explain infants with SIDS who are found in the supine or lateral position. Many of the risk factors for SIDS point to an infective cause. The relative risks of these infection-related factors differ from study to study, as does the relative risk of prone sleeping position. I present the case for an infection model for SIDS causation, which has largely been neglected by mainstream SIDS researchers.

AB  - Three main concerns underlie this review: 1) The need to draw together the widely dispersed information available on the circadian biology of the rabbit. Although the rabbit is a classic laboratory mammal, this extensive body of information is often overlooked by chronobiologists, and despite several advantages of this species. In terms of its general biology the rabbit is the best studied laboratory mammal in the wild, it demonstrates a wide variety of robust circadian functions, and being a lagomorph, it provides a useful comparison with more commonly studied rodent species. 2) The need to more fully exploit a developmental approach to understanding circadian function, and the particular suitability of the rabbit for this. Female rabbits only visit their altricial young for a few minutes once every 24 h to nurse, and survival of the young depends on the tight circadian-controlled synchronization in behavior and physiology of the two parties. Patterns of circadian rhythmicity in neonatal pups associated with nursing do not form a smooth continuum into weaning and adult life, and may reflect the action of separate mechanisms operating in their own right. 3) Using information from the first two points, to emphasize the diversity and complexity of circadian rhythms underlying behavioral and physiological functions in adult and developing mammals. Information accruing on circadian functions in the rabbit makes it increasingly difficult to account for these in terms of one or two regulatory mechanisms or "oscillators." Thus, it is argued that in addition to the reductionist, molecular approaches currently dominating much of chronobiology, the study of circadian systems as emergent characteristics of whole organisms operating in complex environments merits special attention.

AB  - A 17-year-old primigravid woman presented with Cushing's syndrome. Typical clinical symptoms and signs developed at the beginning of pregnancy. By week 17 of gestation, plasma cortisol diurnal rhythm was absent and there was a paradoxical increase in plasma cortisol after a 1-mg dexamethasone overnight suppression test. Basal urinary free cortisol was 10 times above the upper limit (in pregnancy) and ACTH levels were suppressed. The diagnosis of ACTH - independent Cushing's syndrome was established. MRI scans revealed normal adrenal and pituitary glands. To control hypercortisolism, the patient was treated with metyrapone. At 34 weeks of gestation, the patient developed preeclampsia and underwent caesarean section. A female infant weighing 1070 g was delivered. No apparent metyrapone-induced teratogenic effects were observed. Cushing's syndrome in the patient resolved within three weeks of delivery. No corticosteroid replacement therapy either for child or mother was needed. Eight months after delivery the patient became pregnant again and rapidly developed Cushing's syndrome with typical clinical symptoms and signs and laboratory results (urinary free cortisol 6464 nmol/24 h). This second pregnancy was unwanted and terminated by artificial abortion that was followed by rapid resolution of hypercortisolism. A third pregnancy, 12 months after delivery was also accompanied by the rapid development of hypercortisolism which recovered after artificial termination. The mechanisms by which pregnancy-induced Cushing's syndrome occurred in this patient are unclear. Aberrant responsiveness or hyperresponsiveness of adrenocortical cells to a non-ACTH and non-CRH substance produced in excess in pregnancy should be considered. Metyrapone suppression of hypercortisolism currently represents the best treatment for these rare cases.

AB  - A theory based on the model of how the auditory-brain system perceive primary sensations is used to explain the differential effects of noise and music signals on the sleep of babies and on the performance of mental tasks by children. In a previous study by Ando and Hattori, [1], it was found that sleeping babies (2-4 months old) whose mothers had begun living in a noisy area before conception or during the first five months of pregnancy did not react to daily aircraft noise but did react to music. In another previous study by Ando et al. [2], the percentage of the pupils in "V-type relaxation" state during an adding task in a quiet living area was much greater when pupils heard music than when they heard noise. These phenomena are explained here by the difference between the temporal factors extracted from the running autocorrelation function of the noise and music signals.

AB  - It is now recognized that high-level impulse noises penetrate the uterus of pregnant sheep, elevate thresholds of fetal auditory-evoked potential and produce damage to fetal inner ear hair cells. However, little is known about functional effects of airborne impulse noise on the late-term fetus. In the present study, the effects of a series of 20 impulses on the behavioral state of 6 fetal sheep were tested. Noise impulses produced 169.3 peak sound pressure level (pSPL) in air. Peak levels recorded near the fetal head averaged 161.1 dB. Impulses delivered to the fetus during periods of NREM sleep resulted in a decrease in average fetal heart rate (FHR) from 185 Â± 22 beats/min (bpm) before stimulation to 174 Â± 23 bpm 2-5 s after stimulation (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, an FHR acceleration occurred (before stimulation: 177 Â± 24 bpm, after stimulation: 189 Â± 31 bpm; p < 0.05). Impulse exposure during NREM sleep resulted in reductions in delta-, theta- and alpha-band powers. As a consequence, total power decreased from 100 to 72 Â± 16% (p < 0.05). During REM sleep, stimulation provoked a short decrease in total band power from 100 to 73 Â± 20% and a similar decrease in the theta- and beta-band powers. The results indicated that impulse noise evoked short-term alterations in FHR and cortical activity. These changes were mediated by auditory brain stem activation that led to cortical desynchronization during both NREM and REM sleep in late-term fetal sheep. Copyright Â© 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - It is well known that there are circadian rhythms of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and neuronal firing in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) during fetal and early postnatal periods. A core clock mechanism in the mouse SCN appears to involve a transcriptional feedback loop in which CLOCK and BMAL1 function as positive regulators and three mPeriod (mPer) genes play a role in negative feedback. Per genes expression occurs not only in the adult SCN but also in the fetal SCN. However, the developmental change in these genes remains unclear. In this experiment, we examined the day-night pattern of expression of Per1 and Per2 mRNA in the mouse SCN and cerebral cortex on embryonic day 17, postnatal day 3, and in young adult mice under a light-dark cycle. Daily rhythms of mRNA content were observed in mPer1 but not mPer2 in the fetal SCN. Interestingly, the expression of mPer2 in the SCN was high throughout the entire day, and a significant daily rhythm of this gene was observed on postnatal day 6. The expression pattern of SCN mPer1 in constant darkness was similar to that seen in the light-dark cycle. The present results suggest that the daily oscillation of mPer1 but not of mPer2 in the SCN in fetal and early postnatal mice may be associated with the daily rhythms of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and neuronal firing.

AB  - Sleep problems are common in pregnant women. This review examines sleep in normal pregnancy; discusses the physiologic bases for alterations in sleep, including hormonal and mechanical factors; and correlates these factors with changes in sleep of pregnant women, as determined subjectively by surveys and objectively by polysomnographic studies. The changes in respiratory physiology during pregnancy, the possible predisposition of the pregnant woman to sleep-disordered breathing because of these changes, and results of published studies of sleep-disordered breathing in pregnancy are discussed. Finally, the effect of pregnancy on other sleep disorders and the management of these sleep disorders during pregnancy are outlined, including changes in management necessitated by this state. The paucity of available data and the need for further studies of incidence and outcomes of sleep disorders in the pregnant woman are emphasized.

AB  - 1. We determined the effects of betamethasone on the fetal sheep electrocorticogram (ECoG) using linear (power spectral) and non-linear analysis. For non-linear analysis we used an algorithm based on the Wolf algorithm for the estimation of the leading Lyapunov exponent which calculates a prediction error based on the course of the time series in the phase space. A high prediction error stands for low predictibility or low regularity and vice versa. 2. After 48 h of baseline recordings, vehicle (n = 6) or betamethasone (n = 7) at 10 Î¼g h-1 was infused over 48 h to the sheep fetus at 128 days gestational age (0.87 of gestation). 3. ECoG spectral analysis revealed no difference in power spectrum between vehicle- and betamethasone-treated fetuses. The prediction error of the ECoG during REM sleep was higher than during non-REM or quiet sleep in both groups (P &lt; 0.0001) revealing lower causality of brain activity during REM sleep. During REM sleep, prediction error significantly decreased 18-24 h after onset of betamethasone treatment. (P &lt; 0.05) and returned to baseline values within the following 24 h of continued betamethasone treatment. No ECoG changes were found during quiet sleep. Non-linear ECoG changes during metabolically active REM sleep accompanied the previously described decrease in cerebral blood flow. 4. These results suggest that betamethasone in doses used in perinatal medicine acutely alters complex neuronal activity.

AB  - Aims: Routinely antepartal CTG will be recorded for 30 minutes to obtain normal resting phases, a decrease of irregulatory due to hypoxia or to differentiate these from each other. In case of early onset of hypoxia first pathological findings might only be seen by chance in incidentally recorded CTG. The goal of this study was, if a continuous 24 hour-CTG will allow an earlier detection of beginning hypoxia in case of placental insufficiency compared to a routine CTG of 30 minutes. Methods: 21 normal pregnancies and 17 patients with placental insufficiency of â¥ 36 weeks had 24 hour-CTG's by means of telemetry. In both study groups fetal heart rate (FHR) tracing included a full qualitative and quantitative description. Comparison of the results of both groups was done to look for early signs of pathological findings concerning reduced fetal well-being. Results: In comparison to normal pregnancies patients with placental insufficiency had in 4.5 % oscillation frequency type A and an increase of saltatory and silent oscillation. The number of accelerations and Dip 0 was significantly reduced as well as accelerations in combination with undulatory oscillation. Baseline tachycardia and bradycardia showed significantly increasing quantity. Conclusions: 24 hour-CTG is a good screening method to detect early onset of hypoxia in case of beginning placental insufficiency. The failure to find any clinically significant difference in the diurnal variation of both groups suggests, that less than 24 hour testing is required. 8 hour-CTG could be a compromise and a big help to detect a fetus at risk earlier.

AB  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants born at term and this increase is inversely related to gestational age. The incidence and severity of apnoea of prematurity, are also inversely related to gestational age. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia affected the maturation of arousal responses. Twenty-five premature infants were studied. A perinatal risk score was determined for each infant and infants were divided into those with a neonatal history of apnoea/bradycardia (n=16) and those without (n=9). All infants were studied using daytime polysomnography on three occasions: (a) a preterm study around 36 weeks gestation, (b) within 3 weeks of term, and (c) 2-3 months post-term. Multiple measurements of arousal threshold (cmH2O) in response to air-jet stimulation applied alternately to the nares were made in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). Arousal thresholds were elevated in apnoeic infants compared to control infants in both AS (P&lt;0.05) and QS (P&lt;0.001) at the term study and in QS at 2-3 months post-term (P&lt;0.01). In addition, arousal thresholds were positively correlated with perinatal risk score in both sleep states, in all studies, with the exception of AS at 2-3 months when all infants were readily arouseable. We conclude that a history of prematurity with neonatal apnoea has a persisting effect on decreasing arousabilty from sleep and these infants may be at increased risk for SIDS.

AB  - Background. The proportion of women who stop smoking during pregnancy has varied between 17 and 40% percent in Sweden with a tendency of lower prevalence in recent years. The aim of the present study was to examine the factors that might influence the ability to stop smoking during pregnancy. Method. One hundred and two women were interviewed shortly after their first visit to the antenatal clinic and a second time approximately one month after delivery. Two women who had late spontaneous abortions were excluded. The women were asked about background factors, smoking habits of their parents, smoking history and current smoking habits. The carbon monoxide in expiratory air was measured to verify reported smoking habits. Results. Fifty-six of the 100 participating women had stopped smoking before the second interview. Having started smoking at an older age, having no previous children, smoking few cigarettes, a higher level of education, positive support from the partner and having lived with non-smoking parents were all associated with stopping smoking when tested as single factors. Reported smoking habits could be verified. Age, smoking habits of the partner, passive smoking at work, quality of sleep, general perceived health, length of sick-leave or amount of nausea were not correlated to stopping smoking. Conclusion. The presence of several factors found to influence stopping smoking during pregnancy, and the tendency for smoking habits to be passed over to the new generation, are reasons for comprehensive and individualized, anti-smoking support.

AB  - Treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) consists of restriction of natural protein and provision of a protein substitute that lacks phenylalanine but is enriched in tyrosine. Large and unexplained differences exist, however, in the tyrosine enrichment of the protein substitutes. Furthermore, some investigators advise providing extra free tyrosine in addition to the tyrosine-enriched protein substitute, especially in the treatment of maternal PKU. In this article, we discuss tyrosine concentrations in blood during low-phenylalanine, tyrosine-enriched diets and the implications of these blood tyrosine concentrations for supplementation with tyrosine. We conclude that the present method of tyrosine supplementation during the day is far from optimal because it does not prevent low blood tyrosine concentrations, especially after an overnight fast, and may result in largely increased blood tyrosine concentrations during the rest of the day. Both high tyrosine enrichment of protein substitutes and extra free tyrosine supplementation may not be as safe as considered at present, especially to the fetus of a woman with PKU. The development of dietary compounds that release tyrosine more slowly could be beneficial. We advocate decreasing the tyrosine content of protein substitutes to â6% by wt (6 g/100 g protein equivalent) at most and not giving extra free tyrosine without knowing the diurnal variations in the blood tyrosine concentration and having biochemical evidence of a tyrosine deficiency. We further advocate that a better daily distribution of the protein substitute be achieved by improving the palatability of these products.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the definition of daytime and nighttime on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in pregnancy. To determine the prevalence of a <10% decrease in mean arterial pressure with sleep (nondipper) in pregnancy and the consistency of nondipper status throughout pregnancy. In a prospective, longitudinal study, 102 pregnant woman underwent 24-h ABP monitoring and recorded sleep patterns at â¤14, 19 to 22, 27 to 30, 35 to 37 weeks' gestation and 5 to 9 weeks' postpartum. Nighttime was defined by arbitrary hours or actual periods of sleep. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements using the different definitions of nighttime were compared in the total cohort and individual women. Nondipper status of each woman was determined throughout pregnancy and postpartum. At 35 to 37 weeks' gestation, 19% of women napped during the day and 20% were awake during the night. Throughout pregnancy, mean day and night systolic and diastolic ABP measurements were similar whether daytime and nighttime were defined by arbitrary hours or by sleep periods. In individuals, the use of arbitrary hours (day 07:00 to 21:59, night 22:00 to 06:59) compared to sleep periods to define day and night resulted in differences in daytime systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of up to 4 and 5 mm Hg, respectively. Similarly there were individual differences in nighttime SBP up to 10 mm Hg and DBP up to 11 mm Hg. A third of women were nondippers at least once during pregnancy, but only two women were consistent nondippers. The different definitions of day and night did not change group ABP measurements, but resulted in significant variation in ABP measurements in individual pregnant women. Nondippers were common and nondipper status frequently changed during pregnancy. Â© 2001 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

AB  - The authors conducted 2 surveys to determine the relationship between time of birth and being a day person or a night person. Day persons are most alert during daylight hours; night persons are most alert during hours of darkness. In Survey 1, the authors asked U.S. high school students to complete the Alertness Questionnaire (B. Wallace, 1993) and to respond to other items related to daytime or nighttime activity. In Survey 2, the authors administered the same items to a U.S. college population. In both surveys, time of birth was significantly related to being a day person or a night person. The results suggest that a critical period for setting the biological clock for alertness may be the moment of birth. Â© 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction. The restless legs syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation in the legs which causes an imperative need to move the legs and is therefore considered to be a disorder of movement. When it appears before going to sleep, it may interfere with falling asleep and lead to a sleep-deficit. Development and conclusions. It is a clinical condition with a satisfactory treatment, and improvement of the associated sleep disorder. The etiology is unknown, sometimes it is familial. The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Polysomnography is not necessary, unless one suspects an associated disorder of periodic leg movements. Treatment is by dopaminergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant drugs or clonidine.

She also smokes 20 cigarettes a day. I am concerned about the effects of marijuana exposure on her baby. ANSWER: It is not always possible to isolate the effect of marijuana exposure from other possible confounders on pregnancy outcome. Although marijuana is not an established human teratogen, recent well conducted studies suggest it might have subtle negative effects on neurobehavioural outcomes, including sleep disturbances, impaired visual problem solving, hyperactivity, impassivity, inattention, and increased delinquency.

AB  - Serum melatonin concentrations were studied in normal pregnant women and in women with several types of pathologic pregnancies, e.g., twins, preeclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Blood samples were collected from the maternal antecubital vein at 14:00 hr (daytime) and 02:00 hr (nighttime) during pregnancy, and also from the umbilical vein and artery immediately after delivery. Serum melatonin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Daytime serum melatonin levels in normal (single fetus; singleton) pregnancies were low. While the levels showed an increasing tendency toward the end of pregnancy, no statistically significant changes occurred. On the other hand, the nighttime serum melatonin levels increased after 24 weeks of gestation, with significantly (P < 0.01) high levels after 32 weeks; these values decreased to non-pregnant levels on the 2nd day of puerperium. Nighttime serum melatonin levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in twin pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation than in singleton pregnancies, whereas the patients with severe preeclampsia showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower serum melatonin levels than the mild preeclampsia or the normal pregnant women after 32 weeks of gestation. Melatonin concentrations in umbilical vessels showed a higher tendency in neonates who were born during at night compared with the other neonates; moreover, those in the umbilical artery were generally higher than those in the umbilical vein. The present results indicate that in humans, the maternal serum melatonin levels show a diurnal rhythm, which increases until the end of pregnancy, reflecting some pathologic states of the feto-placental unit. Fetuses may produce melatonin with a circadian rhythm.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the ability of late-pregnant (days 15-22) rat uterine tissue rings to contract in response to electric field stimulation in vitro. For this purpose, maximum rhythmic contractions were elicited by optimum choice of the period time and the pulse width, the two main parameters of electric field stimulation. In parallel, the plasma 17Î²-estradiol and progesterone levels were determined. It was found that the contractility ratio, i.e. the quotient of the optimum pulse width and the period time, is a good parameter with which to express the contractility. The larger the contractility ratio, the better the ability to contract. Evaluation of the area under the curve did not furnish information relating to the contractility in this method. A very close correlation was observed between the contractility ratio and the quotient of the 17Î²-estradiol and progesterone levels on different days, demonstrating that the in vitro ability characterized by the contractility ratio is in keeping with the physiological regularity. There was also a very close correlation between the contractility ratio and the quotient of the Î±1- and Î²-adrenergic receptors, suggesting the main role of the numbers of Î±1-receptor in pregnant uterine contractility. It is believed that this is the first in vitro model to give a numerical measure concerning the ontogeny of uterine contractility in late pregnancy. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Objective: We investigated the epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the Tyrol before and after an intervention campaign. Patients and methods: Descriptive characteristics and risk factors of SIDS before the campaign were assessed in a retrospective case-control study (1984 to 1994). In April 1994 a country-wide information campaign on modifiable risk behaviours was initiated. Thereafter we prospectively collected data on child care practices four to six weeks after birth for all infants born in the Tyrol (participation rate 72%; n = 28,361) and evaluated new SIDS cases (1994 to 1998). For this purpose two questionnaires were used, one with 96 items for the evaluation of all SIDS cases and assessment of child care practices before 1994, and the other with 24 items for prospective data collection. Results: The incidence of SIDS decreased from 1.83 (mean incidence, 1984-1994) to 0.4/1000 live births immediately after the campaign and remained low until 1998. The frequency of maternal smoking during pregnancy declined (22.9% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.01), as did the prevalence of the prone sleeping position (53.7% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001) and of non-breastfeeding (21.3% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001). All these variables were prominent risk factors for SIDS before the campaign and remained significant thereafter. On account of the markedly reduced prevalence of the prone sleeping position, smoking became the most common SIDS risk factor. The prevalence of sleeping on the side significantly increased (5.1% vs. 36.4%, p < 0.001) and the social status of mothers of SIDS infants tended to be lower than that before the campaign. The clear winter preponderance of SIDS which was evident before the campaign disappeared, or was even reversed. Conclusions: Our study documents the long-term efficacy of a low-cost intervention campaign by way of health education. Further efforts must be directed toward lower social classes, thereby focusing on maternal smoking and avoidance of the side sleeping position.

AB  - Rat or hamster pups exposed to constant light or darkness since birth exhibit many circadian rhythms synchronized with those of the mother. During early development, a number of cues derived from the maternal circadian system synchronize the fetal and neonatal circadian clock. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation during early pregnancy disrupts maternal synchronization of parotid Î±-amylase and testicular malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythms in rat pups. Maternal pineal sympathetic denervation was used to study potential agents able to synchronize the fetal or neonatal circadian clock. Melatonin injection to denervated pregnant mothers prevents the pineal sympathetic denervation effect on those circadian rhythms. We now studied the synchronizing effect of a benzodiazepine compound, diazepam. This GABAA agonist synchronized testicular malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity of pups when it was injected to sympathetic denervated pregnant dams (a daily dose at 07:00 or 19:00h from the 14th to the 20thday of gestation) or orally administered to the pups (a daily dose at 19:00h from the 10th to 24th day of life). Co-injection of diazepam and GABAA antagonist, flumazenil, blocked the synchronizing effect of diazepam. The results demonstrate that diazepam has a synchronizing effect on the development of the circadian clock in rats and suggest that modulation of maternal GABAA could participate in mammalian maternal synchronization.

AB  - The circadian time-keeping system is the neural system that allows predictive adaptation of individuals to the reproducible 24-hour day/night alternations of our planet. A biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, receives environmental information and imposes a circadian pattern to physiological functions. Since the suprachiasmatic nucleus develops early in gestation and circadian rhythms are present in the fetus and newborn, the circadian system seems to be functional in fetal life and can receive circadian inputs through the mother. The neonate moves to an environment in which the main time giving signal is the light:dark cycle. Teleologically, a term newborn should be fit to face this challenge. But this may be quite different for a preterm infant that trades the circadian environment to which it was previously exposed for the timeless environment of the Neonatal Intensive Care Nursery. Scientists and physicians should seek new experimental and clinical approaches to answer the challenging questions of perinatal chronomedicine. Copyright Â© 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company.

AB  - The article is dedicated to a pressing problem of arterial hypertension in the postmenopausal period. Our objective in this study was identifying of special features of the course of arterial hypertension by data secured from a 24-hr monitoring of AH in those women in the post-menopausal period of both surgical and natural genesis. Those women with a surgical menopause had a higher level of AH in the diastole, with that in the systole being the same as in the control group in spite of the fact that the former women were at about the same age, as evidenced by results of the study made. The load indices were also higher, which fact suggested to us, first, a gravier course of AH in those women with a natural menopause and second, that removal of ovaries at the child-bearing age is a prognostically unfavourable factor.

AB  - This quasi-experimental research investigates developmental regulation around a critical life-span transition, the "biological clock" for childbearing. The action-phase model of developmental regulation proposes contrasting control orientations in individuals approaching versus those having passed a developmental deadline. Individuals in an urgency phase close to the deadline should be invested in goal pursuit, whereas those who have passed the deadline without attaining the goal should focus on goal disengagement and self-protection. In 2 studies, women at different ages and with or without children were compared with regard to various indicators of primary and secondary control striving for goal attainment versus goal disengagement and self-protection. Findings support the action-phase model of developmental regulation. Patterns of control striving congruent with the participants' status as preversus postdeadline were associated with superior psychological well-being.

AB  - Women have twice the incidence of major depression compared with men. They are prone to develop episodes of depression during times of reproductive hormonal change at puberty, with use of oral contraceptives, during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, postpartum and during the perimenopause (see review: Parry 1995a). Wirz-Justice (1995) describes the variety of disturbances in biological rhythms observed in mood disorders. In this report, we describe the chronobiological disturbances observed in female-specific mood disorders, namely, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, pregnancy and postpartum depression and menopause. We hypothesize that changing reproductive hormones, by affecting the synchrony or coherence between components of the circadian system, may alter amplitude or phase (timing) relationships and thereby contribute to the development of mood disorders in predisposed individuals.

AB  - Maternal treatment with cocaine or a D1-dopamine receptor agonist induces c-fos gene expression in the fetal suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Other treatments that induce c-fos expression in the fetal SCN include caffeine and nicotine. In the current article, the authors assessed whether these different pharmacological treatments activate c-fos expression by a common neurochemical mechanism. The results indicate the presence of at least two distinct pharmacological pathways to c-fos expression in the fetal rat SCN. Previous studies demonstrate that prenatal activation of dopamine receptors affects the developing circadian system. The present work shows that stimulant drugs influence the fetal brain through multiple transmitter systems and further suggests that there may be multiple pathways leading to entrainment of the fetal biological clock.

AB  - Prenatal stress in rats can exert profound influence on the offspring's development, inducing abnormalities such as increased "anxiety", "emotionality" or "depression-like" behaviours. Prenatal stress has long-term effects on the development of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and forebrain cholinergic systems. These long-term neuroendocrinological effects are mediated, at least in part, by stress-induced maternal corticosterone increase during pregnancy and stress-induced maternal anxiety during the postnatal period. We have shown a significant phase advance in the circadian rhythms of corticosterone secretion and locomotor activity in prenatally-stressed (PNS) rats. When subjected to an abrupt shift in the light-dark (LD) cycle, PNS rats resynchronized their activity rhythm more slowly than control rats. In view of the data suggesting abnormalities in the circadian timing system in these animals, we have investigated the effects of prenatal stress on the sleep-wake cycle in adult male rats. PNS rats exhibited various changes in sleep-wake parameters, including a dramatic increase in the amount of paradoxical sleep. Taken together, our results indicate that prenatal stress can induce increased responses to stress and abnormal circadian rhythms and sleep in adult rats. Various clinical observations in humans suggest a possible pathophysiological link between depression and disturbances in circadian rhythmicity. Circadian abnormalities in depression can be related to those found in PNS rats. Interestingly, we have recently shown that the increased immobility in the forced swimming test observed in PNS rats can be corrected by chronic treatment with the antidepressant tianeptine, or with melatonin or S23478, a melatonin agonist. Those results reinforce the idea of the usefulness of PNS rats as an appropriate animal model to study human depression and support a new antidepressant-like effect of melatonin and the melatonin agonist S23478.

AB  - Maternal recognition of pregnancy in rodents requires semicircadian surges of hypophyseal PRL secretion during early gestation, which are required for the formation of the corpus luteum of pregnancy (CLP). Here we show that puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (Psa)-deficient mice display female infertility that results from impaired formation of CLP. Transplantation of mutant ovaries into normal females restored fertility but not vice versa. Psa-deficient females revealed no semicircadian surges of PRL induced after mating stimuli. Pregnancy in the mutant females was restored by grafting intact pituitaries to elevate circulating levels of PRL. Psa is thus required for the appearance of the semicircadian surges of PRL secretion that are crucial for maintaining pregnancy in rodents.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indirect evidence suggests that adrenal steroid production in the human fetus may have a circadian rhythm. To assess whether there is a 24-hour rhythm of fetal cortisol in the human fetus, we investigated the relationship between fetal and maternal cortisol and cortisone concentrations in maternal, umbilical arterial, and umbilical venous blood samples over a 24-hour period. STUDY DESIGN: Elective cesarean sections were scheduled every 2 hours around the clock in 57 term (38-41 weeks' gestation) nonlaboring pregnant women. Plasma cortisol and cortisone concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean 24-hour cortisol concentration was higher in umbilical arterial than in umbilical venous blood samples, 63.6Â±4.6 ng/mL (SEM) versus 48.7Â±3.2 ng/mL, respectively (P < .05). Fetal plasma cortisol showed a rhythm in the umbilical artery (acme from noon to 4 PM) (1-way analysis of variance and least significant difference test; P < .05) but not in the umbilical vein. Umbilical arteriovenous differences showed no net transfer of cortisol to the fetus at any time of the day and net fetal production of cortisol from 8 AM to 6 PM. There was limited transfer of cortisone to the fetus and only in the 2 AM-to-noon time interval. CONCLUSION: These data suggest the presence of a 24-hour rhythm of fetal adrenal cortisol secretion that may be controlled by a fetal circadian pacemaker.

AB  - Retrospective studies suggest that gestational stress in humans can delay the attainment of developmental milestones, increase the incidence of allergic reactions and respiratory infections and cause behavioural abnormalities in the children. Our studies and others have shown that prenatal stress in rats can mimic several of these developmental and behavioural alterations. These include a suppression of immune function, but also enhanced sensitivity to allergens. Prenatally-stressed rats, like children, show a reduced propensity for social interaction and increased anxiety in intimidating or novel situations. They have physiological and behavioural alterations consistent with depressive symptoms, including a phase-shift in their circadian rhythm for corticosterone, sleep abnormalities, and greater acquisition of learned helplessness under appropriate conditions. Prenatally-stressed male rats also show demasculinisation and feminisation of their sexual behaviour. The developmental and behavioural abnormalities in prenatally-stressed offspring may be mediated by alterations in the activity of endogenous opioids or neurosteroids, since several of them can be corrected by maternal administration of an opioid antagonist or by drugs like diazepam and allopregnanolone that modulate GABA transmission.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Arterial blood pressure (BP) shows circadian variation. The most important feature of the circadian variation of BP is it fall during sleep. Nocturnal fall of BP achieves at least 10% ("dip"). Very scanty literature is available on the diurnal BP pattern in healthy gravidae with uncomplicated pregnancy. DESIGN: The aim of the study was to evaluate of the day-time/night-time mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) fall in pregnant woman in the first half of pregnancy in comparison with healthy non-pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty seven healthy woman were included into the study, and divided into two groups: 23 pregnant woman in 7-20 weeks of first gestation and 34 non-pregnant woman. All the subjects were included into the 24-hours non-invasive automated blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal fall of BP appeared to be the most pronounced element of the circadian BP pattern in the studied women. Women in the first half of pregnancy exhibit reduction of BP in the night-time similar to that observed in the non-pregnant subjects. In average, 2/3 of pregnant women below 20 weeks of gestation belong to "dippers" in the MAP range. Women with higher mean diurnal BP value have less pronounced nocturnal BP "dip".

AB  - The recent miniaturization of implantable radiotelemetric devices offers the possibility of an accurate, reliable, and simple phenotyping tool for long-term, hands-off measurement of blood pressure in unrestrained, untethered mice; however, use has been limited because of high morbidity and mortality in all but larger-than-average mice. Also, because the device was developed for abdominal aorta implantation at the renal artery level, its use has not been feasible in studies where infrarenal blood flow is critical, i.e., in pregnant mice. We provide details of a very successful alternative approach for implanting radiotelemeters in mice, whereby thoracic aortic implantation of the pressure-sensing catheter is combined with subcutaneous placement of the transmitter body along the right flank. We used female C57/BL6 (C57) or BPH/5 mice, a strain derived from the cross of inbred hypertensive and hypotensive mouse strains. We show that this is a reliable procedure for providing high-fidelity mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) recordings for 50-60 days in mice weighing 22 g on average but as small as 17 g. No morbidity or mortality was observed in either strain using this procedure. Importantly, neither strain fully recovered from anesthesia and surgery, as indicated by a return of normal circadian rhythms, until 5-7 days postsurgery. This was also reflected in significantly elevated baseline MAP and HR levels in both strains during this recovery period. Moreover, strain-related differences in relative increases in MAP during the first 5 days of recovery masked the significant elevation in BPH/5 baseline MAP (vs. C57) observed in fully recovered mice. This suggests that methods must allow at least 5-7 days recovery from surgery to provide accurate cardiovascular (CV) phenotyping in mice. Finally, we show that CV parameters can be monitored continuously before, during, and after pregnancy in mice using this alternative implantation approach. The device did not interfere with conception, gestation, delivery, or postnatal care of pups. These results demonstrate the feasibility of stress-free, long-term monitoring of CV parameters in pregnant or nonpregnant mice of typical size and offer exciting possibilities for application in CV functional genomic research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the physiological effects of shift work on the urinary excretion rates of norepinephrine, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and estriol in hospital nurses. METHOD: Twenty-four hour urine specimens were examined on a daytime/nighttime basis for each work shift of pregnant and non-pregnant subjects. The urinary norepinephrine and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and estriol by radio-immunoassay. RESULTS: Urinary norepinephrine level during the night work was higher than the night levels of the days off and the day shift. Urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin level during the night work was lower than the night levels of the days off and the day shift. Urinary estriol level of pregnant subjects showed no differences among work shift and also between daytime and nighttime. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary excretion rates of norepinephrine and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were affected by shift work both for non-pregnant and pregnant subjects. It was unlikely that urinary estriol levels in the pregnant subjects were significantly affected by shift work.

AB  - Studies based on casual blood pressure measurements concluded that both age and parity have significant effects on blood pressure during pregnancy. We have tested these results on clinically healthy normotensive women who were systematically studied by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during their pregnancies. We analyzed 1254 blood pressure series sampled for 48 consecutive hours every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery in 205 normotensive pregnant women. Data were divided for comparative analysis by parity (nulliparous versus multiparous), age (</=25, 26 to 30, 31 to 35, and >/=36 years), and trimester of gestation. Circadian parameters established by population multiple-component analysis were compared between groups with a nonparametric test. Effects of age and parity on blood pressure were also tested by ANOVA. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern described by a model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 hours is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (always P<0.001). There was no significant difference in 24-hour mean among groups divided by parity at any age or stage of pregnancy (always P>0.160). A trend of increasing blood pressure with age was found for diastolic but not systolic blood pressure. Although statistically significant, differences in the 24-hour mean of diastolic blood pressure among groups divided by age were always <1.5 mm Hg. Data obtained from systematic ambulatory monitoring in normotensive pregnant women indicate the lack of differences in blood pressure according to parity. The small, although significant, increase in diastolic blood pressure with age may have little influence in the proper identification of women with gestational hypertension. Reference thresholds for blood pressure to be used in the early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy could thus be developed as a function of rest-activity cycle and gestational age, independent of parity or maternal age.

AB  - Cortisol levels dramatically increase during pregnancy, peak at birth, and subsequently decline. However, all previous studies examined women during pregnancy and early postpartum. None examined the long-term association of parity and lactation with cortisol levels. We examined the relation of reproductive history to cortisol levels in postmenopausal women. Subjects were 749 women, aged 50-89, who were not using estrogen in 1984-1987 when morning cortisol was measured. Parity was not significantly associated with cortisol. However, women who breast-fed for >12 months had significantly higher cortisol levels than women who breast-fed for shorter durations or not at all (p = 0.003). This association was stronger among women with three or more births. Duration of breast-feeding is a determinant of cortisol levels in postmenopausal women. Because both increased cortisol and increased duration of breast-feeding may play protective roles in certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, we suggest that the beneficial effect of lactation on the course of these diseases may be mediated by cortisol.

AB  - Recently it has been shown that magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) - the choice for therapy and prophylaxis of eclampsia - has an antihypertensive effect in pregnant women with pregnancy induced hypertension. The population PK/PD properties of MgSO4 in pregnant women are almost unknown. A population PK/PD analysis using NONMEM was performed on data from 51 pregnant Chinese women with pregnancy induced hypertension who received two consecutive MgSO4 infusion (120 mg/kg for 1 h and 24 mg/kg for 5 h). A 2-compartment model is fitted to measured blood Mg2+ concentrations (ca. 8/subject) observed in these subjects over 24 hours after beginning infusion. An Emax model is fitted to systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. The circadian rhythm in blood pressure is modeled with a cosine function. Placebo effect on blood pressure is assumed absent, as no placebo data is available. Population PK parameter estimates (meanÂ±SD) are central volume Vc (24Â±8.5 L), peripheral volume Vp (25Â±8.4 L), intercompartment clearance Q (5.6Â±2.5 L/h), and body clearance CL (5.0Â±2.2 L/h). Endogenous Mg2+ concentration is estimated to be 1.08Â±0.21 mmol/L. Maximum decrease (Emax) in SBP (DBP) is 32Â±14 mmHg (21Â±1.0 mmHg). The Mg2+ concentration (above baseline) eliciting half maximum effect (EC50) is 0.30Â±0.14 mmol/L (0.56Â±0.42 mmol/L). We conclude that if MG2+ concentration can be maintained at 1.8 to 3.0 mmol/L as required for treatment of eclampsia, MgSO4 will produce 73%-87% of its maximum effect on systolic blood pressure.

AB  - To recognize the highly statistically significant circadian variability of blood pressure in pregnancy is to admit that the diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia should be based not just on whether a casual blood pressure value is too high or too low, but rather on more pertinent questions: How long is blood pressure elevated above a given time-varying threshold? What is the excess blood pressure? When does most of the excess occur? Answers to these questions may be obtained by establishing (1) an adequate reference threshold for blood pressure and (2) a proper measurement of blood pressure elevation. Accordingly, we derived time-specified reference standards for blood pressure as a function of gestational age. We analyzed 1408 blood pressure series systematically sampled by ambulatory monitoring for 48 consecutive hours every 4 weeks from the first obstetric visit (usually within the first trimester of pregnancy) until delivery in 235 women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Data from each blood pressure series were synchronized according to the rest-activity cycle of each individual to avoid differences among women in actual times of daily activity. Data were then used to compute 90% circadian tolerance intervals for each trimester of pregnancy, in keeping with the trends in blood pressure along gestation previously documented. The method, derived on the basis of bootstrap techniques, does not need to assume normality or symmetry in the data, and therefore, it is highly appropriate to describe the circadian pattern of blood pressure variability. Results not only reflect expected changes in the tolerance limits as a function of gestational age, but also upper limits markedly below the thresholds currently used for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy. The use of these time-qualified tolerance limits for the computation of a hyperbaric index as a measure of BP excess has already been show to provide high sensitivity and specificity in the early identification of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectivity of melatonin in addition to light treatment (exposure to 2 hours of light during the night = a long-day photoperiod) to modify the breeding season of Saanen and cross-bred milk goats and to compare the difference between the breeds. Twenty-two Saanen and 22 cross-bred does were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups. Group 1 (controls) received no treatment, Group 2 received light treatment for 37 days and Group 3 received light treatment plus melatonin implants after the light treatment. After a further 35 days the 3 groups were brought together and a billy goat that had also been exposed to the extra light at night, had received a melatonin implant and had been isolated from the does during the treatment period, was introduced to the does for natural mating. Ultrasound scanning was used to diagnose pregnancy and all the pregnant goats kidded. Significantly more Saanen does compared to cross-bred does (P = 0.018) became pregnant and kidded after natural mating, when the group that received melatonin as well as light treatment was compared to the group that received light treatment only. Compared to light treatment only, the addition of melatonin to light treatment improved (P = 0.0028) conception after natural mating, in both the Saanen and the cross-bred does.

AB  - This study investigated whether the PRL surge that precedes parturition is accompanied by a decrease in activity of hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons, as occurs during the PRL surges of early pregnancy. Serial blood samples were collected at regular intervals during early and late pregnancy via chronic indwelling jugular cannulae, and concentrations of plasma PRL were determined by RIA. In addition, pregnant rats were killed at either 1200 and 0300 h on different days throughout pregnancy. Levels of TIDA neuronal activity were estimated using concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the median eminence as an index of dopamine metabolism, During early pregnancy, plasma PRL concentrations showed characteristic diurnal and nocturnal surges peaking at 1700 and 0300 h, respectively, whereas during late pregnancy, there was a broad nocturnal surge throughout the night preceding parturition. During early pregnancy, DOPAC was elevated at 1200 h, associated with suppressed plasma PRL, whereas at 0300 h, during the nocturnal PRL surge, DOPAC was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). On the last day of pregnancy DOPAC levels were significantly reduced at both 1200 and 0300 h compared with those at 1200 h in early pregnancy regardless of the PRL concentration. This experiment was repeated with additional groups to further characterize the timing of the fall in TIDA activity during late pregnancy. DOPAC concentrations were elevated throughout the second half of pregnancy, then fell significantly between 0300-1200 h on day 21, approximately 36 h before parturition. As in the previous experiment, the timing of changes in DOPAC concentrations in the median eminence was dissociated from the antepartum PRL surge. These data indicate that the regulation of PRL secretion during late pregnancy is different from that of early pregnancy. Despite the prolonged reduction in activity of TIDA neurons during late pregnancy, PRL secretion still occurs as a nocturnal surge, suggesting that dopamine is not the only regulator of PRL secretion at this time.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - To assess the 24-h glucose levels in a group of nondiabetic, nonobese pregnant women and to verify the presence of correlations between maternal glucose levels and sonographic parameters of fetal growth. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 66 Caucasian nonobese pregnant women with normal glucose challenge tests (GCT) enrolled in the study; from this population, we selected 51 women who delivered term (from 37 to 42 weeks completed) live-born infants without evidence of congenital malformations. The women were requested to have three main meals and to perform daily glucose profiles fortnightly from 28-38 weeks without modifying their lifestyle or following any dietary restriction. All subjects were taught how to monitor their blood glucose by using a reflectance meter. Fetal biometry was evaluated by ultrasound scan according to standard methodology at 22, 28, 32, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. RESULTS - The overall daily mean glucose level during the third trimester was 74.7 Â± 5.2 mg/dl. Daily mean glucose values increased between 28 (71.9 Â± 5.7 mg/dl) and 38 (78.3 Â± 5.4 mg/dl) weeks of pregnancy. We found a significant positive correlation at 28 weeks between 1-h postprandial glucose values and fetal abdominal circumference (AC). At 32 weeks, we documented positive correlations between fetal AC and maternal blood glucose levels 1 h after breakfast, 1 and 2 h after lunch, and 1 and 2 h after dinner. At 36 weeks, there was a positive correlation between fetal AC and 1- and 2-h postprandial blood glucose levels. In addition, there was a negative correlation between head-abdominal circumference ratio and 1-h postprandial blood glucose values. CONCLUSIONS - This longitudinal study first provides a contribution toward the definition of normoglycemia in nondiabetic, nonobese pregnant women; moreover, it reveals significant correlations of postprandial blood glucose levels with the growth of insulin-sensitive fetal tissues and, in particular, between 1-h postprandial blood glucose values and fetal AC.

AB  - Rabbit maternal behavior consists of building an underground nest of straw and body hair during late pregnancy and displaying, with circadian periodicity, a single 3-min nursing bout/day across lactation. Estrogen, androgen, progesterone, and prolactin regulate specific aspects of nest-building and promote the onset of maternal responsiveness. However, the maintenance of this behavior relies on stimuli from the litter: by preventing mother/young contact at parturition or during early lactation maternal responsiveness is altered or abolished. The brain areas controlling the expression of nest-building and nursing were investigated by implanting estradiol, locating the distribution of estrogen and prolactin receptors, quantifying the expression of immediate-early genes, and lesioning structures of the olfactory system. These studies revealed that: (a) estrogen receptor-Î±, alpha, present in the preoptic region, may mediate the stimulation of nest-building by estradiol; (b) prolactin binding sites, located mainly in periventricular structures, are more abundant in late pregnancy and early lactation; (c) the number of FOS-immuno-reactive neurons increases in the lateral septum, but not in the mediobasal hypothalamus, following nursing; (d) the accessory olfactory bulb tonically inhibits the expression of maternal behavior because its removal promotes maternal responsiveness in virgins, which are otherwise unresponsive to daily pup exposure. In summary, rabbits rely on the same hormonal and extrahormonal factors that stimulate maternal behavior in other mammals, yet the way in which such factors promote elaborate nest-building and the unfailing display of circadian nursing is unique to rabbits and warrants future investigation.

AB  - This chapter provides a review and synthesis of research on women's sleep and fatigue from a nursing perspective. Most of the research involves four primary issues for women: menstrual cycles, childbearing, chronic mental or physical illness, and oncology. Research with healthy women focused on diurnal fluctuations in fatigue and relationships to sleep, without regard for exercise or level of daytime activity. Research on chronic illness and cancer fatigue focused on general fatigue and its impact on activity, without regard for sleep or therapeutic use of rest and naps. A comparison of these two areas highlights gaps in nursing knowledge about sleep and fatigue. Further research is needed to understand relationships between nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, and symptoms related to poor quality of life. From a synthesis of these studies, nonpharmacologic interventions that could be prove useful in promoting a higher quality of life for those with either acute or chronic fatigue are then proposed.

AB  - Ewes selected for fertility in autumn lambing were used to evaluate correlated responses in nocturnal hormone levels. Four jugular blood samples were obtained during nighttime in August from each of 113 selected and 69 control ewes. Melatonin levels were lower for selected ewes (143 Â± 14 pg/mL) than for control ewes (184 Â± 13 pg/mL), and melatonin levels decreased with increases in estimated breeding values (EBV) for fertility (-2.23 Â± 0.79 pgÂ·mL-1Â·%-1). Prolactin levels were higher for selected ewes (90 Â± 7 ng/mL) than for control ewes (52 Â± 7 ng/mL), but significant line Ã ewe age interaction was also observed, with smaller differences in prolactin levels in 2-yr-old and older ewes (74 Â± 7 vs 56 Â± 9 ng/mL for select and control ewes, respectively; P &lt; 0.20 before and P = 0.05 after logarithmic transformation). Prolactin levels increased with both fertility EBV (1.23 Â± 0.53 ngÂ·mL-1Â·%-1) and maternal birth weight EBV (9.0 Â± 4.0 ngÂ·ml-1Â·kg-1). Heritability estimates were 0.43 (P &lt; 0.02) for melatonin levels and 0.11 (P &gt; 0.25) for prolactin levels. Thus, we conclude that selection for fertility in autumn lambing has affected patterns of melatonin and prolactin secretion during the dark phase. Â© 2001 American Society of Animal Science.

AB  - The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays important roles in the adaptive changes in physiology that occur during pregnancy and lactation. Although the axis still exhibits a pulsatile pattern of secretion, the normal diurnal rhythm of pulse amplitude is lost during lactation, such that mean basal levels remain constant throughout the day. In addition, the peripartum period is associated with a remarkable plasticity in stress-induced HPA activity, in that the increase of HPA activity normally seen in response to either physical or psychological stresses in the non-reproductive state become severely attenuated or absent in the lactating animal. This stabilization of both basal and stress-induced HPA activity may be important for maintaining a constant endocrine environment, thereby preventing any programming effects on the developing offspring. Attenuation of the stress response is initiated in late pregnancy and is temporally associated with luteolysis, indicating possible steroid hormone involvement. Indeed, mimicking the luteolytic changes in oestrogen and progesterone levels in non-pregnant animals induces a similar attenuation of the stress response. Furthermore down-regulation of the stress response is, at least in part, centrally mediated since in the period following luteolysis rats will show a decreased level of stress-induced neuronal activation of the PVN, as measured by the expression of either c-fos or CRH mRNAs. Persistence of this adapted state is dependent upon the continued suckling stimulus, as removal of the offspring litter rapidly leads to resumption of HPA responses to and the appearance of an exaggerated diurnal rhythm. The underlying mechanisms responsible for this stress hyporesponsiveness may include plasticity of noradrenergic and oxytocin pathways. In view of its role in other reproductive behaviors, a stress-inhibiting effect of oxytocin may reflect a more widespread co-ordinating role in the peripartum animal.

AB  - We show the levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glutamic acid to GABA, changes in zebrafish retinal tissue during the light/dark cycle. Further, we identify two transcripts of the GAD67 gene, full-length GAD67 and the truncated 25 kDa alternative splice variant (ES), as the major GAD isoforms in this tissue. GAD-positive neurons were identified immunocytochemically by probing retinal sections with K2, an antibody to the GAD67 isoform, and with an antibody specific for the 25 kDa splice variant. For both antibodies, GAD-immunoreactivity was observed in horizontal cells in the distal retina and amacrine cells in the proximal retina, with both cell bodies and processes labeled. No apparent difference in K2 labeling pattern was observed in tissue harvested 8 hrs after light offset or onset, whereas ES label was identified in more structures in dark tissue. Quantification of GAD levels was determined by densitometry of Western Blots. The protein content of GAD67 and ES varied between tissue harvested during the light and the dark. ES expression was up-regulated in dark tissue; whereas, full-length GAD67 expression increased in light tissue. In vivo GABA content, measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), was found to increase in light tissue, paralleling the expression of full-length GAD67 transcripts. Expression of ES did not correlate with measured GABA levels, suggesting this isoform, which lacks the catalytic domain necessary for enzymatic activity, may have a different physiological role in retinal tissue. The inverse expression patterns of full-length GAD67 and ES suggest that alternative splicing of GAD67 may be triggered by the light and/or dark cycle, resulting in a change in inhibitory neurotransmitter content in retinal tissue.

AB  - Study objectives: This study was designed to evaluate sleep-related disordered breathing in obese women during pregnancy. Obesity is known to predispose to sleep-related breathing disorders. During pregnancy, obese mothers gain additional weight, but other mechanisms may counteract this effect. Design: A case-control study to compare sleep-related breathing in obese pregnant women (mean prepregnancy body mass index [BMI] &gt; 30 kg/m2) with pregnant women of normal weight (mean BMI, 20 to 25 kg/m2). Setting: University teaching hospital with a sleep laboratory. Participants: We recruited II obese women (BMI, 34 kg/m2; mean age 31 years) and II control women (BMI, 23 kg/m2; mean age 32 years). Interventions: Overnight polysomnography was performed during early (after 12 weeks) and late (after 30 weeks) pregnancy. Measurements and results: During pregnancy, obese mothers gained 13 kg and control women gained 16 kg. Sleep characteristics did not differ between the groups. During late pregnancy, the women in both groups slept more poorly and slept in supine position less. During early pregnancy, their apnea-hypopnea indexes (1.7 events per hour vs 0.2 events per hour; p &lt; 0.05), 4% oxygen desaturations (5.3 events per hour vs 0.3 events per hour; p &lt; 0.005), and snoring times (32% vs 1%, p &lt; 0.001) differed significantly. These differences between the groups persisted in the second polysomnography, with snoring time further increasing in the obese. Preeclampsia and mild obstructive sleep apnea were diagnosed in one obese mother. One obese mother delivered a baby showing growth retardation (weight - 3 SD). Conclusions: We have shown significantly more sleep-related disordered breathing occurring in obese mothers than in subjects of normal weight, despite similar sleeping characteristics.

AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs in 30-50% of all pregnancies. The progressive rise in plasma progesterone has been suggested as a possible mediator of GER during pregnancy. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to detect GER through monitoring of esophageal pH for prolonged periods, including sleep. 24-hour pH monitoring is the proper method for diagnosing GER in pregnant women. If 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is to be a useful diagnostic tool, it must reliably discriminate GER patients despite daily variations in distal esophageal acid exposure. To address this issue, we studied 62 women (30 healthy non-pregnant women without GER symptoms and 32 pregnant women with GER symptoms-heartburn, acid regurgitation) with 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. Intrasubject reproducibility of three pH parameters to discriminate the presence of abnormal acid reflux was determined (DeMeester score, Kaye score, circadian one hour diagram for pH < 4). Each patient was interviewed, using a reliable questionnaire detailing individual habits, life style characteristics and symptoms, at four time points during the first, second, third trimesters of pregnancy and post-partum period. Symptoms of GER are common in pregnancy and although GER rarely endangers maternal or fetal health, it can significantly affect patient comfort and quality of life. We conclude: 1. GER is almost constantly present during pregnancy, increasing with gestational age. 2. The most important pH--parameter is DeMcester score. 3. Heartburn disappear after delivery. 4. 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring is the gold standard for measuring acid exposure and is a reproducible test for the diagnosis of GER in pregnancy.

AB  - Purpose: Routine use of ultrasound during pregnancy has emphasized the need for greater knowledge about normal and abnormal voiding function during fetal live. We describe the developmental changes in lower urinary tract function from the middle of the second to the early third trimester of gestation. Materials and Methods: The study included 22 male fetal pigs of 13 pregnant Goettingen minipigs (gestational period 111 to 115 days) with 11 fetuses in the middle of the second (median 61.5 days, 0.55 of term) and 11 fetuses in the beginning of the third trimester of gestation (median 80 days, 0.72 of term). With the sow under isoflurane anesthesia catheters were placed in the bladder, rectum and amniotic cavity of the fetuses, and a flow probe was placed around the distal urethra. After the sow was at light sleep urethral flow, amniotic pressure, abdominal pressure and bladder pressure were recorded a median of 241 minutes. Results: The recordings of 14 fetuses were evaluable. In the middle of the second trimester the fetuses showed an almost constant dribbling with a median flow of 0.2 ml. per minute and a median of 4 concomitant bladder contractions per minute of median 3.5 cm. H2O (detrusor pressure). At the beginning of the third trimester the fetuses had periods of staccato flow (median 0.2 ml. per minute, staccato frequency 1 to 2 Hz.) on top of contractions (median 4 contractions per minute, median detrusor pressure 5.5 cm. H2O) with no flow between voidings. Conclusions: Development of storage and voiding function in male pigs occurs between the mid-second and early third trimester of gestation, together with emergence of striated sphincter bursting activity, which interrupts flow in the urethra during the voiding phase.

AB  - Objectives: To describe beliefs about infant sleep position among African American grandmothers and other older caregivers (senior caregivers [SCGs]) and to measure the incremental effect on the rates of prone sleep after educating a group of African American SCGs. Design: Survey of sleep practices and beliefs. Randomized, controlled trial of a teaching intervention. Settings Managed care prenatal clinic for normal risk obstetrics patients. Participants: Low-income pregnant women, self-identified as African American. An SCG is an older family member or friend to whom they would go for advice about routine child care. Pregnant women randomly assigned to the control group (educated about safe sleep practices) or the experimental group (education for both pregnant women and their SCG). Intervention: During the third trimester, 2 teaching sessions for pregnant women (both control and experimental groups) and for the experimental group's SCGs. One-on-one teaching emphasizing that infants should sleep supine. Main Outcome Measures: During the third trimester, description of rate of preference for prone sleep for infants among pregnant women and SCGs. Effects of teaching SCGs on (1) SCGs' postnatal beliefs about sleep position as a means to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, and (2) the eventual rate of prone sleeping among study infants. Results: One hundred twenty-five women were in the control group; 98 pregnant women and SCG pairs were in the experimental group. Senior caregivers were 47.1 Â± 12.4 years old (mean Â± SD). Most were grandmothers (either maternal, 72.5%, or paternal, 14.3%) or aunts or sisters (10.2%). No differences were noted in the prenatal rates of the prone preference (controls, 36.3%; experimental group, 35.7%; and SCGs, 34.7%). Teaching SCGs did not increase the rate of the usual prone sleep in the experimental vs the control group (13.3% vs 17.3%, X2 = 0.59, P =.44, 95% confidence interval for difference from -5.8% to + 13.8%). After the teaching and during the pregnancy, the SCGs became less worried that the infant was susceptible to sudden infant death syndrome (X2 = 16.6, P = .003) or likely to die of sudden infant death syndrome (X2 = 24.7, P &lt; .001). Their concerns about sudden infant death syndrome were significantly less postnatally, in particular when the infant was placed supine (X2 = 19.4, P &lt; .001). Conclusions: Most African American women and SCGs endorsed the supine sleeping position for infants. Among a group of African American infants, prenatal teaching of their grandmothers and other SCGs did not have a statistically significant incremental effect on the rates of the usual prone sleeping position. Contrary to our starting hypothesis, the SCGs of pregnant women who receive prenatal care seemed responsive to messages about supine sleeping. The Back-to-Sleep message should be delivered prenatally, but special prenatal interventions should attempt to reach women who do not receive prenatal care and SCGs who persist in their opposition to the supine sleeping position.

AB  - Using a visual memory test we studied memory in pregnant women. Benton's Visual Retention Test was used with 54 pregnant women three times: at term, 3-4 days post-partum, and one month after birth. There was a significant decline in visual memory at 3-4 days post-partum (p < 0.01). There was no interaction between hours of sleep and memory of pregnant women at any period. Although memory declined at 3-4 days, there was no interaction between this decline and duration of labor, intra-partum hemorrhage, or memory at one month post-partum. It is not yet clear why visual memory declined shortly after birth. Further studies on post-partum memory decline as well as the possible relationship to hormonal and mood changes are necessary.

AB  - Objective: To derive reference curves of polysomnographic parameters for clinically healthy infants and children in the first and second year of life. Study design: From January 1989 to December 1999 a total of 13 373 polygraphic sleep recordings were carried out at the sleep laboratory of the Vestische Kinderklinik Datteln, a tertiary referral centre for sleep-related respiratory problems in infants and children. In order to create a data base for reference curves, 681 recordings were retrospectively selected from the total pool, if the following criteria were fulfilled: first polygraphic sleep recording of the proband, clinically healthy term infants without symptoms of upper respiratory infection at the time of sleep study. Premature birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (< 2 500 g), apparent life-threatening events (ALTE), neonatal complications, known cardial, pulmonary, cerebral and metabolic disorders, dysmorphic syndromes, sudden infant death (SIDS) of a sibling, heavy parental smoking (> 10 cigarettes per day), and maternal drug addiction were exclusion criteria for the reference group. Recording and evaluation of polysomnographies were carried out according to published recommendations of the Pediatric Task Force of the German Sleep Society (DGSM). Results: Reference curves covering an age range of 1 to 24 months are presented for the following parameters: quiet and active sleep, coordinated and paradoxical patterns of thoracic and abdominal breathing movements, periodic breathing, frequency of respiratory pauses of â¥ 3 seconds, â¥ 5 seconds and â¥ 10 seconds duration, respectively, frequency, mean and maximal duration of respiratory pauses following a sigh, central, obstructive and mixed respiratory pauses, respectively, transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation of hemoglobin as measured by pulse oximetry, and instantaneous heart rate. Periodic breathing and apnea frequencies, especially obstructive apneas showed an asymmetric distribution of individual measurements. Conclusion: These reference curves facilitate the judgement of individual polysomnographic results to be adequate for age, to be deviating from the normal age range, or to be pathologic.

AB  - A 41-year-old man fell into type II respiratory failure after catching a cold, and became dependent on a respirator. Chest radiography showed no abnormalities and the hyperventilation test showed improved arterial blood gas findings. His sleep study showed marked nocturnal desaturation due to hypopnea and apnea with a decrease of thoracic and abdominal movement during sleep. Therefore, we diagnosed him as primary alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (PAH). Seven years previously, his 2-year elder sister had suffered from similar respiratory failure during her second pregnancy and had been diagnosed as PAH. While myopathy was suspected in both cases, attenuation of muscle strength was slight and it appeared not to be the main cause of alveolar hypoventilation. Since medication was not effective in each case, they underwent non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). While sustained mild hypercapnia remained during the daytime, it improved their respiratory failure. To our knowledge, this is the first study of familial adult onset PAH.

AB  - We report a 29-year-old Japanese woman with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP). In the 37th week of pregnancy, she noticed the development of intensely itchy erythema on her abdominal striae. Small erythematous papules were also seen on her axillae and extremities. Her sleep was even disturbed by severe itching. A histological examination showed edema in the papillary dermis and perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration in the upper to middle part of the dermis, A direct immunofluorescence study of the skin lesion revealed C3 deposition at the capillary vessel walls, but not IgG, A and M. From these observations, a diagnosis of PUPPP was made. The skin eruptions and itching did not improve after treatment with topical cream containing budesonide and the oral administration of chlorpheniramine maleate. The skin eruptions with itching spontaneously disappeared shortly after delivery. Â© 2001, Western Division of Japanese Dermatological Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a new group of antidepressants used in mild to moderate cases of depression. In studies evaluating the safety of SSRIs during pregnancy, no increase in major anomalies has been reported. This might have led to increasing off-label prescription of SSRIs to pregnant women. Neonatal withdrawal syndrome commonly occurs in infants exposed during the third trimester to drugs known to cause addiction. We report five cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome after third trimester in utero SSRI exposure. In three cases the mother used paroxetine in doses from 10 to 40 mg, one mother used citalopram 30 mg, and one mother fluoxetine 20 mg. Withdrawal symptoms occurred within few days after birth and lasted up to one month after birth. Four of the infants needed treatment with chlorpromazine. Symptoms were irritability, constant crying, shivering, increased tonus, eating and sleeping difficulties and convulsions, Conclusion: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome can occur after third trimester in utero SSRI exposure. Further research should focus on whether it is safe to use SSRIs during the last trimester. All neonates exposed to SSRIs during the last trimester should be followed-up closely for withdrawal symptoms after birth.

AB  - Objective: To assess the level of recognition and knowledge about treatment of depression by General Practitioners (GPs). Method: Analysis of questionnaires completed by participants commencing a series of workshops aimed at improving their knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of depression. Of the 3289 GPs involved in the program 2500 (76% respondent rate) completed the questionnaires in a group situation. There was no difference between respondents and nonrespondents in terms of age, gender and year of graduation. Results: The majority of GPs believe they have a satisfactory competence in the recognition and treatment of depression, although a sizeable minority based their diagnosis predominantly on somatic symptoms. The GPs felt confident about their knowledge and skills in counselling and the use of antidepressant medication, but not in dealing with children and suicidal or pregnant patients. The most common symptoms used to identify 'depression' were sleep disorders and only 54% listed depressed mood as a symptom on which the diagnosis is based. Only 28% reported sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for DSM-IV major depressive disorder, which supports views that these criteria are inappropriate for general practice. Fifty-seven percent of doctors used medicine together with nonpharmacological treatment in the majority of patients, and medications doses were almost all within the range recommended in the product information. Conclusions: There is a need to improve GPs knowledge in diagnosing depression, in child psychiatry and in dealing with pregnant and suicidal patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the predictive ability of parameters of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension in women who are already considered at risk for these disorders. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty-two pregnant women who were considered high risk for the development of preeclampsia underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring between 18 and 30 weeks gestation, while their condition was normotensive according to routine mercury sphygmomanometry. One hundred sixty-four healthy primigravid women who were considered at usual risk for preeclampsia underwent the same tests as a parallel study. Routine blood pressure, awake and sleep average blood pressure, and 24-hour mean average blood pressure were entered into multiple logistic regression as predictors of either preeclampsia or gestational hypertension; significant variables were then tested by a series of receiver operator curves. RESULTS: Eight percent of usual risk and 45% of high risk women experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In both groups, the average routine mercury blood pressure and awake, sleeping, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived blood pressure were significantly higher in women who later experienced the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. In usual risk women, 24-hour systolic blood pressure of â¥115 mm Hg and sleeping systolic blood pressure of â¥106 mm Hg were predictive of later preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but sensitivities were low (77% and 54%, respectively). In high risk women, sleeping diastolic blood pressure of â¥62 mm Hg and sleeping mean arterial pressure of â¥79 mm Hg were predictive of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, but again sensitivities were low (70% and 65%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Awake and sleeping blood pressure are higher in midpregnancy in women who later experience the development of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a noninvasive method of selecting some of these women, but this test has a sensitivity no better than that of other predictive tests, even in women at high risk for preeclampsia.

AB  - Children frequently received no treatment, or inadequate treatment, for pain and for painful procedures. The newborn and critically ill children are especially vulnerable to no treatment or under-treatment. Nerve pathways essential for the transmission and perception of pain are present and functioning by 24 weeks of gestation. The failure to provide analgesia for pain results in rewiring the nerve pathways responsible for pain transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and results in increased pain perception for future painful results. Many children would withdraw or deny their pain in an attempt to avoid yet another terrifying and painful experiences, such as the intramuscular injections. Societal fears of opioid addiction and lack of advocacy are also causal factors in the under-treatment of pediatric pain. False beliefs about addictions and proper use of acetaminophen and other analgesics resulted in the failure to provide analgesia to children. All children even the newborn and critically ill require analgesia for pain and painful procedures. Unbelieved pain interferes with sleep, leads to fatigue and a sense of helplessness, and may result in increased morbidity or mortality.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the range and frequency of behaviors in neonates 24-30 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) using the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program (NIDCAP). DESIGN: A prospective design with convenience sampling was used. SAMPLE: Starting 24-72 hours postnatally and continuing through 30 weeks PCA, 8,144 two-minute observations of 85 NIDCAP behaviors were collected and analyzed from 42 neonates born at 24-29 weeks gestation. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The main outcome variables were the frequencies of the 85 neonatal behaviors measured by the NIDCAP. Frequencies were organized first by subsystem (autonomic, motor, or state) and were categorized further based on week of PCA. Comparisons of behavioral frequencies by number of weeks PCA were completed using correlation and regression analyses. RESULTS: The most frequently observed behaviors were irregular respirations, pink color, postured flexion of the extremities, immature light sleep, and drowsiness. Least frequently observed behaviors consisted of burps, bowel movement, grunting, smooth motor movements, cooing, and speech movement. Regression analysis illustrated that the pattern of behavior was significantly similar week to week.

AB  - We report on a 32-y-old woman with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and her daughter with Angelman syndrome (AS). PWS in the mother was confirmed as due to a deletion of 15q11-q13, and molecular analysis in the neonate indicated an inherited maternal deletion of the same region. Features of AS in early infancy, such as jerky movements, feeding problems and poor sleep, were observed. At 5 mo of age, a triphasic high voltage EEG pattern was reported. Conclusions: This case confirms the non-Mendelian inheritance of PWS and AS and, in addition to previous reports, provides evidence of fertility in PWS women. We recommend the provision of information regarding fertility in females with PWS to parents, guardians and individuals with PWS, and frequent EEG monitoring for early AS diagnosis. Given the different genetic aetiologies for PWS and AS, cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis is strongly indicated for counselling and risk estimation.

AB  - Important factors which may affect the fetal circulation are the fetal breathing movements (FBMs) and other movements adn the features of fetal circulation. Recent studies have demonstrated that FBMs are a normal phenomenon of intrauterine development and that there are two patterns of FBMs: (1) A predominant pattern of rapid, irregular (in rate and amplitude) episodic movements, with interspersed episodes of apnea that is present more than 50 percent of the time and accounts for more than 90 percent of the breathing activity. Interestingly, periodic sighs are often seen during these FBMs; (2) There is also a less frequent pattern of sporadic, slow (1 to 4 movements/min), deep inspiratory movements, like sighs or gasps, or espiratory efforts which resemble grunting, coughing, or panting. The first pattern, which represents normal fetal respiratory activity, only occurs during rapid eye movements (REM) sleep, and it is unrelated to changes in blood gases and pH values and to afferent impulses from aortic and carotid bodies; FBMs may produce intrathoracic pressure swings of 35 Torr or more and are independent of Hering-Breuer reflexes. This pattern is usually accompanied by increased FHR beat-to-beat variability and increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and flow (BF). Therefore, they may influence the velocimetry of B.F. in humans, e.g., RED and ARED in the umbilical artery blood flow (UABF), which do not necessarily indicate impending fetal demise. The second pattern is unrelated to the fetal behavioral state and blood gas tensions. Concerning the effects of drugs on FBMs, we have analysed the effects aminophylline (A)(bolus of 240 mg followed by 0.2 mg/kg/min) given to women not in labor; A caused a prompt and sustained FBMs that started as vorteces and then as regular inspiratory and expiratory movements, which increased in frequency (up to 88/min) and depth. Hexoprenaline given to pregnant women with threatened preterm labor were able to elicit FBMs and NFFV; the infusion of 0.3 microg/min increased UABF. Conjugated estrogens administered to the mother as a 10 mg bolus enhanced FBMs, as documented by TM and nasal flow velocity waveforms (NFFV); this was associated with an increased UABF; betamethasone (4 mg bolus to the mother) was shown to induce FBMs and an increased UABF. In a twin pregnancy betamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) was administered IV into the umbilical vein in one fetus and IM to the other; in both cases bradycardia and increase in UABF occurred, immediately after IV infusion, and after 30 min following IM injection FBMs were induced or enhanced in frequency and depth. The flow in MCA was unchanged. In conclusion, the fetal circulation is influenced by fetal behavioural states, particularly by FBMs that affect the fetal cardiovascular function, including blood pressure and FHR thereby conditioning the velocimetric response of its major vessels, i.e., UA and MCA BF, whose alterations do not necessarily reflect impending fetal demise.

AB  - This paper describes and compares the infant care practices and beliefs of Maori, Tongan, Samoan, Cook Islands, Niuean and Pakeha (European) caregivers residing in Auckland, New Zealand. Focusing on four areas - sources of support and advice; infant feeding; infant sleeping arrangements; and traditional practices and beliefs - it explores inter-ethnic similarities and differences and intra-ethnic tensions. The international literature indicates that there can be significant cultural variation in infant care practices and in the meanings attributed to them. There is, however, little New Zealand literature on this topic, despite its importance for effective health service and health message delivery. Participants were primary caregivers of infants under 12 months. An average of six focus groups were conducted within each ethnic group, resulting in a total of 37 groups comprising 150 participants. We found similarities across all ethnic groups in the perceived importance of breastfeeding and the difficulties experienced in establishing and maintaining this practice. The spectrum of behaviours ranged widely with differences most pronounced between Pacific caregivers, especially those Island-raised, and Pakeha caregivers, especially those in nuclear families. Amongst the former, norms included: the family as central in providing support and advice; infant bedsharing; abdominal rubbing during pregnancy; baby massage; and the importance of adhering to traditional protocols to ensure infant well-being. Amongst the latter, norms included: strong reliance on professional advice; looser family support networks; the infant sleeping in a cot; and adherence to Western biomedical understandings of health and illness. Maori caregivers bridged the spectrum created by these groups and exhibited a diverse range of practices. Intra-cultural differences were present in all groups indicating the dynamic nature of cultural practices. They were most evident between Pacific-raised and New Zealand-raised Pacific caregivers, with the latter attempting to marry traditional with Western beliefs and practices.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) accounts for the largest number of deaths during the first year of life in developed countries. The possible causes of SIDS are numerous and, to date, there is no adequate unifying pathological explanation for SIDS. Epidemiological studies have played a key role in identifying risk factors, knowledge of which has underpinned successful preventive programmes. This review critically assesses information on the main risk factors and causal hypotheses put forward for SIDS, focusing on research published since 1994. The overall picture that emerges from this review is that affected infants are not completely normal in development, but possess some inherent weakness, which may only become obvious when the infant is subjected to stress. Initially there may be some minor impairment or delay in development of respiratory, cardiovascular or neuromuscular function. None of these is likely to be sufficient, in isolation, to cause death and, provided the infant survives the first year of life, may no longer be of any significance. However, when a compromised infant is confronted with one or more stressful situations, several of which are now clearly identified as risk factors, and from which the majority of infants would normally escape, the combination may prove fatal.

AB  - Objective: To identify the risk factors for infants who die suddenly and unexpectedly, but whose deaths are not related to prone position, or having the head covered. Methodology: A case-control study was designed in which the cases were infants who had died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in South Australia between January 1974 and December 1997, who were found not prone, not bed sharing and with the head not covered. The controls were two infants for each case, born in the same year and found in the prone position (again not bed sharing and with the head not covered). Results: Sudden unexpected death in infancy is rare in non-prone infants with the head not covered, occurring on average twice a year in South Australia, where there are 18 000-21 000 births per year. In this group there was a higher percentage of infants with features associated with low socio-economic groups (teenage pregnancies and maternal smoking), sibling SIDS, suspicion of non-accidental injury and the presence of minor congenital anomalies, especially cardiac anomalies. Conclusions: The majority of unexpected deaths in infancy can be prevented by not allowing infants to be unobserved in prone position, and by preventing them from getting their faces covered. For the few infants not found in these positions, a careful investigation should be made for malformations or non-accidental injury.

AB  - Time patterns of activity-rest rhythms during and after pregnancy are increasingly recognised as important factors for the well-being and health of young families. This longitudinal study examined activity-rest patterns of couples during late pregnancy and subsequently the alterations in the periodic structure of parental and neonatal time patterns during the first four months after birth. Part I concentrates on the effects of late pregnancy and birth to the mother's rest-activity patterns and those of the father and, after birth, what time pattern the infant developed. Part II attempts to clarify how activity patterns of the entire family agree or disagree with each other and investigates how the infant synchronises with the environment that includes the process of parent-infant interaction. Activity data of, so far, seven families (father, mother and child) were continuously recorded using non-invasive Actiwatch units. Recordings of parental activity started at the beginning of the 37th week of gestation, and were continued in parallel with the infants' recordings in three series of three weeks each until four months after birth: 1st to 3rd week, 7th to 9th week and 13th to 15th week of life. In a standardised diary, record was kept of household routines, parental activities, type of feeding, initiation of sleep or waking up. Activity data of seven non-pregnant women were collected and used as a control. Irregular nocturnal activity epochs occurred frequently in pregnant women and were absent in non-pregnant women. Period lengthenings and shortenings of the circadian rhythms appeared in both parents from prepartum to postpartum. Activity at night increased from prepartum to postpartum in mothers and fathers. Three infants showed a marked circadian rhythm between day 3 and 14 after birth. All seven infants showed a predominant circadian rhythm between day 8 and 19 after birth. The onset of daytime activity of mothers and their infants corresponded well to each other. Postpartum frequency spectra of parents and child always had some ultradian components in common. Time patterns of activity-rest rhythms of couples and parents are shown to be altered during and after pregnancy and we suggest that the infants' adaptation to the environment begins during the first week that includes the process of mother-infant interaction.

AB  - Objective : To investigate matemo-fetal synchronization at the level of the gene expression, expression pattern of clock genes were examied in the placenta, fetal heart, and maternal heart under light-dark condition. Methods : Female rats aged 8 weeks were impregnanted, and at days 18(E18)and E20 of pregnancy, their fetuses had removed by caeserian section at zeitgabor times of 5, 11, 17 and 23 hours. The fetal hearts and placentae as well as the maternal hearts were excised and mRNA patterns of expression of clock related genes rPer1, rPer2, BMAL1 and clock controled gene, albumine site D-binding proteins (DBP) and mRNAs were analyzed in these tissues by Northern blot. Results : In both the E18 and E20 pregnant rats, we detected mRNA expressions of rPer1, rPer2, BMAL1 and DBP in the placenta and fetal heart as well as the maternal heart but only BMAL1 mRNA in the fetal heart had a daily rhythm which showed a different phase from that in adult rats. No remarkable rhythms were observed in other clock genes in the placenta and fetal heart. Interestingly, levels of expression of rPer1 mRNA in the fetal heart were significantly higher in E20 than in with those in E18. Conclusion : Circadian expressions of clock genes such as rPer1, rPer2, and BMAL1 were observed in all the peripheral tissues examined as well as in the SCN, but in the placenta and fetal heart, expression patterns of clock genes were remarkably different from those in other peripheral tissues. These observations suggest that the regulation of clock gene expressions in the placenta and fetal tissues are different from those in peripheral tissues of adult animals. Increased expression of rPer1 in fetal heart at E20 suggests that rPer1 plays an important role in fetal developement, and suggests that the regulation of rPer1 expression is different from that of rPer2 in fetal tissues.

AB  - Objective: Aim of this study is to detect the pattern of blood pressure (BP) within-day variability (WDV) and circadian rhythmicity (CR) in clinically healthy newborns (CHN) during the first days of life, by comparing the non-twins (NT) versus the twins (T). Materials and methods: The investigation was performed, after written parental consent, on 104 fullterm CHN, 76 NT and 28 T. BP was measured via an automated non-invasive monitor every 1 hour over the 24-h span. Time data series were biometrically analyzed via conventional statistical methods and a chronobiologic procedure (Cosinor method). Results: The T as compared to the NT were found to show the systolic and diastolic daily BP level significantly lower. Both the NT and T showed the BP CR, whose mesor was significantly higher in NT as compared to T. Conclusions: The occurrence of the BP CR seems to demonstrate that the CHN are synchronized Â«in uteroÂ» in their bioperiodic tensive regimen. The lower daily BP in T could be the expression of a mechanism which involves the tonic regulation of the BP CR. The BP within-day variability in CHN, however, seems not to be sensibly dependent on the initial condition of being or not being born from a bigeminal pregnancy. Such a dependence, instead, seems to exist for the tonic level around which the BP maintains its CR.

AB  - Objective : We investigated the functional cf change in Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in pregnant rats together with cardiac autonomie nervous function. Methods : We used 9-week-old non-parous Wistar rats (WRs, n = 8) as normal pregnant model, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, n = 8) as a chronic hypertension model and Wistar rats infused with TNP-470 (2mg/kg/hr) subcutaneously by means of an Osmotic minipump to induce placental circulatory insufficiency (TNPs, n = 4) as a uteroplacental ischemia model, and the BP and HR of all rats were recorded every 5 minutes by means of a radiotelemetry system. Obtained data were analyzed by the single Cosinor and the Memcalc method. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) of pregnant rats were also recorded by means of a radiotelemeter, and LF, HF and Entropy were calculated from the ECG to estimate autonomie nervous function in pregnant rats. Results : Obvious circulatory functional changes occur coincidentally with the placental formation period in normal pregnant WRs and SHRs. A significant decrease in DP and increase in HR occurs from about the 15th day of gestation, and these changes are more marked in SHRs. In TNPs, the weight of the placenta and pups decreased dose-dependently, and the amount of change in BP and HR decreased. In WRs, parasympathetic nervous function was superior to sympathetic nervous function early in the gestational period, and sympathetic nervous function increased late in the gestational period, and after delivery parasympathetic nervous function recovered. These changes were more marked in WRs than in SHRs. Conclusion : The cardiovascular adaptation mechanisms in WRs and SHRs were different in terms of autonomie nervous function and response to placental angiogenesis.

AB  - Neurulation is a complex process of histogenesis involving the precise temporal and spatial organization of gene expression. Genes influencing neurulation include proneural genes determining primary cell fate, neurogenic genes involved in lateral inhibition pathways and genes controlling the frequency of mitotic events. This is reflected in the aetiology and genetics of human and mouse neural tube defects, which are of both multifactorial and multigenic origin. The X-linked gene Nap1/2, specifically expressed in neurons, encodes a protein that is highly similar to the nucleosome assembly (NAP) and SET proteins. We inactivated Nap1/2 in mice by gene targeting, leading to embryonic lethality from mid-gestation onwards. Surviving mutant chimaeric embryos showed extensive surface ectoderm defects as well as the presence of open neural tubes and exposed brains similar to those observed in human spina bifida and anencephaly. These defects correlated with an overproduction of neuronal precursor cells. Protein expression studies showed that the Nap1/2 protein binds to condensing chromatin during S phase and in apoptotic cells, but remained cytoplasmic during G1 phase. Nap1/2 therefore likely represents a class of tissue-specific factors interacting with chromatin to regulate neuronal cell proliferation.

AB  - The foetal sheep brain develops organised sleep states from 115-120 d gestational age (dGA, term 150 dGA) alternating between REM and NREM sleep. We aimed to investigate whether maturation of REM or NREM sleep generating structures leads to the development of distinct sleep states. The electrocorticogram (ECoG) was recorded from five unanaesthetised chronically instrumented foetal sheep in utero and was analysed every 5th day between 115-130 dGA by two different non-linear methods. We calculated a non-linear prediction error which quantifies the causality of the ECoG and applied bispectral analysis which quantifies non-linear interrelations of single frequency components within the ECoG signal. The prediction error during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM sleep at each investigated age (P < 0.0001) coincidental with poor organisation of the rhythmic pattern in the ECoG during REM sleep. At 115 dGA, organised sleep states defined behaviourally were not developed yet. The prediction error, however, showed already different states of electrocortical activity that were not detectable using power spectral analysis. The prediction error of the premature NREM sleep ECoG decreased significantly during emergence of organised sleep states between 115 and 120 dGA and continued to decrease after the emergence of distinct sleep states (P < 0.05). The prediction error of the premature REM sleep ECoG did not change until 120 dGA and began to increase at 125 dGA (P < 0.05). Using bispectral analysis, we showed couplings between delta waves (1.5-4 Hz) and frequencies in the range of spindle waves (4-8 and 8-12 Hz) during NREM sleep that became closer during development. The results show that maturation of ECoG synchronisation mediating structures is important for the development of organised sleep states. The further divergence of the prediction error of NREM and REM sleep after development of organised sleep states reveals continuous functional development. Thus, complementary application of non-linear ECoG analysis to power spectral analysis provide new insights in the collective behaviour of the neuronal network during the emergence of sleep states.

AB  - Objective. To characterize different methods of monitoring neonatal effects associated with maternal opioid analgesia. Special focus was on the static-charge-sensitive bed (SCSB), which could potentially serve as a non-invasive neonatal monitor. Methods. 12 healthy, term newborns from normal pregnancies were included in this prospective, randomized, controlled study. Maternal labor analgesia was either intravenous fentanyl (n = 5) or paracervical bupivacaine blockade (n = 7). Neonatal recording from delivery to the age of 12 hours included continuous SCSB monitoring with ECG and oximeter for sleep states, respiration, oxygenation, heart rate, and body movements. In addition, umbilical blood pH, Apgar, Amiel-Tison's Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scoring (NACS), skin cyanosis scoring, blood pressure, rectal and skin temperatures, and skin blood flow measurements were performed. Results. The study was interrupted, because one baby in the fentanyl group had a significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) to 59%. This was considered to be residual effect of fentanyl and was treated with naloxone. SpO2 was generally lower in the fentanyl group. Epochs with SpO2 &lt;90% were more frequent in the fentanyl group, especially during the active sleep (mean Â± SD 11.9 Â± 10.7% vs. 2.0 Â± 1.7% of epochs, p = 0.034). Mean heart rate values were lower in the fentanyl group (121.1 Â± 6.4 vs. 132.6 Â± 6.8 beats per minute, p = 0.02), and this difference was seen during wake and all sleep states. Maximum heart rate values were lower in the fentanyl group, too. The opiate group had less quiet sleep than controls (9.6 Â± 2.8% vs. 18.3 Â± 8.3%, p = 0.05). NACS after birth was lower in the fentanyl group (median [range] 15 [13-26] vs. 22 [20-25], p = 0.004). Conclusions. Several differences were seen between the fentanyl and the control group babies. The SCSB method proved sensitive enough to find neonatal effects of maternal analgesia. Together with ECG and SpO2 monitoring, SCSB gives plentiful information on neonatal well-bering in a non-invasive way. Results of this study emphasize the importance of neonatal monitoring after maternal opiate use in labor.

AB  - Background: Robust evidence that anorexia nervosa is preceded rather than accompanied by high-concern (overprotective) parenting is limited. Aims: To look for evidence of parental high concern occurring before any onset of disorder. Method: Forty consecutive referrals of adolescent girls with DSM-III- R anorexia nervosa were compared with matched controls using obstetric records and maternal interviews. Results: Index mothers reported higher rates of: near-exclusive child care (P=0.02), infant sleep difficulties (P=0.018), severe distress at first regular separation (P=0.048), high maternal trait anxiety levels (P=0.008) and later age for first sleeping away from home (P=0.009). More index families had experienced a severe obstetric loss prior to their daughter's birth (P=0.066). Conclusions: This study lends evidence to the clinical contention that high-concern parenting in infancy is associated with the later development of anorexia nervosa. This may derive, in part, from aspects of unresolved grief. Declaration of interest: P.S. was supported by a training grant from the Wellcome Trust.

AB  - After childbirth, elation and associated features of hypomania have been reported in the first 5 days postpartum among women in other countries. However, few studies have been done on this phenomenon in Japanese women. Therefore, we performed an investigation of postpartum mild hypomania in Japanese women using the Japanese version of "The Highs" self-rating scale. Correlations of "The Highs" score and obstetric factors were calculated. Moreover, we compared total scores of "The highs" between Japanese and British women on the third day after delivery. One hundred nineteen pregnant women in Mie and 63 British women agreed to participate in this research. The results of the present study demonstrated the following. Japanese women most often experience mild hypomania immediately after delivery. The primiparae showed more the mild hypomania phenomenon than the multiparae soon after delivery. The "The Highs" score pattern of the Japanese women was similar to that of the British women. However, the score of the Japanese women were generally lower than the British women. The score for the elation was notably high on the-first postpartum day, and many women felt that they could reduce their sleep during hospitalization.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under 1 year of age that remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy. Despite recent reductions in the SIDS rate attributed to placing the baby to sleep on his back, SIDS remains the most common cause of infant mortality between 1 month and 1 year of age in developed countries. This review concerns the current state of a hypothesis (1972) that magnesium deficiency, which causes sudden death in young mammals, is the major cause of SIDS. Numerous investigators have compared the concentration of magnesium, and other minerals from soft tissues and bone in SIDS with non-SIDS controls (normal infants who died suddenly of known cause such as trauma). Because of rapid shifts of minerals during early development, SIDS and control infants must be matched for gestational and postnatal age. About 95 per cent of SIDS occurs between 1-6 months of life, with peak incidence at 2-4 months, when vitreous magnesium is high. There is little change in magnesium in the relatively inert vitreous despite extremes in dietary magnesium. All values fall within a small range, with scatter. Magnesium rapidly increases in foetal cartilage with ossification of the bone. Early in magnesium deficiency, liver magnesium may be increased or unchanged, but it does not increase during magnesium excess. Lead accumulation is increased in magnesium deficiency. Among infants with high environmental exposure to lead, those who die of SIDS rather than non-SIDS infants have the greater lead burden. Soft water with low magnesium and calcium and with high concentration of sodium have been linked to higher SIDS rates, which have been attributed to low magnesium. It is concluded that the SIDS hypothesis has neither been proved nor disproved.

AB  - Background. Excellent metabolic control before conception and during diabetic pregnancies is the aim in order to avoid malformations and perinatal morbidity. Since an inverse correlation between median blood glucose concentration (BG) and hypoglycemia as well as a high prevalence of nocturnal hypoglycemia have been described, we investigated the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycemia and the predictive value of bedtime blood glucose concentration for development of this condition in insulin treated diabetic patients. Methods. During hospitalization, with no other changes in the patients' normal schedules, hourly blood samples were drawn from an iv-cannula from 22.00 h to 07.00 h for one night. BG (venous whole blood) and hemoglobin A(1c) were determined the following day. Results. Fifty-three patients participated; subsequently ten were excluded due to discontinuation of blood sampling during the night, caused by either discomfort or cannula problems. Of the remaining 43 patients, 16 (37%) had at least one blood glucose <3.0 mmol/l. The duration of hypoglycemia was 2.4 (1-7) h with the highest prevalence at 05 h. Only one patient felt hypoglycemic during the night. Hemoglobin A(1c) was similar in patients with (7.1Â±1.2%, meanÂ±s.d.) and without (6.8Â±0.8%) nocturnal hypoglycemia. Women with nocturnal hypoglycemia had significantly lower BG before bedtime compared to patients without hypoglycemia, 6.4Â±3.6 mmol/l vs. 7.9Â±2.4 mmol/l, p<0.05. The best predictive value for nocturnal hypoglycemia was a BG below 6.0 mmol/l at 23.00, which resulted in a risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia of 71%. Conversely, if the BG was â¥6.0 mmol/l, the chance of avoiding nocturnal hypoglycemia was 83%. Conclusion. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was seen with a prevalence of 37% during a night in the first trimester of pregnancy in insulin treated patients. Only one patient registered the hypoglycemia. Nocturnal hypoglycemia could be predicted in the majority of patients by measurements of BG before bedtime.

AB  - Background: Studies indicate that women abused by their intimate partners are at increased risk for a number of health problems and have increased rates of health care utilization. However, these findings are based mainly on studies using clinic or health plan populations. In this study, we examined the association between intimate partner abuse (IPA) and health concerns and health care utilization in a population-based sample of adult women. Methods: We analyzed data on 2043 women aged 18 to 59 who participated in the 1998 Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a population-based health survey that included questions on IPA. IPA was defined as experiencing physical violence by, fear of, or control by an intimate partner. Consequences of IPA and self-rated health status and health care utilization of women experiencing IPA were examined. Results: A total of 6.3% of Massachusetts women aged 18 to 59 reported IPA during the past year. Women experiencing IPA were more likely than other women to report depression, anxiety, sleep problems, suicidal ideation, disabilities, smoking, unwanted pregnancy, HIV testing, and condom use. Women experiencing IPA were less likely to have health insurance, but received routine health care at similar rates as other women. Conclusions: These results indicate that women in the general population experiencing IPA are at increased risk for several serious emotional and physical health concerns. Most of these women are in routine contact with health care providers. These findings also suggest that the BRFSS may provide a valuable mechanism for tracking state-based IPA prevalence rates over time. (C) 2000 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB  - Atrazine (ATR) is an herbicide that has been shown to have adverse reproductive effects including alterations in levels of pituitary hormones such as prolactin (prl) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in female LE rats when administered at doses of 200 mg/kg/day for 1 and 3 days. Because the action of prl in promotion of progesterone secretion is essential for the initiation of pregnancy in rats, this study was designed to examine the effect of exposure to ATR during early pregnancy on implantation and short-term pregnancy maintenance. Rats were divided into two groups representing periods of dosing with ATR prior to the diurnal or nocturnal surges of prl. Within each group, four groups consisting of four strains of rats [Holtzman (HLZ); Sprague Dawley (SD); Long Evans (LE); Fischer 344 (F344)] were each further subdivided into four ATR dosages. Rats were dosed by gavage with 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day ATR on days 1-8 of pregnancy (day 0 = sperm +). All animals were necropsied on day 8 or 9 of pregnancy. The 200 mg/kg dose of ATR reduced body weight gain in all but one group. Two groups of animals dosed at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day in the nocturnal dosing period showed an increase in percent preimplantation loss, and both of these were F344 rats. HLZ rats were the only strain to show a significant level of postimplantation loss and a decrease in serum progesterone at 200 mg/kg/day both following diurnal and nocturnal dosing. Doses of 100 mg/kg/day also produced postimplantation loss following diurnal and nocturnal dosing, but progesterone levels were decreased only after nocturnal dosing. Alterations in serum LH were seen in several groups. Serum estradiol was significantly increased only in SD rats dosed at the diurnal interval with 200 mg/kg ATR. We conclude that F344 rats are most susceptible to preimplantation effects of ATR and that HLZ rats appear most sensitive to the postimplantation effects of the chemical. LE and SD rats were least sensitive to effects of ATR during very early pregnancy.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of critically timed sleep deprivation in major mood disorders (MMD) occurring during pregnancy and postpartum. Methods: Nine women who met DSM-IV criteria for a MMD with onset during pregnancy or within 1 year postpartum underwent a trial of either early-night sleep deprivation (ESD), in which they were sleep deprived in the early part of one night and slept from 03:00-07:00 h, or late-night sleep deprivation (LSD), in which they were deprived of sleep in the latter part of one night and slept from 21:00-01:00 h. Mood was assessed before the night of sleep deprivation, after the night of sleep deprivation, and after a night of recovery sleep (sleep 22:30-06:30 h) by trained clinicians, blind to treatment condition, using standardized scales. Results: More patients responded to LSD (nine of 11 trials: 82%) compared with ESD (two of six trials: 33%) and they responded more after a night of recovery sleep (nine of 11 nights: 82%) than after a night of sleep deprivation (six of 11 nights: 55%). Pregnant women were the only responders to ESD and the only nonresponders to LSD. Limitations: The small and heterogeneous sample size prevents us from making more definitive conclusions based on statistical analyses. Conclusions: Although the findings are preliminary, the results suggest that with further study, critically timed sleep deprivation interventions may benefit women with pregnancy or postpartum major mood disorders and potentially provide a viable alternative treatment modality for those women who are not candidates for pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic interventions. Such interventions are needed to help prevent the devastating effects of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period on the mother, infant, her family and society.

AB  - Study Objectives: To test the hypotheses that: 1) an increase in endogenous progesterone levels during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle wild alter REM sleep and mood state, and 2) a decrease in endogenous progesterone levels during postpartum will also alter REM sleep and mood state. Design: A longitudinal descriptive study utilizing ambulatory polysomnography for two consecutive nights at seven time points. Setting: Subject's homes Participants: The first hypothesis was tested with 34 women studied during both the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycle. The second hypothesis was tested with 31 women who completed the sleep studies during pregnancy and at one month postpartum. Interventions: N/A Measurements and Results: Women who ovulated (high levels of serum progesterone in the luteal phase) had shorter REM latency, more REM sleep, and more positive mood state compared to those who did not ovulate (low luteal progesterone). Compared to the third trimester (high progesterone), REM latency was significantly shorter at one month postpartum (low progesterone). Mood state was most positive at the second trimester and most negative at one month postpartum. Conclusions: REM sleep and mood state were related to low progesterone levels during the menstrual cycle, but postpartum REM sleep and mood state were related to increased wake time rather than changes in progesterone levels.

AB  - In the infant, sucking behaviour is one of the first coordinated muscular activities. It is under the control of the brainstem. In utero sucking is observed from 13 weeks' gestation. The healthy full-term newborn infant has a very stable rhythm of alternating bursts of sucking with pauses in between. The non-nutritive sucking (NNS) patterns of 58 low-risk prematurely born infants (gestational ages between 26 and 35 weeks) were studied using a specially designed computer-based method that analyses and quantifies NNS. A total of 183 observations were analysed. The typical NNS pattern with bursts of sucking activity separated by quiescent periods was recorded in all infants studied and was already present before 30 weeks of gestation. A gradual change over time of their NNS was seen. With increased maturation the sucking activity, sucking frequency, amplitude and burst duration all increased, while the variability of the sucking frequency and the duration of the intervals between bursts declined. Post-menstrual age (PMA) was the dominant predictor of this result but gender, state of activity and weight also influenced it to some extent. Girls had more sucking activity and a higher sucking frequency than boys. State of activity affected the stability of the rhythm. The weight of the infant influenced both sucking activity and duration of separate bursts. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the association of hysterectomy and oophorectomy with the prevalence and clustering of menopausal symptoms in a large population-based sample of older women. Subjects were 1121 women aged 50-89 from the Rancho Bernardo Study. Information on menopause, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, estrogen use, and other covariates was obtained in 1984-1987. A 1989 mailed survey obtained information on menopausal symptoms. In this sample, 22.1% reported hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, and 25.3% reported hysterectomy with ovarian conservation. Mean time since hysterectomy was 26 (Â±12) years. Overall, 37% reported current estrogen use, and 40% reported past use. The duration of estrogen use was longer for women who had a hysterectomy (p < 0.001). Age-adjusted comparisons indicated that more women who had a hysterectomy, with or without bilateral oophorectomy, reported greater energy after menopause (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively), and more women with bilateral oophorectomy reported greater interest in sex (p = 0.007) and that life was getting better (p = 0.012) than women with natural menopause. Principal components factor analysis of the symptom data for all women yielded four factors: psychological, vasomotor, positive feelings, and self-image. Analyses performed within each group of women yielded similar factors and loadings. Adjusted comparisons of factor scores indicated that positive feelings were significantly higher in women who had a hysterectomy, with or without bilateral oophorectomy (p < 0.01) than in women with natural menopause. This difference was limited to current estrogen users. Vasomotor symptoms, psychological symptoms, and negative self-image did not differ by hysterectomy or oophorectomy status before or after stratification for estrogen use (p > 0.10). This study found after a hysterectomy, women are more likely to recall positive feelings about their menopause than women with natural menopause. Relief from symptoms leading to hysterectomy and use of replacement estrogen may be partly responsible. Results do not support the thesis that surgical menopause is associated with a sustained increased prevalence of vasomotor, psychological, or other symptoms.

AB  - It is well established that heat is associated with reduced sperm production, but the role of physiological variation in temperature has never been scrutinized in humans. We studied diurnal scrotal temperature and markers of male fertility in a population of couples planning their first pregnancy. Sixty men from a cohort of couples who were planning their first pregnancy were included and scrotal skin temperature was monitored during 3 days using a portable data recorder. Working hours and working postures were recorded daily in a questionnaire. Each man provided a fresh semen sample and the couples were followed for six menstrual cycles or until a clinical pregnancy was recognized. The median value of scrotal skin temperature was 33.3 Â°C in the daytime and 34.8 Â°C at night. In periods of sedentary work, the median temperature was on average 0.7 Â°C higher (SE = 0.2 Â°C). In addition, scrotal temperature was higher in the daytime, in summer, and in leisure time compared with working hours. Median sperm concentration among men with more than 75% of their daytime readings above 35 Â°C was 33.4 x 106/mL, compared with 91.8 x 106/mL for men with less than half of their readings above 35 Â°C (difference 58.4; 95% CI: 25.9-77.8 x 106/mL). It is concluded that a sedentary position is a significant source of increased scrotal skin temperature, and even moderate and physiological elevation in scrotal skin temperature is associated with a substantially reduced sperm concentration. Sedentary work should be considered as an important potential confounder for reduced sperm count in epidemiological research.

AB  - Objective: Investigation of daytime sleepiness, blood pressure changes and presence of sleep disordered breathing, in healthy young women during pregnancy. Methods: Young, healthy pregnant women between 18 and 32 years of age, seen in three different prenatal care clinics, were enlisted in a prospective study divided in two parts: part 1 of the study consisted of completing a standardized questionnaire on past and present sleep disorders. It also included filling out visual analog scales (VAS) for daytime sleepiness and snoring by the subject and bed partner. Blood pressure measurement was performed at 9 AM as per the WHO protocol. Similar data were collected again at the 6-month prenatal visit and at the 3-month post-delivery visit. At the 6-month visit, ambulatory monitoring of nocturnal sleep using a portable six-channel recorder (EdentraceÂ®) was performed at home. Part 2 involved a subgroup of subjects that were randomly selected after stratification based on results of VAS and ambulatory monitoring. It included 1 night of nocturnal polysomnography with esophageal manometry and 24 h of ambulatory BP monitoring with portable equipment with cuff inflation every 30 min. Results: Of the 267 women who participated in part 1 of the study , only 128 consented to enroll in part 2, from which 26 were selected to undergo polysomnography. At the 6-week prenatal visit 37.45% of the subjects reported daytime sleepiness of variable severity. At the 6-month visit, this was noted in 52% of the subjects. Bed-partners reported chronic, loud snoring prior to pregnancy in 3.7% of the study population, but this increased to 11.8% at the 6-month visit. Blood pressure (BP) remained below the pathological range, i.e. less than 150/95 mm Hg, during the entire pregnancy. However, ambulatory monitoring indicated that 37 women, including the loud chronic snorers, had some minor SaO2 drops during sleep and this same group presented the largest increase in BP between the 6th week and the 6th month prenatal visits. Part 2 included 26 women, 13 from the above identified 37 women and 13 from the rest of the group, chosen randomly, age and body mass index (BMI) matched. Polysomnography did identify two abnormal breathing patterns during sleep: (1) esophageal pressure 'crescendos' associated predominantly with stage 1 and 2 NREM sleep, and (2) 'abnormal sustained efforts' seen predominantly with delta sleep. These abnormal breathing patterns were noted during a significantly longer time during sleep. This group of women with the abnormal breathing patterns were not only chronic snorers but also had significantly higher systolic and diastolic BP increases when compared to the 13 other non-snorers. Six out of the 13 snorers were 'non-dippers' at the 24-h BP recording. Conclusion: Abnormal breathing during sleep (that is frequently, but not always, associated with loud, chronic snoring, and may be a consequence of edema induced by hormonal changes associated with pregnancy), can be seen in otherwise healthy young pregnant women. It may contribute to the symptom of daytime sleepiness. The changes in blood pressure noted were of no pathological significance in our population but could be an added risk factor in high-risk pregnancies. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Objective: To review the major confounding factors that influence the determination of arousal thresholds in infants. Review of confounding factors: The determination of arousal thresholds in infants measures their arousability from sleep. The evaluation is influenced by various conditions. The infant's arousability is decreased by maternal factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke, alcohol, illegal drugs or medications during gestation or breastfeeding. The levels of arousal thresholds also depend on the age of the infant and on experimental conditions, such as previous sleep deprivation, type of arousal challenges, time of administration of the arousal challenge, sleep stage, body position, room temperature, use of a pacifier, bed sharing, or type of feeding. In addition, spontaneous arousals can occur and modify the infant's response to external arousal challenges. Conclusions: Factors known to modify infants' arousability from sleep should be controlled during studies designed to determine arousal thresholds. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - CASE. Tiffany, a 3-year-old girl, was referred to the developmental and behavioral pediatrics service for evaluation of significant and persistent negative behaviors associated with refusal to eat at meal time and constant snacking during the past 3 months. She lost 2 pounds, but her weight for her height was at the 50th percentile. Her mother indicated that Tiffany had frequent night awakenings (>10) and late sleep onset (between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m.). Her mother described her as being "easily frustrated," getting upset and angry very quickly. Tiffany was identified at an early intervention program as having mild to moderate developmental delays in pragmatic speech, gross and fine motor skills, and social interaction skills. Tiffany was born at 33 weeks gestation and was hospitalized for 10 days without significant perinatal problems. She was readmitted at 2 months of age when she was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux, lactose intolerance, sleep apnea, and bradycardia. She was discharged with an apnea monitor. A seizure disorder was diagnosed at 1 year of age and reactive airway disease at 2 years of age. At the time of the referral to the developmental and behavioral pediatrics service, Tiffany was followed by multiple services, including cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology, psychology, and pulmonary. Pharmacologic therapies included albuterol and cromalyn inhalers, phenobarbital, valproic acid, levocarnitine, ranitidine, and an inhaled steroid. She continued to use the apnea monitor each night, although three sleep studies demonstrated a normal sleep pattern with no evidence of apnea or bradycardia. A recent electroencephalogram was normal. Tiffany lives with her mother and maternal grandparents. Her mother is morbidly obese with a history of asthma and depression. She was infertile for a 10-year period, which she attributed to the stress associated with living with an abusive man. Tiffany was the result of a subsequent, brief relationship with another man; she has not had contact with her father. Her mother is a licensed practical nurse who has not worked as a nurse since Tiffany's birth. An interdisciplinary treatment approach to Tiffany's multiple biological and behavioral problems was implemented by admitting her to a collaborative care unit at a children's hospital.

AB  - Menstrual migraines may be diminished when NSAID treatment is started 3 days before the onset of - and continued through - a patient's menses. Focal use of triptans or dihydroergotamine 24 hours in advance - and for the duration - of an anticipated attack may also be effective. If a patient wants to try an oral contraceptive as a form of birth control and has migraine, advise her about the small but red increased risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events. With pregnant patients, discuss dietary strategies, exercise and sleep patterns and, possibly, the use of biofeedback. NSAIDs and other drug treatments are available to pregnant migraine sufferers. Consider hormone replacement therapy as a preventive measure for patients in menopause.

AB  - In excitable cells, small-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (SK channels) are responsible for the slow after-hyperpolarization that often follows an action potential Three SK channel subunits have been molecularly characterized. The SK3 gene was targeted by homologous recombination for the insertion of a gene switch that permitted experimental regulation of SK3 expression while retaining normal SK3 promoter function. An absence of SK3 did not present overt phenotypic consequences. However, SK3 overexpression induced abnormal respiratory responses to hypoxia and compromised parturition. Both conditions were corrected by silencing the gene. The results implicate SK3 channels as potential therapeutic targets for disorders such as sleep apnea or sudden infant death syndrome and for regulating uterine contractions during labor.

AB  - The long-term consequences of a physiological-range increase of maternal corticosterone during lactation were investigated on the 15-month-old progeny. The offspring of rats drinking water supplemented with corticosterone (200Î¼g/ml of corticosterone hemisuccinate) from day 1 postpartum to weaning exhibited: (i) better performance in a conditioned learning test; (ii) reduction of fearfulness in two conflict situations; (iii) lower stress-induced corticosterone secretion and (iv) higher number of corticosteroid receptors in the hippocampus. The results of this study show that the effects of maternal physiological-range hypercorticosteronemia during lactation are lifelong. Moreover, these data suggest that corticosteroids, secreted during neonatal life, may constitute a factor directing the neurobiological development of the infant. In line with this hypothesis, glucocorticoid-induced early events have consequences on the behavioral and physiological status of adulthood. These consequences may be either 'beneficial' or 'detrimental' depending on the plasma levels of corticosterone induced by the early life occurrences, as well as on the kind of the stimulus and the developmental stage at which the neonate experiences the event.The present study demonstrates that, when the increase of corticosterone in infancy is moderate, the adult rats show reduced anxiety, improved learning and a better coping strategy to deal with stressful situations.

AB  - Not only doctor's office hypertension, but also, conversely, doctor's office normotension can be detected by 24-hour blood pressure measurement. A diagnostic improvement is also achieved in patients with borderline or mild hypertension. A number of illnesses are associated with nocturnal blood pressure elevation. In particular patients with secondary hypertension experience this reversal of the usual decrease in blood pressure at night. In such cases, non-invasive 24-hour blood pressure measurement may provide the first evidence. In pregnant women in particular, untreated hypertension may have serious consequences. In such cases, close monitoring of blood pressure and treatment by long-term measurement is also of prognostic significance. Also, in patients with concomitant diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or renal disease, 24-hour blood pressure measurement for monitoring purposes should be done more often than in patients with a low risk profile.

AB  - The prevalence of depressive disorders in women is twice that in men. This gender difference emerges around the time of puberty and persists through the childbearing years. Reproductive events and psychosocial factors are important influences on depression in women. Women often present with atypical depressive symptoms and comorbid disorders that can complicate both diagnosis and treatment. Sex differences in pharmacokinetics have been noted, as well as differences in antidepressant treatment response. While sleep disturbances, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain may be part of the constellation of depressive symptoms, they are also important considerations in selecting a treatment option for depressed women.

AB  - Background - Blood pressure (BP) is usually measured by conventional sphyg-momanometry. Although apparently simple, this procedure is fraught with many potential sources of error. This review focuses on two alternative techniques of BP measurement: ambulatory monitoring and self measurement. Review - BP values obtained by ambulatory monitoring or self measurement are characterised by high reproducibility, are not subject to digit preference or observer bias, and minimise the transient rise of the blood pressure in response to the surroundings of the clinic or the presence of the observer, the so called white coat effect. For ambulatory monitoring, the upper limits of systolic/diastolic normotension in adults include 130/80 mm Hg for the 24 hour BP and 135/85 and 120/70 mm Hg for the daytime BP and night time BP, respectively. For the the self measured BP these thresholds include 135/85 mm Hg. Automated BP measurement is most useful to identify patients with white coat hypertension. Whether or not white coat hypertension predisposes to sustained hypertension remains debated. However, outcome is better correlated with the ambulatory BP than with the conventional BP. In patients with white coat hypertension, antihypertensive drugs lower the BP in the clinic, but not the ambulatory BP, and also do not improve prognosis. Ambulatory BP monitoring is also better than conventional BP measurement in assessing the effects of treatment. Ambulatory BP monitoring is necessary to diagnose nocturnal hypertension and is especially indicated in patients with borderline hypertension, elderly patients, pregnant women, patients with treatment resistant hypertension, and also in patients with symptoms suggestive of hypotension. Conclusions - The newer techniques of BP measurement are now well established in clinical research, for diagnosis in clinical practice, and will increasingly make their appearance in occupational and environmental medicine.

AB  - Study Objectives: Pre-eclampsia is currently the predominant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Diurnal blood pressure variation is flattened or reversed in pre-eclampsia; however, sleep has not been extensively investigated in this disease. Our objective was therefore to study sleep architecture in this group of patients. Study Design: Full polysomnography using the Compumedics Sleepwatch SystemÂ® or Compumedics p-series. Setting: NA. Patients: 25 pre-eclamptic patients and 17 primigravidas with normal pregnancies and no history of cardiovascular disease or sleep disorder. With the exception of one subject, all pre-eclamptics were taking clonidine (a known suppressant of rapid eye movement-REM-sleep) for control of their hypertension. Interventions: NA. Results: Pre-eclamptic subjects had markedly altered sleep architecture, with a markedly increased percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS) (21 * 2% versus 43 * 3%, p < 0.001). There was a longer latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (92 * 11 mins vs. 205 * 23 mins in control and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively, p<0.001) and reduced time spent in REM (18 * 1% and 10 * 2% in control and pre-eclamptic subjects, respectively, p<0.001). Conclusions: While the increased REM latency and decreased REM time are most likely due to clonidine, this is unlikely to also account for the increased SWS. Two possible explanations for this include cerebral edema and release of cytokines, which are known to alter sleep structure.

AB  - There is a genetic contribution to the idiopathic restless legs syndrome (iRLS). An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is suspected, but as yet no gene has been identified. To assess the frequency and characteristics of the hereditary restless legs syndrome (RLS) in comparison to those of non-hereditary RLS, we analysed the clinical data of 300 RLS patients. All 300 patients diagnosed as RLS according to the criteria of the International RLS Study Group were examined using a standard questionnaire covering demographic data, family history, clinical symptoms, subjective sleep disturbances and course of the disease. In all patients a complete neurological examination was performed, and in selected cases electrophysiological examinations and polysomnographic studies. Family history was rated as definitely positive when at least one first-degree relative was examined and classified as RLS according to the criteria by one of the authors. If it proved impossible to contact family members to verify reports of a family history, the patients were classified as only having a 'possible positive family history.' 232 of the 300 patients had iRLS and 68 secondary RLS due to uremia (uRLS). 42.3% of the patients with iRLS and 11.7% of those with uRLS were classified as having 'definite positive' hereditary RLS, with a further 12.6% of iRLS patients and 5.8% of uRLS patients as having 'possible positive' hereditary RLS. Patients with definite hereditary RLS were significantly younger at the age of onset than those with a negative family history (35.45 vs. 47.17 years, p<0.05). The clinical characteristics of the disease were similar in both groups, except that women with hereditary RLS experienced a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy (19.1% vs. 2.6%, p<0.05). Our study shows that patients with hereditary RLS may experience an earlier onset of the disease. Hereditary and non-hereditary RLS present with similiar clinical signs and symptoms.

AB  - There is substantial evidence to suggest that ethanol exposure during vulnerable periods of prenatal somatic growth results in a number of morphological abnormalities and cognitive deficits in offspring. Amongst the characteristics exhibited by affected individuals are abnormal sleeping patterns, particularly abnormal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. To better understand how prenatal ethanol exposure specifically affects sleeping patterns in offspring, an animal model of fetal alcohol syndrome was investigated using the Sprague-Dawley rat. Our study demonstrated that the amount of time spent in REM sleep was reduced in female, but not male rats, which were exposed to ethanol in utero as compared to male and female saline controls. Similarly, % REM sleep for female saline control rats was almost twice that of females exposed to ethanol (11.9 vs. 6.9%). By contrast, ethanol treated and control saline males did not differ on the % REM measure (11.5 vs. 10.4%), nor did they differ from the female saline controls. No differences were observed between males and females or treatment groups in terms of time spent in either slow wave sleep or wakefulness. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor (TAFI) is a recently described inhibitor of fibrinolysis. The physiological variations of plasma TAFI antigen are not well known. We studied TAFI antigen values in healthy populations with a commercially available kit from Milan Analytica (Switzerland). Broad range of TAFI antigen values (from 41% to 259%) was found in a population of 249 healthy individuals. Gender as well as pregnancy did not influence mean values of TAFI antigen. There was a positive correlation between TAFI antigen and age in female (r = 0.28; p < 0.05) but not in male populations. Mean TAFI antigen value of a black African male group [mean Â± SD (range): 87 Â± 23 (39-144%)] was significantly lower than the one of age matched Caucasian men [114 Â± 34 (52-259%)] (p < 0.0001). TAFI antigen values were very stable within individuals, they did not significantly vary on day time or at several months period. Thus, in contrast to large inter-individual variations, TAFI antigen levels are quite stable within individuals.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic movement disorder that is often associated with a sleep complaint. Patients with RLS have an irresistible urge to move their legs, which is usually due to disagreeable sensations that are worse during periods of inactivity and often interfere with sleep. It is estimated that between 2 and 15 percent of the population may experience symptoms of RLS. Primary RLS likely has a genetic origin. Secondary causes of RLS include iron deficiency, neurologic lesions, pregnancy and uremia. RLS also may occur secondarily to the use of certain medications. The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on the patient's history. A list of questions that may be used as a basis to assess the likelihood of RLS is included in this article. Pharmacologic treatment of RLS includes dopaminergic agents, opioids, benzodiazepines and anticonvulsants. The primary care physician plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of RLS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the iron bioavailability in two popular prenatal multivitamin/multimineral supplement tablets containing 27 mg elemental iron. STUDY DESIGN: Iron absorption during an eight-hour period following ingestion of a multivitamin/multimineral formulation, both fasting and with a standardized meal, was measured in a group of 30 pregnant women (24-32 weeks of gestation) and statistically compared. The prenatal formulations were Stuartnatal PlusÂ® and MaternaÂ® (Wyeth-Ayerst Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and each contains 27 mg of elemental iron. A placebo was included in the study for the control group in this crossover, single-blind study. RESULTS: The net iron bioavailability (mean Â± SE) of Stuartnatal PlusÂ® and MaternaÂ®, accounting for diurnal variation, and the iron ingested with the standardized meal was 5.4 Â± 0.4 and 4.6 Â± 0.2 mg, respectively, while fasting and 2.9 Â± 0.4 and 2.7 Â± 0.4 mg, respectively, postprandially. The total amount of iron absorption in the fasting states from both prenatal formulations exceeded the 3 mg of supplemental iron absorption per day recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that these two prenatal multivitamin/multimineral formulations provide > 3.0 mg of supplemental iron absorption (fasting) as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences and 2.7 mg of iron absorption above the levels achieved following ingestion of a standard, low-iron test meal.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and pituitary corticotropin, is one of the first endocrine systems to develop during fetal life, probably because glucocorticoid secretion is necessary for the maturation of many essential fetal organs. Consistent with this, pregnant mice with an inactivating mutation in the Crh gene deliver CRH-deficient offspring that die at birth with dysplastic lungs, which can be prevented by prenatal maternal glucocorticoid treatment. But children lacking the ability to synthesize cortisol (because of various genetic defects in adrenal gland development or steroidogenesis) are not born with respiratory insufficiency or abnormal lung development, suggesting that the transfer of maternal glucocorticoid across the placenta might promote fetal organ maturation in the absence of fetal glucocorticoid production. We used pregnant mice with a normal HPA axis carrying fetuses with CRH deficiency to characterize the relative contributions of the fetal and maternal adrenal to the activity of the fetal HPA axis, and related these findings to fetal lung development. We found that in the presence of fetal adrenal insufficiency, normal fetal lung development is maintained by the transfer of maternal glucocorticoid to the fetus, specifically during the circadian peak in maternal glucocorticoid secretion.

AB  - 30 Pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy were compared with 30 age and height matched non pregnant married premenopausal women as controls. Both the groups were warded for a minimum period of 24 hours and monitored by the first investigator for snoring for a minimum period of six hours of sleep. In addition, the history of snoring (from the spouses), and other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea were obtained. A full otolaryngological clinical examination and measurements of fundal height, BMI (body mass index), and abdominal girth was carried out. Snoring was observed in 20 out of 30 pregnant women (67%) and none in the control group. The mean BMI, abdominal girth, and the fundal height were significantly greater in the pregnant snorers as compared to the pregnant non-snorers.

AB  - A new periodogram was proposed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), termed ANOVA periodogram, in order to reveal a precise significant periodicity. Thirty 3-day complex computer-simulated time series with known periodicity (24h) and three 2-h data-missing occurring periodically (23 h, 20 min) were used to compare the ANOVA periodogram with Enright's one. In results, the ANOVA periodogram was superior to Enright's periodogram in the accuracy of assessing the major periodicity.

AB  - Female CD-I mice were exposed to a commercial amine formulation of 2,4- dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on days 6-16 of gestation in drinking water at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0% of the formulated product, equivalent to approximately 0-650 mg/kg/d expressed as the amine derivative. The effect of 2,4-D on urethan-induced pulmonary adenoma formation was evaluated in female offspring 19 w after birth. Urethan-induced sleeping times observed following ip injection of 1.5 mg urethran/g bw 7 w after birth were not altered by 2,4-D (p = 0.10), indicating that 2,4-D did not affect the rate of urethan elimination, 2,4-D exposure did not affect the number of tumors produced (p = 0.58), but did reduce the mean tumor diameter in the highest dose group (p < 0.01). This minor antineoplastic activity of 2,4-D may be related, in part, to inhibitory effects of 2,4-D on various enzymatic or metabolic pathways, essential for cellular growth and tissue development. Since exposure to 2,4-D during pregnancy had little impact of tumor production, it is unlikely that persistent alteration to developing immune cells involved in the cell-mediated immunosurveillance mechanisms occurred. The subtle alteration in tumor size and the mild impairment of growth in the offspring were observed almost exclusively in the highest treatment group. Since this level of exposure is well in excess of those associated with normal application of 2,4-D, the hazard to non-target mammalian populations appears minimal.

AB  - Infants of mothers with depressive symptoms show developmental delays if symptoms persist over the first 6 months of the infant's life, thus highlighting the importance of identifying those mothers for early intervention. In Study 1, mothers with depressive symptoms (n = 160) and mothers without depressive symptoms (n = 100) and their infants were monitored to identify variables from the first 3 months that predict which mothers would still be symptomatic at 6 months. A "dysregulation" profile was noted for the infants of depressed mothers, including lower Brazelton scores, more indeterminate sleep, and elevated norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine levels at the neonatal period, and greater right frontal EEG activation, lower vagal tone, and negative interactions at the 3- and 6-month periods. A group of maternal variables from the neonatal and 3-month assessments accounted for 51% of the variance in the mothers' continuing depressive symptoms. These variables included greater right frontal EEG activation, lower vagal tone, and less positive interactions at 3 months, and elevated norepinephrine, serotonin, and cortisol levels at the neonatal stage. In Study 2, a similar sample of mothers with depressive symptoms (n = 160) and without depressive symptoms (n = 100) was recruited and followed to 3 months. Those symptomatic mothers who had values above (or below) the median (depending on the negative direction) on the predictor variables identified in Study 1 (taken from the first 3 months) were then randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group at 3 months. These groups were then compared with each other, as well as with the group without depressive symptoms, at 6 and 12 months. The intervention, conducted from 3 to 6 months, consisted of free day care for the infants and a rehab program (social, educational, and vocational) plus several mood induction interventions for the mothers, including relaxation therapy, music mood induction, massage therapy, and mother-infant interaction coaching. Although the mothers who received the intervention continued to have more depressive symptoms than did the nondepressed mothers, their interactions significantly improved and their biochemical values and vagal tone normalized. Their infants also showed more positive interations, better growth, fewer pediatric complications, and normalized biochemical values, and by 12 months their mental and motor scores were better than those of the infants in the control group.

AB  - A study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a health promotion campaign on 6 major preventative actions for infant health is presented. The study is financed by the italian Ministry of Health within the National Health Plan 1998-2000 research framework. The 6 preventative actions were chosen as those where the evidence for the effect of behavioural change is stronger and include: periconceptional administration of folic acid, avoidance of smoking during pregnancy and at home, back to sleep position, exclusive and prolonged breast feeding, safe transport in car and immunizations. Young couples and parents are addressed through both health professionals (family doctors and perinatal health services) and the media. The study, design is based on a comparison of the prevalence of prevertative behaviours among the target population before and after the intervention. The study area includes three different italian Regions for a total population of almost 3 millions. Expected outcomes of the study include information on baseline altitudes and behaviours of parents and on health promotion strategies which address infant and child health.

AB  - We examined developmental changes of orexins/hypocretins and their receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the rat hypothalamus from postnatal day 0 to 10 weeks, using in situ hybridization histochemistry for the prepro-orexin, OX1R and OX2R mRNAs and immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and orexin-B. The prepro-orexin mRNA was weakly detected in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) from days 0 to 15. Orexin-A- and -B-like immunopositive cells and fibers were not detected from days 0 to 10, but they were observed after day 15. The prepro-orexin mRNA in the LHA markedly increased between days 15 and 20. The OX1R mRNA was detected in the ventromedial hypothalamic area (VMH) at day 0. The OX2R mRNA was not detected in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) at days 0 and 1, but weakly observed on day 5. The OX1R mRNA in the VMH and OX2R mRNA in the PVN gradually increased throughout the postnatal period. Next, we examined the effects of milk deprivation and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of leptin on the hypothalamic prepro-orexin mRNA in pups. Although 24-h milk deprivation did not affect the level of the prepro-orexin mRNA at days 5 and 10, i.p. administration of leptin from days 0 to 3 caused a significant increase in the prepro-orexin mRNA on days 5 and 10. These results suggest that the development of orexins may be associated with developmental changes such as increase of leptin, weaning, feeding and sleep/wakefulness states.

AB  - The current study examined the consequences of prenatal SKF-38393 exposure on the cellular response in the adult suprachiasmatic nuclei to light. Pregnant rats were injected with the dopamine agonist SKF-38393 or vehicle daily from gestational day 15 to 21. Adult offspring received a light pulse (1 min/2 lux) 4 or 8 h after lights off (ZT16 or ZT20 where ZT = zeitgeber time). Brains were processed for c-FOS-like immunoreactivity in the SCN. At ZT20 the number of cells expressing c-FOS protein after a light pulse was the same in both groups. At ZT16 the number of cells in the SCN of SKF- 38393-exposed animals was 58% lower than the vehicle-treated group. The data suggest that prenatal SKF-38393 treatment may have long-term consequences for SCN function. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Background: During the last decade most hospitals in Norway have introduced breastfeeding according to the baby's needs during night-time as well. The aim of this study was to examine whether women had sufficient sleep and rest in the maternity unit, and the factors influencing insufficient sleep and rest. The degree of satisfaction with the stay in the maternity unit and factors associated with satisfaction were also studied. Material and methods. From April to November 1998, 160 postnatal women in two Norwegian communities were included in a questionnaire-based study, representing 89% of all women eligible for the study. Results. 47% (75/160) of the women reported lack of sleep and rest in the maternity unit. The factor most strongly associated with lack of sleep and rest was not having a single room (adjusted odds ratio 11.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.7-69.1). 56% (88/158) of the women reported to be very satisfied, 39% (68/158) were moderately satisfied, and 5% (8/158) dissatisfied with the stay at the maternity unit. Not being very satisfied was associated with the hospital of delivery (adjusted OR 18.0; 95% CI: 2.2-149.1), and with insufficient sleep and rest (OR 3.3: 1.3-8.1). Interpretation: Our results suggest that women do not get sufficient sleep and rest under existing circumstances in maternity units.

AB  - Background: Low-dose thalidomide therapy (median dose 100 mg/day, 50-200 mg/day) in chronic discoid lupus erythematosus was studied with regard to efficacy, tolerance, and toxicity in 22 patients. Intense contraceptive precautions were taken in women patients of childbearing age. Methods: An open uncontrolled trial was conducted. Age, the total drug intake, disease duration, extent/severity, and adverse reactions were studied with regard to the final clinical outcome. The follow-up duration was 1.8 years (range 1 month to 3 years). Results: With the exception of age (inverse correlation, P < 0.01), the parameters studied did not influence the final clinical amelioration: complete responders numbered 54.5%, partial responders 22.7%, and 13.6% were withdrawn from the trial with complaints of intolerance. The initial (first month) clinical response correlated significantly with the final one (P < 0.01). Drowsiness (40.9%) and somnolence (18.2%) were the most common side-effects, without affecting seriously the daily life of the participants. No case of real neurotoxicity was confirmed. Relapses occurred within 39.4 Â± 21.4 days after drug withdrawal, presenting a milder clinical picture. Conclusions: In the context of a predictable final outcome, low-dose thalidomide therapy is effective as an alternative choice in cases resistant to the usual treatment.

AB  - There has been considerable interest in heart rate (fH) fluctuations in relation to cardiovascular control systems and foetal conditions during pregnancy in mammals. Prominent fluctuations in fH also occur in avian embryos, which are an important experimental model for studying developmental physiology. The present study determined the instantaneous fH of seven chick embryos continuously from the last stage of prenatal development (day 18), throughout the pipping (perinatal) period (days 19-21) until hatching and, subsequently, of newly hatched chicks (up to day 2). The distinctive patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations took the form of specific changes within a broad mean fH baseline. Cyclic oscillations (ultradian rhythm) occurred until an early stage of the perinatal period, when the fH baseline started rising. Subsequently, the baseline dropped and respiratory arrhythmia began to appear concomitant with external pipping. During the final stage of external pipping, when the fH baseline rose again prior to hatching, three unique patterns of instantaneous fH fluctuations were evident: relatively long-lasting cyclic small accelerations, irregular intermittent large accelerations and short-term repeated large accelerations. Furthermore, repeated alternate occurrences of the latter two types of acceleration formed an additional oscillating pattern with a period of 10-15 min. During the early period after hatching, when the fH baseline reached its maximum, instantaneous fH changed relatively slowly accompanied by transient rapid decelerations, probably due to augmented vagal tone. Subsequently, the mean fH baseline dropped to its minimum, and a circadian rhythm and three types of previously reported fH fluctuations (types I-III) appeared. Developmental patterns of mean fH and the appearance of distinctive patterns of instantaneous fluctuations in fH and circadian rhythms were not influenced by an ultimate failure of hatching after a normal development. The demonstration of complex, repeatable patterns of fH fluctuation that change during development suggests that the avian embryo model should be useful in studying the phenomenon of fH fluctuation and its underlying causes.

AB  - The present study examined if drug suppression of active sleep (AS) in the neonate affected the development and expression of respiratory behavior. Secondly, we assessed brain neurochemistry and receptor density in specific supra-medullary brain regions to identify coincident biochemical alterations. Sprague-Dawley newborn rat pups were randomized and divided among six rat mothers (n=10/mother/group), each mother housed separately. Two untreated control (UC) groups received either no interventions or were fed milk vehicle twice daily and were handled similarly to the drug intervention animals. Pharmacological disruption of sleep was achieved by administration (2 groups of each) of either clonidine (CLO) 100 Î¼m/kg, or scopolamine (SCO) 800 Î¼m/kg, given orally twice daily for the first 7 days of life. On postnatal (P) days P10 and P19 of life, pups were assessed for metabolism, minute ventilation (V(E)), tidal volume (V(t)) and frequency (f). On P21 (14 days after the end of drug exposure), pups from each condition were sacrificed and punch biopsies of the frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus were examined for hydroxytryptophan (5-HT), and norepinepherine (NE) by HPLC. An equal number of pups were sacrificed and brains examined for muscarinic acetylcholine (mAch), Î±2-adrenergic and I1-imidazoline receptor density. Results: Both CLO and SCO exposed animals had a lower V(t) and respiratory quotient than UC animals (p&lt;0.01). CLO animals exhibited a higher f (p&lt;0.01) and both CLO and SCO exhibited a lower V(t) (p&lt;0.05) than the UC groups; V(E) was reduced in the SCO groups, compared with CLO and UC groups (p&lt;0.01). Pattern of breathing in response to brief hypoxia exposure was altered for CLO and SCO. The normal decline in V(E) during sleep was not observed in CLO rats. Both drug exposures resulted in a comparable reduction in hypothalamic NE and 5-HT levels (p&lt;0.05), while in the frontal cortex, and the hippocampus variable changes in NE and 5-HT, occurred. In CLO and SCO rats mAch receptors were increased in cortex, and reduced in hypothalamus; I1-imidazoline receptors were increased in hypothalamus and decreased in hippocampus (p&lt;0.05 for each). In contrast, Î±2-adrenergic receptors were increased in cortex for both CLO and SCO, decreased in hypothalamus for CLO, and decreased in hippocampus for SCO (p&lt;0.05 for each). Conclusions: these data show that drug-induced neonatal sleep suppression will alter ventilatory pattern, metabolism, and site-specific concentrations of adrenergic neurotransmitters and in receptor density, perhaps as a result of suppression of neonatal AS.

AB  - Blood specimens were obtained at different daily times from the umbilical cord and brachial vein from 53 women within 10 minutes after delivery. Enzyme activities were measured in the white blood cells (WBCs) and serum of each sample. For each enzyme, the results were grouped according to sampling (delivery) times and arrayed to form a 24h time series. Separate time series were generated for maternal and fetal enzymes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and cosine best-fit analyses were applied to elucidate significant differences between enzyme activity patterns of mothers and fetuses with regard to time dependency, number of peaks, and acrophases. These and previously documented results indicate that not all mothers and fetuses have rhythms that are concordant. For some enzymes of fetuses, the activity rhythms differ in phase and shape of the time series pattern from those of the mothers; for other enzymes, the activity rhythms develop after birth.

AB  - QUESTION: I have a 30-year-old pregnant patient who is asthmatic and is taking prednisone. Whenever she decreases her prednisone dose, her nausea increases tremendously even though she is taking two tablets of doxylamine and pyridoxine combination (DiclectinÂ®) daily. She is already at 26 weeks' gestation, and I really do not want her to continue the prednisone beyond what is needed for her asthma, but two attempts to taper prednisone off failed because of unbearable nausea. ANSWER: Several controlled trials show the efficacy of prednisone for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP), but your case is fascinating in proving the point by challenge-rechallenge. You should try to decrease the prednisone while increasing doxylamine and pyridoxine to its recommended dose of two tablets before sleep, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon.

AB  - Placental progesterone metabolites may influence fetal behaviour during late gestation. We have investigated the effect of the neuroactive metabolite, pregnanolone, on the sleep/awake behaviour of fetal sheep. These studies can only be effectively performed in unanesthetized animals with chronically implanted leads and catheters. The relatively large internal volumes of these catheters raises problems for cerebroventriclear infusions. Therefore, we developed a device with negligible deadspace (~10 Î¼l) consisting of a ventricular cannula attached to a small cap which allowed the instillation of Î¼l volumes of neuroactive steroids into a cerebral ventricle of fetal sheep in utero. Two catheters attached to the cap allow it to be filled in a push-pull configuration. The smaller internal diameter of the ventricular cannular prevents the solution entering the ventricle until the outflow catheter is occluded and solution is forced through the probe. Using this device, the infusion of 5Î²-pregnane-3Î±-ol-20-one (pregnanolone, 1 mg), in 35% hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin, resulted in a marked suppression of fetal behaviour parameters indicative of arousal, while vehicle alone did not affect these parameters. We conclude that neuroactive steroids can be infused into the cerebroventricular system of chronically catheterised fetal sheep in small volumes and that pregnanolone may act directly to influence fetal behaviour.

AB  - Repeated prenatal exposure to cocaine is associated with attenuated respiratory and arousal responses in infants and piglets. As the normal development of these functions is influenced by medullary opioid systems, the present study explored the possible contribution of the opioid systems to the attenuation induced by cocaine. Methionine-enkephalin (met-enkephalin), an endogenous opioid peptide, was delineated by immunocytochemistry in respiratory- and arousal-related medullary regions of relatively immature (6-7-day-old) and more mature piglets (20-21-day-old). The animals were either unexposed, or exposed prenatally to 2 mg/kg cocaine four times daily administered to the pregnant sows intravenously throughout the last third of gestation. At control, met-enkephalin was found in the neurons, fibers and terminals of the respiratory- and arousal-related medullary regions throughout the age range studied. Prenatal cocaine exposure increased met-enkephalin immunoreactivity in the respiratory-related hypoglossal and solitary tract nuclei of both age groups. These findings support a modulatory role of met-enkephalin in the normal development of respiratory control, and an involvement of this peptide in the attenuation of respiration by repeated prenatal exposure to cocaine.

AB  - The effects of diencephalic lesions on respiratory responses to intra- arterially infused adenosine (ADO) were determined in chronically catheterized fetal sheep (>0.8 term). These studies were designed to test the hypothesis that the inhibitory effects of ADO on fetal breathing, like those of hypoxia, are mediated by the parafascicular nuclear complex (Pf) of the posteromedial thalamus. ADO inhibited breathing [control (C): 26 Â± 2.6, ADO: 4 Â± 1 min/h] in normal fetuses and in a fetus with a lesion that virtually destroyed the thalamus but left intact most of Pf. Neuronal lesions in the diencephalon, produced by injecting ibotenic acid, abolished the inhibitory effects of ADO on breathing (C: 31 Â± 5.1, ADO: 30 Â± 4.5 min/h) when the lesions encompassed Pf or the sector immediately rostral to Pf that retained the capacity to regulate hypoxic inhibition. Smaller lesions created by the insertion of needles also eliminated the depressant effects of ADO when disruptions were within Pf or a rostral component of the thalamic cortical activating system. It is concluded that 1) a medial thalamic sector is critically involved in ADO-induced apnea and 2) ADO-dependent and ADO- independent mechanisms mediate hypoxic inhibition.

AB  - The ontogeny of photic responsiveness in the retina and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of C57BL/6J mouse was studied using the enhanced expression of the immediate early gene c-fos as a marker of neuronal activation. c-fos expression was assessed by immunocytochemical localisation of its protein product. Light induction of Fos-like protein in the retina and SCN occurred first at postnatal day four (PD 4). At this stage of development, some cells in the inner part of the neuroblastic layer and in the ganglion cell layer showed positive immunoreaction; the number of Fos- like positive cells increased with age until it reached adult levels by PD 15. Induction of Fos-like expression at PD 4 in the SCN mainly occurred in the ventrolateral region, the region that receives the greatest density of retinal innervation. These results indicate that retinal input can activate cells in the SCN even before eyelids open, and the SCN can be stimulated by photic inputs as early as day 4 after birth.

AB  - The abuse of social drugs such as cocaine during pregnancy represents enormous risks to the offspring. Recent studies showed that drugs administered to the pregnant rat can activate cell populations in the fetal brain, possibly altering the timing of key neuronal developmental events. The current study examined the ontogeny of light-responsiveness of the neonatal rat suprachiasmatic nucleus using c-FOS protein in SCN nuclei as a marker. The effect of acute administration of the dopamine D1 agonist, SKF-38393, on the development of light responsiveness was also examined. Pregnant dams received either SKF-38393 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle 7 h after dawn on gestational day 20. Litters were then assigned to one of seven experimental time points from 4 h after subjective dark onset on the day of birth (P0-CT16) at 4-h intervals until CT16 on the day after birth (P1-CT16). Half of the pups in each litter were exposed to a 200 lux/2 h light pulse and the other half remained in darkness. Three time points (P1-CT0, P1-CT8 and P1-CT16) were used to examine the prenatal drug effects on light-responsiveness. Light exposure at the time of subjective lights on, the day after birth (P1-CT0), resulted in a significant increase in c-FOS-positive cells. The number of positive cells recorded in the SCN after a light pulse at P1-CT0 and P1-CT8 was significantly less in SKF-38393 pretreated pups compared to vehicle treated animals. The exposure to dopaminergic stimulation during gestation may have altered the timing of development of afferent connections to the fetal SCN, resulting in alteration of the initial response of the circadian timing system to light.

AB  - In April 1994, an intervention campaign to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was established in the Tyrol. The campaign was intended to increase knowledge concerning risk factors for SIDS in the general community and to improve individual care for infants at risk. In contrast to interventional programmes in other federal states of Austria (i.e. Vorarlberg, Styria), this programme did not utilise polysomnography for identifying infants at risk A part of the intervention programme was the 'Styrian risk questionnaire', a standardised questionnaire concerning risk factors for SIDS. Individual instructions for health care of children at risk (risk score â¥ 7) were provided and, if necessary, subscription of home monitoring was performed at the outpatient department (SIDS out-patient service) of the Department of Paediatrics in Innsbruck and other paediatric departments throughout the Tyrol. The educational programme also included information concerning basic life support. Psychological support was offered to parents of SIDS infants. Risk factors for SIDS in the Tyrol before the campaign were assessed in a retrospective case-control study (time period 1984-1994; 99 SIDS infants, 136 controls). The risk of SIDS was markedly reduced when parents had detailed knowledge of the risk factors of SIDS (odds ratio (OR) 0.03; p<0.001), which emphasises the importance of information and educational programmes. The incidence of SIDS declined after the beginning of the intervention campaign from 1.83/1000 live births (average incidence from 1984-1994) to 0.4/1000 live births and remained at this level thereafter. Post-neonatal mortality also declined from 3.9 to 1.3/1000 live births. The prevalence of the prone sleeping position declined immediately after the campaign (53.7% vs. 5.4%, p<0.001), as did the frequency of maternal smoking during pregnancy (22.9% vs. 14.5%, p<0.01). Breast feeding became more popular. In all, the low-cost intervention programme in the Tyrol proved to be highly efficient in reducing the risk of SIDS and in maintaining this effect for several years.

AB  - Objective: To compare the outcome of induction of labor and patient's preferences using a protocol with the first dose of prostaglandin E2 endocervical gel in the evening versus a protocol with the first dose in the morning. Design: We performed a randomized trial comparing administration of prostaglandin E2 endocervical gel in the morning with administration of prostaglandin E2 gel in the evening, followed if necessary by a second dose being given after six hours if labor had not started or the cervix was still unripe. Formal induction of labor by amniotomy and oxytocin infusion was performed the morning after the initial prostaglandin E2 dose. Patients' preferences were assessed using a questionnaire that was completed after delivery. Setting: Tertiary care hospital in the Netherlands with 1600 deliveries per year. PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred and twenty-six women with viable singleton pregnancies at term who had induction of labor with prostaglandins. Main outcome measures: Time of delivery (daytime, evening or night) and patient's satisfaction. Results: Fifty-eight women were allocated for administration of gel in the morning, whereas 68 had their gel in the evening. Administration of gel in the evening did not significantly reduce delivery between 23.00 hours and 08.00 hours, although there was a reduction in delivery between 23.00 hours and 08.00 hours in nulliparae. None of the multiparous women delivered between 18.00 hours and 23.00 hours after induction of labor in the evening. The relative risk for delivery by vacuum or forceps was increased after allocation of gel in the evening (4.2; 95% confidence limits 1.4 to 13). Patients' preferences favored administration of gel in the morning. Conclusions: There was no benefit in starting induction of labor with prostaglandin E2 in the evening, compared with starting in the morning.

AB  - The neurohypophysial hormones oxytocin and vasopressin show daily rhythms of secretion with elevated hormone release during the hours of sleep. This pattern can be modulated by ovarian steroids and alters with age. The pattern appears to be due in part to the nocturnal increase in melatonin secretion, which stimulates hormone release in man, while being inhibitory in the rat. Pinealectomy alters both the 24 h pattern of neurohypophysial hormone release in the rat and the firing rate of magnocellular supraoptic nucleus neurones. There is also a reduced hormone release in response to hypovolaemia and raised plasma sodium concentration compared to sham operated animals, with a smaller increase in neuronal activity, as determined by immediate-early gene expression. The normal responses can be restored by nocturnal administration of melatonin. Melatonin also influences the neurohypophysial hormone response in the human to known stimuli of release, such as raised plasma osmolality, exercise and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Recent studies have revealed that not only does the release of vasopressin and oxytocin vary over each 24 h, but the respective renal and pregnant uterine responses also show diurnal variations.

AB  - Blattella bisignata (Brunner) and B. germanica (L.) are oviparous cockroaches with cyclic reproductive behaviour, but in B. germanica only males show circadian rhythmicity of locomotion at 28Â°C and DD (constant darkness). In B. bisignata, males and virgin females cockroaches entrained by light-dark cycles show free-running rhythmicity in DD, and most activities occur during the subjective night. Daily locomotor activities of virgin females show cyclic changes that coincided with ovarian development. Virgin females also exhibit calling behaviour during the subjective night, and this shows a free-running rhythm. Male mate-finding locomotion and female calling behaviour are under circadian control, so the timing for both behaviours is synchronized. However, most mated females do not show a locomotor free-running rhythm under DD conditions. Our results indicate that only mated females could not express a circadian locomotor rhythm. Pregnancy reduces a female's locomotory intensity and masks the expression of a circadian locomotor rhythm. We attribute the differences in circadian locomotory rhythms between these two species to their living environments and mate-finding strategies.

AB  - We examined the processes of cortical activation and deactivation of the fetal brain during spontaneous sleep state transitions and during central nervous processing of vibroacoustic stimulations (VASs) using nonlinear analysis of the electrocorticogram (ECoG). Tests of nonlinearity and a random shuffling routine revealed deterministic and nonlinear portions in the fetal ECoG. As common nonlinear measures are not applicable to nonstationary time series, we developed an algorithm to estimate the predictability of the ECoG in its time course by means of a point prediction error (PPE). The ECoG was recorded before and during VAS from the maternal abdominal surface in seven chronically instrumented fetal sheep at 0.8 of gestation. The PPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM sleep. VAS in NREM sleep resulted in an abrupt increase of the PPE not reaching the level of REM sleep. The steep increase of the PPE at onset and its slow decrease after cessation of the stimulus were very similar to the dynamics of spontaneous sleep state transitions, suggesting the involvement of the same cortical activating mechanisms. In conclusion, the stage and the time course of fetal brain activation and deactivation patterns can be clearly shown by PPE techniques. The PPE is a useful complement to spectral analysis. Both techniques describe different properties of the ECoG.

AB  - We have examined the effects of exposure to chronic maternal anemia, throughout the final one-third of gestation, on postnatal ventilatory and arousal responses to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia-hypercapnia in sleeping lambs. While resting quietly awake, lambs from anemic ewes had higher arterial PCO2 levels than control animals during the first 2-3 postnatal wk, but pH, arterial PO2, and arterial O2 saturation were not different. During active and quiet sleep lambs from anemic ewes had higher end-tidal CO2 levels than control animals when breathing room air and at the time of spontaneous arousal or when aroused by progressive hypercapnia or by combined hypoxia-hypercapnia. Ventilation and arterial O2 saturation during uninterrupted sleep and ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia (inspiratory O2 fraction, 10%), progressive hypercapnia, and combined hypoxia/hypercapnia were not significantly affected by exposure to maternal anemia. Our findings show that maternal anemia results in elevated PCO2 levels in the offspring. This effect may be due, at least in part, to altered pulmonary function.

AB  - To determine the influence of maternal smoking on autonomic nervous system in healthy infants, 36 infants were recorded polygraphically for one night. Their mothers were defined, according to their smoking frequency during pregnancy, as 'nonsmokers' (no cigarettes smoked during pregnancy) or 'smokers' (10 or more cigarettes per day). The infants had a median postnatal age of 10.5 wk (range 6 to 16 wk); 18 were born to nonsmokers, and 18 to smokers. During the whole night, spectral analyses of heart rate (HR) were evaluated as a function of sleep stages. Two major peaks were recognizable: a low-frequency component (LF) related to sympathetic and parasympathetic activities and a high-frequency component (HF) reflecting parasympathetic tonus. The ratio of LF/HF powers was calculated as an index of sympathovagal interaction. In REM sleep, 'smokers' infants were characterized by significantly lower HF powers and normalized HF powers, and higher LF/HF ratios than 'nonsmokers'. The finding did not reach statistical significance in NREM sleep. In conclusion, maternal smoking induced changes in autonomic control and maturation in infants. These effects of cigarette smoke exposure can be added to those already reported and offer additional evidence for counseling mothers to stop smoking.

AB  - The fetal biological clock is an endogenous clock capable of generating circadian rhythms and responding to maternal entraining signals. By at least the third trimester of pregnancy fetal diurnal rhythms are entrainable by maternal day-night rhythms. Maternal illness during pregnancy and premature birth are obvious clinical factors that may adversely affect circadian rhythm development. Premature birth of the fetus has a most dramatic impact on maternal fetal interactions. The effect on biorhythms appears to be temporary and is greatest on the most immature infants. The results to date support the importance of fetal circadian rhythms and the relative lack of these rhythms in the preterm infant. It is well known that growth and development in the prematurely born infant are influenced by a multitude of factors; clearly, the neonatal intensive care unit is not a surrogate for the maternal placental unit. This article reviews what is known about circadian development in the human infant with an emphasis on the unique circumstances of the preterm infant. The research on the short- and long-term effects of environmental interventions on circadian, sleep, and neurologic development is discussed. Although an earlier onset of circadian development did not result with cycled lighting in the neonatal nursery, there may still be important biological effects that have not been studied. There are sufficient data to state that there is no reason for continuing a chaotic, noncircadian environmental approach for the care of the prematurely born infant. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL, and MIRLYN. STUDY SELECTION: Selected studies from 1 969 to 1997 were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and information was organized under the following areas: definition of and the interconnection between circadian rhythm and blood pressure; the circadian variability of blood pressure throughout the trimesters; the patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancies defined as normal and those complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia; and clinical implications. DATA SYNTHESIS: The circadian rhythm of blood pressure in pregnancy is the same as in the non-pregnant state, with a nocturnal decrease, especially during sleep. In patients with chronic hypertension, the nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be steeper. Patients with mild preeclampsia may experience a less pronounced nocturnal decrease in blood pressure. Patients with severe preeclampsia may display a reversed circadian rhythm, with no decrease and/or an increase in nocturnal blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure during normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension and preeclampsia warrant consideration when monitoring patients and implementing management plans.

AB  - With the aim to describe the daily pattern of blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 1494 blood pressure series systematically sampled by ambulatory monitoring for 48 hours every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 124 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 55 with gestational hypertension, and 23 with a final diagnosis of preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group and trimester of gestation was established by population multiple-component analysis. A highly statistically significant circadian pattern represented by a linear model that includes components with periods of 24 and 12 hours is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for all groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P<0.001 in all cases). The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (always P<0.001). There is also a statistically significant difference in circadian amplitude (extent of daily change) of blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies in all trimesters (always P<0.004). Results further indicate similar circadian characteristics between women who later developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia in the first trimester of pregnancy. The difference between these 2 groups in circadian mean is statistically significant in the second trimester for systolic (P=0.022) but not for diastolic blood pressure (P=0.986). In the third trimester, the difference in circadian mean is highly statistically significant for both variables (P<0.001). The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy. Those highly significant differences are found when both systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological range of blood pressure variability. These differing changes in the circadian pattern of blood pressure with advancing gestational age between healthy and complicated pregnancies offer new end points that may lead to an early identification of hypertensive complications in pregnancy as well as to the establishment of prophylactic intervention.

AB  - Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were automatically monitored for 48 hours at 15-min intervals in 31 hospitalized pregnant women at low risk for BP disorder. Each of the recorded 56 data series for systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and heart rate (HR) was chronobiologically assessed. A rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR), 24-hour and harmonic amplitudes, 24-hour and harmonic acrophases were grouped by trimester of pregnancy and further subjected to analysis of variance. The repeatedly reported well-established lowering of BP MESOR was not detected in this particular sample, while, as anticipated, the HR MESOR increased statistically significantly in the course of pregnancy. Ultradian components, with a period from 1 to 12 hours and an amplitude higher than that of the 24-hour component, were found in 25% of the SAP data series recorded during the second and third trimesters. Such ultradian components were detected in only one of the 36 simultaneously recorded HR series. Analysis of the individual variability in the statistical endpoints, based on 9 women contributing records in each trimester of pregnancy, revealed in the course of pregnancy greater variability in circadian amplitude and acrophase than in the individual BP MESOR. Healthy pregnancy differentially affects the BP and HR chronomes. The reproducible individual BP MESOR, obtained by 48-hour monitoring at 15-min intervals in hospitalized pregnant women, may be useful in early diagnosis of gestational hypertension, but for detection of circadian hyper-amplitude-tension (CHAT), longer than 48-hour monitoring is needed.

AB  - In 9 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction, 24-hour fetal heart rate recordings were made before and after betamethasone treatment to study the influence of cortisol on diurnal fetal heart rate rhythms. Maternal and fetal rhythms were correlated and did not change after betamethasone administration. We conclude that diurnal fetal heart rate rhythms are synchronized by the mother through a mechanism other than adrenal control.

AB  - Objective: The gastrointestinal motility agents metoclopramide and domperidone are known to increase pituitary prolactin (PRL) secretion and breast milk production. This study compared the effect of single doses of two strengths of metoclopramide and a single dose of domperidone on PRL secretion. Methods: Ten nonpregnant women had baseline evaluation of serum PRL concentrations. The PRL concentrations were then determined after random oral administration of metoclopramide 10 mg, metoclopramide 5 mg, and domperidone 10 mg. Blood samples were drawn in the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle, at 13 time points over a 6-hour period (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes), with the zero time point beginning at 0800 hours. Variables such as weight, height, age, gravidity, parity, and oral contraceptive use were recorded. Results: Baseline PRL concentrations showed the natural circadian rhythm. Metoclopramide and domperidone both caused a significant increase in PRL. However, PRL secretion was most influenced by parity. Nulliparous women had the quickest and highest PRL secretion with metoclopramide 10 mg, compared with the PRL response with metoclopramide 5 mg and domperidone 10 mg. Conversely, multiparous women had PRL secretion patterns that were equivalent between the medications. Conclusions: The PRL response to the medications was most influenced by parity. Therefore, we suggest that the medication therapy of choice for enhancing lactation may not be the same in all women, but may instead be determined by parity.

AB  - We analyzed the perinatal outcome of 1,086 pregnancies classified according to the response to the 3-hour 100-gram glucose tolerance test and the diurnal glycemic profile into the Rudge groups corresponding to control pregnant women, class A gestational diabetic women, class A/B to FRH pregnant women and women with daily hyperglycemia. Despite treatment, the diabetic pregnant women and those with daily hyperglycemia presented higher mean blood glucose levels compared to controls (76.6 Â± 10.2 mg/dl). The pregnancies complicated by diabetes and by daily hyperglycemia were characterized by a high incidence of prematurity, macrosomia, large for gestational age newborn infants, malformation and fetal and neonatal death, with consequent perinatal mortality. The perinatal mortality of women with daily hyperglycemia was 10 times higher than that of the controls and was similar to that of the diabetic patients. These adverse perinatal results emphasize the need for the diagnosis and control of intrauterine hyperglycemia both in diabetic pregnant women and in women with an altered diurnal glycemic profile.

AB  - Objectives. This study used a large population-based data set (n = 619455) to establish reference standards of the timing of spontaneous vaginal births. Methods. Low-risk births in Massachusetts from 1989 to 1995 were studied. This group comprised 242276 births that met the following criteria singleton, vertex, vaginal births with a birthweight of between 2500 and 4000 g; gestation between 37 and 42 weeks; a 5-minute Apgar score greater than 6, and no induction or stimulation. Results. Low-risk births displayed a mild circadian pattern, with a peak between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM and a trough between 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM. Subgroup analysis showed no clear differences except for parity. Conclusions. Reference standards should be developed and used as comparative norms for hospital and practice-based perinatal studies of diurnal patterns of birthing.

AB  - Daily rhythmicity of renal blood flow (RBF)and urine flow (UF) was studied in fetal sheep between 121-125 d of gestation. Fetal arterial blood pressure, heart rate, UF, and right RBF were measured continuously for 24-h periods in 10 sheep. Rhythmic variations during a 24-h period were found for all variables studied. The rhythms of arterial blood pressure and heart rate were highly correlated, whereas an inverse correlation was found between arterial blood pressure with RBF and between arterial blood pressure with UF. These findings indicate that fetal RBF is not blood pressure dependent. Furthermore, fetal UF appears not to be mediated by pressure-dependent diuresis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The difference between night and day may be reinforced in young babies by offering a 'focal feed' between 10pm and midnight and gradually lengthening the intervals between night-time feeds by a variety of other activities (such as nappy changing, re-swaddling and walking with the infant). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of using a structured training programme to teach exclusively breastfed infants to sleep through the night by eight weeks old. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Acceptably controlled trials of a structured programme accentuating the difference between night and day compared with no intervention in first time parents of singleton babies, with mothers intending to exclusively breastfeed their infants for at least eight weeks post-partum. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: One trial involving 33 couples was included. More infants in the treatment group were sleeping throughout the night by eight weeks of age than in the control group (odds ratio 0.04, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.21). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence to show that first time parents using a structured sleeping programme can teach their babies to sleep through the night by eight weeks of age.

AB  - Objective: To examine the difference, if any, between midwives'care and obstetricians' care in the circadian pattern of the hour of birth in spontaneous labour and delivery. Design: A descriptive study comparing the circadian pattern of the hour of birth between women cared for by a midwife or an obstetrician. Setting: Data were derived from the Perinatal Database of the Netherlands (LVR), comprising 83% of all births under midwives' care and 75% of all births under obstetricians' care. Subjects: 57871 women receiving midwives' care and 31999 women receiving obstetricians' care with spontaneous labour and spontaneous delivery. Main outcome measures: Differences in the circadian rhythms beween women receiving midwives'care and obstetricians'care. Findings: There was a difference in the circadian pattern of the hour of birth between midwives' and obstetricians'care. Peak times differed 5.43 hours (Cl 4.23-7.03) for primiparous and 3.34 hours (Cl 3.00-4.08) for multiparous women between the midwives' group and the obstetricians'group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a remarkable difference in circadian pattern of the hour of birth between midwives' care and obstetricians' care. In obstetricians' care the duration of normal labour appears to be prolonged, presumably by an increased level of stress. In normal birth the care of midwives is preferable.

AB  - Objective: Elevated levels of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in women with preeclampsia may reflect endothelial damage and leukocyte activation. Urinary VCAM-1 excretion in normal pregnancies and those complicated by hypertension has not been studied. We studied the circadian pattern of VCAM-1 levels in the serum and urinary excretion of VCAM-1 in normal pregnancies and those complicated by hypertension and analyzed their relation with maternal blood pressure. Methods: Serum and urine samples were obtained at 1-hour and 2-hour intervals, respectively, over a 24-hour period from 10 normotensive and 10 hypertensive pregnant women. VCAM-1 levels were measured by ELISA. Blood pressure was recorded continuously over the 24-hour period. Results: Serum VCAM-1 levels and urinary VCAM-1 excretion were significantly higher in the hypertensive patients than in the controls (851 vs. 659 ng/ml and 62.0 vs. 29.4 pg/min, respectively; P < 0.01). Serum VCAM-1 levels did not show a circadian pattern. In contrast, urinary excretion of VCAM-1 showed a circadian pattern in both groups with a maximum in the daytime hours. There was no correlation with circadian blood pressure variations. Conclusion: Urinary excretion of VCAM-1 shows a circadian pattern in both normotensive and hypertensive pregnancies. Urinary excretion is independent of the serum levels of VCAM-1, which remain stable, and of blood pressure. This suggests intrinsic renal endothelial dysfunction in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.

AB  - Objectives: To determine whether the diurnal blood pressure profile in pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) differs from that in normal pregnant controls, and, if so, to establish whether such a difference is accompanied by altered diurnal rhythms of fetal heart rate (FHR) and its variation. Methods: Ten IDDM patients at 30-38 weeks of gestation were enrolled in the study. Four of them were hypertensive. Eleven healthy pregnant volunteers at 30-36 weeks of gestation served as controls. Maternal systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures and heart rate (MHR) were determined automatically at 30-min intervals during a period of 26 h, starting at 09.00. During the study period, nine 1-h recordings of FHR were made at predetermined timepoints. FHR was analyzed numerically. Cubic spline models were used to describe diurnal rhythmicity of maternal blood pressure and heart rate in each individual. Results: Diurnal patterns were found for SBP, DBP and MHR, with highest values during the day and a trough during the night in all women. Daytime and night-time DBP were higher in the diabetic women (p < 0.01), but the day-night drop in DBP was blunted as compared with the controls (p < 0.05). The day-night drop in blood pressure was inversely related to the duration of IDDM (r = -0.68 for SBP, r = -0.58 for DBP; p < 0.05), but not to the presence of hypertension. Diurnal rhythms of FHR and its long-term and short-term variations did not differ between the diabetic and control groups. Conclusion: In pregnant diabetic women, blunting of the diurnal blood pressure profile was demonstrated which could not be attributed to hypertension, but was significantly related to the duration of IDDM. The altered maternal hemodynamics was not associated with changes in FHR parameters.

AB  - Objective: To describe the time of onset of contractions which result in preterm delivery to investigate if there is a diurnal influence. Design: The admission register for the neonatal unit was used to identify admissions for prematurity over a three-year period. Obstetric case records were then reviewed to obtain the recorded time of onset of contractions when delivery was preceded by spontaneous labour. Setting: A maternity hospital in the United Kingdom. Main outcome measures: The time of onset of spontaneous contractions which result in preterm labour and delivery. Results: Four hundred and twenty-five women in preterm labour were studied. A significant diurnal rhythm in the timing of onset of contractions was noted with 42% of deliveries occurring in labour which commenced between midnight and 0600 hours. Subgroup analysis indicated that there was a significant rhythm in second trimester preterm labours, male and female babies and that this rhythm was present during both the winter and summer months. Conclusion: The periodicity of preterm labour onset demonstrates a rhythm which is similar to the rhythm in the onset of labour at term. Preterm labour most commonly begins between midnight and 0600 hours.

AB  - We validated the use of urine to monitor changes in the activity of both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in swine. Ten pregnant sows were fitted with venous catheters 3 wk after mating. In the early (wk 6), middle (wk 9), and late (wk 14) stages of gestation, blood and urine were collected over 24 h to monitor diurnal changes in plasma cortisol, urinary cortisol, and urinary catecholamines (norepinephrine [NE] and epinephrine [EPI]). Dexamethasone suppression tests (DST) and ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) challenge tests were also performed at each stage of gestation. All plasma and urinary values changed markedly around the clock. Diurnal variations of urinary cortisol were comparable to those in plasma, with a late nocturnal peak and a trough occurring in the evening. During the dark period, urinary catecholamines were lower than during the light period. Norepinephrine increased sharply after lights came on and peaked after meal time. Epinephrine began to rise at the end of the dark period and peaked just before meal time. Average plasma cortisol increased with the stage of gestation, due to higher levels during daylight hours. Dexamethasone at 2000 (20 Î¼g/kg i.v.) decreased plasma cortisol at 0830 and nocturnal cortisol excretion. The magnitude of the decrease in plasma ACTH and urinary cortisol after DST was lower in late than in early and midgestation, indicating increased feedback resistance at that stage. The CRH (1 Î¼g/kg i.v.) increased plasma and urinary cortisol. Peak levels occurred 30 min and 2 to 3 h after the injection, respectively. Catecholamines and cortisol in urine produced during the night (2000 to 0800) and the early morning (0400 to 0800 and 0800 to 0900) were highly correlated with their 24-h excretion rate. These results indicate that it is possible to monitor changes in the HPA axis and SNS activity through urinary measurements in pigs.

AB  - Leptin is a 16-kDa adipocyte-secreted protein the serum levels of which reflect mainly the amount of energy stores but are also influenced by short-term energy imbalance as well as several cytokines and hormones. Leptin, by binding to specific receptors, alters the expression of several hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate neuroendocrine function as well as energy intake and expenditure. More specifically, accumulating evidence suggests that this hormone may serve to signal to the brain information on the critical amount of fat stores that are necessary for LHRH secretion and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Rising leptin levels have been associated with initiation of puberty in animals and humans and normal leptin levels are needed for maintenance of menstrual cycles and normal reproductive function. Moreover, circadian and ultradian variations of leptin levels are associated with minute to minute variations of LH and estradiol in normal women. Falling leptin levels in response to starvation result in decreased estradiol levels and amenorrhea in subjects with anorexia nervosa or strenuously exercising athletes. In addition, leptin has a potentially important role during pregnancy and in the physiology of the neonate. Finally, recent evidence suggests that leptin may influence ovarian steroidogenesis directly, but the exact role of intraovarian leptin action in the physiology and pathophysiology of the human reproductive system needs to be further elucidated.

AB  - The present study tested the hypothesis that acute treatment with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) impairs fertility, disrupts the nocturnal melatonin rhythm, and suppresses lymphocyte function. Adult Siberian hamsters administered 2 or 100 Î¼g TCDD/kg body weight/0.2 ml sesame oil had a delayed latency to first litter and an increased adult mortality compared to hamsters given 0.1 Î¼g/kg or vehicle. Within 75 days of TCDD treatment, full reproductive capabilities were achieved. Moreover, the nocturnal melatonin rhythm was not disrupted in adults administered TCDD or in their progeny. Lymphocyte activity varied with respect to time of day and treatment. Lymphocyte proliferation was enhanced at night irrespective of TCDD treatment; during the day, 2 wk after the 2-Î¼g/kg treatment, blastogenesis was reduced compared to that in the 0.1-Î¼g/kg group or in vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, TCDD did not affect the mixed lymphocyte reaction in response to allogeneic antigen when assessed at 2 and 20 wk post-treatment. Thus, findings indicate that TCDD produced acute effects on fertility, mortality, and systemic lymphocyte proliferation, but long-lasting effects on specific aspects of reproductive, neuroendocrine, and immune cell functions were not observed.

AB  - During pregnancy, placenta-derived CRH increases exponentially in the plasma. Circulating levels of CRH-binding protein decrease considerably in the last trimester of pregnancy, resulting in further elevation of bioavailable plasma CRH. The adrenal glands during pregnancy gradually become hypertrophic because of the increase in ACTH, which parallels that of CRH. Thus, pregnancy is a transient period of relative hypercortisolism. The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy has been proposed to function as a biological clock. In this model, the placenta is perceived as a stress-sensitive organ and placental CRH as a timing starter, determining a preterm, term, or postterm labor. During pregnancy, as well as during the immediate postpartum period, the hypothalamic maternal CRH secretion is suppressed, because of the circulating levels of cortisol. Hypothalamic CRH secretion normalizes within 12 weeks. This transient postpartum maternal hypothalamic CRH suppression, together with the steroid withdrawal that follows parturition, might be causally related to the mood disorders and the vulnerability to autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis often observed during the postpartum period.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess sleep patterns and prevalence of sleep disturbances during pregnancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design; prospective questionnaire. SETTING: Outpatient, private obstetric clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 127 consecutive patients, with women evaluated at one of four points in pregnancy, 8-12 weeks (n = 37), 18-22 weeks (n = 28), 25-28 weeks (n = 24), and 35-38 weeks (n = 38). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Questionnaire of sleep habits and sleep disturbances. RESULTS: A large percentage of the women experienced sleep disturbances during pregnancy, These problems included frequent night wakings, difficulty falling asleep, and symptoms of sleep apnea. Few differences in sleep patterns were found across pregnancy, although women were found to sleep more and nap more by the end of pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy, especially late in pregnancy.

AB  - We investigated the long-term influence of early dietary NaCl on adult mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), assessed continuously for 7 weeks when fed water and chow containing 1% NaCl (weeks 1, 4, 7), 0% NaCl (weeks 2-3), and 3% NaCl (weeks 5-6) while on a 12:12 light/dark cycle. Subjects were offspring of female Sprague-Dawley rats fed solid chow consisting of either 0.1% (basal), 1% (intermediate), or 3% (high) NaCl throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning on postnatal day (PD) 21, offspring were fed the same NaCl diet of their mother until PD 30, at which time all offspring were given Purina 5001 diet (1% NaCl) as their solid chow. On PD 60, 22 adult male offspring (eight basals, six intermediates, eight highs) were implanted with an aortic electronic sensor for transmitting blood-pressure signals by telemetry. MAP and HR varied significantly across the 7-week testing period in association with dietary NaCl levels. The three perinatal salt groups had similar HR levels on normal 1% NaCl chow. However, HR increased in all groups during 0% NaCl and decreased in all groups during 3% NaCl. In contrast, the average MAP levels were significantly greater in the highs compared to both the intermediate and basal groups during both dark and light periods. MAP increased in high and basal groups during both 0% and 3%; however, the increase was more pronounced in the highs. In conclusion, exposure to high levels of dietary NaCl early in development led to a persistent increase in MAP in adulthood. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I, IGF-II) circulate in biological fluids bound to six different IGF-binding proteins that regulate IGF bioactivity. The IGF-binding protein-2 is regulated by growth hormones, and its concentration depends on nutrition and physiological state. Specific antibodies directed against bovine IGF-binding protein-2 were produced, and IGF-binding protein-2 levels in bovine blood samples were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Parallel displacement curves showed strong cross-reactivity with bovine and ovine plasma, were low with porcine plasma, and no cross-reactivity with rat or chicken plasma. Addition of IGF-I or -II to a control pool of bovine plasma did not significantly alter control IGF-binding protein-2 values in a radioimmunoassay. Six nycthemeral periods, determined for three young bulls bled on two occasions, showed that IGF-binding protein-2 plasma levels were stable throughout the day; two or three samples were sufficient to characterize the animal. Cows treated with recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) had significantly lower serum levels of IGF-binding protein-2 than did control cows. Furthermore, IGF-binding protein-2 levels were dramatically increased at the onset of lactation. This radioimmunoassay for bovine IGF-binding protein-2, which enables quantitative assessment of IGF-binding protein-2 concentration in cattle, confirmed that IGF-binding protein-2 concentrations are depressed by administration of bST, enhanced after calving, and showed absence of diurnal variation.

AB  - Prolactin is a protein hormone of the anterior pituitary gland that was originally named for its ability to promote lactation in response to the suckling stimulus of hungry young mammals. We now know that prolactin is not as simple as originally described. Indeed, chemically, prolactin appears in a multiplicity of posttranslational forms ranging from size variants to chemical modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation. It is not only synthesized in the pituitary gland, as originally described, but also within the central nervous system, the immune system, the uterus and its associated tissues of conception, and even the mammary gland itself. Moreover, its biological actions are not limited solely to reproduction because it has been shown to control a variety of behaviors and even play a role in homeostasis. Prolactin-releasing stimuli not only include the nursing stimulus, but light, audition, olfaction, and stress can serve a stimulatory role. Finally, although it is well known that dopamine of hypothalamic origin provides inhibitory control over the secretion of prolactin, other factors within the brain, pituitary gland, and peripheral organs have been shown to inhibit or stimulate prolactin secretion as well. It is the purpose of this review to provide a comprehensive survey of our current understanding of prolactin's function and its regulation and to expose some of the controversies still existing.

AB  - Objective: To describe changes in women's sleep patterns from prepregnancy to postpartum.Methods: Polysomnography was done in women's homes for 2 consecutive nights. Forty-five women were studied during the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles, and 33 conceived and were studied during each trimester of pregnancy. Twenty-nine were studied at 1 and 3 months postpartum.Results: Compared with prepregnant sleep characteristics, significant changes in sleep patterns were evident by 11-12 weeks' gestation, with a significant increase in total sleep time but less deep sleep and more awakening during sleep. By the third month postpartum, there was improvement in sleep characteristics; however, sleep efficiency remained significantly lower than baseline prepregnancy values.Conclusion: Sleep disturbance was greatest during the first postpartum month, particularly for first-time mothers.

AB  - To determine whether gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in culture without the hypothalamus secrete GnRH in a pulsatile fashion, the nasal placode (NAP) was obtained at day 13.5 of gestation and cultured by a roller tube method. If the GnRH release occurs in a pulsatile fashion, it can be said that the pulse generator of GnRH exists inherently in each cell or community of cells in the culture. The concentration of GnRH in the NAP culture medium collected at 8-min intervals for 160 min after 2- to 4-week cultures showed that GnRH release occurred in a pulsatile fashion with a mean interpulse interval of 29.8 Â± 2.3 min (n = 9). When the NAP was cultured with tissues of the forebrain vesicle (n = 3) or the hypothalamus (n = 4), GnRH was also released in a pulsatile fashion with similar intervals (27.3 Â± 1.0 min for the NAP+forebrain vesicle culture and 36.0 Â± 6.3 min for the NAP+hypothalamus culture) as those in cultures without brain tissues. It is concluded that pulsatile GnRH release is an inherent function of GnRH neurons. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of devazepide (DEV), a cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist, which crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and prevents the development of a preferential relationship with the dam, and compare it to that of 2-NAP, which acts peripherally. At birth, lambs received either an intraperitoneal injection of saline (CTL), DEV (0.1 mg/kg), or 2-NAP (0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg). No major side effects were observed after the injection, however, there was a trend for lambs receiving CCK-A antagonists to be more vocal in the first 2 h and to loose more weight between birth and 3 h. When tested in a two-choice test situations at 24 h of age, the latency to reach a ewe and the total time spent next to them were not affected by the treatments. On the other hand, unlike CTLs, lambs receiving DEV or 0.1 mg of 2-NAP did not spend significantly more time near their dam than near the alien ewe. 2-NAP had no effect at 0.01 mg/kg, but at 1 mg/kg, it improved the preference score. There was no relationship between preference scores and the variations in weight recorded during the neonatal period. The effects of DEV, but not those of 2-NAP, persisted at 48 h of age. Thus, these results support the hypothesis that peripheral CCK receptors are involved in the development of a preference for the mother, but the effects differ according to the amount of 2-NAP that the lambs receive.

AB  - Several studies attempted to evaluate the predictive value or the associated risk of several factors only on generic sleep disorders and mainly night-wakings. Aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of biological and historical and clinical factors on the different aspect of sleep behavior and disturbances evaluated by the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children. Mothers of 1157 children (583 M, 574 F) aged 6.5 to 15.3 years (mean 9.8) completed the SDSC together with a questionnaire on demographic data about family composition, parent's education and professional activities, as well as clinical data about pregnancy, delivery and medical history of the child with specific questions regarding pathologies that could affect sleep; sleep habits of parents and children were also investigated. Global sleep disturbances measured as SDSC total score were affected by co sleeping, early sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis, asthma and parents' sleep disorders. Early sleep disorders, asthma and parents' sleep disorders had a significant main effect on disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Sleep breathing disorders score was associated with the presence of cosleeping, adenotonsillitis, asthma, food allergy. Disorders of Arousal score was affected by early sleep disorders and parents' sleep disorders. There was a significant main effect of co-sleeping, early sleep disorder, adenotonsillitis, parents' sleep disorder on sleep-wake transition disorders score; of gender, parents' sleep disorder on Disorders of excessive somnolence score and of gender, early sleep disorder and parents' sleep disorder on Sleep hyperhydrosis score. Post-hoc comparisons showed that females vs. males have higher scores in Disorders of excessive somnolence score while males scored higher in Sleep hyperhydrosis score. A visual generalized model revealed that predictors for Total SDSC score are early sleep disorders, parents' sleep disorders, adenotonsillitis and asthma. Our results underline the role of genetic and neurobiological substrate on the development of children sleep, delineating the areas of the sleep that are involved and rising some suggestions on which factors could lead to different later sleep disturbances.

AB  - This study compared the perceptions of body image and psychological well-being between exercising and non-exercising pregnant women. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted with 65 nulliparous women (mean age years = 30.3, range = 23-39) who were allocated to 2 groups based on level of recreational exercise participation; 25 exercisers were compared with 18 non-exercisers. A self-report exercise history questionnaire and a 10 item Body Cathexis Scale were completed on two occasions during the pregnancy, at approximately 17 weeks and 30 weeks of gestation. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was administered in late pregnancy. There was a significant difference between the exercise group and the non-exercise group in late pregnancy for some items on the Body Cathexis Scale. The exercise group had a lower level of probable caseness on the GHQ-28 with reduced frequency of somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, and a higher level of psychological well-being.

AB  - This longitudinal study examined the popular belief that cognitive performance is impaired during pregnancy. Both self-report and objective test data on cognitive performance were collected on six occasions from three groups of women at three monthly intervals. Ten women who initially planned a pregnancy, 18 women initially in the first trimester of pregnancy, and 24 non pregnant controls completed the study. At each data collection participants reported their perceptions of current everyday memory, sleep, health, exercise, depression, anxiety and stress levels, and undertook a set of cognitive tests examining vocabulary, reasoning, short term memory, working memory, and semantic memory. A personality test was taken once. The planning group showed a significant increase in reported forgetting during pregnancy, and significantly more variability in sleep patterns than the control group over the test period. However, there were no other differences between groups on self-report or objective test results at any time phase. The personality factor of conscientiousness and level of reported anxiety were significant predictors of reported absentmindedness and forgetting on errands. The reported increase in forgetting in some pregnant women is possibly related to a complex interaction of personality and particular life situations. However, the precise nature of any objective change in memory performance during pregnancy is not yet clear.

AB  - The 1998 Women and Sleep Poll sponsored by the National Sleep Foundation demonstrated the prevalence of sleep problems in American women. Specifically, more than 73% of premenopausal women have sleep complaints; 56% of postmenopausal women report insomnia. In addition to insomnia, women are faced with other sleep problems associated with menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, as well as medical disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless-legs syndrome, and periodic limb movement disorder. The sleepiness associated with these conditions must be separated from the classic inherited condition, narcolepsy. This review will center on the predominant sleep complaints encountered by ob/gyns. An approach to evaluation, management, and referral will be presented. A review of simple patient questionnaires, validated behavioral protocols, and medications that can be included in a busy office or hospital practice are included. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

The Medical Resonance Therapy Music (MRT-Music) of the German classical composer and musicologist Peter Huebner is built on this concept of Pythagorean music medicine. Its therapeutic effect may be best explained by the natural phenomenon of resonance between the harmony laws of the microcosm of music and the biological laws of the body. Results received after application of MRT-Music indicate multiple positive effects on the organism of pregnant women both with a healthy pregnancy as with a pathologic one, reducing the rate of premature births very effectively. Furthermore, MRT-Music came out to be an effective method in the complex therapy of late gestoses and a nearly irreplaceable method for preoperative preparation of pregnant woman for caesarean section. It demonstrated a powerful anti-stress effect and allowed to reduce the amount of administered pain-killers to pregnant women by the factor 1.5 to 2.0, thus reducing the negative pharmacological load to the foetus. It furthermore reduced labour time and shortened hospital stay. It helped to create optimal conditions for the course of pregnancy and heightened pain sensitivity threshold by means of improving the functional, hormonal, and psycho-emotional conditions of pregnant and lying-in women. Thus, the labour process became more natural, the delivery non-traumatic, and motherhood more happy and safe.

AB  - Study objective: Our purpose was to study the relationship between snoring and pregnancy-induced hypertension and growth retardation of the fetus. Design: Retrospective, cross-sectional, consecutive case series. Setting: The Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Umea, Sweden. Participants and measurements: On the day of delivery, 502 women with singleton pregnancies completed a questionnaire about snoring, witnessed sleep apneas, and daytime fatigue. Data concerning medical complications were taken from the women's casebooks. Results: During the last week of pregnancy, 23% of the women reported snoring every night. Only 4% reported snoring before becoming pregnant. Hypertension developed in 14% of snoring women, compared with 6% of nonsnorers (p < 0.01). Preeclampsia occurred in 10% of snorers, compared with 4% of nonsnorers (p < 0.05). An Apgar score â¤ 7 was more common in infants born to habitual snorers. Growth retardation of the fetus, defined as small for gestational age at birth, had occurred in 7.1% of the infants of snoring mothers and 2.6% of the remaining infants (p < 0.05). Habitual snoring was independently predictive of hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.03; p < 0.05) and growth retardation (OR, 3.45; p < 0.01) in a logistic regression analysis controlling for weight, age, and smoking. Conclusions: Snoring is common in pregnancy and is a sign of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Snoring indicates a risk of growth retardation of the fetus.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has many consequences. There is an independent association between OSA and hypertension. The Sleep Heart Health Study reported that hypertension prevalence increased as sleep disordered breathing severity increased. The Nurses' Health Study noted an age-adjusted relative risk of cardiovascular events of 1.46 for occasional snorers and 2.02 for regular snorers, and a risk of stroke of 1.60 for occasional snorers and 1.88 for regular snorers. Sleep apnea is also associated with pulmonary hypertension, neurocognitive effects, depressed quality of life, motor vehicle accidents, awakening headache, childhood growth interruption, pregnancy-induced hypertension, fetal growth retardation, and disruption of the patients' bed-partners' sleep quality. Further research will examine the possibility of causality, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and outcomes of therapeutic interventions for OSA on the many consequences of OSA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: More than a third of women experience back pain during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review was to assess the effects of preventive interventions and treatments for backache in pregnancy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of any treatment to reduce the incidence or severity of back pain in pregnancy, or to prevent back pain arising in pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: One trial of 109 women was included. This cross-over trial compared the use of a special shaped pillow to fit under the woman's abdomen (Ozzlo pillow) with a standard pillow. Women experienced less pain in the week when they used the Ozzlo pillow than in the week with the standard pillow (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.58). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Specially shaped pillows appear to help reduce back pain in late pregnancy and improve sleep.

AB  - Background: There is a need to identify, as early as possible, infants who are at risk for long-term neurological morbidity. Methods: To predict neurodevelopment outcome of preterm infants <30 weeks' gestation in a population of 100 infants, we used several neonatal and neurobehavioral tests, including cranial ultrasonography, the Prechtl neurological test, quality of spontaneous general movements, and quality of sleep-wake organization. Results: The Prechtl test at corrected term age and findings on cranial sonograms both had high specificity, but the Prechtl test had better overall positive predictive power for normal neurological and developmental outcomes at 2 years' corrected age. Developmental changes in sleep and the amount of indeterminate sleep did not correlate with outcome. Scoring general movement quality did not predict outcome and did not augment the positive predictive power of the Prechtl test. Conclusions: The Prechtl test at corrected term age (independent of the other tests) is the best positive predictor of normal neurological outcome and Bayley test results at 2 years' corrected age.

AB  - Adverse perinatal events affecting cerebral functions are a major cause of neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term neurologic deficit. Intrapartum fetal EEG, which records fetal brain electrical activity, provides a monitoring modality for evaluating the fetal CNS during labor. In this study, we describe a new approach to such monitoring that is based on real-time spectral analysis of the fetal EEG during labor. Fourteen pregnant women with uncomplicated term pregnancies who went into labor participated in the study. Two suction-cup electrodes were applied to the fetal scalp at the occipitoparietal or parietal region after rupture of membranes. Real-time spectral analysis was used to determine the frequency and amplitude of the fetal EEG signal. The spectral edge frequency (SEF) was calculated as the frequency below which 90% of the power in the power spectrum resides. The average EEG amplitude and the SEF were displayed using the density spectral array technique. Fetal heart rate and intrauterine pressure were also measured. Two fundamental EEG patterns were identified: high-voltage slow activity and low-voltage fast activity. The SEF was found to be an excellent index of cyclic EEG activity. Fetal heart rate demonstrated increased variability and an elevated baseline during low-voltage fast activity, whereas both parameters decreased during high-voltage slow activity. During episodes of variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate, a decrease in the SEF was observed, accompanied by an increased EEG voltage. The results obtained substantiate the presence of sleep cycles in the human fetus. This kind of cortical activity monitoring may enable rapid alertness to cerebral hypoxia and allow for prompt intervention, thereby decreasing the risk for birth asphyxia and subsequent brain damage.

AB  - Objective: Ultrasound studies of hourly urine production rate in human fetuses have suggested that a fall in urine production occurs in state 2F (fetal quiet sleep) secondary to a state-dependent decrease in renal blood flow. We sought to ascertain the relationship between fetal hourly urine production rate and behavioral state in the near-term ovine fetus, a model in which urine production and fetal brain activity can be directly measured. Methods: Six ewes with singleton pregnancies were prepared with vascular and amniotic fluid catheters. Fetuses were prepared with hindlimb vascular catheters, a bladder catheter, and biparietal ECoG electrodes. After at least 5 days of recovery (ga 130 Â± 2 days; term = 145-150 days), each animal was monitored for a 6-h period. Urine production was measured by draining the bladder catheter through a drop counter and fetal ECoG was continuously recorded (sampling rate of 50 Hz). ECoG activity was analyzed using power spectral analysis and periods of active and quiet sleep identified using both signal amplitude and corresponding 85% spectral edge frequency. Results: Basal fetal arterial pH (7.36 Â± 0.01), pO2 (22.0 Â± 1.2 mmHg) and pCO2 (47.0 Â± 1.6 mmHg) and plasma (295 Â± 2 mOsm/kg) and urine (179 Â± 3 mOsm/kg) osmolalities were within normal ranges. Active and quiet sleep comprised 50 Â± 2 and 43 Â± 1% time, respectively. There was no difference in hourly urine production rate in active sleep (21.4 Â± 9.7 ml/h) and quiet sleep (18.8 Â± 7.7 ml/h). Conclusions: 1) Hourly fetal urine production rate is independent of ECoG activity state in the near-term ovine fetus. 2) Assuming only minor species differences, ultrasound measurement of human fetal hourly urine production rate can be performed without concern for fetal neurobehavioral state changes.

AB  - The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome has been found to be consistently higher in preterm and low birth weight infants than in infants born at term. Failure to arouse from sleep is one possible mechanism for sudden infant death syndrome. This study compared the arousal responses to nasal air-jet stimulation in a longitudinal study between groups of healthy preterm and term infants. Preterm infants (n= 9) were born at 3135 wk gestation with normal birth weights for gestational age and studied on three occasions: a preterm study at 36 wk, at 23 wk post-term, and at 23 mo post-term. Term infants (n= 22) were born at 3742 wk and were studied at 23 wk and 23 mo post-term. Arousal thresholds were determined in both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). In preterm infants, there was no state-related difference in arousal thresholds at either the 36 wk or 23 wk study; however, at 23 mo, arousal threshold was significantly greater in QS than AS (pâ 0.05). In contrast, in term infants, arousal thresholds were significantly elevated in QS compared with AS at both 23 wk and 23 mo (pâ 0.001). Arousal thresholds in AS were not different between the two groups of infants, with both groups of infants remaining readily arousable. However, in QS at 23 mo, arousal thresholds were significantly lower in the preterm infants (pâ 0.05). This study has demonstrated that arousability is altered by gestational and postnatal age. The lower arousability that characterizes QS in term infants regardless of age is not evident in preterm infants until 23 mo post-term age.Â© International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 2000.

AB  - Purpose: To elucidate further the maturation of voiding habits from gestation to infancy we investigated the free voiding pattern of healthy preterm neonates. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 11 male and 8 female healthy preterm newborns at a mean of 32 weeks after cessation of menstrual flow (postmenstrual age). Assessment was done in the neonatal ward using 4- hour voiding observation, a method described previously in studies of free voiding pattern of full-term newborns. Results: The voiding pattern of male and female preterm neonates was characterized by 1 void per hour and a mean voided volume of 53% of bladder capacity with 58% frequency of interrupted voiding. Residual urine was increased but varied during observation (mean 11% bladder capacity) and was 0 after at least 1 void during 4 hours in 14 of the 19 subjects. Two-thirds of all voiding occurred during sleep, whereas a third of the newborns showed signs of arousal with a mean awake time of only 17 minutes. Conclusions: The voiding pattern of preterm versus full-term subjects is characterized by an increased number of interrupted voidings, further indicating that these voidings represent immature behavior of detrusor-sphincter coordination. Also, the high number of voidings during sleep suggest a more immature pattern for preterm newborns.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effects of external light stimulation on fetal behavioral states and know the difference from those of vibroacoustic stimulation. Methods: A flashlight and a vibroacoustic stimulator was applied directly on the maternal abdomen to determine the response of 56 normal fetuses at 36-40 weeks gestation. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and body movements were recorded using an actocardiograph, and fetal eye movements were observed using real-time ultrasonography. Using Nijhuis's criteria, the fetal behavioral states (1F-4F) were determined. FHR acceleration was considered a fetal response to the stimulations. Results: The lag time between stimulation and fetal response was within 4 s. A positive response rate to the light stimulation was higher at behavioral states 2F (82%) and 3F (83%) than at state 1F (4%). Light stimulation changed the behavioral state of two of the six 3F fetuses (33%) from 3F to 4F. No change of state was observed in fetuses that were in states 1F and 2F. For vibroacoustic stimulation, fetal response was 100% positive and changes of states were observed frequently irrespective of the behavioral state before the stimulation. Conclusion: Fetal response to light stimulation is closely connected to fetal behavioral states and may reflect some distinct stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle.

AB  - This study eval uated the impact of certain Emergency Physician (EP) conditions on hiring decisions by fellow EPs. An anonymous survey asked 255 Pennsylvania EPs to rate the likelihood of their voting to offer a position in each of six scenarios. Three scenarios consisted of EPs unable to work regular shifts because of periodic migraines, a sleep disorder, and periodic difficulty handling stress. The other scenarios involved an EP with a probable future pregnancy, a recovered alcoholic, and a healthy HIV-positive physician. Most respondents said they were unlikely to recommend hiring colleagues who disclose a disorder restricting their availability for regular shifts. EPs were generally tolerant of recovered alcoholics and plans for pregnancy leave, but nearly half had significant reservations regarding hiring HIV-positive peers. An understanding of which conditions negatively impact an EP's ability to obtain employment in Emergency Medicine may be useful in emergency medicine career counseling or in the process of obtaining disability coverage.

AB  - Phylogenetically prolactin is an old hormone that plays an important role in the physiology of fishes and reptiles as well as mammals. In humans, prolactin levels normally increase during sleep, pregnancy and lactation. Causes of abnormal hyperprolactinemia include exogenous factors, drugs and pituitary tumors. Functional hyperprolactinemia can result from central mechanisms interfering with dopamin metabolism. The most common symptom is impaired reproductive function. Prolactin secretion by the pituitary gland is regulated mainly through the inhibitory effect of dopamin. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia should be directed to the underlying disorder, if known. Most cases are treated with dopamin agonists. Patients with prolactinomas that do not repond to medical treatment will require surgery or radiotherapy. During pregnancy, prolactinomas can increase in size but most will respond to medical therapy.

AB  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS or cot death) was the major cause of post-neonatal infant death in many countries in the late 1970s and 1980s. There is now very strong evidence that public intervention campaigns targeting the prone sleeping position, which had been identified by epidemiological studies as a major risk factor, were followed by substantial falls in the rate of SIDS. In the present review we discuss the evidence on which current recommendations for the prevention of SIDS are based. The prone sleeping position is now clearly causally associated with SIDS. Further reductions in SIDS may be produced by recommending the back sleeping position as opposed to the side position. Maternal smoking in pregnancy and bed sharing by infants of mothers who smoke are also strongly associated with SIDS, but have been harder to influence. Paternal smoking has also been implicated, although the magnitude of the reported risk is small. Finally, breastfeeding, pacifier use and having the infant sharing the parents bedroom, but not the bed, may also reduce risk. Continued reductions in SIDS mortality will require innovative public health education to target these major risk factors, while building on the 'back to sleep' approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is the subjective complaint of poor sleep or an inadequate amount of sleep that adversely affects daily functioning. For the past 4 decades, treatment of insomnia has shifted away from the use of barbiturates toward the use of hypnotic agents of the benzodiazepine class. However, problems associated with the latter (eg, next-day sedation, rebound insomnia, dependence, and tolerance) have prompted development of other agents. OBJECTIVE: This review describes the recently approved nonbenzodiazepine agent, zaleplon. METHODS: Studies of zaleplon were identified through a search of English-language articles listed in MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, with no limitation on year. These were supplemented by educational materials from conferences. RESULTS: The efficacy and tolerability of zaleplon have been documented in the literature. Zaleplon has been shown to improve sleep variables in comparison with placebo. Like most hypnotic agents, zaleplon can be used for problems of sleep initiation at the beginning of the night, but its short duration of clinical effect may also allow patients to take it later in the night without residual effects the next morning. Zaleplon can be taken < or = 2 hours before awakening without "hangover" effects. It is generally well tolerated, with headache being the most commonly reported adverse event in clinical trials (15%-18%). Compared with flurazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agent, zaleplon causes significantly less psychomotor and cognitive impairment (P < 0.001). Zaleplon has not been studied in pregnant women or children. The dose of zaleplon should be individualized; the recommended daily dose for most adults is 10 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia has a substantial impact on daily functioning. If pharmacologic treatment is indicated for insomnia, the choice of an agent should be guided by individual patient characteristics.

AB  - Objective. Little is known about the neurophysiologic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use. The aim of this study, designed to overcome methodologic limitations of previous research, was to investigate the effects of prenatal cocaine use on electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep patterns, a marker of central nervous system development. Methods. In a longitudinal study of prenatal cocaine/crack exposure, women were interviewed at the end of each trimester about cocaine, crack, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use. Two-hour paper- and computer-generated EEG sleep recordings were obtained on a sample of the full-term infants on the second day of life and at 1 year postpartum. Eligible newborns were fullterm, had received no general anesthesia, and had a 5-minute Apgar score >5. All infants whose mothers used one or more lines of cocaine during their first trimester or any crack (n = 37) were selected. A comparison group was chosen randomly from the group of women who did not use cocaine or crack during their pregnancy (n = 34). Results. Women who used cocaine/crack during the first trimester were older, less educated, less likely to be working, and used more tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs than women who did not use cocaine/crack during the first trimester. There were no differences in infant birth weight, length, head circumference, or gestational age between the two exposure groups. After controlling for the significant covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was associated with less well developed spectral correlations between homologous brain regions at birth, and with lower spectral EEG power values at 1 year of age. Prenatal alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco use were found to affect state regulation and cortical activities. Conclusions. These results indicate that the neurotoxic effects of prenatal cocaine/crack use can be detected with quantitative EEG measures.

AB  - Objective: To determine if any relationship exists between the severity of symptoms in women with dystonia and female reproductive hormonal variations. Patients and Methods: We surveyed 279 women with dystonia seen at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale over a 6-year period (1990-1995), and 204 responded. The women were asked questions regarding their reproductive and menstrual histories and dystonia severity and other questions with an emphasis on possible exacerbating or relieving factors. Results: Although in the majority of women hormonal influences had no consistent effect on dystonia symptom severity, 26 (41.9%) of 62 premenopausal women noted a change in the severity of their dystonic symptoms in relation to the 3 phases of their menstrual cycle. Other factors that exacerbated dystonia included stress and fatigue, while sleep improved symptoms. Pregnancy, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy had no effect on symptoms. Conclusions: Menstrual cycling may result in subjective worsening of dystonia symptoms in some women with dystonia. Further clinical and physiologic evaluation is indicated in such patients, as they may represent an important subgroup of dystonic patients that might yield some clues to the pathophysiology of dystonia and to improved treatment strategies.

AB  - A case of an infant who had morphine exposure during and following pregnancy while her mother was treated with intrathecal (IT) morphine is presented along with a review of the relevant literature. Successful maternal pain management was achieved during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Minimal maternal serum and breast milk levels in the first 7 postpartum weeks were found. Also, infant sleep and arousal behavior and general development at 2 and 7 months were unremarkable, illustrating the possible safe and efficacious use of IT morphine during and following pregnancy. Further work is required to understand opioid pharmacology during breastfeeding, which will be used to develop an empirical approach to breastfeeding and morphine use.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on the neurogenic control of neonatal heart rate. Methods: Thirty-six healthy newborns (20 boys and 16 girls) with a mean age of 52 h were examined by means of Holter ECG recordings during quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS) and awake states. Seventeen of the mothers had smoked during pregnancy and 19 were non-smokers. To compare the neonatal autonomic control of heart rate between the smoking and the non-smoking groups, heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated with spectral analysis of R-R intervals and the mean values of 2-min epochs. Total power, low-frequency power (LF), high-frequency power (HF) and the low to high frequency ratio (LF/HF) were examined. The LF/HF ratio is considered to reflect sympathovagal balance. Results: Prenatal exposure to nicotine did not influence the total power or the high- or low- frequency components. Boys had a tendency to higher HRV than girls and this was significantly higher at LF during QS. On combining the effects of maternal smoking and gender, boys with smoking mothers had a lower LF/HF ratio than boys with non-smoking mothers: 0.87 Â± 0.37 and 1.34 Â± 0.51, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Smoking during pregnancy may have a different effect on the sympathovagal balance in the development of the fetal male autonomic nervous system than on that of the female.

AB  - The human brainstem is fashioned around the 6th-7th week of gestation and matures in a caudal to rostral arc, thereby forming the medulla, pons, and midbrain. The medulla mediates arousal, breathing, heart rate, and gross movements of the body and head, and medullary functions appear prior to those of the pons, which precede those of the midbrain. Hence, by the 7th-9th gestational week the fetus displays spontaneous movements, 1 week later takes its first "breath," and by the 25th week demonstrates stimulus-induced heart rate accelerations. As the pons, which is later to mature, mediates arousal, body movements, and vestibular and vibroacoustic perception, from around the 20th to 27th weeks the fetus responds with arousal and body movements to vibroacoustic and loud sounds delivered to the maternal abdomen. The midbrain inferior-auditory colliculus followed by the superior-visual colliculus is the last to mature and in conjunction with the lower brainstem makes fine auditory discriminations and reacts to sound with fetal heart rate (FHR) accelerations, head turning, and eye movements - around the 36th week. When aroused the fetus also reacts with reflexive movements, head turning, FHR accelerations, and may fall asleep and display rapid eye movements. Thus fetal cognitive motor activity, including auditory discrimination, orienting, the wake-sleep cycle, FHRs, and defensive reactions, appear to be under the reflexive control of the brainstem, which also appears capable of learning-related activity.

AB  - We report the case of a 30-year-old woman affected by hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), who developed a painless, left axillary neuropathy after sleeping on her left side, on a firm orthopaedic mattress, in her eighth month of pregnancy. Electromyography (EMG) showing neurogenic signs in the left anterior and middle deltoid, and normal findings in the left teres minor, posterior deltoid and other proximal upper limb muscles, demonstrated that the lesion was at the level of the axillary anterior branch. A direct compression of this branch against the surgical neck of the humerus seems the most likely pathogenic mechanism. This is the first documented description of an axillary neuropathy in HNPP. Knowledge of its possible occurrence may be important for prevention purposes.

AB  - After childbirth, women in other countries have been reported to have elation and associated features of hypomania within the first 5 days postpartum. However, there has been no research on this phenomenon in Japan. The characteristics of postpartum mild hypomania in Japanese mothers are discussed here. The usefulness of the Japanese version of 'The Highs' self-rating scale is evaluated and the prevalence of mild hypomania phenomenon for 5 days postpartum is measured. One hundred and nineteen pregnant women in Mie, Japan, agreed to participate in this research. The Japanese women reported feeling elated, especially on the first postpartum day. They also reported feeling the need for less sleep. Many women felt that they could reduce their sleep during hospitalization. There was a relationship between the primipara and the multipara in the obstetric factors selected for study and the occurrence of mild hypomania after delivery. There were not clear correlations in 'The Highs' scores for the nursing actions. It is suggested that the after-effect of stress would be highly correlated to elation, and there is some biological mechanism triggered especially on the first day postpartum.

AB  - Since the introduction of antidepressants in the 1950s, it was assumed for the next several decades that there were no special reasons to look at the application of these medications to women. In the past half-century, particularly in the past decade, since the advent of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI), a series of specific foci have developed. Firstly, there appear to be differences in the degree of response to particular antidepressants between the genders. Secondly, there is data concerning hormonal effects of particular relevance to women, i.e. prolactin, which separates out among the antidepressants. Also of concern to women are the potential teratogenic effects of these medications, which impact on their use during pregnancy. Finally, there are certain diagnostic syndromes that are particularly relevant to women: premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); postpartum depression (PPD) and perimenopausal depression (PMD). It appears that the SSRIs may be more effective, relative to the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), in women than in men. The SSRIs have shown to be effective in treating these disorders, with the possibility of intermittent luteal phase treatment of PMDD. Non-antidepressant (AD) approaches have generally been found to be less effective. In the first trimester of pregnancy, there is data available supporting the safe use of SSRIs, particularly those first released, i.e. fluoxetine and sertraline. Finally, all SSRIs, with the exception of sertraline, can increase the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. This can lead to a variety of complications including amenorrhea and osteoporosis. This effect of sertraline, due to its unique profile in blocking re-uptake of dopamine, extends itself into additional relative benefits for sleep and memory. The issues associated for women with bipolar disorder are dealt with in terms of both increased risk of relapse during pregnancy and postpartum periods, as well as the relative risk of use of lithium and mood stabilisers in pregnancy and lactation. 2000 Â©Ashley Publications Ltd.

AB  - Pain management for premature infants raises challenging questions for nurses. This group of infants is often physiologically fragile and they may undergo frequent painful procedures on a daily basis. Contrary to ideas from the past, premature infants are able to feel pain, and nervous system elements required for the transmission of painful stimuli are functional by 24 weeks gestation. Painful procedures are harmful to the infant's physiological stability and the ability to self-regulate, which includes maintenance of motor control and stable sleep/wake cycles. Assessment of pain in the premature infant is complex. Major indicators of pain include facial grimaces and physiological parameters such as heart rate and oxygen saturation. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) is one tool designed specifically for preterm infants. Nonpharmacological nursing measures such as swaddling or nesting and offering a pacifier are useful strategies to help infants cope with painful procedures. The nurse may also maintain a therapeutic environment to assist the infant in self-regulation. Pharmacological agents such as morphine, fentanyl, and acetaminophen are effective in relieving procedural pain. The use of oral sucrose before and during painful procedures offers new possibilities for pain relief. Recent research shows that oral sucrose is a safe and effective analgesic for short-term procedures. Research studies to determine the most effective doses and modes of oral sucrose administration are ongoing. It is thought that the relief of pain is owing to the sweet taste of the sucrose that activates endogenous pain-modulating systems. Â© 2000 by the American Society of Pain Management Nurses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the conclusions and associated recommendations for care developed by the Physical and Developmental Environment of the High-Risk Infant Center, Study Group on Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Sound, and the Expert Review Panel.STUDY DESIGN: A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers reviewed the literature regarding the effect of sound on the fetus, newborn, and preterm infant and developed recommendations based on the best evidence. An Expert Review Panel reviewed the data and conclusions.RESULTS: The following recommendations are developed from the review of the literature and are clarified in the body of the article. (1) Women should avoid prolonged exposure to low-frequency sound levels (&lt;250 Hz) above 65 dB(A) during pregnancy. (2) Earphones or other devices for sound production should not be used directly attached to the pregnant woman's abdomen. (3) The voice of the mother during normal daily activities, along with the sounds produced by her body and those present in her usual surroundings, is sufficient for normal fetal auditory development. The fetus does not require supplemental stimulation. Programs to supplement the fetal auditory experience cannot be recommended. (4) Infant intensive care units should incorporate a system of regular noise assessment. (5) Sound limit recommendations are to maintain a nursery with an hourly Leq of 50 dB(A), an hourly L10 of 55 dB(A) and a 1-second Lmax of 70 dB(A), all A-weighted, slow response scale. (6) Infant intensive care units should develop and maintain a program of noise control and abatement in order to operate within the recommended permissible noise criteria. (7) Care practices must provide ample opportunity for the infant to hear parent voices live in interaction between parent and infant at the bedside. (8) Earphones and other devices attached to the infant's ears for sound transmission should not be used at any time. (9) There is little evidence to support the use of recorded music or speech in the environment of the high-risk infant. Audio recordings should not be used routinely or left unattended in the environment of the high-risk infant.CONCLUSION: The recommendations, if followed, should provide an environment that will protect sleep, support stable vital signs, improve speech intelligibility for the infant, and reduce potential adverse effects on auditory development.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to alcohol can produce a number of behavioral alterations, including hyperactivity, learning deficits and motor impairments. However, the severity and nature of behavioral alterations varies markedly among children of women who drink during pregnancy. One important determinant of this variation may be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. Recently, we demonstrated that exposure to alcohol during development produced hyperactivity in rats bred for high alcohol sensitivity (HAS), but not in rats bred for low alcohol sensitivity (LAS). These lines were selectively bred for extremes in alcohol-induced 'sleep time.' The present study investigated the effects of ethanol exposure during development on motor coordination later in life in both HAS and LAS rats. Using an artificial rearing procedure, neonatal pups from each line were exposed to a binge-like alcohol treatment on postnatal days (PD) 4-9. Within each line, one group was exposed to ethanol (6.0 g/kg/day), one group served as an artificially reared control, and a third served as a normally reared control group. On PD 30, parallel bar motor performance was evaluated. Exposure to ethanol during development severely impaired motor performance in the HAS rats compared to their controls. In LAS rats, early ethanol exposure produced only mild and nonsignificant effects on motor performance. Thus, HAS rats were more vulnerable to ethanol-induced motor deficits compared to the LAS rats. Importantly, there were no differences in peak blood alcohol level between the lines, indicating that vulnerability to ethanol's teratogenic effects was not due to differences in metabolic rate. These results suggest that genetic differences in response to alcohol may serve as a predictor for susceptibility to ethanol's teratogenic effects. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Objective. To describe the prevalence of various symptoms five months and twelve months after childbirth in two European countries, according to employment, financial difficulties and relationship with partner. Design Longitudinal multicentre survey with a similar design in France and Italy. Women were interviewed three times: at birth and twice after childbirth. At 12 months after childbirth, the survey was postal in both countries. Population. Women who had been delivered of their first or second baby in three maternity units in France and five units in Italy. Women who had multiple pregnancies, a stillbirth or known neonatal death were excluded. Results. The response rates were 83% in France and 88% in Italy. Fifteen symptoms were considered. The results were similar in the two countries and showed that the prevalence of most symptoms was higher at 12 months than at five months after childbirth. When their baby was one year old, more than half of the women reported backache, anxiety and extreme tiredness. Around one-third of women reported headache, lack of sexual desire, sleep disorders and depression. Piles, constipation and painful intercourse were also common. One year postpartum women with financial problems or a difficult relationship reported poor psychological health more frequently. Conclusion. Physical and emotional problems are common after birth, and they tend to increase over time. Backache, headache and piles can seriously interfere with day-to-day life. Sexual problems also may be a source of unhappiness for the woman and her partner. Extreme tiredness, anxiety and depression may make a woman feel guilty for not corresponding to the image of a healthy, happy and well-coping mother. There is a link between financial problems or a difficult relationship with her partner and her own wellbeing. Health professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of health problems among new mothers, and of the social context of women who are more likely to suffer from them. They should counsel the women in their care, in order to help them to find the best solution, be it medical or social in nature.

AB  - Background: Although nitrous oxide (N2O) is used commonly during anesthesia, clinically relevant advantages-disadvantages of using this agent are not well established in the ambulatory setting. This study in women undergoing ambulatory gynecologic surgery compares outcomes in patients administered total intravenous anesthesia with propofol versus the propofol plus N2O. The primary outcome was the time to home readiness. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postanesthetic adverse events. Methods: Women presenting for elective ambulatory termination of pregnancy or gynecologic laparoscopy were induced with an intravenous sleep dose of propofol and fentanyl. After induction, subjects were randomly allocated to maintenance anesthesia with propofol alone or propofol plus 65% N2O. Patients were assessed by a blinded observer in the postanesthetic care unit at 20-min intervals to determine home readiness. Postoperative pain and nausea were measured with visual analog scales. Postoperative analgesics and antiemetics were recorded. The incidence of adverse events occurring after hospital discharge was assessed by a telephone interview 24 h postoperatively. Results: A total of 740 patients received propofol alone, and 750 patients received propofol plus N2O. Mean home readiness times were not significantly different between treatment groups. There were no significant differences between groups in pain scores, nausea scores, analgesia administration, or antiemetic administration before discharge. There were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse events for 24 h after discharge from hospital Conclusions: Omission of N2O from a propofol-based anesthetic for ambulatory gynecologic surgery does not affect time to home readiness or the incidence of postoperative adverse events up to 24 h after discharge from hospital.

AB  - Our goal was to investigate whether the normal birth process stimulated an acute phase response in healthy infants with physiological changes in the circulating levels of acute phase cytokines and acute phase proteins. We also monitored body temperature, body weight and behavioural state in order to investigate if clinical signs of acute phase reaction were present. We made cross-sectional measurements of interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, procalcitonin, prealbumin, body weight, body temperature and the duration of the sleeping period during the first four postnatal days. We found an increase in interleukin-6 (p < 0.001) during the first day, followed by an increase in C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A and procalcitonin on the second postnatal day (p < 0.01). The level of prealbumin fell after birth and reached its lowest value at 3 d of age (p < 0.001). Interleukin-1Î² remained unchanged. The duration of the sleeping period was longer during the first day (p < 0.01). There was an increase in body temperature during the first day (p < 0.01). Maximal weight loss was during the first 2 d. Conclusions: The normal birth process and extra-uterine adaptation stimulates an acute phase reaction in the newborn infant with a release of interleukin-6 and acute phase proteins and a depression of prealbumin. This reaction, as the body's first line inflammatory defence system, probably affects the infants's behaviour, nutritional state as well as the regulation of body temperature.

AB  - The primary aim was to determine whether there was an inverse association between the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the development of traits associated with asthma in children at age six years. A prospective cohort study of children from Western Australia was enrolled prior to birth and followed to age six. Two thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine children were recruited through antenatal clinics at the major tertiary obstetric hospital in Perth. Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and outcomes related to asthma or atopy at age six allowing for a number of important confounders. These included gender, gestational age, smoking in pregnancy and early child care. After adjustment for confounders, the introduction of milk other than breastmilk before four months of age was a significant (p < 0.05) risk factor for all asthma-related outcomes in six-year-old children: (i) doctor diagnosed asthma odds ratio Â¿ORÂ¿ = 1.25 (95% CI 1.02-1.54); (ii) wheeze three or more times since the age of one year OR 1.42 (1.15-1.76); (iii) wheeze in the last twelve months OR 1.28 (1.02-1.76); (iv) sleep disturbance due to wheeze within the last twelve months OR 1.41 (1.04-1.90); (v) age at doctor diagnosis (hazard ratio Â¿HRÂ¿ 1.22 Â¿1.03-1.43Â¿); (vi) age at first wheeze (HR 1.36 Â¿1.17-1.59Â¿) and; (vii) positive reaction to common aeroallergens OR 1.27 (1.01-1.59). There is a substantial reduction in risk of childhood asthma as assessed at age six years, if exclusive breastfeeding is continued for at least the first four months of life. These findings are important for our understanding of the aetiology of and for the potential prevention of asthma in children.

AB  - 1. Low birthweight is now recognized as an important risk factor for early postnatal respiratory illness and it is becoming evident that low birthweight can increase the risk for airway dysfunction in children and adults. Our studies have been aimed at determining how low birthweight, resulting from intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), affects the control of breathing and the structural and functional development of the lung. 2. We have measured ventilatory responsiveness to progressive hypoxia and progressive hypercapnia during the first weeks after birth in postnatal lambs in which IUGR was induced by chronic placental insufficiency. It was found that the postnatal increase in ventilatory sensitivity to hypoxia observed in control lambs was diminished in low birthweight lambs; in contrast, the sensitivity to hypercapnia was not affected. In other studies, we found that IUGR caused by maternal anaemia led to elevated CO2 levels during sleep and wakefulness. 3. Our findings suggest that the prenatal development of the brain-stem or respiratory chemoreceptors may be affected by intra-uterine factors associated with IUGR, such as foetal hypoxaemia or hypoglycaemia. It is also possible that the structure of respiratory muscles and, hence, their ability to maintain a high level of ventilation may be affected by IUGR. 4. Recently, we studied the influence of IUGR on foetal lung development, in particular its effects on foetal lung liquid, a major determinant of lung growth, as well as alveolar structure and pulmonary surfactant. Lung liquid secretion and volume, in relation to bodyweight, were unaffected; however, there was evidence of structural and functional immaturity in the lungs. In foetuses exposed to IUGR, the air-blood barrier was thicker and, after birth, the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide was lower. In contrast, surfactant protein gene expression was enhanced, particularly in foetuses with high levels of circulating cortisol. 5. Further studies are needed to characterize the effects of specific types of prenatal compromise on postnatal control of ventilation and lung function, to determine mechanisms underlying these effects and to determine the capacity for postnatal recovery.

AB  - Objective: To describe sleeping position, room and bed-sharing, tobacco smoke exposure and infant feeding for a sample of Australian Aboriginal infants from a metropolitan area. Methods: Interviews with Aboriginal mothers who resided in the Perth metropolitan area and had given birth during a continuous 15-month study period. The interviews took place when the infants were approximately 6-12 weeks old and efforts were made to contact all eligible mothers. Results are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of all the eligible mothers (n = 515), 87% were contacted and 53% (n = 273) completed the interview. Of all the infants, 11% slept prone, 96% shared a room and 68% shared a bed; 65% of mothers smoked during pregnancy and 65% were smokers at the time of interview; 66% of the partners were smokers and 80% of the infants were regularly exposed to tobacco smoke; 89% of mothers initiated breast-feeding and 70% were breast-feeding at time of interview. Conclusion: Prevalences of non-prone sleeping and breast- feeding are similar to the overall Western Australian population, whilst tobacco smoke exposure of the infants is markedly higher. Programs of community and family education and support are required urgently to decrease this exposure.

AB  - Background. The development of automatic instrumentation for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring makes it possible to follow the time-course of blood pressure variation over 24 h or more in large groups of individuals. Whenever samples from a reference group of individuals are available, one may construct a prediction interval that is expected to include any single future observation from the reference population, with a specified confidence. Alternatively the reference interval may consist of a tolerance interval that will include at least a specified proportion of the population with a stated confidence. Objective. To examine prospectively whether a new, combined tolerance-hyperbaric test approach of establishing tolerance intervals for the circadian variability of blood pressure as a function of gestational age and then computing the hyperbaric index as a measure of blood pressure excess provides high sensitivity and specificity in the early identification of pregnant women who subsequently will develop gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Methods. We used data sampled for 48 h from 148 normotensive men and women to compute and compare time-specified tolerance and prediction intervals for blood pressure. Once the threshold, given by the upper limit of the tolerance interval, was available, the hyperbaric index, as a measure of blood pressure excess, could be calculated by numerical integration as the total area of any given patient's blood pressure above the threshold. The hyperbaric index, in addition to the duration of excess, could then be used as nonparametric endpoints for assessing hypertension. This combined approach, the tolerance-hyperbaric test, was examined prospectively in the early identification of pregnant women who subsequently will develop gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. We analysed 1494 blood pressure series sampled for 48 h in 124 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 78 women who developed gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Results. Sensitivity of the tolerance-hyperbaric test was 93% for women sampled during the first trimester of gestation, and increased up to 99% in the third trimester. Results further indicated lower sensitivity and specificity from other parameters also computed from data sampled by ambulatory monitoring, including the blood pressure load and average values of blood pressure. Discussion. The results suggested the use of tolerance intervals as the appropriate threshold for the circadian variability of blood pressure, primarily because the practical use of prediction limits was restricted by the need for assumptions of normality and symmetry; also, the prediction intervals could not be considered generally applicable when constructed on the basis of a small sample. Conclusions. Despite the limitations of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the tolerance-hyperbaric test represents a reproducible, noninvasive, and highly sensitive test for diagnosing hypertension that has also been validated prospectively for the very early identification of subsequent gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia.

AB  - We report 5 girls presenting Rett syndrome. All of them were from south Tunisia. They fulfilled the Rett syndrome diagnosis criteria (The Rett syndrome diagnosis criteria work group, 1988). Pregnancy, birth and psychomotor development during the first year of live were normal. The mean age at the onset was 19.8Â±2.5 months. The two revealing symptoms were psychomotor regression (3 cases) and epilepsy (2 cases). They were admitted to our ward at a mean age of 4.7Â±1.5 years. Clinical presentation was typical of Rett syndrome. Mental retardation, stereotypic hand movement (hand washing/wringing or clapping/tapping) and loss of purposeful manual skills were noted in all cases. Gait was apraxic and increase of head circumference was slowed. Additional features included: respiratory dysfunction (episodic hyperventilation and breath-holding), epilepsy, scoliosis (4 cases), growth retardation and spasticity (3 cases). Electroencephalography showed slow activity with multifocal epileptiform abnormalities. Sleep enhanced these EEG abnormalities. MRI and CT-scan disclosed non specific cortical and sub- cortical atrophy. All cases were isolated and parents were consanguineous in 3 cases. Rett syndrome is relatively frequent in Europe, but in Tunisia this disease remains rare and certainly underdiagnosed.

AB  - Aims: To test the common assumption that pregnant women who are sufficiently motivated to achieve very good HbA(1c) levels will record home blood glucose data accurately. Methods: A new device was used to download information from electronic blood glucose meters to assess the extent of selectivity in patient glucose diary-keeping. Results: In an index case, a woman with excellent ambient HbA(1c) (5.9%; upper limit of normal 6.1%) was observed to have 68% of preprandial blood glucose readings above the target range of 3.5-6.5 mmol/l and a mean (Â±SD) level of 8.9 Â± 3.9 mmol/l in the corresponding period. No such impression was conveyed by the home monitoring diary. Six pregnant women with well controlled Type 1 diabetes (mean HbA(1c) 6.6 Â± 0.2%) exhibited between 42 and 68% of preprandial readings above the target range. Conclusions: The frequency of hyperglycaemia has hitherto been underestimated in well controlled pregnant women whose near-perfect home monitoring record is apparently corroborated by near-normal HbA(1c) levels. These observations provide a hypothesis for understanding of the disappointing continuance of macrosomia despite excellent HbA(1c) levels throughout pregnancy.

AB  - Our study looked at the variation in peripheral blood lymphocytes, during the menstrual cycle, of frequencies of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and micronuclei (MN) in 819 women and cells with aberrant chromosomes (CA) in a selected sample of 136 volunteers. We observed significant fluctuations in SCE and CA frequencies: SCEs reached a maximum value at the end of menstruation and a low at the time of ovulation, whereas CAs showed a continuous increase from the beginning of the menstrual cycle up to the time of ovulation and a progressive decrease thereafter. MN frequency did not fluctuate in a statistically significant way. No statistically significant differences in SCE, CA and MN frequencies were observed when fertile women were compared with women taking the contraceptive pill or those in menopause and no difference was found between women who had undergone physiological or surgically induced menopause. Moreover, no difference was found between women with a history of miscarriages and matched controls. These data together suggest that the natural variations in sexual hormone levels, but not those due to the contraceptive pill or their reduction at menopause, can contribute in modulating the baseline frequencies of SCEs and CAs. Moreover, these data suggest that the increased risks either of producing a chromosome imbalance in the progeny (eliciting miscarriages) or of occurrence of gynaecological diseases is not predictable by evaluating cytogenetic end-points in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

AB  - Since our major hypothesis is that prenatal protein malnutrition significantly affects hippocampal neuroplasticity, this study examined the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on the modulation of dentate granule cell excitability in freely moving rats at 15, 30 and 90 days of age across the vigilance states of quiet waking (QW), slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Using paired-pulse stimulation, the paired-pulse index (PPI), a measure of the type and degree of modulation of dentate granule cell excitability elicited by stimulation of the medial perforant path, was obtained for each vigilance state at each stage of development. Four specific measures of granule cell excitability were computed, namely, PPI using both population spike amplitude (PSA) and EPSP slope measures, absolute values of PSA1 and EPSP1 slope. PPI values obtained at 15, 30 and 90 days of age, however, were altered during normal ontogenetic development, but not by vigilance state. At 15 days of age, the malnourished group exhibits greater early inhibition of the PPI using the PSA measure at IPIs between 20 and 30 ms regardless of vigilance state, while at 30 days of age, the malnourished group exhibits greater facilitation at IPIs between 50 and 70 ms during QW and SWS, but not during REM sleep. In the control adult (PND90) and juvenile (PND30) animal, PSA1 values are significantly higher during SWS than in QW or REM sleep. However, for the younger malnourished animals (PND15 and PND30), PSA1 values were found to be significantly greater during REM sleep rather than SWS. Therefore, as the animal matures, there appears to be a shift in vigilance state dependent synaptic transmission through the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit from REM sleep to SWS in both control and malnourished animals, with the change occurring later in malnourished animals when compared to control ones. Furthermore, our findings suggests that prenatal protein malnutrition significantly alters modulation of dentate granule cell excitability (i.e., PPI values using the PSA measure) during the earlier stages of development but not in adulthood.

AB  - We performed studies in 8-, 16-, 24-, 30 and 35-day-old Wistar rats at 8.00 h (AM) and 20.00 h (PM) to investigate the relationship between the diurnal variations of basal plasma corticosterone (compound B, CB) and its responses to ACTH and ether stress during the postnatal period. Basal plasma CB levels increased at PM from 8 to 35 days of age and an AM-PM difference was observed at 16 days. Although an AM-PM difference in CB responsiveness to ACTH was detected only at 24 and 35 days, ACTH induced an increasingly higher CB response at PM than at AM from 8 to 35 days. A stress-induced CB response was observed starting at 8 days of age and presented an age-dependent increase; however, no AM-PM difference was observed at any age. The stress-induced CB levels were higher than ACTH-induced CB values at all ages tested except at PM in 8-day old rats. These data demonstrate that the basal CB levels and adrenal sensitivity to ACTH rise during the evening as a function of neonatal development. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Leptin is a 16-kDa cytokine secreted in humans primarily but not exclusively by adipose tissues. Its concentration in blood is usually proportional to body fat mass, but is higher in women than in men not only because of a different distribution of and greater fat mass in women, but also because testosterone reduces its level in men. Leptin features in different ways during the life span. It is synthesized in the ovary, transported in the oocyte, and made by both fetus and placenta, particularly during the last month of gestation. It is made by the lactating mammary gland and ingested by the newborn infant in its milk. The prime importance of leptin is realized at puberty when it is necessary for progression to a normal adult reproductive status in females. Fasting and chronic undernutrition result in a lower level of leptin in the blood. Lack of leptin results in hunger, ensuring that the individual eat to survive, and also inhibition of reproduction, until such time as food and fat stores are adequate to supply energy for pregnancy and lactation. Thus, leptin is important for survival of the individual and survival of the species. Although an extremely rare genetic absence of leptin induces hyperphagia and obesity in humans, as it does in mice, there appears to be little role for leptin in humans in ensuring that fat stores are not in excess of adequate, that is, in preventing obesity. The mouse differs from humans in many respects, in particular in the far more drastic ways it conserves energy when it very rapidly adapts to lack of food. These include not only suppression of reproduction but also lowering of its body temperature (torpor), suppressing its thyroid function, suppressing its growth, and increasing secretion of stress hormones (from the adrenal). This review concentrates on roles of leptin in human physiology and pathophysiology but also discusses why some observations on actions of leptin in mice are not applicable to humans.

AB  - Changes during pregnancy include reduced functional residual capacity and residual volume, increased alveolar-arterial difference for oxygen and, in the supine position, reduced cardiac output. In conjunction with sleeprelated disturbances, these changes could lead to maternal oxygen desaturation during sleep. Because of conflicting data from respiratory sleep studies in late pregnancy, we performed complete polysomnography on 11 pregnant women at the 36th week of gestation and again postpartum. We also measured the PaO2 every 2 h. Contrary to many other studies, we found that during pregnancy PaO2 levels were significantly lower at 36 weeks of gestation compared to the postpartum period. This is probably related to the large volume of abdominal content, as in ascites, pneumoperitoneum and obesity, the effect of which is more severe in the supine position during sleep. We did not find any correlation between SaO2/PaO2 levels and apneas or hypopneas or percent of REM sleep. The frequency of apnea and hypopnea was significantly lower during pregnancy, which may be due to the raised level of progesterone. This may not preserve the maternal decrease in arterial oxygen tension during sleep, in pregnant healthy women. Â©1999 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Sleep disturbance Is a complaint ofchlldbeartng women that has tmpllcationsfor perinatal health. A descriptive, longitudinal study examined the numbers and sources ofmidsleep awakenings in women prior to conception and during each trimes ter ojpregnancy. A secondary analysis ofdatafrom a larger study of sleep during childbearing was performed for subjects (n = 25) who completed sleep diaries across the four measurement periods. There was a two-fold increase in the number of awakenings from pre-conceptlon to the third trimester of pregnancy. Maintenance insomnia during pregnancy follows a pattern of prevalence that can be characterized by trimester. The predominant source ofawakening during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy was due to the need to urinate. Parity and environmental circumstances can influence sources of awakenings. Nurses working with childbearing women canprovide information and assistance with strategies to minimize or mitigate lengthy episodes of sleep disturbance. Â© 1999 Sage Publications, Inc.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to survey the current contraception use and analyze the sexual patterns in women above 35 years of age in India. Five hundred women, of whom 250 were at least 35 years old and 250 were less than 35 years old (control group) were interviewed with the help of a prepared questionnaire. A permanent surgical method of contraception had been accepted by 40.4% of women â¥ 35 years old versus 16.8% of women < 35 years old. Of various temporary methods, an intrauterine device (IUD) was used by 5.2% and 22.8%, oral contraceptive pills (OCs) by 1.2% and 9.6%, and natural methods by 6.4% and 3.2%, in women â¥ 35 years and < 35 years, respectively. No contraception was used by 25.6% women â¥ 35 years. A history of medical termination was given by 67.18% of non-contraceptive users vs. 27.41% of contraceptive users in women â¥ 35 years. Coital frequency was noted at 4.32 times/month in women â¥ 35 years but 7.2 times/month in women < 35 years. Among contraceptive users â¥ 35 years, coital frequency was 4.9 times/month compared with 3.9 times/month in non-contraceptive users. There is a high acceptance of irreversible sterilization and a high abortion rate in women â¥ 35 years. Use of contraceptives was linked with increased sexual activity and a decreased abortion rate.

AB  - Frequently in pregnancy itch is responsible of itching lesions, sleep disorders and anxiety for the mother and the obstetrician. Every single itching case needs a clinical and laboratory study, even if no many itching cases give mathernal and fetus complications. Some clinical cases were observed by us, giving the opportunity to value the itch desease in pregnancy; the most usefull classification is: 1) Pruritus gravidarum, or intraepatic cholestasis in pregnancy (PG). 2) Herpes gestationis (HG). 3) Bollous and itching dermatoses of pregnancy (DPPG). The purpose of our study is to give a small review of itch lesions in pregnancy to gynaecologists, with diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of the common itch diseases.

AB  - Ultrasound examination offered to nearly all pregnant women in Norway may lead to the identification of fetuses with Down's syndrome. This may iead to termination of pregnancies and to a reduction in the prevalence of live-borns with Down's syndrome. In a retrospective study of hospital records we have examined the prevalence of Down's syndrome, associated malformations and diseases during the last 20 years. 68 children and adolescents with Down's syndrome were identified. 43 were born 1988-97 (1.16 per 1,000 births) and 25 1978-87 (0.8 per 1,000 births; p = 0.13). Congenital heart defects were diagnosed in 33 children (49%). Five children (7.4%) had died by the end of 1997, four with a cardiovascular defect. Four children had moved out of the region. Among 59 persons alive at the time of study, 11 (19%) were treated for hypothyroidism, 26 (44%) had been hospitalised because of infections, and 14 (20%) suffered from problems with sleep obstruction. 23 (39%) had impairments in hearing and 30 (51%) in vision. Ten children (18%) had a weight-for-height above the 97.5 percentile of standard growth charts for Norwegian children. Scram concentration of zink was below reference values in 15 children. We conclude that the prevalence of livebirths with Down's syndrome was not reduced in 1988-97 compared to 1978-87. Children with Down's syndrome have a wide range of somatic disorders and need close and systematic medical follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To base permissible noise criteria for occupied, new nurseries on research findings. STUDY DESIGN: An interdisciplinary group of clinicians reviewed the literature regarding the effect of sound on the fetus, newborn, and preterm infant and based recommended criteria on the best evidence. An external panel subsequently reviewed the criteria RESULTS: The recommended criteria: Patient bed areas and the spaces opening onto them shall be designed to produce minimal ambient noise and to contain and absorb much of the transient noise that arises within the nursery. The overall, continuous sound in any bed space or patient care area shall not exceed: (1) an hourly Leq of 50 dB and (2) an hourly L10 of 55 dB, both A-weighted, slow response. The 1-second duration Lmax shall not exceed 70 dB, A-weighted, slow response. CONCLUSION: The permissible noise criteria will protect sleep, support stable vital signs, and improve speech intelligibility for many infants most of the time.

AB  - Background Studies on risk factors for epileptic seizures are mostly based on heterogeneous groups of patients: incident and prevalent cases, first seizures and epilepsies, idiopathic and symptomatic seizures, children and adults, hospital and population series. Different types of seizures are pooled together and methods of exposure ascertainment differ among studies. Confounding has never been considered. Objective To evaluate with a case-control study risk factors for a first "symptomatic" epileptic seizure. Methods This is a multicenter case-control study, involving 18 neurological departments from January 1995 through April 1998. Cases are adult patients (age > 15 years) with a first seizure, symptomatic (either acute or remote) of stroke, intracranial tumor or head trauma. Controls are patients without seizures, matched to the cases for center, sex, age, and underlying pathology (stroke, intracranial tumor or head trauma). Cases and controls are interviewed with a questionnaire, already validated, on risk factors for epilepsy, including familial, pre-, peri- and post-natal risk factors. Results We included 290 cases (5 to 41 per center), 125 women and 165 men, with a mean age of 61.4 years. The underlying pathology was stroke in 169 cases, intracranial tumor in 90 and head trauma in 31. We included 211 cases with acute and 79 with remote symptomatic seizures. The recruitment of controls is still ongoing; we have now recruited 344 controls. Preliminary results (odds ratio, 95% confidence limits) are: family history for seizures, 1.9 (0.8-4.6); complications of pregnancy, 1.0 (0.6-1.4); low gestational age, 0.8 (0.5-1.4); low birthweight, 1.5 (1.2-1.8); febrile seizures, 1.3 (0.6-2.9); sleep deprivation, 1.2 (0.91.5); hypertension 0.9 (0.8-1.1); alcohol use 26-50 g/day, 1.3 (0.7-2.4); alcohol use more than 51 g/day, 1.5 (0.8-2.8). Conclusions In presence of an insult to CNS (either acute or remote), other risk factors for seizures have only a minor role.

AB  - COMT O-methylates catecholamines and other compounds with a catechol structure. The general function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active or toxic catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. During the first trimester of pregnancy, COMT present in the placenta protects the developing embryo from activated hydroxylated compounds. COMT also acts as an enzymatic detoxicating barrier between the blood and other tissues shielding against the detrimental effects of xenobiotics. COMT may serve some unique or indirect functions in the kidney and intestine tract by modulating the dopaminergic tone; the same may be true in the brain: COMT activity may regulate the amounts of active dopamine and norepinephrine in various part of the brain and therefore be associated with the mood and other mental processes. There is one single gene for COMT, which codes for both S-COMT and MB-COMT using two separate promoters. Both rat and human S-COMTs contain 221 amino acids, and their molecular weights are 24.8 and 24.4 kD, respectively. Rat MB-COMT contains 43 and human MB-COMT contains 50 additional amino acids, of which 17 (rat) and 20 (human) are hydrophobic membrane anchors. The remainder of the MB-COMT molecule is suspended on the cytoplasmic side of the intracellular membranes. Rat S-COMT has been recently crystallized at 1.7- to 20-Ã resolution. The active site of COMT consists of the AdoMet-binding domain and the actual catalytic site. The catalytic site is formed by a few amino acids that are important for the binding of the substrate, water, and Mg2+ and for the catalysis of O-methylation. The Mg2+, which is bound to COMT only after AdoMet binding, improves the ionization of the hydroxyl groups. The lysine residue (Lys144), which accepts the proton of one of the hydroxyls, acts as a general catalytic base in the nucleophilic methyl transfer reaction. A series of new and highly selective COMT inhibitors have been developed. Entacapone, nitecapone, and tolcapone are nitrocatechol-type potent COMT inhibitors in vitro (K(i) in nanomolar range), whereas CGP 28014 is a hydroxypyridine derivative and ineffective in vitro. In animal studies, these compounds effectively inhibit the O-methylation of L-dopa, thus improving its bioavailability and brain penetration and potentiating its behavioral effects. Entacapone and nitecapone have mainly a peripheral effect, whereas tolcapone and CGP 28014 also inhibit the O-methylation in the brain. In human volunteers, entacapone, nitecapone, and tolcapone dose- dependently inhibit the COMT activity of erythrocytes, improve the bioavailability of L-dopa, and inhibit the formation of 3-OMD. In clinical studies in PD patients, both entacapone and tolcapone potentiate the therapeutic effect of L-dopa and prolong the daily on time by 1 to 2 h. The two marketed COMT inhibitors have different treatment strategies, advantages, and disadvantages, which are listed in Table 11. In the clinic, COMT inhibitors have been well tolerated, and the number of premature terminations has been low. In general, the incidence of adverse events has been higher in tolcapone-treated patients than in entacapone-treated patients. The main events have consisted of dopaminergic and gastrointestinal problems. Dopaminergic overactivity causes an initial worsening of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disorders, and hallucinations. Tolcapone has been associated with diarrhea in about 16 to 18% of cases, and entacapone has been associated in less than 10% of cases. Diarrhea has led to discontinuation in 5 to 6% of patients treated with tolcapone and in 2.5% of those treated with entacapone. Urine discoloration to dark yellow or orange is related to the color of COMT inhibitors and their metabolites. Elevated liver transaminate levels are reported in 1 to 3% of patients treated with tolcapone but very rarely, if at all, in patients treated with entacapone. Three cases of acute, fatal fulminant hepatitis have been described in association of tolcapone when more than 100,000 patients have been treated. In addition, a few potentially fatal neurological adverse reactions, including neuroleptic-like malignant syndrome, have described. Because of these serious adverse drug reactions, tolcapone marketing was suspended in Europe and Canada. In early 1999, no restrictions of the use of entacapone have been proposed.

AB  - A 26 yr old puerperal female with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome developed serious obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome during pregnancy. She underwent an elective Caesarean section delivery, but ending the pregnancy did not improve her clinical symptoms. By treating her with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, a worsening of her headaches and glaucoma was prevented. The administration of acetazolamide controlled all of her symptoms. Treatment with nasal ventilation is the best initial approach. It is also important to assure normal oxygenation before pregnancy since the foetus may suffer from the severe deprivation that may occur in these patients.

AB  - Objective. Epidemiological studies suggest that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to maternal undernutrition during pregnancy represents a major risk factor for hypertension and diabetes in adult age. However, placental insufficiency, rather than maternal malnutrition, is the main cause of IUGR in the Western world. We therefore studied the relationship between birth weight and adult blood pressure and glucose tolerance in an established animal model of placental insufficiency. Design. IUGR was induced by uterine artery ligation in pregnant rats and the offspring were studied at 3-4 months of age. Methods. In one subgroup of animals (n = 41, birth weight range 3.2-6.6 g) blood pressure was recorded over 72 h using telemetry and hypothalamic tissue levels of noradrenaline was measured. In another subgroup (n = 30, birth weight range 3.0-6.8 g) the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) was assessed by noradrenaline isotope dilution techniques and glucose tolerance determined by an intravenous glucose load. Results. Adult blood pressure was independent of birth weight. Haemodynamic responses of IUGR rats to moderate sound stress was unaltered. In male rats neither SNS activity, hypothalamic noradrenaline concentrations nor glucose tolerance was associated with birth weight. In contrast, IUGR in female rats was associated with increased SNS activity, elevated fasting blood glucose as well as lower insulin and higher glucose levels in response to a glucose load. Conclusion. IUGR is not linked to an elevated blood pressure at 3-4 months of age in this model. However, in female rats, IUGR is associated with increased SNS activity and impaired glucose tolerance in adult life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and health-related quality of life of family medicine patients with clinically diagnosed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: The study involved the baseline assessment of 268 patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing treatments for GERD. The study was conducted in a five-center, university-based family practice in southeastern West Virginia. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of GERD and who had not received treatment in the past 30 days were eligible; pregnant and lactating women and patients with severe renal or hepatic insufficiency were excluded. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty- eight patients were included in the analysis. Mean Â± SD age was 44.9 Â± 14.1 years; 61.2% were women and 91.4% were white. Mean Â± SD body mass index was 30.3 Â± 6 kg/m2, and &gt;15.3% of patients had no insurance. One hundred seventy-four (64.9%) patients were enrolled from nonurban primary care clinics. One hundred sixty-four patients (61.2%) were prescribed at least one medication prior to study enrollment (mean Â± SD 2.88 Â± 1.71; range 1-9). When adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity status, and rural status, severity of GERD was associated with decreased health-related quality of life. GERD patients without comorbidity demonstrated decrements in health-related quality of life when compared with the US general population. When compared with another GERD population, the study patients reported fairly consistent GERD symptomatology and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: GERD symptom severity was associated with impaired health-related quality of life in a predominantly rural primary care population.

AB  - Objective. To examine whether ethnic origin is related to care giving styles relevant to sudden infant death. Design. Prospective/retrospective, descriptive. Method. In six child health care centres in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, data about sleep position, bedclothes and passive smoking of infants aged 1-5 months were collected by face-to-face interviews of mothers visiting these centres between February 1997 and October 1998. Results. Eligible for the study were 1815 infants, 919 boys and 896 girls, mean age 2 months. In Amsterdam 12.5% of infants were usually or sometimes put to sleep in a prone position, 31.0% usually or now and then in a side position (but not in a prone position) and 56.5% usually in a supine position. Prone sleeping position was more frequent among Surinamese infants and less frequent among Moroccan infants compared with Dutch infants. Overall use of a duvet among infants was 22.7%. Use of duvets was higher among allochtonous infants; after controlling for demographic factors this difference was not significant, however. 6.3% of the infants had slept in the previous night with a pillow. Use of a pillow was much more frequent among allochtonous than among autochthonous infants: 13% versus 1.2%. Maternal daily smoking during pregnancy and daily smoking by mothers or others at home at time of interview was found in 15.1% and 25.8% of the infants respectively. Almost no Moroccan mothers smoked during pregnancy (0.4%), while Turkish mothers smoked as much as Dutch mothers (18.5% and 21.6% respectively). No differences in daily smoking at home were found between Surinamese, Moroccan and Dutch families (circa 26%). However, daily smoking at home was much more frequent in Turkish families (43.8%). Conclusion. Health education about a safe sleeping position, about safe bedclothes and about the dangers of passive smoking is still needed. Education programmes to prevent sudden infant death must take into account ethnic differences in care giving styles. Special attention must be paid to the use of a pillow among allochtonous infants.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that the uterus achieves maximum contractile capabilities before the onset of labor. Basal and agonist- stimulated contractions were assessed in uterine strips on Day 15 or 18 of pregnancy, the day of parturition, or I day postpartum (n = 4-13 per group). Spontaneous contractions were evident in all groups (n = 4-13 per gestational group); contraction frequency was greater in peripartum groups than in virgin controls (~4.6 versus 2.8/200 sec). Peak amplitude was nearly 9-fold higher on Days 15 and 18 and over 30-fold higher in the postpartum and I day postpartum groups than in nonpregnant mice. Maximum frequency and peak amplitude were achieved in response to 10-6 to 10-8 M oxytocin or arginine vasopressin (OT(max) or AVP(max). Frequency of contractions in response to OT(max) peaked on Day 18 and then declined. Contraction amplitude increased 5-fold on Day 15, declined on the day of birth (equivalent to nonpregnant level), then rebounded to peak on postpartum Day 1. AVP(max) similarly increased frequency and amplitude of contractions, except that maximum contraction amplitude occurred postpartum. Thus, an endogenous oscillator, residing in the uterus, sustains high basal and agonist-induced contraction frequency during pregnancy. Although acceleration of this pacemaker occurred before term, the data suggest that peripartum increases in contraction amplitude characterize the transition to the powerful synchronous contractions of parturition.

AB  - This study extends previous results on the effects of low-dose aspirin on blood pressure in pregnant women at differing risk of developing hypertension in pregnancy and who received aspirin at different times according to their rest-activity cycle. A double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trial was conducted in 240 pregnant women randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups according to treatment (placebo or aspirin, 100 mg/d, starting at 12 to 16 weeks of gestation) and the time of treatment: on awakening (time 1), 8 hours after awakening (time 2), or before bedtime (time 3). Blood pressure and heart rate for each subject were automatically monitored for 2 days every 4 weeks from the day of recruitment until delivery, as well as at puerperium (6 to 8 weeks after delivery). Subjects were further divided for comparative purposes according to the results of the tolerance-hyperbaric test for early identification of those with a higher risk for developing hypertensive complications in pregnancy. Results indicated that there was no effect of aspirin on blood pressure at time 1 (compared with placebo). A blood pressure reduction was, however, highly statistically significant at time 2 and, to a greater extent, at time 3 (mean reductions of 14.2 and 9.6 mm Hg in 24-hour means for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, at the time of delivery compared with placebo given at the same time). Effects of aspirin on blood pressure were significantly larger for women with a positive test at the time of recruitment (P<0.001). Differences in blood pressure among pregnant women receiving aspirin at different times in the circadian cycle disappeared at puerperium (P>0.212). There was no effect of aspirin or placebo on heart rate. This study corroborates the statistically significant, time-dependent effect of low-dose aspirin on blood pressure in pregnant women with differing risk of developing hypertensive complications in pregnancy. Although the mechanism involved in the administration-time-dependent responsiveness of blood pressure to aspirin still remains uncertain, the use of doses of aspirin <80 mg/d that do not affect placental thromboxane, initiation of the use of aspirin after 16 weeks' gestation, and the lack of circadian timing for aspirin administration could all explain the lack of positive results in previous clinical trials.

These disturbances parallel to a large extent those found in depressed patients, in which hypercortisolemia and sleep alterations may be related to stress- inducing events. We studied sleep-wake parameters in control and prenatally stressed adult rats (3-4 months old) and examined possible relationships with their corticosterone levels (determined at 2 months of age). Under baseline conditions, prenatally stressed rats showed increased amounts of paradoxical sleep, positively correlated to plasma corticosterone levels. Other changes include increased sleep fragmentation, total light slow-wave sleep time, and a slight decrease in the percentage of deep slow-wave sleep relative to total sleep time. During recovery sleep from acute restraint stress, all sleep changes persisted and were correlated with stress-induced corticosterone secretion. High corticosterone levels under baseline conditions as well as an acute stress challenge may thus predict long-term sleep-wake alterations in rats. Taken together with other behavioral and hormonal abnormalities in prenatally stressed animals, the pronounced changes in sleep-wake parameters that are similar to those found in depressed patients suggest that prenatal stress may be a useful animal model of depression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) has been described infrequently in adults, and treatment in both children and adults remains unsatisfactory. We report clinical features of a group of adults with CVS and anecdotal outcome from open-label treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, medications that have some efficacy in other unexplained gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: Clinical data were examined from 17 adult patients with CVS seen over a 10-yr period, each having been treated with a tricyclic antidepressant. Outpatient records were reviewed, clinical outcome was extracted using a priori criteria, and findings were compared with 37 patients having usual functional nausea and vomiting who also received tricyclic antidepressant therapy. RESULTS: Symptoms in CVS began at age 35 yr (range 14-73 yr); the average episode length was 6 days (range 1-21 days) and the symptom-free interval averaged 3.1 months (range 0.5-6 months). Vomiting cycles typically began without warning, and fewer than one-third of the subjects reported a prodrome or potential trigger event, such as menstrual periods, pregnancy, or large meals. Sleep was seemingly beneficial in 23.5%. Tricyclic antidepressant therapy was associated with complete remission in 17.6% and partial response in 58.8%, but was less effective than for functional nausea and vomiting (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CVS is a rare diagnosis with distinctive features in adults. Duration of episodes and cycles varies considerably across subjects. In open-label, uncontrolled use, tricyclic antidepressants appear beneficial for some subjects but are less effective in CVS than in chronic, persistent functional nausea and vomiting.

AB  - Networks of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the myenteric plexus (Myp) or circular muscle (CM) function as pacemakers for gastrointestinal slow waves. ICC in contact with muscle and closely asso ciated with nerves in the CM may mediate inhibitory neurotransmission. We wondered if ICC in Myp and CM and their connections are immature at birth and mature first in the proximal gut in association with nerves. Tissues from lower esophageal sphincter (LES), pylorus (PYL), small intestine (SI) and colon (CO) of 18 term fetal dogs taken from six females were fixed and prepared for ultrastructural examination and studied. Ganglia were present where expected in the Myp and submucous plexus (SMP). ICC cells were present in the Myp of PYL, SI and CO and appeared to have normal relationships to the outer border of CM as in adults. ICC in CM were found associated with nerves in the LES and in PYL, but not in SI or CO. However, axons in CM were everywhere usually free of glial covering, indicating ongoing migration or development. No organized deep muscular plexus (DMP) in SI or submuscular plexus (SP) in colon was present. Visible gap junctions were absent everywhere except for very rare ones between circular muscle cells. We conclude that at birth the neural and ICC networks of CM are more immature in intestine and colon than in oesophagus and stomach. Development of nerve and ICC of CM in oesophagus and stomach apparently precedes that in the remaining gut. However networks in these regions have not achieved adult organization and ICC and smooth muscle cells are anatomically poorly coupled. These findings suggest the reasons that gut motility at birth will not be adult in pattern are because ICC, nerve and muscle control systems are not fully differentiated further developmental delays in ICC and nerve maturation could have serious consequences for feeding of infant animals.

AB  - Background and Objective: Pregnancy toxemia may lead to appreciable mortality among jills and their offspring. The objective of this report was to increase awareness of the disease, its likely cause, and practical prevention and treatment measures. Methods: Ten cases of pregnancy toxemia were evaluated. Jills were in late gestation (mean, 38 days; range, 34 to 42 days) and had large litters (mean, 11.5 kits; range, 7 to 15 kits). Results: The most common clinical signs of disease were lethargy, inappetence, dehydration, and excess shedding. Hematologic and clinical biochemical abnormalities included anemia (4 of 8 jills tested), hypoproteinemia (5 of 7), azotemia (7 of 7), hypocalcemia (5 of 6), hyperbilirubinemia (3 of 3), and high liver enzyme activities (6 of 6). Two jills were found dead; two jills were euthanized, six received supportive treatment, and cesarean section was performed on five. The three jills that survived tended to have less pronounced azotemia, hypoproteinemia, and liver enzyme activity increases and were not anemic. Hepatic lipidosis was observed grossly in all jills that died and was confirmed by histologic examination in four jills. Conclusions: Pregnancy toxemia in ferrets resembles metabolic diseases in several other animal species and requires aggressive treatment, including supportive care, nutritional supplementation, and cesarean section. Maintaining adequate nutrition and avoiding stress late in gestation may prevent the disease.

AB  - Melatonin (MEL) is a widely used, over-the-counter sleep aid, and it has putative contraceptive, antioxidant, antiaging, and anticancer effects. The developmental toxicity potential for repeated oral doses of MEL had not previously been evaluated. In the present studies, time-mated, Sprague- Dawley-derived (CDÂ®) rats were administered MEL or vehicle by gavage on gestation days (gd) 6-19. MEL-treated groups received 1-, 10-, 100-, 150-, or 200-mg/kg body weight/day in the screening study (15 rats/group), and 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day in the definitive study (25 rats/group). In both studies, maternal food/water consumption, body weight, and clinical signs were monitored at regular intervals throughout gestation. At termination (gd 20, both studies), maternal liver and gravid uterine weights, number of ovarian corpora lutea, conceptus survival, fetal sex, and fetal body weight were evaluated. Fetal morphological examination included external structures (both studies) as well as visceral and skeletal structures (definitive study). In the screening study, maternal serum levels of 17Î²-estradiol, progesterone, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone were determined by radioimmunoassay, and mammary tissue was fixed, stained, and evaluated for percent glandular area within the fat pad. No maternal morbidity/mortality was found in either study. In the screening study, aversion to treatment (â¥100 mg/kg/day) and reduced maternal weight gain (â¥150 mg/kg/day) were noted, but reproductive/endocrine parameters and fetal development were not affected. In the definitive study, aversion to treatment was noted at â¥50 mg/kg/day, and mild sedation, reduced maternal food intake, and reduced body weight gain were found during initial treatment with 200 mg/kg/day. MEL had no effect on prenatal survival, fetal body weight, or incidences of fetal malformations/variations. Thus, in the definitive study, the maternal toxicity NOAEL and LOAEL were 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the developmental toxicity NOAEL was â¥200 mg/kg/day.

AB  - Family physicians are often asked to advise patients who are preparing to travel. The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 has enabled more passengers with medical disabilities to choose air travel. All domestic U.S. airlines are required to carry basic (but often limited) medical equipment, although several physiologic stresses associated with flight may predispose travelers with underlying medical conditions to require emergency care. Recommendations for passengers with respiratory, cardiac or postsurgical conditions must be individualized and should be based on objective testing measures. Specific advice for patients with diabetes, postsurgical or otolaryngologic conditions may make air travel less hazardous for these persons. Air travel should be delayed after scuba diving to minimize the chance of developing decompression sickness. Although no quick cure for jet lag exists, several simple suggestions may make travel across time zones more comfortable.

AB  - The primary factors in feeding premature infants are dependent on the development and maturation of digestion and absorption. The maturation of digestive and absorptive functions of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins in the young premature infant were determined in relation to availability of hydrolytic enzymes, such as lipases, proteases, amylases, glucosidases, and lactase. The feeding is dependent on the ability of the premature infant to secrete salivary enzymes, gastric acid, pepsin, pancreatic exocrine enzymes, the presence of enterohepatic circulation, and the hydrolytic and absorptive capacity of the entercocyte. To evaluate the complexity of the gut maturation process, we proposed a unified concept where the ontogeny of the gastrointestinal system is the result of the following four major determinants: genetic endowment, intrinsic developmental and biological clock, endogenous regulatory mechanisms, and environmental influences. The developmental clock represents a predetermined temporal sequence of happenings in ontogeny that is inherently controlled. By 20 weeks of gestation, the anatomic differentiation of the fetal gut has progressed to the extent that it resembles that of a newborn. Secretory and absorptive functions, however, develop at different rates; the intestinal absorptive process is only partially available before 26 weeks of gestation, whereas gastric and pancreatic secretion is only basal and can be stimulated only partially even in the full-term newborn period. Regulatory mechanisms control the expression of the genetic endowment at various stages in gastrointestinal development. Neural-hormonal factors play major roles in the ontogeny of the gut. Adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy, and thyroidectomy delay the development of the gut. Administration of glucocorticoids or thyroxine at the critical stage in maturation causes early appearance of enzymes within the intestine. Other hormones that are potentially important in regulating gastrointestinal development include cholecystokinin, gastrin, secretin, which have trophic effects on the gastrointestinal tract, and insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and epidermial growth factor. The development of gastrointestinal secretory function, particularly in response to hormonal stimulation, has received considerable attention. The degree of response of the target cell is determined not only by the amount of effective hormone reaching it but also by the number and affinity of receptors on its surface. Human newborns have high levels of gastrin in their sera, yet have low acid output. Exogenous gastrin is an ineffective stimulant despite the presence of seemingly "anatomically developed" parietal cells. It seems that neither endogenous nor exogenous gastrin has an effect on the target cell. If one accepts the role of circulating gastrin levels in the regulation of its own receptor, one can hypothesize the absence of a regulatory effect of gastrin in the newborn period. It was shown that hormonal regulation of migrating activity by motilin is also absent in the preterm and term infant. Plasma levels of motilin in neonates are comparable to those found in adults, but migrating motor complexes occur in the absence of cycling of plasma concentrations. Interestingly, however, the motilin receptor appears to be present. In conclusion, the feeding mode content, concentration, and volume of the very young premature infant can be assessed by the development of digestive and absorptive capacity and gut motility. The concomitant changes in gut hormones and regulatory peptides during ontogeny and feeding will add a new dimension in the understanding of when, what, and how to feed the very young premature infant. copyright Â© 1999 by the American Society for Parenteral ans Enteral Nutrition.

AB  - Structural brain development undergoes rapid and complex changes during the last weeks of gestation. Polysomnographic registrations used in low risk preterm infants at various conceptional ages reflect the changing qualities of brain bioelectrical activity as well as of spontaneous motor behaviour and of autonomic functions. Information about these processes can be derived by visual and by automatic computer-assisted data analysis. Knowledge about development under normal conditions is crucial for clinical evaluation of high risk newborns. Data from the literature and from personal studies are described and their diagnostic and prognostic implications discussed. Polysomnography in preterm and term infants can serve as a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool to neurological examination and to various neuroimaging methods.

AB  - Epidemiologic studies indicated formula-feeding and heavy smoking of parents as risk factors of SID. From a clinical-physiological point of view, obstructive sleep apnea and periodic breathing in infants are discussed as markers of an increased risk of SID. We intended to test the hypothesis, that clinical-physiological factors were dependent on epidemiological factors. In a total of 302 infants the status of epidemiological risk factors was assessed by history and a polygraphic sleep recording was performed. We used the method of logistic regression in order to find possible intercorrelations. Heavy maternal smoking during pregnancy (10 cigarettes per day or more) was found to be the decisive influence on the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea in the infant. In the first year of life, infants of heavy smoking mothers were found to have a significant higher occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea than infants of non-smoking mothers. Strength of this intercorrelation was age-dependent, risk of obstructive sleep apnea being highest when infants were 14 to 42 days of age (O.R. 8.6, 95 % CI 2.0; 36.1, p=0.003). Periodic breathing was more frequent in breast-fed infants in their 7th to 10 th week of life (O.R. 8.0, 95 % CI 2.9;22.3, p = 0.0001). Independent of age girls were more likely to have periodic breathing than boys (O.R. 2.3, 95 % CI 1.4;3.9, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Heavy maternal smoking in pregnancy seem to increase obstructive apnea within the same age range, in which epidemiology showed maternal smoking augmenting the SID incidence. In contrast, occurrence of periodic breathing was correlated to epidemiologic factors, known to be associated with lower risk of SID. Periodic breathing was found to be higher in breast-fed infants and in girls. These findings support the opinion, that periodic breathing should not be regarded as a pathologic breathing pattern in clinically healthy full term infants.

AB  - The various options for the treatment of retrograde ejaculation (RE) and anejaculation (AE) are discussed systematically in this review. A total of 88 studies dealing with patients with RE emphasize medical treatment for reversal of RE and retrieval of spermatozoa from urine. In 136 studies concerning patients with AE, the main emphasis is on medical treatment, electroejaculation (EE) and electrovibration stimulation (EVS) for the reversal of AE. Sperm quality in patients with RE and AE is often impaired. However, with the help of assisted reproduction techniques (ART) available today, both ejaculation disorders can be considered as treatable diseases. The major problem when analysing the studies was the uneven methodological quality of the original articles and the difficulties presented by different drugs and dosages, equipment and techniques, along with different criteria for success. In conclusion, controlled clinical trials comparing different treatment options appear urgently warranted.

AB  - Prenatal stress impairs activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress in adult offspring. So far, very few data are available on the effects of prenatal stress on circadian functioning of the HPA axis. Here, we studied the effects of prenatal stress on the circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion in male and female adult rats. To evaluate the effects of prenatal stress on various regulatory components of corticosterone secretion, we also assessed the diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin, total and free corticosterone levels, and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. Finally, in the search of possible maternal factors, we studied the effects of repeated restraint stress on the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant female rats. Results demonstrate that prenatal stress induced higher levels of total and free corticosterone secretion at the end of the light period in both males and females, and hypercorticism over the entire diurnal cycle in females. No diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin was observed in any group studied. The effects of prenatal stress on corticosterone secretion could be mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in corticosteroid receptors at specific times of day. Results also show that prepartal stress alters the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant females. Those data indicate that prenatally stressed rats exhibit an altered temporal functioning of the HPA axis, which, taken together with their abnormal response to stress, reinforces the idea of a general homeostatic dysfunction in those animals.

AB  - Aims. To determine whether exposure to fluoridated water supplies prenatally or postnatally at the time of death increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Methods. A nationwide, case-control study, with infant's water fluoridation status determined from census area unit information for mother's usual address at the time of the infant's birth, infant's usual address at the time of death / nominated sleep and address where infant died / was at nominated sleep. SIDS risk associated with fluoride exposure postnatally was assessed according to method of infant feeding (breast or reconstituted formula), for the two days prior to infant's death / nominated sleep. Results. Infants exposed to fluoridated water supplies during pregnancy were not at increased risk for SIDS, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.19 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82, 1.74). For breast-fed infants at the time of death / nominated sleep, fluoridated water exposure was not associated with an increased risk for SIDS, adjusted OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.66, 1.79). Similarly, 'fluoridated' formula feeding, when compared with 'unfluoridated' formula feeding, showed no increased risk of SIDS, adjusted OR 1.25 (95% CI 0.73, 2.13). There was no evidence of an interaction between fluoridation and infant feeding for the last two days (X2= 0.171, df = 1, p = 0.68). Conclusion. Exposure to a fluoridated water supply prenatally or postnatally at the time of death did not affect the relative risk for SIDS.

AB  - Objective - To explore diurnal variation in blood ionized calcium, sodium, potassium, and chloride concentrations and pH in pregnant dairy cows. Animals - 14 dairy cows in their third or later pregnancy approximately 6 weeks before expected parturition. Procedure - Throughout a 24-hour period, blood samples were taken at 2-hour intervals and analyzed for ionized calcium (iCa2+), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-) concentrations and pH. Paired t-tests were used to compare initial and final values. Circadian changes were tested by use of repeated-measures ANOVA. Additionally, a nonparametric analysis was performed for each animal to determine minimal and maximal values for the variables. Results - Significant differences were not detected between initial and final values of any variable. Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated significant diurnal fluctuations in all variables. With the exception of Cl- concentration, nonparametric analysis of individual values also revealed significant changes over time. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - The magnitude of daily fluctuations does not make it necessary to standardize time of sample collection for routine diagnostic examination of blood iCa2+, Na+, K+, and Cl- concentrations and pH. However, it may be important to standardize time of sample collection in comparative studies in which more discrete differences may be identified.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) secreted by tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons in the hypothalamus is the major inhibitory factor controlling prolactin (PRL) secretion from the anterior pituitary. Endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs), mainly the neuropeptide Î²-endorphin, have a stimulatory influence on PRL secretion. During the first half of pregnancy in rats, PRL secretion is characterized by two daily surges, the nocturnal surge and the diurnal surge. We tested the hypothesis that EOPs are critical stimulatory factors in regulating the nocturnal PRL surge, possibly via inhibition of TIDA neuronal activity. Naloxone (NAL), an opioid antagonist, was continuously infused (0.2 mg/10 ÏL/min iv) during the expected time of the nocturnal PRL surge in day 8 pregnant rats. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to measure plasma PRL levels, and the immunocytochemical (ICC) staining of Fos/FRA was performed to detect changes in transcriptional activity of neurons in the hypothalamus. ICC of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for DA synthesis, was performed to visualize TIDA neurons in the arcuate nucleus. The results showed that the nocturnal surge of PRL was markedly delayed and dampened in NAL-treated rats (p < 0.01). The numbers of both Fos/FRA and (Fos/FRA)/TH dual-staining neurons increased in the arcuate nucleus following NAL treatment (p < 0.05 for both comparisons). These data indicate that EOPs are critical stimulatory factors for the nocturnal PRL surge and that the actions of EOPs are partially mediated via decreasing TIDA neuronal activity.

AB  - Monozygotic (MZ) twins with a known chorion type were assessed in the neonatal period to determine if placentation was related to twin similarity in early temperament development. The sample included 48 pairs with monochorionic placentas and 29 pairs with dichorionic placentas. The assessment focused on irritability, resistance to soothing, activity while awake, activity during sleep, reactivity, and reinforcement value. There were no differences between the monochorionic and the dichorionic twins in any of the temperament ratings. Chorion type was not related to cotwin similarity on any of the temperament ratings. It was concluded that differences in prenatal environment reflected in placentation type did not affect early temperament for MZ twins.

AB  - It has been reported that progesterone (P4) induces changes in sleep, but the brain regions involved in these actions are unknown. We studied the effects of P4 microinjections into the pontine reticular formation (PRF) upon rat sleep. Intact adult male and ovariectomized female rats were unilaterally injected with P4 into the PRF and the sleep-waking cycle was recorded for 6 h. P4 (1.0 and 5.0 Î¼g/0.2 Î¼l) did not modify sleep, but at a higher dose (7.5 Î¼g/0.2 Î¼l) it produced a marked decrease in rapid eye movement sleep (REM) latency in both male (55%) and female (63%) rats. A non- significant increase in the number of REM episodes was observed after P4 administration. These findings suggest that P4 should participate in the mechanisms related to REM initiation in the rat through its effects in the PRF.

AB  - To investigate the organization of diurnal rhythmicity during gestation, the relationship between daily cycles of maternal and fetal heart rate were measured in long-term studies of healthy chronically instrumented pregnant baboons. In each of six pregnancies, hourly mean values over a 168 h time series were obtained during a 7 to 10 day interval between 135 and 160 days of gestation. Data were modeled by a least squares fit to a cosine function with a period of 24 h. Hourly mean heart rate in the fetus ranged from 161 to 172 bpm (167.9Â±0.6 bpm), and the mother from 105 to 125 bpm (107.9Â±1.4 bpm). The amplitude of the daily fluctuations were 15 to 25 bpm for the fetuses and 25 to 60 bpm for the mothers. The relation between time series data and model estimates were significant (P&lt;0.001) in all cases with aggregate r2=0.747 for fetuses and 0.737 for the mothers. On average the time of day of the peak in fetal heart rate (15:05Â±0.3 h) was about 45 min after the maternal peak (14:21Â±0.4 h). This phase delay was significant (t=2.63, P&lt;0.05). There was significant (P&lt;0.01) diurnal periodicity for each of six parameters used to assess different aspects of fetal heart rate variability with peak variability at night (23:00 to 2:00). Thus, during the latter third of pregnancy in both the maternal and fetal baboon 24 h periodicities of heart rate are present with peak rates in the midafternoon. The daily rhythms in fetal heart rate are linked with periodicities in maternal heart rate with a phase delay in the majority of cases. The synchrony of 24 h fluctuations in rate with parameters of rate variability is consistent with diurnal input into the fetal autonomic nervous system.

AB  - Direct behavioral observation and motility monitoring procedures provide reliable data, and both are appropriate for sleep/wake state measurements starting immediately after birth. Using these procedures, newborn rats, rabbits, and humans were found to have a greater amount of quiet sleep on the day of birth rather than 24 hr later. Changes in active sleep and wake were inconsistent across the 2 days. The quiet sleep findings are contrary to the developmental course which increases with age. The findings are interpreted as a temporary adaptive response to the stress of the birth process.

AB  - Prenatal stress in rats has been shown to produce long-term behavioral, neuroendocrine and neurochemical changes. These changes may model aspects of human depressive illness. In this pilot investigation, adult male offspring exposed to stress in utero and nonstressed controls were studied using 24- hour electroencephalographic sleep recordings. Prenatally stressed animals demonstrated reduced latency to the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, prolongation of the first REM episode, and diminished slow-wave sleep. Although preliminary, the observed changes parallel those seen in studies of human depression. These data further support the face validity of the prenatal stress model as a potential tool for future studies on the pathophysiology of depressive disorder.

AB  - This study was undertaken to determine if a relationship existed between the duration of spontaneous general movements before and after birth. Twenty- two infants were examined three times as fetuses between 38 and 40 weeks gestational age and three times as neonates between 2 and 4 weeks postnatal age. Motor activity level during active sleep periods was quantified by direct sonographic visualization for fetuses and by videotaped images of trunk movement for neonates. We found that both fetuses and neonates exhibited stable individual differences in motor activity level. In addition, infants who moved at a certain rate as fetuses generally moved at the same relative rate as neonates up to 4-weeks postnatal age. Our findings suggested that individual differences in motor activity level in the 1st month following birth probably arise during fetal life.

AB  - The birth dates of 163 men and 245 women who were born between the years 1958 and 1969 were extracted from our data base for first-year university students. Daily aa values, measures of the amplitude of global geomagnetic activity, were obtained for the birthdays and for each of the seven days before and after the birthdays. Analyses of variance indicated no significant differences in the magnitudes of the geomagnetic activity during these 15 days; however, men were born when the geomagnetic activity was significantly higher than when the women were born. The effect, which was equivalent to a correlation coefficient of about .20, was largest for the day of birth and for the two or three days before birth. The means of the aa values for the day of birth and the day before birth for the men were about 7 nanoTesla higher than the values for the women. Â© Perceptual and Motor Skills 1999.

AB  - Objective. To define normal and abnormal patterns, test interobserver variability, and the prognostic accuracy of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) soon after the onset of neonatal encephalopathy. Methods. Consecutive cases of neonatal encephalopathy (n = 56; gestation median, 40; range, 35-42 weeks) and healthy infants (n = 14; gestation median, 40; range, 39-40 weeks) were studied, aEEG was recorded using a cerebral function monitor, at median, 0, range, 0-21 days of age. Of the infants, 24 of the 56 with encephalopathy and all of the normal infants were studied within 12 hours of birth (median, 5; range, 3-12 hours). Forty infants were suspected of having suffered birth asphyxia. Criteria for normal and abnormal patterns were defined and the interobserver variability of these classifications determined. Results were compared with neurodevelopmental outcome assessed at 18 to 24 months of age. aEEG also was compared with a standard EEG and with magnetic resonance imaging. Results. The median upper margin of the widest band of aEEG activity in the control infants was 37.5 Î¼V (range, 30-48 Î¼V), and median lower margin was 8 Î¼V (range, 6.5-11 Î¼V). We classified the aEEG background activity as normal amplitude, the upper margin of band of aEEG activity >10 Î¼V and the lower margin >5 Î¼V; moderately abnormal amplitude, the upper margin of band of aEEG activity >10 Î¼V and the lower margin â¤5 Î¼V; and suppressed amplitude, the upper margin of the band of aEEG activity <10 Î¼V and lower margin <5 Î¼V. Recordings were analyzed further for the presence of seizures, defined as periods of sudden increase in voltage accompanied by a narrowing of the band of aEEG activity. Tests of interobserver variability showed excellent agreement both for assessment of amplitude (Îº statistic = 0.85) and for identification of seizures (Îº statistic = 0.76). There was a close relationship between the aEEG and subsequent outcome: 19 of 21 infants with a normal aEEG finding were normal on follow-up at 18 to 24 months of age, whereas 27 of 35 infants with a moderately abnormal or suppressed aEEG and/or seizures died or developed neurologic abnormalities. Thus, aEEG predicted outcome with a sensitivity of 0.93, a specificity of 0.70, positive predictive value of 0.77, negative predictive value of 0.90, and the likelihood ratio of a positive result of 3.1 and a negative result of 0.06. For the 24 infants studied within 12 hours of birth, the corresponding results were sensitivity, 1.0; specificity, 0.82; positive predictive value, 0.85; negative predictive value, 1; likelihood ratio of a positive result, 5.5; and likelihood ratio of a negative result, 0.18. Conclusion. The aEEG is a simple but accurate and reproducible clinical tool that could be useful in the assessment of infants with encephalopathy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate if the alertness connected with seeing water increased arterial blood pressure and heart rate to the same extent as the act of drinking, and if ingestion of warm water caused a different effect compared with ingestion of cool water on these cardiovascular variables. Seven goats of the Swedish domestic breed (Capra hircus) were used in a cross-over design. The animals were dehydrated for 24 h. They were allowed to watch water being prepared for 11-16 min, after which they were given access to warm (35Â°C) or cool (15Â°C) water. The goats drank 6.86 Â± 0.361 of the warm water and 4.54 Â± 0.351 of the cool water (P < 0.05) within the first hour. The arterial blood pressure, heart rate and activity of the animals were registered by an implanted telemetric device. Dehydration did not affect the cardiovascular variables, except before feeding in the morning, when the heart rate accelerated faster in dehydrated goats. Heart rate increased abruptly when dehydrated goats saw water being prepared, remained at the increased level during drinking and then slowly declined. It increased again during the afternoon feeding, to a level similar to that on control days, but between 18.00 and 06.00 h the heart rate was higher than during control nights. Blood pressure did not change when the goats saw water, but increased when they drank. On the morning following rehydration, the rise in heart rate in response to feeding was delayed compared with that during control and dehydration periods. It is concluded that seeing water caused arousal in the goats, resulting in an accelerated heart rate. The additional rise in blood pressure during the act of drinking appears to be a combination of excitement and sensory inputs from the pharyngeal region, causing a temporary activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

AB  - The National Sleep Foundation in conjunction with the Gallup Organization conducted telephone interviews with a sample of Americans (N=1000) to examine the prevalence and nature of difficulty with sleep. Consistent with other national studies, about one-third of Americans reported some type of sleep problem. Approximately one in four reported occasional insomnia while 9% reported that their sleep difficulty occurred on a regular nightly basis. The problem most frequently reported by insomniacs was waking up in the morning feeling drowsy or tired, followed by waking up in the middle of the night, difficulty going back to sleep after waking up and difficulty falling asleep initially. Importantly, insomniacs rarely visited a physician to discuss their sleep problem and four out of ten insomniacs self- medicated with either over-the-counter medications or with alcohol. Two- thirds of the insomniacs reported that they did not have an understanding of available treatments for insomnia.

AB  - Background: A reported association between congenital central hypoventilation, long-segment intestinal aganglionosis (Hirschsprung disease), and autonomic dysfunction, with a high recurrence risk and mortality rate, is associated with abnormal neural crest development (neurocristopathy). Case: A fetus had increasing polyhydramnios, no stomach bubble, and repeatedly nonreactive fetal heart rate tracings despite normal activity. There were no other fetal anomalies on ultrasound. Postnatally all of the above clinical features were diagnosed, prompting diagnosis of neurocristopathy syndrome. She died at 2 weeks of age. Conclusion: Antenatal polyhydramnios, nonreactive nonstress tests, and absent stomach bubble in an active fetus indicated neurocristopathy.

AB  - Leg cramps in pregnancy, defined as painful spasms of the calf, were investigated among women giving birth at the maternity ward at Baerum Hospital from 1 October to 20 October 1997. A questionnaire distributed to 120 women three days after parturition revealed that 45% had suffered from leg cramps during pregnancy. Among 54% of them the cramps appeared after the 25th week of pregnancy. 76% of the women had experienced the symptoms twice per week or less often; 81% of them suffered from painful cramps only during night-time. We conclude that leg cramps are still a common symptom in pregnancy and may compromise sleep and hence the ability to work.

AB  - At many locations in the northern hemisphere human sperm counts are reduced during the summer. Experiments with rhesus monkeys suggest that such seasonal variation may be induced by an endogenous biological clock reset annually by changes in the length of daylight. Little is known about seasonal variation in human female reproductive function, although fecundity may be lower during the summer, as it is for men. Variation in fecundity could help explain seasonal patterns of birth in countries such as the United States, where there is a deficit of spring births. But the relationship to patterns of birth in Canada and Europe, where the birth rate is highest during late winter and spring, is unclear.

AB  - We have previously shown that during the post-natal critical period of development of the cat visual system, 1 week of instrumental rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation (IRSD) during 2 weeks of monocular deprivation (MD) results in significant amplification of the effects of solely the 2-week MD on cell-size in the binocular segment of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) [36,40]. In this study, we examined whether elimination of ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO)-wave phasic activity in the LGN during REM sleep (REMS), rather than suppression of all REMS state-related activity, would similarly yield enhanced plasticity effects on cell-size in LGN. PGO-activity was eliminated in LGN by bilateral pontomesencephalic lesions [8,32]. This method of removing phasic activation at the level of the LGN preserved sleep and wake proportions as well as the tonic activities (low voltage, fast frequency ECoG and low amplitude EMG) that characterize REM sleep. The lesions were performed in kittens on post-natal day 42, at the end of the first week of the 2-week period of MD, the same age when IRSD was started in the earlier study. LGN interlaminar cell-size disparity increased in the PGO-wave-suppressed animals as it had in behaviorally REM sleep- deprived animals. Smaller A1/A-interlaminar ratios reflect the increased disparity effect in both the REM sleep- and PGO-suppressed groups compared to animals subjected to MD-alone. With IRSD, the effect was achieved because the occluded eye-related, LGN A1-lamina cells tended to be smaller relative to their size after MD-alone, whereas after PGO-suppressing lesions, the A1- lamina cells retained their size and the non-occluded eye-related, A-lamina cells tended to be larger than after MD-alone. Despite this difference, for which several possible explanations are offered, these A1/A-interlaminar ratio data indicate that in conjunction either with suppression of the whole of the REMS state or selective removal of REM sleep phasic activity at the LGN, altered visual input evokes more LGN cell plasticity during the developmental period than it would otherwise. These data further support involvement of the REM sleep state in reducing susceptibility to plasticity changes and undesirable variability in the course of normative CNS growth and maturation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the sleep-wake cycle during the period from late pregnancy to about 3 months of postpartum by evaluating the number of actigraphic activities in four women (one multipara and three primi gravidae), and to compare the results with the findings from sleep logs. An irregularity of the sleep-wake cycle with increased number of wakings at night was notable during about l month after delivery, compared to the late pregnancy period, and subsequently this number tended to decrease. These results were indicative of the association between the lactation cycle to neonates and the sleep-wake cycle.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that pregnancy-associated sleep enhancement is correlated with the daily surges of prolactin (PRL). However, in spite of a surge of PRL in the proestrus night, a reduction of nocturnal sleep occurs in phase with proestrus. Therefore, to clarify the physiological role of PRL in sleep regulation during the estrous cycle, time-course changes in sleep were analyzed in bromocriptine (CB-154)-treated and/or PRL-supplemented female rats. Sleep patterns characteristic of proestrus-to-estrus were not affected by the CB-154 treatment. In contrast, nocturnal rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) was significantly increased after the PRL supplementation. The CB-154 treatment diminished the REMS-enhancing effect of PRL. Thus, the results suggest that the endogenous PRL is not crucial for the regulation of sleep during the estrous cycle, while exogenous PRL can enhance REMS.

AB  - In order to investigate mothers' sleep-wake patterns from five to 12 weeks in the postpartum period, we analyzed continuous sleep logs. Data for 341 days from seven mothers were analyzed for each postpartum week. There were significant differences in total sleep time and wake time at night. Wake time at night gradually decreased from the fifth to the twelfth week. These results from continuous sleep logs support the results of our previous polysomnographic findings based on intermittent measurements. A transition from interrupted sleep to noninterrupted sleep was observed from the ninth to twelfth week of postpartum. The mothers' sleep-wake patterns are discussed focusing on their relationships to the infants' sleep-wake patterns and feeding rhythm.

AB  - Shift work and night work in particular have been associated with sleep difficulties, general malaise, fatigue, peptic ulceration, ischaemic heart disease, cigarette smoking and adverse pregnancy outcome. The medical conditions previously regarded as making individuals unsuitable for shift work show wide ranging patho-physiological activity and there is no published evidence for any such condition to be regarded an absolute reason to exclude an individual from shift work. The fulfilment of the legal obligations of the Working Time Regulations 1998 is neither prescribed nor constrained in any way. It is advisable therefore to build on existing health procedures where they are in effect. Periodic health questionnaires can offer health professionals an opportunity to detect any disorder likely to be aggravated by shift work or by a combination of shift work, job demands and workplace conditions. A further purpose of the questionnaire is the assessment of ability to undertake shift work duties. However, health questionnaires are neither sensitive nor specific enough to be used to select applicants or employees for shift work, since they do not consistently predict tolerance of shift work or subsequent health problems. Whether employers should offer anything more than a simple questionnaire will depend on the culture of the company and accessibility of health services. Screening programmes affect many people relative to the few who benefit and with existing knowledge, periodic general health examinations performed in asymptomatic subjects have limited predictive or preventive value.

AB  - Three hundred and forty-nine (349) patients with pruritic atopic dermatitis who provided written informed consent participated in this study. To enter, patients had to have experienced moderate to severe pruritis accompanying their eczematous lesions daily for at least 1 week prior to enrollment, a family history of atopy and/or a personal history of atopic dermatitis 25% or less body surface area affected by atopic dermatitis, and good general health. After enrollment, patients were required to discontinue systemic corticosteroids at least 4 weeks prior to study entry as well as antipruritic and central nervous system-active medications at least 1 week before entry. In addition, no topical medications were permitted to be applied to treatment sites for at least 2 days before entry. Patients who had infected treatment sites, other concurrent cutaneous conditions, or who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from the study. This was an 8-day multicenter double-blind parallel-design study assessing the effects of adding topical doxepin to topical corticosteroid treatment vs. the topical corticosteroid treatment itself. All test products were incorporated in an identical cream base to that for doxepin hydrochloride cream. Using a computer-generated randomization schedule, patients were assigned to treatment groups receiving creams containing: (1) 2.5% hydrocortisone; (2) 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide; (3) 2.5% hydrocortisone and 5% doxepin hydrochloride; (4) 0.1% severity acetonide and 5% doxepin hydrochloride. Patients were instructed to apply the study cream four times daily for 8 days of treatment. The physician initially rated the patients' pruritis as mild, moderate, or severe, and their atopic dermatitis as mild, moderate, marked, or severe. A baseline visual analog scale (VAS) for pruritis severity, consisting of a 100-mm horizontal line labeled 'no itch' and 'worst itch imaginable' at opposite ends, was completed by the patients to quantify the intensity of pruritis experienced during the week before study entry and daily during the study. Additionally, daily during the study, each patient completed a VAS for pruritis relief by marking a 100-mm vertical line labeled 'no relief from itching' and 'complete relief from itching' at opposite ends. After the baseline evaluation, subsequent visits were scheduled for days 2, 3, 4, and 8. At each visit, the physician reviewed the patient's daily VASs to record a global evaluation of pruritis relief and rated the overall change in dermatitis on a five-point scale ranging from much worse to much better. Any reports of adverse effects were also recorded. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the VAS for pruritis severity. With the use of the row mean score with ridit assigned scores, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) analysis for ordered response categories was performed in the analysis of the physicians' global evaluations (pruritis and dermatitis). Intent-to-treat analysis was used for all efficacy variables. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05 (two-tailed).

AB  - Our previous studies demonstrated that nicotine induces c-fos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the rat during a narrow developmental window occurring in the perinatal period. We have extended these observations by showing that c-fos cannot be induced in the adult SCN by nicotine even during the subjective night, when phase shifts do occur. In contrast to the SCN, significant induction of c-fos and NGFI-A was observed in the medial habenula and paraventricular nucleus at all circadian times. In the fetal rat SCN we show that NGFI-A and junB are also induced by nicotine, but not c- jun. To investigate whether changes in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression in the SCN may underlie this change in sensitivity during the perinatal period, we examined nAChR mRNAs across this developmental period. By Northern analyses, Î±2, Î±3 and Î±4 subunit mRNAs are relatively abundant in the fetal SCN but decline substantially in the adult. Î±7 mRNA increases substantially while Î²2 mRNA is relatively abundant throughout development. We also examine expression in the whole mouse brain beginning at embryonic day 11. Many mRNA sizes for nAChR subunits in both the rat and mouse are characterized here for the first time by Northern analyses and some show very large changes in expression across development. In particular, a small 1.4 kb Î±2-related mRNA is highly expressed during early development, perhaps indicating an important novel function for this subunit.

AB  - Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that daily plasma prolactin (Prl) levels were higher in the evening than in the morning in the pregnant baboon suggesting a diurnal variation. The goal of this study was to examine in more detail the diurnal alterations in plasma Prl levels. A tethered pregnant baboon model was utilized for these studies. Hourly venous blood samples were taken from 0700 to 2400 hr (n=10) or until 0700 hr the following day (n=5). The studies were performed at various days of pregnancy from day 135 until delivery. Plasma samples were analyzed for Prl by radioimmunoassay. A surge in plasma Prl was detected, starting around 1500 to 1600 hr and lasting for 3 to 5 hr. The surge occurred before the lights went off in the colony (1800 hr). Baseline Prl levels were higher in animals < 15 days before delivery compared to those > 15 days before delivery (P < 0.05). In contrast, no differences were found in the average peak Prl values between these two groups of animals. In summary, in the pregnant baboon during the last one-third of pregnancy plasma Prl surges, beginning around 1500 to 1600 hr and lasting for 3 to 5 hr. Less than 15 days before delivery the mean baseline Prl levels are higher compared to animals greater than 15 days before delivery.

AB  - Cigarette smoking during pregnancy increases the incidence of perinatal mortality and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). We have evaluated prenatal or postnatal nicotine exposure in developing rats to examine the potential role of altered neurotransmitter receptor expression in these processes. Pregnant rats received continuous infusions of nicotine throughout gestation, at doses mimicking the plasma levels found in smokers. After birth, cardiac M2-muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which are responsible for inhibitory autonomic actions, were enhanced in the nicotine group, coincidentally with decreases in stimulatory Î²-adrenergic receptors that have been demonstrated previously. Studies of adenylyl cyclase activity confirmed that the changes in receptor binding represented functional alterations: the stimulatory response to isoproterenol was obtunded by prenatal nicotine exposure, whereas the inhibitory response to carbachol was enhanced. Elevations of M2- muscarinic receptor binding were not generalized to all tissues, as the same prenatal nicotine treatment elicited a reduction in these receptors in the brainstem, an effect that has also been noted in infants who died of SIDS; we found no effects of prenatal nicotine on brainstem M1-receptor binding. Postnatal administration of nicotine produced similar brainstem receptor effects when treatment was conducted during the first postnatal week but not thereafter; postnatal nicotine treatment did not affect cardiac M2-receptor binding. Thus, during a critical developmental period, nicotine exposure produces cardiac and brainstem receptor imbalances that favor inhibitory responses, effects that can contribute to morbidity and mortality evoked by hypoxic episodes, such as those experienced during parturition, sleep apnea or airway obstruction.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure relate to the time of day, reproductive period and feeding routines in dairy goats (Capra hircus). Registrations were made by radiotelemetry in the same four goats during pregnancy, lactation and the non-pregnant, non-lactating (dry) period. Heart rate rose around the morning and afternoon feedings, whereas blood pressure did not show any diurnal rhythm. Comparison between reproductive periods revealed that heart rate was higher during the fifth month of pregnancy than during lactation and the dry period, whereas for blood pressure no such differences between periods were found. Withholding three meals from lactating goats resulted in a continuous slowdown of the heart rate, whereas blood pressure fluctuated. Re-feeding temporarily increased the heart rate but had no effect on blood pressure which continued to fluctuate. After another 2 days, blood pressure (but not heart rate) had stabilized. Food-restriction, aimed at terminating milk production resulted in a consistently depressed heart rate and reduced the mean and systolic blood pressures at night. The results show that with this implantable telemetry device it is possible to measure both heart rate and blood pressure day and night in the same unrestrained animals over a length of time long enough to include all reproductive periods. Our results emphasize that when planning experiments it is important that the exact stage in each reproductive period, the act of feeding and the amount of food given be taken into account.

AB  - Until the introduction of the first atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, in 1975, hyperprolactinemia was assumed to be an inevitable consequence of treatment with any antipsychotic agent. Now we know that atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, sertindole, and ziprasidone are not associated with significant prolactin increase. These new antipsychotics appear to spare dopamine blockade within the brain's tubero- infundibular tract, a dopamine pathway that also controls prolactin secretion. Since the release of prolactin is tonically inhibited by the hypothalamus, with dopamine acting as the prolactin release-inhibiting factor, any disruption of the connection between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland is associated with hyperprolactinemia. Other factors that can increase prolactin secretion are also reviewed (e.g. estrogens, thyroid- releasing factor, vasoactive intestinal peptides, opioids, surgery, illness such as epilepsy or herpes zoster infection, and psychic or physical stress). Prolactin levels are at their highest 1-2 hours before waking, and early waking interrupts its secretion. The major effects of hyperprolactinemia in women are amenorrhea, cessation of normal cyclic ovarian function, loss of libido, occasional hirsutism, and increased long-term risk of osteoporosis. The effects in men are impotence, loss of libido, and hypospermatogenesis. Current data indicate that conventional antipsychotics, as well as high doses of risperidone (> 6 mg/day), increase prolactin levels to a range associated with sexual dysfunction in nonpsychiatric patients. The lack of prolactin elevation reported with the atypical antipsychotics is believed to be due to their much greater specificity, which results in less blockade of dopamine receptors in the tubero-infundibular pathway.

AB  - Changes in prenatal care practices resulted from a pilot study with 12 urban New Mexican women who received no prenatal care. The women were interviewed regarding their reasons for not receiving care during pregnancy, health behaviors, and perceived neonatal outcomes. Data on actual neonatal outcomes were taken from the medical record. Maternal reasons for no prenatal care were socio-demographic, system-related, attitudinal, and outside forces of job and childcare. To ensure a healthy baby, the women made changes in their nutrition, self-care activities, substance use, sleep, and exercise activities. All of the women perceived they had a healthy baby. Yet 61% of the neonates had complications and 45% were low birth weight. The research findings were used to develop a care management program that included case management and utilization management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. ACTH-producing non-pituitary tumours are often associated with altered precursor processing, particularly in the most aggressive ones. Since placental tissue is characterized by its ability to express the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and rapid cellular proliferation, we examined whether intact POMC could be released physiologically during human gestation. SUBJECTS. One hundred and fifty six normal pregnant women, 12 with multiple pregnancies, and 23 non-pregnant controls. Twenty-eight women mere studied in the immediate postpartum period. MEASUREMENTS. We measured plasma POMC levels with a specific immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) using a combination of antibodies directed against ACTH and Î² endorphin. Results obtained with this first IRMA were confirmed in 22 subjects with a second assay using the same Î² endorphin antibody and a more distal antibody directed against the N- terminal fragment of POMC. Reverse transcription-PCR detected full length, pituitary-like, POMC mRNA in human placenta. RESULTS. Plasma POMC was undetectable (<60 U/ml) in 23 normal subjects. In normal monofetal pregnancies, POMC became detectable in most women by the third month and then increased steadily until mid-gestation: 168 Â± 108 (U/ml; mean Â± SD) between 12 and 15 weeks, 190 Â± 103 between 16 and 19 weeks, 324 Â± 180 between 20 and 23 weeks, 276 Â± 171 between 24 and 27 weeks, 292 Â± 177 between 28 and 31 weeks, 290 Â± 235 between 32 and 35 weeks and 308 Â± 210 between 36 weeks and parturition. Plasma POMC was significantly higher in multiple pregnancies with very high levels in three triplet-bearing mothers: 671, 941, and 1731 U/ml at 31, 33 and 32 weeks, respectively. POMC levels felt quickly in post partum, becoming undetectable in five of 13 women on day 1, seven of eight on day 2 and five of six on day 3. Plasma POMC displayed no diurnal variation, was not suppressed by glucocorticoid administration and did not correlate with plasma ACTH or cortisol. In contrast, plasma POMC positively correlated with plasma CRH. CONCLUSIONS. Pregnancy is the only condition in which POMC is produced and released physiologically, similar in some respects to the ectopic ACTH syndrome. POMC is derived solely from the placenta, with no interference from maternal pituitary secretion, and is thus a new and specific placental marker.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The object of the study was to characterize daily values and patterns of salivary estriol levels during normal pregnancy at mid to late gestation. STUDY DESIGN: We measured salivary estriol levels in a clinical research center setting with an established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fourteen pregnant women (24-36 weeks' gestation) submitted unstimulated saliva samples hourly from 10:00 am until 10:00 pm and at midnight and 2:00, 4-00, 6:00, and 8:00 am. RESULTS: Each subject demonstrated greater salivary estriol levels at night (10:00 pm-6:00 am) than in the daytime (8:00 am-9:00 pm, P < .001). Salivary estriol levels consistently increased at 10-00 pm, peaked at 4:00 am, and returned to daytime levels between 6:00 and 7:00 am. Salivary estriol concentrations were stable during daylight hours. CONCLUSIONS: (1) There was a dramatic diurnal variation in salivary estriol levels (nadir during daylight with nighttime apogee). (2) Diurnal patterns and salivary estriol levels were consistent in each of 14 subjects evaluated in the latter half of pregnancy. Samples for baseline measurements of salivary estriol level should be obtained during daylight hours (8:00 am-8:00 pm).

AB  - Using a standardised procedure, 20 women who were 37 weeks pregnant logged fetal movements for 1 h in the morning and evening for 3 days. Close agreement between such logs and ultrasound recordings of individual differences in fetal movements have been documented. After birth, the babies' sleeping, waking, feeding and crying behaviour were recorded prospectively in validated behaviour diaries at 1, 6 and 12 weeks of age.The fetal movements showed an evening peak, due to a diurnal variation in strong movements. These strong movements did not predict the babies' crying. Weak fetal movements provided a reliable index of fetal differences and predicted the amounts the babies cried at 1, 6 and 12 weeks of age. The findings suggest that temperament-like dispositions present before babies are born predict how much they are likely to cry. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - We previously demonstrated high leptin levels during late pregnancy in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus). We now extend these observations to a second species, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), and also report that leptin increases after the first trimester of pregnancy. Leptin decreased to baseline 1 week following parturition, with a half-time decay of 2 days. During lactation, leptin was significantly correlated with body mass in E. fuscus, but not in M. lucifugus. No circadian pattern of leptin was observed in M. lucifugus. The decrease in post-partum leptin in bats may be partly explained by loss of putative placental leptin. The continued decrease may reflect depletion of body fat during this energy demanding period, at least in Eptesicus. Changes in leptin during lactation appeared to be independent of circadian effects and time of sampling. Our study provides additional evidence that leptin increases during pregnancy and declines during lactation in a free-ranging mammal, supporting the hypothesis that leptin plays important but yet undetermined roles in reproduction.

AB  - The cardiac orienting reflex is elicited by a low-intensity sound, it consists of a sustained heart rate (HR) deceleration, and it is a specific physiological correlate of cognitive processing. In this study we examined the relationship between behavioral state and the cardiac orienting reflex in 75 human fetuses between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated with a 30-s speech sound at an average intensity of 83 dB SPL in quiet sleep (QS) and active sleep (AS). The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on HR pattern and the presence or absence of eye and general body movements. We found that a significant HR deceleration occurred, in both QS and AS, following stimulus onset. However, HR decelerations occurred more often in QS than AS; and for fetuses exhibiting a HR deceleration, the magnitude of the deceleration was greater in AS compared to QS. In addition, in AS female fetuses exhibited a larger, more sustained HR deceleratory response than male fetuses, but the secondsxgender interaction in QS was not significant. Based on these results, we concluded that behavioral state is an important determinant of the HR deceleratory response in human fetuses. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To identify the levels of grief and depression and the coping mechanisms of women with infertility problems who participated in in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation-induction medication. Methods: Pretest and post-test data were obtained from 50 IVF and 50 ovulation-induction medication patients receiving treatment at two urban infertility centers. Results: Both groups of women experienced measurable levels of grief and depression before, during, and after treatment. Higher scores on the Grief Experience Inventory were found for both groups of women when pregnancy did not occur. Age, reproductive problems, years infertile, financial impact, and number of past IVF cycles were not found to influence the reported grief or depression levels. Women in the IVF and ovulation-induction medication groups used isolation coping behaviors such as self-talk and sleep. Conclusion: Because of moderate to high levels of grief and depression, therapeutic counseling may be more effective if initiated before the infertility treatment. Women's present levels of distress and coping strategies should be assessed prior to initiating infertility treatment to provide the patients with opportunities to learn and practice new adaptive behaviors that could enhance their ability to cope with infertility and the associated medical procedures.

AB  - Objective: To establish the influence of fetal behavior states on venous and arterial pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms in the normally developing term fetus. Methods: The relation between venous and arterial pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms and fetal behavior states was investigated in 18 normal term fetuses. Recordings of the venous pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained just proximal to the entrance in the left atrium, and the arterial pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms were taken from the most proximal branch of the pulmonary artery in the same lung using color Doppler imaging. Time-averaged peak systolic, peak diastolic, and end-diastolic flow velocity; peak systolic to peak diastolic ratio; pulsatility index; and fetal heart rate were calculated from both venous and arterial Doppler recordings obtained during behavior states 1F (quiet sleep) and 2F (active sleep). Fetal behavior states were determined from combined recordings of fetal eye and body movements. Results: Recordings of sufficient quality for analysis were obtained from ten fetuses. Venous pulmonary blood flow velocity waveforms demonstrated a statistically significant increase in time-averaged peak diastolic and end-diastolic velocity during fetal behavior state 2F. No behavior-state-related changes were observed for the arterial pulmonary blood flow velocity waveform. Conclusion: The data suggest an increased pressure gradient between the pulmonary venous system and the left atrium during behavior state 2F. Flow velocity waveforms from the proximal arterial pulmonary branch are independent of behavioral state.

AB  - Significant differences in urinary excretion of N-acetyl-Î²-glycosaminidase (NAG) were observed between nulliparous and multiparous patients and between fasted and nonfasted individuals. No significant difference was observed between patients with normal and those with abnormal glucose tolerance. Multiple regression analysis confirmed that the significant independent determinants of NAG/creatinine ratio were age, parity, gestation and fasting state. Significant diurnal variation in urinary NAG/Cr ratio was observed, the highest levels being recorded in early morning fasting specimens, falling in each postprandial specimen and beginning to rise again by midnight. The urinary NAG/Cr ratio is influenced by fasting, parity, gestation and age. More consistent results for prediction of pre-eclampsia are therefore likely to be obtained using fasting (early morning) urine specimens and adjusting cut-off criteria for the other factors.

AB  - Maternal cues entrain a circadian pacemaker in fetal Syrian hamsters. These cues may act through dopaminergic activation of the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN); injection of the dopamine D1 agonist SKF38393 to pregnant hamsters entrains activity rhythms of their pups and induces expression of c-los in the fetal SCN. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of SKF38393 to entrain neonatal Syrian hamsters and to determine the age at which this effect is lost. SKF38393 injections given to two groups of pups at opposite times of day on postnatal days (PN) 1-5 entrained the pups' activity rhythms to average phases that differed by 9.25 h. SKF38393 failed to establish different average phases when given on PN 6-10. Injection of SKF38393 on PN 1, but not PN 6, induced expression of Fos. These results demonstrate that dopaminergic activation is a potent entraining stimulus in neonatal hamsters and that its entraining effects, as well as its ability to induce Fos, are lost by PN 6. The phase established by dopaminergic activation was approximately opposite to that previously shown to be established by melatonin injections. Dopaminergic activation and melatonin may mimic separate but complementary maternal entraining signals which represent day and night.

AB  - Melatonin is a principal hormone of the vertebrate pineal gland. Its production, being under control of a circadian oscillator, follows circadian rhythmicity with high values at night and low values during day-hours. As the nocturnal production of melatonin is proportional to the length of the night (or dark phase of an imposed light-dark illumination cycle), the hormone conveys an important chronobiological message to the whole body, playing the role of a biochemical clock and calendar. This article surveys a current knowledge on regulation of melatonin biosynthesis, receptors and function, and particularly provides a comprehensive view of the role the hormone may play in the vertebrate circadian system.

AB  - Ten pregnant Sprague Dawley rat dams were exposed to spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle (STS-70) for gestational days 11-20 (G 11-20; FLT group). Control dams were maintained in either a flight-like (FDS group) or vivarium cage environment (VIV group) on earth. All dams had ad lib access to food and water and were exposed to a light-dark cycle consisting of 12 hours of light (approximately 30 lux) followed by 12 hours of darkness. The dams were closely monitored from G 22 until parturition. All pups were cross-fostered at birth; each foster dam had a litter of 10 pups. Pups remained with their foster dam until post natal day 21 (PN 21). Pup body mass was measured twice weekly. At PN 14 FLT pups had a smaller body mass than did the VIV pups (p < 0.01). Circadian rhythms of body temperature and activity of pups from two FLT dams (n = 8), two FDS dams (n = 9) and two VIV dams (n = 7) were studied starting from age PN 21. All pups had circadian rhythms of temperature and activity at this age. There were no significant differences in rhythms between groups that could be attributed to microgravity exposure. These results indicate that exposure to the microgravity environment of spaceflight during this embryonic development period does not affect the development of the circadian rhythms of body temperature and activity.

AB  - The circadian rhythm of arterial pressure (AP) is not a passive consequence of the impact of exogenous factors. Endogenous mechanisms play an important role in the generation and maintenance of AP rhythm. The adaptation of the exogenous components of AP rhythm to the demands of the environment is modulated by the circadian-time-dependent responsiveness of the biologic oscillator. A neuronal network in the rostral hypothalamus including the suprachiasmatic nucleus is implicated in the generation of AP rhythm, in the modification of the rhythm amplitude (possibly due to homeostatic constraints), and in the regulation of its phase. The central sympathoexcitatory pathway to the upper thoracic cord plays a crucial role in the maintenance of normal circadian AP rhythm. The circadian pattern of AP is influenced also by hormonal factors such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, opioids, and various vasoactive peptides. The circadian variations of AP depend on physiological state--sleep and wakefulness, pregnancy, work, and senescence (primary aging). In some essential hypertensive patients and in patients with secondary hypertension the nocturnal fall in AP is reduced or absent (nondippers). Target-organ damage is more advanced in nondippers than in dippers. The occurrence of cardiovascular events exhibits a prominent circadian pattern, with events more frequent in the morning (06:00-12:00 h).

AB  - Arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) of 31 hospitalized pregnant women at low risk of hypertension were automatically monitored for 48 h at 15-min intervals. Each of the recorded 56 data series for systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and HR was chronobiologically assessed by linear-nonlinear rhythmometry. The rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR), circadian amplitude, circadian acrophase, and best-fitting period were grouped by pregnancy trimester and further subjected to analysis of variance. BP MESOR remained unaltered, whereas HR MESOR increased significantly in middle and late pregnancy. Ultradian rhythms, with an amplitude higher than that of the circadian rhythm, were found in 25% of the SAP records in the second and third trimester. Such ultradian rhythms were not detected in the simultaneously recorded HR. Finally, the group BP and HR circadian acrophases coincided in the first trimester, but were significantly apart in mid and late pregnancy. These observations support the notion that the coordination of BP and HR rhythmicity involves different physiological mechanisms. Analysis of the individual variability in the chronobiological end points (based on the records of nine women monitored in each pregnancy trimester) revealed that only the BP MESOR was well reproducible in the course of pregnancy and may be useful in early diagnosis of gestational hypertension.

AB  - In this perspective article, the authors focus on gender as it relates to pulmonary disease. The very real threat of smoking and lung cancer has been recognized, but gender-related issues in other conditions have not been emphasized. There are minor differences in bronchial responsiveness and breathing mechanics between men and women. The subconscious conversion disorder of vocal cord dyskinesis occurs predominantly in young adult women. Sleep apnea and sleep-disordered breathing have a prevalence of 4% in men and 2% in women, aged 30 to 60 years. Many of these women may go unrecognized or be labeled with chronic fatigue syndrome if a good history for sleep disorders is not obtained. Primary pulmonary hypertension is more common in women than men but only by 1.7 to 1.0 for all ages. With further review of the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) data, the correlation of pulmonary embolism to estrogen use, child-bearing, and an increased incidence of thrombophlebitis has not been as strong as previously reported. Diseases such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and the catamenial syndromes of pneumothorax, pleural effusions, and/or hemoptysis are unique to women but often present as perplexing clinical problems. The premenstrual exacerbation of asthma has been reported with increasing frequency. As evidence-based medical literature accumulates, gender-related differences and similarities will be clarified by studies with both men and women as subjects.

AB  - Lipid peroxidation is thought to be important in numerous disease states, including pregnancy complications. Study of its role requires markers, but the variability of available markers in non-diseased populations has not been well-characterized. We examined the variability over time of blood lipid hydroperoxides, as measured by iodometric analysis, in 49 healthy young women, 21 nonpregnant and 28 pregnant. Lipid hydroperoxides from the same woman were very similar from one day to the next but were less stable over periods of a month or more. The correlation between measurements on consecutive days was 0.98; the correlation between measurements a month or more apart was 0.11. Variability over time was not attributable to seasonal effects or, among the pregnant women, to differences over the course of pregnancy. Knowledge of the variability of this and other markers of oxidative damage enables the development of appropriate study designs.

AB  - In investigating mechanisms underlying intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), circulating melatonin and cortisol were radioimmunoassayed. Blood samples were collected every 4 hours during 24 hours on a strict 24-hour standardized routine in hospital from two groups of women in their third trimester of pregnancy. One group consisted of 14 healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies (HAGA); the other group consisted of 11 pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) confirmed at birth. The circadian characteristics of melatonin and cortisol were assessed for each woman and compared between the two groups by analyses of variance for repeated measures and by parameter tests based on the cosinor. Since a circasemiannual (about half-yearly) component prominently characterizes body weight and length at birth of children with birth characteristics below usual norms, the circadian characteristics of melatonin and cortisol were also analyzed transversely (across women within each group). The 24-hour average and the 24-hour and 12-hour amplitudes of melatonin of women in the IUGR, but not in the HAGA group, were indeed found to be modulated by an about half-yearly component. This study confirms the circadian rhythmicity of melatonin in healthy pregnant women and extends the finding to pregnancies complicated by IUGR, uncovering about half-yearly changes in melatonin in women with IUGR, thereby extending results obtained in healthy non-pregnant women and men. These variations may reflect influences from geomagnetic disturbances also characterized by a prominent half-yearly pattern, to which the pineal has been shown to be sensitive.

AB  - A study was carried out between September 1997 and August 1998 to determine the frequency of occurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms in pregnant women and to establish their significance in relation to infection through bacteriological examination. About 47% did complain of having single or multiple lower urinary symptoms. There were 41% nulliparous and 59% multiparous women and in 52% cases gestational age was > 31 weeks. The most commonly encountered problem was abnormal voiding patterns found in 84% of participants, followed by irritative manifestation 47%, urinary incontinence 37% and voiding difficulties 10%. Significant pyuria (>6 pus cells per high power field) was found in 19% cases and bacterial growth was demonstrated in 8% of women. The cases with positive bacterial growth mostly had the problems of increased diurnal frequency and/or nocturia, dysuria and urgency. Prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was found to be significantly higher among these cases as compared to the cases who had no bacteriological evidence of cystitis.

AB  - Objective. Preliminary reports suggest that antenatal steroid administration may confound the assessment of fetal well-being by suppressing biophysical activities, consequently drug-induced effects could prompt unwarranted delivery of premature fetuses. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of antenatal betamethasone administration on fetal biophysical activities and Doppler flow indices of the umbilical and middle cerebral circulation. Methods. Forty women at risk of premature delivery between 27-32 weeks gestation (mean 30.2 weeks) received two consecutive doses of intramuscular betamethasone, 24 hours apart. Ultrasonographic observations of fetal behavior for 30 minute periods and Doppler examination of the umbilical and cerebral arteries were performed prior to (0 hours), 48 hours after, and 96 hours after administration of the first dose. To account for fetal circadian rhythms and maternal prandial status, all examinations were carefully timed and performed between 1-4 pm. Analysis of Variance, chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test were used for statistical analysis, as appropriate. Results. Nine patients were excluded from analysis due to delivery prior to completion of all examinations. Number of breathing episodes as well as total breathing time at 48 hours decreased by 83.0% (p < 0.01) and 90.4% (p < 0.01), respectively, at 48 hours in comparison to baseline. Fetal limb and trunk movements decreased by 53.2% (p < 0.01) and 48.6% p < 0.01), respectively. Amniotic fluid volume and fetal tone were normal in all patients. At 48 hours, 14 of 31 fetuses and 4 of 31 fetuses had a biophysical profile score of 6/8 and 4/8, respectively, in comparison to 0 of 31 and 0 of 31 at 0 hours (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). All parameters returned to baseline values at 96 h. Pulsatility indices of umbilical and middle cerebral arteries remained unchanged at 48 hours and 96 hours (p = NS). Conclusions. Betamethasone induces a profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal breathing, limb and trunk movements, resulting in decreased biophysical profile scores. Awareness of this drug-induced effect might prevent unnecessary iatrogenic delivery of preterm fetuses.

AB  - Seasonal infertility in sows is a problem in the pig industry characterized by delayed onset of puberty in summer and decreased farrowing rate resulting from silent oestrus and aborted pregnancy. Summer infertility is thought to be influenced by heat, sunburn and stress. However, the strongest contributory factor is photoperiod. The difference in seasonality between wild boar and commercial pig breeds suggests that there may be a genetic component to this trait. The maps and associated molecular tools emerging from the pig genome project have created opportunities to examine the genetic component of seasonal infertility. We are identifying and mapping genes that are likely to be involved in biological clock mechanisms and the melatonin pathways as candidate seasonality genes.

AB  - Objective: Changes in vasoactive hormones are reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia linking placental hypoperfusion with hypertension, systemic disease, and proteinuria. We, therefore, studied diurnal patterns of vasoactive hormones in mild preeclampsia. Methods: Venous blood samples were drawn every 2 h over 25 h for measurements of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), norepinephrine, renin activity, and aldosterone and two urine collections (12 h each) for stable prostaglandin metabolite measurements. The patients were nine women with mild preeclampsia and, for comparison, nine control women matched for gestation and parity. Results: Women with mild preeclampsia had higher norepinephrine levels throughout 25 h, and lower systemic prostacyclin production as measured by the urinary 2,3-dinor-6- keto-PGF(1Î±) excretion during the daytime. Plasma endothelin and ANP and BNP concentrations tended to be higher throughout 25 h in preeclampsia, but differences between the two groups did not reach levels of statistical significance. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone did not differ between the groups. Whereas control women exhibited a diurnal variation in plasma norepinephrine, ANP, BNP, and aldosterone, and in both urinary prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 metabolites, this was less distinct or absent in patients with mild preeclampsia. Conclusions: We conclude that mild preeclampsia is associated with elevated plasma norepinephrine levels, lower systemic daytime production of prostacyclin, and blunting of the normal diurnal variation for a number of indices including plasma levels of BNP, ANP, norepinephrine, and aldosterone, and urinary prostacyclin metabolites.

AB  - A literature search from 1993 to 1997 using MEDLINE and keywords beverages, muscle cramps, and quinine was performed. Three beverages containing quinine were examined in grocery stores. Analysis indicated that leg cramps are a common phenomenon associated with many comorbid disorders especially peripheral vascular and neurologic disorders. Thus, evaluation of a patient's complaining of leg cramps appropriately includes vascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal examinations. Laboratory investigation of the symptom of leg cramps warrants as a minimum, assessment of thyroid function and determination of platelet counts and serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium. A few small studies suggest that quinine is effective in decreasing the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps but not their severity or duration. Quinine consumed in commercial beverages has been reported to cause potentially fatal immunologically mediated hypersensitivity reactions. The concentration of quinine in commercial beverages varies greatly. Although commercial beverages containing quinine generally are labeled "Contains quinine," they typically lack both nutritional information about the amount of quinine and warnings of the health risks. It appears that 325 milligrams of quinine taken by mouth at bedtime typically relieves nocturnal leg cramps, but lower starting doses are appropriate for senior citizens and individuals with impaired renal function. In general, quinine in any form should be avoided by pregnant women and people with hepatic failure. Quinine consumed for the treatment of leg cramps should be prescribed and monitored by physicians, and people who consume quinine in commercial beverages must be warned of the health risks.

AB  - Maternal entrainment of circadian activity rhythm was studied in the laboratory mouse (C57BL/6J). Pregnant mice gave birth in constant dim light and the mother raised the pups until Postnatal Day 18 (weaning). The wheel running activity of these pups was individually monitored from Day 18. It was found that the phases of pups' activity on the day of weaning were similar to the phases of their mother's rhythm (p < 0.001), indicating that maternal entrainment occurs in the C57BL/6J pups. When the mother mouse was cyclically presented to the pups for 12 h of a day, thereby creating presence-absence (PA) cycles of 12:12 h, it was found that the pups' activity rhythm entrained to the imposed cycles. The onset of activity of the pups coincided with the beginning of the mother's 12-h absence period. It is proposed that the social contact between the mother and the pups is taken by the pups as subjective day (rest time) and absence of the mother as subjective night (activity time). This maternal (nonphotic) entrainment, however, does not continue beyond Postnatal Days 23-26, despite ongoing PA cycles. These results indicate that the PA cycles of the mother are a transient zeitgeber, and are effective in entraining the rhythm of pups only for about 4 weeks after birth.

AB  - Ontogenic changes in baseline and 24-h rhythms of fetal arterial blood pressure (FABP) and heart rate (FHR) and their regulation by the fetal adrenal were studied in 18 fetal sheep chronically instrumented at 109-114 days gestation (GA). In the long-term study, FABP and FHR were continuously recorded from 120 days GA to spontaneous term labor (>145 days GA) in five animals. Peak times (PT) and amplitudes (Amp) of cosinor analysis were compared at 120-126, 127-133, and 134-140 days GA. Consistent, significant linear increases in FABP and linear decreases in FHR were observed in all fetuses. Significant 24-h rhythms in FABP and FHR were observed during all the time windows. In the adrenalectomy study, to test the hypothesis that fetal cortisol plays a key role in cardiovascular maturation, fetal adrenals were removed in eight animals (ADX); sham fetal adrenalectomy was performed on five animals (Con). Cortisol (4 Î¼g/min) was infused intravenously in four ADX fetuses from day 7 postsurgery for 7 days (ADX+F). No significant changes in PT and Amp in FABP and FHR were observed. Plasma cortisol levels remained low in con and ADX fetuses (<4.9 ng/ml). Cortisol infusion increased fetal plasma cortisol to 22.3 Â± 3.2 ng/ml (mean Â± SE) on day 13 in ADX+F fetuses. FABP increased in control and ADX+F but not ADX fetuses; FHR decreased in control and ADX but rose in ADX+F fetuses. These results suggest that, in chronically instrumented fetal sheep at late gestation, 1) increases in FABP and decreases in FHR are maintained consistently from 120 to 140 days GA, with distinct 24-h rhythms, the PT and Amp of which remain unchanged, and 2) the physiological increase in FABP is dependent on the fetal adrenal; bilateral removal of the fetal adrenals does not prevent the ability of cortisol to produce a sustained increase in FABP.

AB  - Previously published reports have indicated that postpartum anovulatory intervals can be markedly reduced and rebreeding performance enhanced in Bos taurus cows by eliminating nighttime suckling. We sought to confirm this hypothesis by examining the effects of day, nighttime, and ad libitum suckling on suckling behavior of calves, duration of the postpartum anovulatory interval, and pregnancy rates in 45 fall-calving Brahman Ã Hereford (F1) cows. Beginning on d 9 to 12 postpartum, calves were removed from lactating cows from 0700 to 1900 (Night-Suckled, n = 15) or from 1900 to 0700 (Day-Suckled, n = 15), or remained with their dams continuously (Ad Libitum-Suckled, n = 15). Cows in each group were maintained with fertile Angus bulls from d 10 postpartum until the first normal luteal phase or 100 d postpartum, whichever occurred first. Cows were observed for estrous behavior twice daily, and jugular blood samples were collected twice weekly for the determination of serum progesterone concentration. Mean number of sucklin episodes per 24 h was greater (P &lt; .0001) for the Ad Libitum-Suckled group than either Night-or Day-Suckled groups (5.9 Â± .42 vs 3.8 Â± .14, and 3.9 Â± .32, respectively). Hourly analysis of suckling episodes in the Ad Libitum group indicated that they were not skewed toward a particular period, with suckling occurring at a periodicity of 4 to 6 h. Intervals to the first rise in progesterone â¥ 1 ng/mL (32 Â± 2.5, 32 Â± 4.5, and 31 Â± 1.7 d, respectively), first normal luteal phase (38 Â± 3.1, 38 Â± 3.8, and 37 Â± 2.5 d, respectively), and first estrus (43 Â± 3.5, 40 Â± 3.9, and 36 Â± 1.1 d, respectively) did not differ (P &gt; .05) among the three groups. Similarly, cumulative pregnancy rates within 100 d after calving did not differ (P &gt; .05). These results in Bos indicus Ã Bos taurus (F1) cattle do not support the previous conclusions in Bos taurus that eliminating nighttime suckling reduces the postpartum anovulatory interval.

It is now accepted that leptin is the afferent loop informing the hypothalamus about the state of fat stores, with hypothalamic efferents regulating appetite and energy expenditure. In addition, leptin has a role as a metabolic adaptator in overweight and fasting states. New and previously unsuspected neuroendocrine roles have emerged for leptin. In reproduction, leptin is implicated in fertility regulation, and it is a permissive factor for puberty. Relevant gender-based differences in leptin levels exist, with higher levels in women at birth, which persist throughout life. In adult life, there is experimental evidence that leptin is a permissive factor for the ovarian cycle, with a regulatory role exerted at the hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal levels, and with unexplained changes in pregnancy and postpartum. Leptin is present in human milk and may play a role in the adaptive responses of the newborn. Leptin plays a role in the neuroendocrine control of GH secretion, through a complex interaction at hypothalamic levels with GHRH and somatostatin. Leptin participates in the expression of CRH in the hypothalamus, interacts at the adrenal level with ACTH, and is regulated by glucocorticoids. Since leptin and cortisol show an inverse circadian rhythm, it has been suggested that a regulatory feedback is present. Finally, regulatory actions on TRH-TSH and PRL secretion have been found. Thus leptin reports the state of fat stores to the hypothalamus and other neuroendocrine areas, and the neuroendocrine systems adapt their function to the current status of energy homeostasis and fat stores.

AB  - Background. Contradictory findings on the effect of betamethasone versus dexamethasone on antenatal tests of fetal well-being have been reported. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of these steroid compounds on fetal heart rate patterns and biophysical activities in a prospective, randomized trial. Study design. Forty-six pregnant women (gestational age range 27-34 weeks) at risk for preterm delivery were randomized to receive betamethasone or dexamethasone for enhancement of fetal lung maturity. Fetal heart rate was recorded for 60 minutes and analyzed with the Sonicaid System 8000 before (0 hours), and 48 hours and 96 hours after steroid administration. Subsequently, fetal limb, body and breathing movements were sonographically observed and quantified for 30 minutes. To account for fetal circadian rhythms, all examinations were performed between 1 p.m, and 5 p.m., at least one hour after maternal meals. Results. Fetal heart rate accelerations (p < 0.001; p < 0.O1), short-term variation p < 0.0001; p < O.05), long-term variation (p < 0.01; p = NS), duration of high episodes (p < 0.001; p < 0.05), total movement count (p < 0.001; p < 0.05), and duration of breathing time (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001) were substantially reduced 48 h after betamethasone and dexamethasone administration, respectively, with percent reduction being larger for the betamethasone group, except for breathing movements (p < 0.05; p < 0.001; p < 0.001; p < 0.005; p < 0.05; p = NS; respectively). In 68.2% and 45.5% of fetuses, less than 30 seconds of continuous breathing movements were found in the betamethasone and dexamethasone groups, respectively. In 71.8% and 12.5% of fetuses, respectively, less than 2 body/limb movements were observed. Therefore five and two fetuses in the betamethasone and dexamethasone study group, respectively, had both nonreactive fetal heart rate monitors for 60 minutes and biophysical profiles of â¤ 4/10. All parameters returned to baseline values at 96 h. Baseline fetal heart rate and numbers of decelerations remained unchanged (p = NS). Conclusions. Both betamethasone and dexamethasone induce a profound, albeit transient, suppression of fetal heart rate characteristics and biophysical activities in the preterm fetus. However, the effect of betamethasone is more pronounced. Awareness of these phenomena might prevent unwarranted iatrogenic delivery of preterm fetuses.

AB  - Interactive effects of light and temperature on aspects of seasonality were studied in female British Saanen dairy goats. Four groups of adult non-pregnant non-lactating goats (n = 5) were housed under the following conditions: controls (July-June): natural photoperiod and temperature; group 1 (July-December): long days (16 h light: 8 h dark) and natural temperature; group 2 (July-December): long days and average summer temperature (17.6Â°C); group 3 (December-June): short days (8 h light: 16 h dark) and winter temperature (8.4Â°C). Plasma prolactin and progesterone were measured once a week, circadian changes in prolactin and melatonin were determined in December and May, and coat development was assessed. Seasonal variation in prolactin was influenced by manipulation of both daylength and temperature. In group 1, prolactin concentrations decreased as the environmental temperature decreased, despite maintenance of long days. When light and temperature were maintained under summer (group 2) and winter (group 3) conditions, prolactin remained relatively constant, although at different high and low set points, respectively, but with indications of a seasonal rhythm. An asymptotic relationship between prolactin and temperature was maintained under all daylengths. The circadian pattern of melatonin was related to daylength and was not influenced significantly by temperature. Onset of oestrus was unaltered. In group 3 (maintained winter solstice light and temperature), anoestrus was delayed (P < 0.05) from a median control date of 17 March to a median date of 28 April. Winter coat development was delayed in group 1; group 2 showed premature moulting of the winter coat; and in group 3, development of the summer coat was delayed. The results imply that temperature modifies the influence of daylength on prolactin secretion and hair follicle growth by mechanisms that do not involve melatonin.

AB  - Coffee is commonly given daily to toddlers in Guatemala. Possible negative effects of coffee ingestion on cognitive development and sleep patterns were assessed in 132 children 12-24 months of age who had received coffee for >2 months and were iron deficient on at least one indicator. Children were stratified by initial hemoglobin (A=anemic, Hgb <10.5 g/dl; NA='non-anemic', Hgb â¥10.5 g/dl) and were randomly assigned to an experimental group (S=substitute consisting of sugar and coloring), and a control group (C=continuation of coffee) (42 C-NA; 53 S-NA; 18 C-A; and 19 S-A). Anemic children were provided Fe supplements for 2-3 months. Compliance was assessed every 2 weeks. After 5 months, testers masked to treatment group and anemia evaluated children with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II in a central location. Scores were the Mental Development Index (MDI), the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI), and scales from the Behavior Rating Scale (BRS). The child's sleep in the previous 24 h was assessed with a set of standardized sleep questions to the care giver on the first visit and every 2 weeks thereafter. No significant effects of treatment on test scores or BRS ratings were found. In the 24 h period reported on at the final visit, children in the Substitute group slept more during the night and overall (night plus naps) than children in the Coffee group, a difference not found at the first visit. No differences were found in sleep difficulty or number of times waking at night. Women's reported coffee intake per day during pregnancy was associated with lower BRS ratings, even after controlling for SES and child age. The effects of postnatal coffee ingestion in Guatemala were seen for sleep duration, but not for cognitive development. Prenatal coffee ingestion was negatively associated with Behavior Rating Scales and should be investigated further. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe perceived levels of fatigue and energy before, during, and after pregnancy in a group of healthy women experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies; and to examine relationships between their perception of fatigue and energy, parity, and physiologic indicators of sleep disturbances, thyroid function, and iron deficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal. SETTING: Participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 24 primiparous and 1 8 multiparous women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in fatigue and energy over time. Measures were obtained at follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle before pregnancy, at each trimester, and at 1 and 3 months after delivery. RESULTS: Younger age and lower prepregnancy levels of iron, ferritin, and hemoglobin explained 1st trimester fatigue. Less total sleep was related to fatigue in the 3rd trimester. Postpartum fatigue was related to reduced amounts of sleep and low levels of ferritin and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of premenstrual (luteal) fatigue, progesterone levels were unrelated to fatigue. Neither paid employment nor family variables influenced perception of fatigue. Nurses working with childbearing populations should counsel women about significant 1st trimester fatigue so they can prepare their work and home environments in an attempt to achieve adequate rest.

AB  - The objective of this study was to use validated scales to determine if fatigue is increased during the first trimester of pregnancy compared to nonpregnant women with similar demographic characteristics. Women between 6 and 12 weeks' gestation were invited to complete a demographics questionnaire and the Numerical Rating Scale for Fatigue (NRS-F), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Beck Depression Index (BDI-II). Nonpregnant women were also invited to participate. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann- Whitney U, Fisher's exact, Spearman correlation, and Monte Carlo tests where appropriate; significance was assumed at p <0.05. Twenty pregnant and 15 nonpregnant patients were enrolled. There was no difference in age, parity, BMI, race, marital status, education, income or hours worked outside the home between pregnant and nonpregnant subjects. Pregnant women reported greater number of hours spent sleeping each day (8 [7-10] vs. 7 [6-9], p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in BDI-II, STAI-S, or STAI-T scores, but pregnant women had significantly higher scores on the NRS-F test (72.5 [20- 88] vs. 36 [18-94], p <0.05). Women in the first trimester of pregnancy experience significantly greater fatigue compared to a similar group of nonpregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of psychosocial and demographic variables to health behaviors in early pregnancy. DESIGN: First trimester findings presented from a prospective study of weight gain in pregnancy. SETTING: A comprehensive health care system in central Texas. PARTICIPANTS: 114 pregnant women (75% white, 13% African American, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian) of 12 weeks gestation or less. OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-Care Inventory, which includes diet/eating, substance abuse, recklessness, hygiene-related practices, sleep/rest, and exercise behaviors. RESULTS: In regression analysis the final model of demographic and psychosocial variables showed that higher depressive symptoms, lower internal locus of control for fetal health, and lower family income were related to poorer health behaviors in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Health behaviors in early pregnancy may be affected by psychosocial factors such as depressive symptoms. Greater emphasis should be given to such factors in research and prenatal assessments.

AB  - The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent chronic neurological illness, characterised by strange unpleasant sensations in the legs or less often in the arms, which occur predominately in the evening while sitting or lying in the bed with prompt relieve while standing up and walking. Some patient report involuntary movements which may persist during sleep in form of 'periodic movements in sleep' (PLMS). The main consequence in RLS may be a severe insomnia and sometimes an abnormal daytime sleepiness which may be accompanied by depression and suicidal ideas. PLMS are also known as an isolated phenomenon without clinical complaints or may be associated with insomnia or daytime sleepiness. A genetically based neurotransmittor disturbance in the spinal cord is suspected. The diagnosis should be established clinically, and electrophysiological and laboratory tests are needed to differentiate between an idiopathic and a number of symptomatic forms. The latter occur in association with a polyneuropathy, iron deficiency anaemia, uraemia, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis or gravidity. Beside causal therapies in some symptomatic forms L-DOPA, dopamin agonists, benzodiazepines and opiates can be used for symptomatic therapy.

AB  - This study investigated the belief held by over 50% of parous women that they are more forgetful during pregnancy and postpartum relative to other times. Comparisons were made between both the reported and objective memory performances of three groups of women (n = 20 per group), (1) primigravid, (2) primiparous (baby younger than 12 months), and (3) never been pregnant, matched on age and education levels. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographic, health, and sleep details, the Inventory of Memory Experiences, and tests of implicit, explicit, and working memory. The groups did not differ on self-rated levels of physical or emotional health, or anxiety level. The primigravid and primiparous groups reported overall poorer memory performance since pregnancy relative to controls. The primigravid group also reported significantly more sleep disruption, with this being a significant predictor of reported memory change. On the objective tests, there were no differences between groups on the implicit and explicit memory tests, but the primigravid and primiparous groups scored significantly lower on a test of working memory. Self-reports of memory change during pregnancy and postpartum may be related to life changes, such as sleep change, and may effect changed perceptions rather than objective changes.

AB  - This study, using an information processing model of memory, made a detailed examination of the possible locus (loci) of any memory change in gravid and postpartum women using a battery of seven objective memory tests: implicit, incidental, explicit, semantic, short-term, working, and prospective memory. In addition, links were sought both between (a) self-reported data on sleep, health, and memory performance, and (b) these variables and objective memory perfomance. Five groups of women were tested (n = 22/23 per group), (1) primigravid, (2) multigravid, (3) postpartum, (4) non-pregnant parents with children, and (5) never been pregnant, on self-report and objective memory tests. The gravid and postpartum groups reported significantly more everyday forgetting than the non-pregnant groups but on the objective tests performed no differently from the non-pregnant groups on all tests. Sleep loss was a significant predictor of reported memory change, but not of any memory test performance, and may contribute to a perceived memory change. Pregnant women and new mothers generally should be confident of performing to their normal cognitive capabilities, but may be more affected than usual by a high cognitive load.

AB  - Twenty-six pregnant women were assigned to a massage therapy or a relaxation therapy group for 5 weeks. The therapies consisted of 20-min sessions twice a week. Both groups reported feeling less anxious after the first session and less leg pain after the first and last session. Only the massage therapy group, however, reported reduced anxiety, improved mood, better sleep and less back pain by the last day of the study. In addition, urinary stress hormone levels (norepinephrine) decreased for the massage therapy group and the women had fewer complications during labor and their infants had fewer postnatal complications (e.g., less prematurity).

AB  - Objective: To examine whether maternal pregnancy complications, adverse birth events, respiratory illnesses, or developmental difficulty were increased in neurologically normal children with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and whether severity of OSA adversely affects the child's development and temperament. Methodology: Maternal report of perinatal events, respiratory illness and developmental difficulty in 37 children with OSA was contrasted with a comparison group (n = 67). Children with OSA were assessed developmentally (Griffiths Scales), had a parental rating of temperament (Australian Temperament Scale) and attended an overnight polysomnographic sleep study. Results: Children with OSA had an increased prevalence of adverse maternal pregnancy and perinatal events, respiratory disease and developmental concerns. Limited associations were found between the severity of OSA and development or temperament difficulty. Conclusions: This study suggests a relationship between OSA, though not its severity, and pre/perinatal adversity and child development. Polysomnographic and detailed developmental assessment of community-based samples of children with OSA and control children are necessary to confirm these findings.

AB  - Placental progesterone metabolites may suppress fetal behaviour by interacting with GABA(A) receptors. In an initial study, the effect of 5Î²-pregnan-3Î±-ol-20-one (pregnanolone) given as a bolus (2.5 and 5.0 mg) or infused at a rate of 25 mg/h was investigated in unanaesthetized, catheterized fetal sheep, 127-135 days gestation. The incidence of fetal breathing movements (FBM) and behavioural arousal activity, defined as nuchal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity during low voltage electrocortical (LV ECoG) activity were suppressed by pregnanolone administered as a bolus, while the pregnanolone infusion produced a significant decrease in arousal and EOG activity, and an increase in the presence of HV ECoG. The effect of pregnanolone on fetal behaviour and arousal induced by the GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin was also investigated. Picrotoxin was given as a bolus (â 300 Î¼g/kg) and pregnanolone was subsequently administered as a bolus (5.0 mg), and behavioural parameters were recorded and analysed. The incidence of arousal and FBM were 1.1 Â± 1.6 min/10 min and 2.5 Â± 2.3 min/10 min, respectively, before picrotoxin treatment and increased during the 10-20 and 20-30 min epochs after picrotoxin treatment (arousal: 5.0 Â± 2.2 and 6.5 Â± 3.6 min/10 min, respectively, n = 6, P < 0.05; FBM: 7.3 Â± 3.2 and 9.3 Â± 1.2 min/10 min, respectively, n = 6, P < 0.05.). The picrotoxin-induced increases in arousal and FBM were significantly suppressed (n = 6, P < 0.05) by pregnanolone treatment to 1.6 Â± 1.5 min/10 min and 4.6 Â± 2.3 min/10 min, respectively. We conclude that; (i) the GABA(A) active steroid pregnanolone suppresses basal and picrotoxin-induced fetal arousal and FBM; and (ii) steroid sensitive GABA(A) receptors may regulate fetal behaviour and breathing.

AB  - Objective: Sudden infant death syndrome has been related to both exposure to prenatal cigarette smoke and impaired arousability from sleep. We evaluated whether healthy infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy had higher auditory arousal thresholds than those born to mothers who did not smoke and whether the effects of smoking occurred before birth. Study design: Twenty-six newborns were studied with polygraphic recordings for 1 night: 13 were born to mothers who did not smoke, and 13 were born to mothers who smoked (>9 cigarettes per day). Other infants with a median postnatal age of 12 weeks were also studied, 21 born to nonsmoking mothers and 21 born to smoking mothers. White noise of increasing intensity was administered during rapid eye movement sleep to evaluate arousal and awakening thresholds. Results: More intense auditory stimuli were needed to induce arousals in newborns (P = .002) and infants (P = .044) of smokers than in infants of nonsmokers. Behavioral awakening occurred significantly less frequently in the newborns of smokers (P = .002) than of nonsmokers. Conclusions: Newborns and infants born to smoking mothers had higher arousal thresholds to auditory challenges than those born to nonsmoking mothers. The impact of exposure to cigarette smoke occurred before birth.

AB  - Background. - This case-control prospective study was conducted to determine whether and how medical, psychological and affective development differs from premature to full-term newborns without severe disability. Population and methods. - Newborns under or at 33 weeks gestation (W) were included from December 1992 to January 1994 and were matched with two controls. The same examiners evaluated each infant at the effective postnatal age of nine to ten months. Results. - Fifty premature babies (average gestational age [GA] = 30.7 W) were compared to 100 controls. The main problems were bronchopulmonary (P = 0.03) and sleep (P = 0.027) disorders. Motor disability was suspected in 9% of the cases and none control (P = 0.00003, OR = 3,44). By multivariate analysis, cases differed from the controls by infant-mother relation disturbances (OR = 13.3), motherhood anxiety (OR = 13.3) poor expressiveness (OR = 5.6), peripheral tonus anomalies (OR = 39.5) and sleep troubles (OR = 5.8). Conclusion. - Premature newborns had risks for the child-mother relation but not for psychoaffective development disturbances.

AB  - These are the first clinical guidelines published for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder (PLMD) providing evidence-based practice parameters. They were developed by the Standards of Practice Committee and reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. The guidelines provide recommendations for the practice of sleep medicine in North America regarding the treatment of RLS and PLMD. Recommendations are based on the accompanying comprehensive review of the medical literature regarding treatment of RLS and PLMD which was developed by a task force commissioned by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Recommendations are identified as standards, guidelines, or options, based on the strength of evidence from published studies that meet criteria for inclusion. Dopaminergic agents are the best studied and most successful agents for treatment of RLS and PLMD. Specific recommendations are also given for the use of opioid, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant, and adrenergic medications, and for iron supplementation. In general, pharmacological treatment should be limited to individuals who meet diagnostic criteria and especially who experience insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness that is thought to occur secondary to RLS or PLMD. Individuals treated with medication should be followed by a physician and monitored for clinical response and adverse effects. It would be desirable for future investigations to employ multicenter clinical trials, with expanded numbers of subjects using double-blind, placebo-controlled designs, and an assessment of long-term response, side effects, and impact of treatment on quality of life. Evaluation of special groups such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly is warranted.

AB  - It has been assumed that women recover from pregnancy and child brith within 6 weeks. Recent research shows that women's fatigue levels are the same, or higher, at G weeks postpartum as at the time of delivery. This study determined the differences in pnrniparous women's fatigue and energy levels at 6 weeks and 14 to 19 months postpartum. Determinations of how some contributing factors and outcomes of postpartum fatigue relate to each other and to fatigue and energy at 14 to 19 months postpartum. were also made. Analyses revealed that women are morefatigued and less energetic at 14 to 19 months than they were at 6 weeks postpartum. Quality of sleep did not correlate with fatigue or energy. At 14 to 19 months postpartum return tofull functional status is almost complete, with household and infant care responsibilities being most complete. The women were experiencing mild life crises ofuorious sorts, were somewhat depressed, and were gratified in the mothering role. Â© 1999 Sage Publications, Inc.

AB  - Case reports of four patients with therapy-resistant lesional partial epilepsies and additional foci of benign epileptic discharges of childhood, in addition to the usual electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, are presented. A family history of epileptic or febrile seizures in childhood was reported in all four patients. A distant relative of one patient, not manifesting seizures, demonstrated rolandic spikes on EEG. An abnormal pregnancy (polyhydramnion, premature pains, induced labor because of an abnormal CTG, placenta insufficiency) was reported in one patient, risk factors during birth (birth 14 days after term, placenta insufficiency) were reported in one, and bacterial meningitis at 4 weeks of age was reported in one. All patients manifested a retarded, partly severe, unfavorable infantile psychomotor development. An early seizure onset was observed in all patients (in three patients during the first year of life and in one patient during the second year). A hemifacial seizure symptomatology was seen, in addition to other symptoms, in two patients, possibly indicating the seizure pattern indicative of benign partial seizures; seizures occurred exclusively in sleep in one patient. The benign focus was never located in the lesional area. It was recorded over the same hemisphere in two patients and over the other hemisphere in the other two.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses when placed skin-to-skin on their mother's chests, called kangaroo care (KC), for the first 6 hours after birth, instead of having the neonates go to an intensive care unit. DESIGN: Convenience sampling was used in this descriptive study to enroll neonates who were given continuous KC beginning soon after birth in the delivery room and continuing for 6 hours. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, abdominal temperature, and behavioral state were recorded each minute. SETTING: Data were collected in the delivery room and in a private labor room in tropical Cali, Colombia. PARTICIPANTS: Six 34-36-week preterm neonates with 5-minute APGAR scores of 6 or more were enrolled. Two neonates had grunting respirations before KC was begun. RESULTS: Temperature rose rapidly to thermoneutral range. With few exceptions, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits; grunting respirations in two neonates disappeared with warmed humidified oxygen and continuous KC. Sleep predominated, and neonates were discharged home by 48 hours being fully breastfed, suggesting that KC was an environment conducive to recovery from fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that KC beginning in the delivery room can be given safely and perhaps with benefit to 34-36-week gestation neonates who appear healthy at birth. Kangaroo care was conducive to recovery from birth-related fatigue.

AB  - Objective: To compare health and lifestyle factors of people with and without urinary incontinence (UI). Design: A postal survey was undertaken that represents the first of a 3-stage project designed to evaluate the health interventions of primary health care teams and continence advisory services on patient outcomes related to UI. Setting and Subjects: Two random samples of adult populations (N = 12,529) were included, generated from the family physician patient registers within 2 health authorities in England. Instruments: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire that queried demography, perceived health status, activities of daily living, self-care, and use of local health and social services. Information was also collected on past and present continence status. Methods: Structured questionnaires and a cover letter were mailed to the target population. Two reminders were sent to nonresponders to maximize the response rate. Main Outcome Measures: The main measures relate to factors associated with UI: mobility, sleep, childbirth, smoking, diet, body mass index and accommodation. Results: Significantly more women than men had UI (P < .0001). Respondents with UI were older than those who were continent (P < .0001). Women with UI were significantly more likely to have a greater number of pregnancies (P < .0001), were more likely to have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 Ib (P < .01), and to have had more than 4 children (P = .01) compared with women who were continent. People with UI were less likely to be single and more likely to be widowed than those who were continent (P < .0001). People who lived alone and who had UI were also significantly less likely to have a relative or friend that they could depend on for help than those who were continent (P < .001). UI was also found to be significantly associated with impaired mobility (P < .0001) and sleeping difficulties (P < .0001). No meaningful differences were found between diet and UI, although significantly more people with UI had higher mean body mass index were obese, or reported that they felt too heavy for their height when compared with people who were continent (P < .0001). No association was found in the present study with smoking or ethnicity and UI. Conclusions: Key health and lifestyle factors associated with UI included age, gender, childbirth, mobility, sleep patterns, obesity, living alone, and access to help. These factors should be assessed when planning and implementing health care for persons with UI. Attention to these associated factors may prove useful in identifying new cases or people at risk of developing UI when screening people as part of routine health checks. This, in turn, could assist with targeting effective and efficient health care but may also contribute to prevention for some people. Â© Crown Copyright.

AB  - In 30 patients (ASA-1) for elective Cesarean section who had given informed consent, characteristics of amnesia induced by midazolam (M) and their modulation by flumazenil (F) were examined. Spinal anesthesia was performed with dibucaine. After the delivery, the baby was shown to the mother. Then 21 patients were given bolus intravenous injection of M until the patient got into sleep and the inhalation of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen was started. At the end of surgery bolus until the patient awoke. Nine patients were given only nitrous oxide and oxygen inhalation after the delivery. The remembrance of the baby face and the doses of M and F were compared. In group given M, 14 patients recalled their baby's face whereas 7 did not. The average doses of M and F in patients with memory were 69 Î¼g Â· kg -1 and 2.5 Î¼g Â· kg -1, respectively, whereas the average dose of M and F in patients without memory were 94 Î¼g Â· kg -1 and 4.2 Î¼g Â· kg -1, respectively. In the patients without M injection, all could recall the face of the baby. These results suggest that M could produce retrograde amnesia, when combined with nitrous oxide inhalation, which is not reversed by F.

AB  - Historically, community health nurses have provided nursing services to infants who were exposed to licit and illicit drugs in utero and their mothers. The charts of 145 infants whose mothers had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and who were referred to a visiting nurse agency between 1988 and 1994 were reviewed for this study. Of the infants who were reported to have been exposed to drugs in utero, 69% were exposed to cocaine, 11% to heroin, and 6% to marijuana. The average age of the mothers was 26 years; 83.4% were single; 82.1% received Aid for Families of Dependent Children (AFDC); 92.4% were on Medicaid; and 95.9% were involved with child protective services. The most frequent nursing problems identified were (a) maternal-child attachment, (b) sleep patterns, (c) infant feeding, and (d) infant development. Nursing interventions included nutritional management, physical assessment, monitoring growth and development, and education in parenting skills. Fifty percent of the infants increased their weight by at least one percentile and 31% increased two percentiles. Resolution of nursing problems occurred in 50% of the cases.

Nicotine replacement medications aid smokers in their cessation efforts by relieving the physiologic symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Because nicotine medications do not deliver myriad toxins and carcinogens that cigarettes deliver, these medications are safe when used as directed. Although the efficacy of nicotine medications in helping smokers to quit has been well documented, there is much room for improvement. There are improvements that could be made to the products themselves, but there are also improvements that could be made in the way that these products are regulated, compared with tobacco products. Cigarettes are highly appealing to smokers, inexpensive, and easy to produce, whereas nicotine medications are generally unappealing to smokers, expensive, and often require a prescription. In addition, cigarettes are available at gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores, and vending machines, whereas nicotine replacement medications currently are available only in stores that sell pharmaceuticals. So long as these barriers to effective treatment exist, many smokers are likely to continue to use the more appealing, and deadly, cigarettes.

AB  - We report on a boy with a maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 14 (UPD(14)). At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). He showed short stature, obesity, mild developmental delay, cryptorchidism, and some mild dysmorphic features. The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy. His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth. After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking, for which gavage feeding was needed. Motor development was delayed. After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite. Recurrent middle ear infections, a high pain threshold, and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported. There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis was normal (46,XY). DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities. Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD(14). At that time precocious puberty was evident. DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14. In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD(14), a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis. This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD(14) based on clinical features. This finding underlines the importance of DNA analysis for maternal UPD(14) in patients with a similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification of a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish whether epidemiologic characteristics for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have changed since the decrease in death rate after the "Back to Sleep" campaign in 1991, and to compare these characteristics with sudden and unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI) from explained causes. DESIGN: Three-year, population-based, case-control study. Parental interviews were conducted soon after the death and for 4 controls matched for age and date of interview. All sudden unexpected deaths were included in the study and the cause of death was established by a multidisciplinary panel of the relevant health care professionals taking into account past medical and social history of the mother and infant, the circumstances of death, and a full pediatric postmortem examination. Contributory factors and the final classification of death were made using the Avon clinicopathologic system. SETTING: Five regions in England, with a total population of >17 million people, took part in the study. The number of live births within these regions during the particular time each region was involved in the study was 473 000. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred twenty-five SIDS infants (91.3% of those available), 72 explained SUDI infants (86.7% of those available), and 1588 matched control infants (100% of total for cases included). RESULTS: Many of the epidemiologic features that characterize SIDS infants and families have remained the same, despite the recent decrease in SIDS incidence in the United Kingdom. These include the same characteristic age distribution, few deaths in the first few weeks of life or after 6 months, with a peak between 4 and 16 weeks, a higher incidence in males, lower birth weight, shorter gestation, and more neonatal problems at delivery. As in previous studies there was a strong correlation with young maternal age and higher parity and the risk increased for infants of single mothers and for multiple births. A small but significant proportion of index mothers had also experienced a previous stillbirth or infant death. The majority of the SIDS deaths (83%) occurred during the night sleep and there was no particular day of the week on which a significantly higher proportion of deaths occurred. Major epidemiologic features to change since the decrease in SIDS rate include a reduction in the previous high winter peaks of death and a shift of SIDS families to the more deprived social grouping. Just more than one quarter of the SIDS deaths (27%) occurred in the 3 winter months (December through February) in the 3 years of this study. In half of the SIDS families (49%), the lone parent or both parents were unemployed compared with less than a fifth of control families (18%). This difference was not explained by an excess of single mothers in the index group. Many of the significant factors relating to the SIDS infants and families that distinguish them from the normal population did not distinguish between SIDS and explained SUDI. In the univariate analysis many of the epidemiologic characteristics significant among the SIDS group were also identified and in the same direction among the infants dying as SUDI attributable to known causes. The explained deaths were similarly characterized by the same infant, maternal, and social factors, 48% of these families received no waged income. Using logistic regression to make a direct comparison between the two index groups there were only three significant differences between the two groups of deaths: 1) a different age distribution, the age distribution of the explained deaths peaked in the first 2 months and was more uniform thereafter; 2) more congenital anomalies were noted at birth (odds ratio [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.52-6.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The authors presented physiological conditions associated with increased prolactin values (sleep, stress, hypoglycemia, nipples stimulation, pregnancy and lactation) as well as the causes of pathological hyperprolactinemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of radioimmunoassay study have been analyzed in concern to the values of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) obtained from the serum of 100 women with increased PRL levels. The "HOECHT" sets were used for the analysis, whereas the values up to 20.9 microgrammes per litre were rated normal. The patients were distributed into 4 groups in concern to the level of PRL increase: 1st group--twenty (n = 20) patients with PRL values from 21-29.9 micrograms/l, 90 blood samples analyzed; 2nd group-forty (n = 40) patients with PRL values f; 30-49.9 micrograms/l, 183 blood samples analyzed; 3rd group--twenty (n = 20) patients with PRL values from 50-99.9 micrograms/l, 83 blood samples analyzed; 4th group--twenty patients (n = 20) with PRL values more than 100 micrograms/l, 78 blood samples analyzed. The values of FSH and LH recorded in the women with hyperprolactinemia were compared with mean values of the same hormones presented in IU/l from the follicular phase of the cycle in the control group which comprised 50 women of reproductive age having normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. RESULTS: The mean values of FSH and LH in the 1st group have not presented with statistically significant difference in relation to the control group. Prevalence of menstrual disorders was 30%, which was statistically significantly higher than in general population. FSH values in the 2nd group were almost the same as in the control group whereas the values of LH were significantly higher. The rate of polycistic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in this group has been significant, also the increased rate of anovulatory cycles from 30 to 67.5%. A mild increase of menstrual cycle rhythm disorders, from 35 to 40% has been recorded. The values of FSH and LH in the 3rd group were significantly lower than in the control group. The significance level was higher for FSH (p < 0.01) then LH (p < 0.05). There was a sudden increase of the cycle rhythm disorders in this group reaching 90%. The 4th group presented with significantly lower values of FSH and LH in relation to the control group, whereas the cycle rhythm disorders occurred in all patients. DISCUSSION: The obtained results were compared with the literature data and some explanations given. CONCLUSIONS: The values of FSH an LH were statistically significantly lower in the 3rd and 4th group. The 2nd group was characteristic for the sudden increase of the number of anovulatory cycles from 30 to 67.5%, whereas the 3rd group presented with the abrupt increase of menstrual cycle rhythm disorders, from 40 to 90%.

AB  - (1) Gender differences in airway behaviour occur throughout the human life span. Implicated in these differences are biological and sociocultural/environmental determinants related to sex and gender, respectively. Biological determinants of these gender differences in airway behaviour can be characterised as dimensional (related to structure/functional relationships), immunological, and hormonal. (2) Dimensional determinants: gender differences in airway dimensions relative to lung size and in structure/function relationships exist throughout the human life span and are characterised by higher flow rates for a given lung volume in girls and women than in boys and men. These differences are present in utero, have been demonstrated as early as one month of life, and persist through childhood into adulthood. Before puberty boys start to reduce their dimensional disadvantage and, in adolescent girls, the growth of their airways relative to their size (and air spaces) is slower than in adolescent boys. Nevertheless, the lungs of girls retain their dimensional advantages over the lungs of boys and these persist throughout their adult life. Thus, even though women remain on average shorter than men throughout adulthood, and even though the lungs of adult women remain smaller than those of adult men, they exhibit on average higher flow rates in relation to their lung size than men. (3) Immunological determinants of airway behaviour include atopy, probably the most important host determinant of airway behaviour. The phenotype biomarkers of atopy evolve differently with age. For instance, the acquisition of skin test positivity - that is, the increase in its prevalence rate with age - follows the same pattern in both sexes, being greater in childhood through early adulthood, but prevalence rates are lower in girls than in boys. Prevalence rates in both sexes coincide in the mid 20s and stabilise at a lower level in the 30s, after which they both fall at an accelerated rate in the 50s. Also, although prevalence rates averaged over the human life span show no sex differences, in those studies where age specific rates have been examined, these are higher in women in their reproductive years than those of men of the same age, but lower in girls than boys in childhood and again in women than men after the menopause. By contrast, sex differences in total serum IgE levels are present across the human life span, with levels in girls and women being consistently below those in boys and men at all ages. The evolution of total serum IgE also differs from that of skin test positivity, being highest in the first year of life, then decreasing rapidly to levels on average half those seen in childhood by the 30s and 40s and more slowly thereafter. Sex differences in allergen specific IgE are, however, less consistent. In one study of adults the only sex differences were for an outdoor allergen, grass, with lower levels in women than men. Gender differences in the determinants of the biomarkers of atopy other than allergen exposure (such as sibling and socioeconomic status, active and passive smoking, and occupational exposure) appear to have been less consistently examined. There is no evidence of gender differences in the relationship of skin positivity with sibling status. Higher and lower total serum IgE levels have been found in non-smokers than in smokers although gender differences do not appear to have been examined. The mechanisms of interaction between most environmental exposures and smoking remain to be explained. (4) Hormonal determinants. Throughout the human life span female airways are responsive to their sex hormones and to their cyclical fluctuations, supporting the hypothesis formulated by Havelock Ellis over a century ago that their airways are among the organs which exhibit secondary sex characteristics. These fluctuations impose a pattern of variation on airway behaviour to which male airways are not subjected. In the fetus and the neonate, given their more mature surfactant production, female airways (particularly the small airways) have an advantage over those of the male neonate in terms of airway patency as well as relative size. In childhood the airways of girls are less responsive to non-specific challenges such as methacholine, an advantage in part due to their dimensional advantages. This difference diminishes progressively towards adolescence. As girls enter the reproductive period of their life and their airways become subject to the cyclical fluctuation of their sex hormones, they exhibit premenstrual changes which include increases in their airway responsiveness to methacholine, in their chemosensitivity, in their ventilatory demands especially on exercise, and decreases in their spirometric lung function and transfer factor. These cyclical fluctuations are modified by the use of oral contraceptives. During pregnancy there appears to be a bidirectional interaction between the maternal and fetal immune systems. For instance, T cells in the cord blood of babies born to atopic mothers respond to aeroallergens as well as food allergens to which the mother was exposed during her pregnancy. Prenatal, perinatal and early life events also appear to be crucial in programming the fetal immune system as it hovers between the development or not of atopy and the asthma phenotype. During pregnancy the airways of the mother remain under the influence of her sex hormones, and there is also some evidence that the fetal sex hormones exert an influence on the mother's airway behaviour with her airways being less reactive if the fetus is male. After the menopause the level of airway reactivity decreases as does the risk of asthma, but this may reverse with hormone replacement therapy. Finally, despite the evidence that sex hormones influence many aspects of airway behaviour, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood and the clinical implications poorly defined.

AB  - The effects of maternal melatonin on fetal and neonatal melatonin and dopamine D1 receptor systems in the central nervous system, mainly in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), were investigated after pinealectomy of rats at day 7 of pregnancy. 125I-labelled iodomelatonin injected intravenously into the pregnant rats (at day 21) was transferred in considerable amount into the fetal circulation. In vitro autoradiography data demonstrated an increase in the melatonin binding activity in the fetal (embryonic day 21) and early postnatal SCN (postnatal day 3) caused by maternal pinealectomy. This upregulation of the melatonin receptor in the SCN was then normalized after the melatonin system of the neonate started to work. The pregnant rats themselves did not show such a change in their melatonin receptors in the SCN following pinealectomy. Dopamine D1 receptor binding was affected by pinealectomy exclusively in the SCN of fetal and neonatal rats as well as in that of mothers. These results clearly indicate that the fetal circadian clock in the SCN is controlled and prepared before birth to some extent by maternal melatonin rhythm.

AB  - We studied changes in the sleep patterns of ten young women from late pregnancy (36 weeks) to the sixth postpartum week, focusing on the relationship between the women's sleep patterns and their infants' movements. The mothers' polysomnograms and their infants' ankle actigrams were simultaneously recorded using a Medilog 9000 at home in three sessions, during the first, third, and sixth postpartum weeks. The mother-infant pairs slept in close proximity. Two subjects had difficulty with their infants and were dealt with as a separate group. Analysis for the eight subjects who adapted well to the postpartum period showed that wake time after sleep onset increased significantly during the postpartum period compared with late pregnancy given responsibility for feeding. Stage 3+4 and Stage REM did not change across the four sessions (pregnancy, first, third, and sixth postpartum weeks), but Stage 2 decreased significantly from pregnancy to postpartum. There was a high synchronization between infants' movements and mothers' wakefulness. Eight mothers did not complain of sleep disturbance, while the two mothers who had difficulty with their infants did. We suggest that mothers who tolerate well sleep interruption arising from feeding and maintain their Stages 3 + 4 and REM should not be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance. Mothers who have difficulty with their infants and complain of sleep disturbance should be considered as suffering from sleep disturbance.

AB  - Nonstandard workhours may disturb normal body functions, but their relation to reproductive outcome is poorly understood. Two newly published studies suggest an association between rotating shift work and prolonged waiting time to pregnancy. Seven of nine studies on spontaneous abortion suggest that some forms of shift work may be associated with increased risk. Four studies indicate that shift work including night schedules may be related to preterm birth. Moreover, some results have related rotating schedules to intrauterine growth retardation. In the published studies, the type of work schedule examined has varied, and the applied definition of shift work has not necessarily been clear. The main interest areas, however, have been work involving evening and night shifts, rotating or changing schedules, and the irregularity of work patterns. Although the evidence is not ample and remains ambiguous, it is prudent to consider shift work as a potential risk to reproduction.

AB  - It is established that during human pregnancy maternal and fetal serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS), which has been shown to arise mainly by adrenal secretion, serves as a substrate in the biosynthesis of placental oestrogen. The conversion to oestrogen is reflected by decreased DHAS and increased oestrogen concentration in the peripheral maternal blood. Impaired uteroplacental perfusion has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of some complicated pregnancies with placenta insufficiency. Apart from this, lower oestrogen, magnesium and zinc levels are found in many of these conditions in the third trimester with placenta insufficiency. In this study, we examined the effect of 4 mg Dexamethasone intravenously on dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, since materal cortisol or synthetic corticosteroids cross the placental barrier and inhibit the release of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in fetal adrenals. Dexamethasone was found to suppress dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in all groups but a significant difference in suppression was found between the Chemiron - a hematinic combination - and the single iron therapy control groups. Our preliminary results showed that Chemiron has a protective effect on the development of placenta insufficiency during the third trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - Arterial hypertension is a relatively common complication of pregnancy, affecting about 10% of all normal pregnancies. The American College of Obstetric and Gynecology established in 1972 four different forms of arterial hypertension during pregnancy: a) arterial hypertension related to pregnancy, the so-called pre-eclampsia; b) arterial hypertension unrelated to pregnancy or chronic arterial hypertension; c) Pre-eclampsia superimposed on chronic arterial hypertension, and d) Transient or late arterial hypertension (third trimester). Pre-eclampsia and arterial hypertension are two different illnesses with different approaches and treatments. The mechanisms involved in arterial hypertension and pre-eclampsia of pregnant women are presently very well known, including genetic causes, alterations on the renin-angiotensin system, imbalance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator agents derived from endothelial activity of the spiral arteries of the placenta, such as; prostacyclins, tromboxane A2, nitric oxide, endothelin-1, etc. The placenta is the key factor in inducing pre-eclampsia, and its expulsion during delivery or cesarean section is the definite cure of the process. All hypertensive forms during pregnancy increase the risks on both the mother and the fetus. Maternal risk is based on renal, metabolic and haematologic disorders, leading in some cases to cerebral haemorrhage or hepatic rupture. In the fetus, pre-eclampsia significantly increases the risk of still-birth, abruptio placentae, hypocalvaria, intrauterine growth retardation, and prematurity. Clinical, biochemical and haematologic manifestations of pre-eclampsia are very typical, facilitating an early and easy diagnosis. An interesting controversy about pre-eclampsia treatment still remains unresolved. According to the principle studies, alpha-methyldopa is the drug of choice, based on its efficacy and its lack of secondary effects on both the mother and the fetus. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, are clearly contraindicated in pregnancy, because of their negative effects on fetal development. Other antihypertensive agents such as, diuretics, beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, need further clinical research to establish their actions, limitations and contraindications in hypertensive therapy in pregnancy and in pre-eclampsia.

AB  - We investigated whether the melatonin levels in bovine milk exhibit a similar daily rhythm as serum levels. In 4 Ayrshire cows at the beginning of the lactation period in May the nocturnal rise in milk melatonin was moderate (from 7 Â± 2 pg/ml at noon to 15 Â± 1 pg/ml at night; mean Â± SEM) and did not correlate well with the melatonin level in serum (from 7 Â± 2 pg/ml to 27 Â± 7 pg/ml, respectively). On the other hand, 6 cows in a later phase of lactation, studied in February, showed a clear long-lasting nocturnal melatonin increase both in serum (from 9 Â± 1 pg/ml at noon to 26 Â± 3 pg/ml at night) and in milk (from 12 Â±5 pg/ml to 26 Â± 7 pg/ml, respectively). Melatonin kinetics during lactation was studied in more detail in 4 Ayrshire cows and 4 dairy goats by giving an intravenous bolus injection of melatonin. A 3-compartment model with melatonin elimination from the central compartment was used to describe the data. The values (mean Â± SD) for the cows and the goats were: elimination half-life 27 Â± 4 min and 27 Â± l min, mean residence time 24 Â± 4 min and 18 Â± 4 min, steady state distribution volume 1.0 = 0.3 1/kg and 0.6 = 0.1 1/kg (p<0.05), and plasma clearance 0.044 Â± 0.004 1/kg/min and 0.035 Â± 0.011 1/kg/min, respectively. Following injection, the melatonin concentration in milk increased rapidly and exceeded the corresponding serum value 15-30 min later, remaining thereafter above the serum level. Our results suggest that milk melatonin levels reflect blood concentrations of melaionin with a short delay.

AB  - Our aim was to determine the effects of intrauterine compromise, induced by maternal anemia, on ventilatory responsiveness of the sleeping newborn to progressive asphyxia. We induced anemia in 6 sheep for the final third of pregnancy and studied their offspring for 2-3 weeks after birth. Lambs from anemic ewes were growth-restricted at birth; they and 6 control lambs were chronically instrumented soon after birth and underwent studies during which we determined ventilatory and arousal responsiveness to a progressive asphyxie stimulus during sleep. During quiet wakefulness, active sleep and quiet sleep, lambs from anemic ewes had elevated end-tidal CO2 levels (FECO 2,%) compared to controls. Ventilatory responsiveness (i.e., gradient of relationship between minute ventilation and FECO2) was greater in quiet sleep than in active sleep for both groups of lambs but did not differ between the two groups in either active or quiet sleep. Lambs from anemic ewes had significantly higher FECO2 values than controls before arousing from either active or quiet sleep. Other indices of arousability (time to arousal, percent hemoglobin saturation at arousal) were not different between the two groups. Our results indicate that prenatal exposure to maternal anemia induces fetal growth restriction and elevates the CO2 'set-point' for normal ventilation. It does not, however, produce significant abnormalities in ventilatory responsiveness to progressive asphyxia during sleep. Â© 1998 WebSciences.

AB  - The fetal sheep brain develops cyclic electrocortical activity from approximately 0.8 gestation alternating between NREM and REM sleep. The aim of this study was to investigate developmental changes of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) after the occurrence of cyclic electrocortical activity as a measure of functional brain maturation. We used nonlinear analysis because it has been recognized superior to linear analysis for describing the complex properties of the ECoG. We developed a nonlinear algorithm which calculates a mean prediction error (MPE) of the time series in the phase space. The ECoG of six chronically instrumented fetal sheep was recorded in utero at 124, 127, 131 and 135 day gestational age (dGA, term 146 dGA). The MPE of the ECoG was calculated for each animal at each investigated dGA from five 10 min epochs of REM and five 6 min epochs of NREM sleep. The MPE during REM sleep was significantly higher than during NREM sleep (p<0.05). With gestational age, the MPE of REM sleep increased and that of NREM sleep decreased significantly (p<0.05). These results suggest a further functional differentiation of both sleep states after transition to cyclic ECoG activity.

AB  - This descriptive, correlational study examined the relationship of sleep in the hospital to the new mother's progression through Rubin's phases of taking-in and taking-hold in 120 women who had delivered vaginally. The Martell and Mitchell Postpartum Questionnaire, which measured taking-in and taking-hold, was completed the evening of delivery and the following two mornings. The Verran and Snyder-Halpem Visual Analog Sleep Scale was completed each morning. Both taking-in and taking-hold were present on the evening of delivery. There were small decreases in taking-in and small increases in taking-hold between the evening of delivery and the first morning. Sleep disturbance was high, and sleep effectiveness was low, on the first evening. Neither sleep measure was a predictor of change in taking-in or taking-hold. Findings indicate that taking-in and taking-hold are both present on the day of delivery and that increases in taking-hold take place despite high levels of sleep disturbance.

AB  - A prospective study documented the nutritional intakes of a large cohort of pregnant women living in Portsmouth and investigated the independent relationships of smoking, dietary intake and other maternal socio-economic factors on outcome and cardiorespiratory function of the child during sleep at home at three weeks and three months of age. Unattended overnight cardiorespiratory recording was performed and the data stored in local memory before transmission on demand via modem to Oxford next morning. The telemetry of the physiological data, entirely managed by part-time community nurses in Portsmouth, was very successful. Despite some losses, which included transmission failures, electrode or lead disconnection, and monitor malfunction, 92% of the physiological data were analysed at Oxford. Personalized physiological monitoring in the community provides an opportunity for new evidence bases that will enable a new level of individualized care.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to show the differences between the cry sound of premature infants (n = 35,11 females, 24 males, birth weight 1748 Â±93 g, weight at examination 2155 Â±109 g, gestation age 32 Â±0.6 weeks, postnatal age 27 Â±3 days) admitted to the Department of Pathological Newborns in Martin Faculty Hospital, and full-term born infants admitted at the Neonatal Department, Clinic of Paediatrics in Martin Faculty Hospital (n = 30, 13 females, 17 males, full-term weight 3441 Â±478 g, gestation age 39.8 Â±0.2 weeks, examined in the 1st - 5th day of life). The premature infants cried in consequence of discomfort (due to positioning or care manoeuvres) and the full-term born infants before breastfeeding at noon because they felt hunger or their sleep was interrupted. The cry sound was picked, up by a microphone (held at 25 cm from the infant's mouth) on a tape recorder and valuated using computer analysis. This method revealed the intensity, duration and pattern of the cry sound. The sound timbre evaluation was performed by spectrographic analysis based on fast Fourier transformation. From the cry sequence the first complete sound sample was evaluated. Comparison of cry sound indexes of premature and full-term born infants did not show significant differences in sound intensity, duration and pattern. Between the sound intensity and the presented weight the correlation was significant in premature infants. In the spectrogram of premature infants the significant rise of frequencies in the range of 200 to 700 Hz was typical. The results implay the important role of an infant cry because it is one of the first signs of the infant's discomfort.

AB  - Infants that died suddenly and unexpectedly were studied as part of the European Concerted Action on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Three paediatric pathologists, first independently of each other and later in a consensus meeting, classified 63 cases into 3 groups: SIDS (19 cases), borderline SIDS (30 cases) and non-SIDS (14 cases). The interobserver agreement among the pathologists before the consensus meeting was moderate (Kappa = 0.41) and jointly it was higher (Kappa = 0.83). The distribution of epidemiologically determined risk factors was studied over these three groups. Maternal smoking after birth, low socioeconomic status and thumb sucking were found more often in SIDS than in the other cases. Inexperienced prone sleeping was a determinant for SIDS, but not for non-SIDS. Previous hospital admission, low birthweight and/or short gestation were associated with borderline SIDS. Non-SIDS cases received more breastfeeding, the parents hardly smoked during pregnancy and after birth, a firm mattress had been used, and more often signs of illness had been reported by the parents, compared with the SIDS and borderline SIDS cases. Bedding factors and both primary and secondary prone sleeping were equally distributed over the three groups which supports the hypothesis that, in SIDS and borderline SIDS, as well as in non-SIDS cases, some similar external and preventable factors might influence the events leading to death. Research should therefore focus on all sudden unexpected deaths, after which subgroups such as SIDS cases can be separately analysed. The postmortem is an essential part of the whole work-up of each case and the results should be interpreted with all other available data to arrive at a sound evaluation of cases and thus form the basis for the prevention of all sudden unexpected infant death.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and the German and Austrian Governments jointly sponsored an international seminar in November of 1996 on the biological effects of low-level radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. For purposes of this seminar, RF fields having frequencies only in the range of about 10 MHz to 300 GHz were considered. This is one of a series of scientific review seminars held under the International Electromagnetic Field (EMF) Project to identify any health hazards from EMF exposure. The scientific literature was reviewed during the seminar and expert working groups formed to provide a status report on possible health effects from exposure to low-level RF fields and identify gaps in knowledge requiring more research to improve health risk assessments. It was concluded that, although hazards from exposure to high-level (thermal) RF fields were established, no known health hazards were associated with exposure to RF sources emitting fields too low to cause a significant temperature rise in tissue. Biological effects from low-level RF exposure were identified needing replication and further study. These included in vitro studies of cell kinetics and proliferation effects, effects on genes, signal transduction effects and alterations in membrane structure and function, and biophysical and biochemical mechanisms for RF field effects. In vivo studies should focus on the potential for cancer promotion, co-promotion and progression, as well as possible synergistic, genotoxic, immunological, and carcinogenic effects associated with chronic low-level RF exposure. Research is needed to determine whether low-level RF exposure causes DNA damage or influences central nervous system function, melatonin synthesis, permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB), or reaction to neurotropic drugs. Reported RF-induced changes to eye structure and function should also be investigated. Epidemiological studies should investigate: the use of mobile telephones with hand-held antennae and incidence of various cancers; reports of headache, sleep disturbance, and other subjective effects that may arise from proximity to RF emitters, and laboratory studies should be conducted on people reporting these effects; cohorts with high occupational RF exposure for changes in cancer incidence; adverse pregnancy outcomes in various highly RF exposed occupational groups; and ocular pathologies in mobile telephone users and in highly RF exposed occupational groups. Studies of populations with residential exposure from point sources, such as broadcasting transmitters or mobile telephone base stations have caused widespread health concerns among the public, even though RF exposures are very low. Recent studies that may indicate an increased incidence of cancer in exposed populations should be investigated further. Â© 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The occurrence of migraine in women is influenced by hormonal changes throughout the lifecycle. A beneficial effect of pregnancy on migraine, mainly during the last 2 trimesters, has been observed in 55 to 90% of women who are pregnant, irrespective of the type of migraine. A higher percentage of women with menstrual migraine find that their condition improves when they are pregnant. However, in rare cases migraine may appear for the first time during pregnancy. The positive effects of pregnancy on migraine and the possible worsening post partum are probably related to the uniformly high and stable estrogen levels during pregnancy and the rapid fall-off thereafter. Nondrug therapies (relaxation, sleep, massage, ice packs, biofeedback) should be tried first to treat migraine in women who are pregnant. For treatment of acute migraine attacks 1000 mg of paracetamol (acetaminophen) preferably as a suppository is considered the first choice drug treatment. The risks associated with use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and ibuprofen are considered to be small when the agents are taken episodically and if they are avoided during the last trimester of pregnancy. The 'triptans' (sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan), dihydroergotamine and ergotamine tartrate are contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Prochlor perazine for treatment of nausea is unlikely to be harmful during pregnancy. Metoclopramide is probably acceptable to use during the second and third trimester. Prophylactic treatment is rarely indicated and the only agents that can be given during pregnancy are the Î²-blockers metoprolol and propranolol.

AB  - In clinical medicine it is possible to find subjects who show initial signs of hypertensive damage being normotensive at the "casual" sphygmomanometry. In order to verify whether or not these subjects are "true normotensives", it was applied the noninvasive ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure (BP). Five studies were performed: I. Normotensives with initial hypertensive retinopathy; II. Normotensives with initial hypertensive cardiohypertrophy; III. Normotensives with initial hypertensive cardiohypertrophy of the transplanted heart; IV. Normotensive pregnant women with altered uterine blood flow; V. Normotensive pregnant women with intrauterine growth retardation. From all the studies, it was possible to derive that the subjects were all true normotensive. However, they were characterized by BP values on average higher than those of their controls, but below the reference limits given by WHO. Because of the relative elevation of BP, it was possible to argue that there exists a BP regimen which is potentially dangerous for the target organs, even though there is no evidence of manifest arterial hypertension. Such a hemodynamic condition causing hypertensive cardiovascular damage was defined "arterial pre-hypertension".

AB  - Mice lacking the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor EPAS1 die at mid-gestation. Despite normal morphological development of the circulatory system, EPAS1-deficient mice display pronounced bradycardia. In addition to the vascular endothelium, EPAS1 is expressed intensively in the organ of Zuckerkandl (OZ), the principle source of catecholamine production in mammalian embryos. EPAS1-deficient embryos contained substantially reduced catecholamine levels. Mid-gestational lethality was rescued by administration of the catecholamine precursor DOPS to pregnant females. We hypothesize that EPAS1 expressed in the OZ senses hypoxia during midgestational development and translates this signal into an altered pattern of gene expression, leading to increases in circulating catecholamine levels and proper cardiac function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in sleep of women throughout pregnancy compared with those of nonpregnant control subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Four pregnant women were studied longitudinally during their pregnancy using inpatient polysomnography. Measurements included electroencephalography, electrocardiography, and continuous-pulse oximetry. Four healthy nonpregnant women matched for age and weight were used as control subjects. The total sleep time was recorded, and percentages of each sleep stage were generated. RESULTS: Qualitative differences in sleep between pregnancy patients and control subjects were evident. Control subjects displayed a normal appearance of slow-wave sleep in stages 3 and 4 (delta sleep). When pregnant patients did display delta sleep, it appeared abnormal secondary to extensive alpha-wave intrusion. Even when including this abnormal delta sleep in a quantitative comparison, the pregnant patients had a significantly shorter percentage of total sleep time in delta sleep (4.9 Â± 1.9% vs 21.9 Â± 6.0%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Sleep in pregnancy is characterized by loss of normal slow-wave sleep. Thus, sleep stages 3 and 4 are shortened during pregnancy. This sleep alteration is persistent when followed longitudinally during pregnancy.

AB  - Intestinal motor patterns are not well developed in premature infants. Similarly, in neonatal mice, irregular motor patterns were observed. Pacemaker cells, identified in the small intestine as interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) associated with Auerbach's plexus (ICC-APs), contribute to the generation of peristaltic movements. The objective of the present study was to assess the hypothesis that abnormal gut motor activity in (preterm) newborns can be associated with underdeveloped ICCs. Specifically, the aim was to identify at which point the electrical pacemaker activity is fully developed and whether or not the development of pacemaker activity has a structural correlation with the developmental stage of ICCs. Pacemaker activity was identified as that component of the slow wave that is insensitive to L-type calcium (Ca2+) channel blockers and displays a characteristic reduction in frequency in the presence of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump. In newborn, unfed neonates, action potentials occurred that were irregular in frequency and amplitude and sensitive to verapamil. CPA (5 Î¼M) abolished all action potentials. Quiescent spots were observed in approximately 50% of impalements. Six hours after birth, slow-wave activity appeared at a regular frequency and amplitude, and a well-defined plateau phase was observed. Verapamil did not affect the frequency, 5 Î¼M CPA decreased it. The effect of CPA on the pacemaker frequency 2 days after birth was identical to that observed in adult mice. In 2-hr-old neonates, ICCs could be identified through selective uptake of methylene blue, but ultrastructural features were not fully developed. At 48 hr, a complete ICC network covering Auerbach's plexus was formed, confirmed by electron microscopy. In summary, the pacemaker component of the slow waves can be identified in neonates as early as 6 hr after birth. The pacemaker component was fully developed 2 days after birth. These electrophysiological observations correlated with the development of full network characteristics of ICC-APs and the development of fully differentiated ICC-APs from 'blast-like' cells.

AB  - Introduction. The diagnosis and treatment of posterior plagiocephaly is one of the most controversial aspects of craniofacial surgery. Patients and methods. The purpose of this study is to describe a recent increase in the incidence of occipital plagiocephaly without synostosis in our hospital during the last 6 months. The shift in the referral patterns is roughly contemporaneous with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations regarding infant sleep position. The temporal coincidence of this increase with the recommendation to avoid the prone sleeping position, to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, suggests a possible causal relationship. If the association is causal, education regarding the need of head position rotation coupled with that for sudden infant death syndrome should obviate positional occipital plagiocephaly. Conclusions. The feature of true lambdoid synostosis versus those of deformational plagiocephaly secondary to positional molding are inadequately described in the literature and poorly understood,' the differential diagnosis is important in relation to a conservative diagnostical and therapeutical intervention in patients with positional molding.

AB  - In the early development of the central nervous system, stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may be critical for neuronal cell survival and differentiation, as well as the establishment of neural networks resulting from 'experience-dependent plasticity.' The trophic influence of NMDA receptor stimulation may be present only during a certain critical period of development. There are, therefore, major concerns associated with the administration of noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists (such as MK- 801 [dizocilpine]) as neuroprotective and anticonvulsant agents to pregnant women, neonates, infants, and young children. Several studies showing disruptive effects of noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists on normal neurobehavioral development are reviewed in this article. This research has important public health implications because phencyclidine (PCP), a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, is a frequently-abused drug that may disrupt brain development in utero when abused by pregnant women. The article also reviews studies of neonatal blockade of the NMDA receptor complex in animals; studies that may lead to useful models of human neurodevelopmental disorders. These models may even mimic the relevant neurodevelopmental aspects of at least some forms of schizophrenia, especially the early developmental disconnection of circuits between the hippocampus and frontal cortex.

AB  - We propose and explore a twin model to examine the basis for synchrony that often characterizes different facets of normal development. In so doing we also present an approach to the analysis of 'soft' events; events for which available reports of dates or ages of occurrence are unreliable or inconsistent. Discrepancies among reports are accounted for by a statistical measurement model. This combines current status error reflecting uncertain definition of onset and two mechanisms for the phenomenon of 'telescoping,' namely, systematic compression of the time scale and heteroscedastic random measurement error. Statistically, the model can be viewed as a mixed generalized linear model with random effects within both mean and variance functions or, alternatively, as involving multiplicative random effects. We apply the model to multiple maternal reports on menarche and onset of breast development in twin daughters. Fitted to data from the Virginia Twin Study Of Adolescent and Behavioral Development by the use of penalized/predictive quasi-likelihood, the model provided much improved estimates of the true age- at-onset distribution as compared to those from a naive analysis. Results suggested that the observed variance was made up almost entirely of genetic variance and measurement error variance due to telescoping and current status errors and that the timing of breast development and menarche are largely under the control of a common set of genes. Results also indicated that maternal recollections of the onset of breast development were both more poorly defined and subject to greater recall errors than maternal recollections of menarche.

AB  - A method of shifting the dark phase of the 12/12 hr photoperiod cycle on Day 7 of pregnancy is described for regulating the duration of pregnancy to 22 days and assuring that most parturitions take place between 1100 and 1500 hr. This method, in addition, has the added convenience that matings can occur during normal laboratory hours between 0700 and 1900 hr during the dark phase of the photoperiodic cycle. Litter sizes are normal (mostly 1416 pups) and postpartum estrus behavior occurs at the normal interval of 4 to 11 1/4 hr after parturition.

AB  - The sleep/wake states of newborn infants were investigated as as a function of vaginal and C-section delivery. The subjects were 51 normal full- term infants: 26 vaginally delivered, 12 delivered by emergency C-section, and 13 delivered by elective C-section. Their sleep states and wakefulness were continuously recorded from the time of birth throughout their stay in the hospital, that is, the first 2 postnatal days for the vaginally delivered infants and 5 days for the C-section infants. Sleep was recorded using the automated Motility Monitoring System, which permits 24-hr recordings without instrumentation of the subject. During the 1st postnatal day, both C-section groups showed state patterns that differed significantly from those of the vaginally delivered infants. Analyses for single states indicated that both C-section groups had significantly less active sleep, and the elective group had more wake and more sleep-wake transition than the vaginal group. The two C-section groups did not differ significantly on any measure. Only the vaginally delivered infants showed significant day/night differences during the first 2 days, with more wakefulness, shorter mean sleep periods and shorter longest-sleep periods during the daytime on both days. The results of this study indicate that the earliest postnatal sleep patterns differ and the diurnal sleep rhythm is disrupted as a result of surgical delivery.

AB  - The use of fecal steroid analysis to assess gonadal and adrenal function in primates has rapidly increased in recent years due to the ability to collect feces from nonhuman primates living in wild conditions. These techniques offer an exciting new potential for enhancing our knowledge of the endocrine status of free-living animals. Prior to using these techniques under field conditions, it is important to determine the diurnal variation of fecal excreted steroids for assessing possible time limitations on fecal collections. The following study investigates the diurnal frequency of defecation and patterns of steroid levels excreted in feces from four female common marmosets, Callithrix jacchus, living in a family group. These females represented three reproductive conditions: early pregnancy, ovarian cycling, and noncycling (postpubertal). Cortisol, estradiol, and progesterone were extracted and analyzed by enzyme immunoassay. Diurnal variations in steroid levels were found by ANOVA for cortisol and progesterone but not for estradiol. Significantly higher levels of cortisol were found in the afternoon, while the reverse was found for progesterone. All females showed the same pattern of steroid level change, except for cortisol in the pregnant female. Since all females defecated within the first hour after they awoke in the morning, this time was determined to be the most effective time to collect feces. The consistency of our findings reinforces the usefulness of this approach for studying reproductive and adrenocortical function in marmosets and also indicates that fecal collection should be limited to either morning or afternoon collections.

AB  - Children of women who consume high amounts of alcohol during their pregnancies vary greatly in physical and behavioral outcomes. Although many factors, such as dose and timing of exposure, undoubtedly contribute to this variation, one important determinant may be genetic differences in the response to alcohol. The present study examined activity levels in high alcohol sensitivity (HAS) and low alcohol sensitivity (LAS) rats following neonatal alcohol exposure. These lines were selectively bred for extremes in ethanol-induced 'sleep times.' The HAS and LAS offspring were exposed to alcohol via an artificial rearing procedure using the 'pup-in-the-cup' technique. Rat pups were exposed to ethanol (6 g/kg/day) from postnatal day (PD) 4 through 7 and faded to a dose of 3 g/kg/day on PD 8 and 9. An artificially reared gastrostomy control group (GC) and a normally reared suckle control group (SC) were also included. Activity level was measured on PD 18 through PD 21 for 30 min daily in automated activity monitors. Neonatal ethanol exposure produced overactivity in HAS rats, relative to their controls, but the same ethanol treatment had no effect on the LAS rats. Importantly, there were no differences in blood alcohol concentrations (around 420 mg/dl) between the two lines during the treatment period. These data suggest that genetic differences in response to alcohol may be a predictor for some of the behavioral teratogenic effects of alcohol.

AB  - Obesity is epidemic in America. About 80 million Americans are obese, 33.4% of adults and about 20% to 25% of children. Obesity produces morbidity and mortality: there are 300,000 obesity-related deaths annually in America. The definition of obesity has not been standard. Recently, the World Health Organization defined overweight as a body mass index (BMI = kg/m2) of 25 and obesity as a BMI of â¥30. A BMI of â¥35 produces a high risk from obesity and of â¥40 produces a severe risk. The presence of complications of obesity (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, etc.) increases the risk. Treatments of obesity depend on the severity of obesity, the presence of complications, and the absence of exclusions. Exclusions from obesity treatment include pregnancy, lactation, terminal illness, major mental illness, anorexia nervosa. Eating disorders and major medical disorders are strong cautions for obesity treatment. Obesity with a low or modest health risk (BMI: 25-30) is best treated with a diet lower in calories and fat than the current diet, exercise, and lifestyle modification. With obesity that produces a moderate to high health risk (BMI: 30-35), the above treatments plus a very low calorie diet or obesity drugs may be indicated. High and very high health risk due to obesity may be treated with the above regimen plus obesity surgery. In every category of obesity, the presence of complications of obesity increases the risk and justifies more aggressive forms of treatment. Treatment of obesity with drugs has gained acceptance in recent years. There are no absolute indications for drug treatment. Contraindications include pregnancy and lactation, unstable cardiac disease, uncontrolled hypertension, severe psychiatric disorder or anorexia, and other drug therapy, if incompatible. Cautions include the presence of any severe systemic illness and certain other problems such as closed angle glaucoma. Obesity surgery is reserved as a last resort. Contraindications to surgery and significant mental or physical diseases preclude obesity surgery. Whatever the form of treatment, individualized attention with careful follow-up is mandatory. Obesity is similar to other chronic diseases; if the treatment stops, the disease comes back. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The purpose of these studies was to investigate the effects of melatonin on the production of steroids (progesterone, testosterone, and estradiol) and cAMP by preovulatory follicles and to examine changes in melatonin concentrations in the ovary during the estrous cycle. Adult cyclic hamsters were used in this study. Melatonin concentrations in the ovary, pineal gland, and serum were measured at mid-light and mid-dark during the estrous cycle. Effects of melatonin on steroidogenesis by preovulatory follicles, thecae, and granulosa cells were examined, and its effect on cAMP production by preovulatory follicles was also investigated. Melatonin (0.1-10 ng/ml) had no effect on steroid production in the absence of hCG, but melatonin decreased progesterone and estradiol production by preovulatory follicles in a dose- dependent and time-dependent manner in the presence of hCG (100 mlU/ml). The target of melatonin was thecae but not granulosa cells, and melatonin significantly reduced cAMP production by preovulatory follicles. Melatonin concentrations in the ovary showed a similar phasic variation with high levels during mid-dark and low during mid-light, as in the pineal gland and serum. These results show that the ovarian melatonin levels also exhibit a circadian rhythm and suggest that the high melatonin milieu in the ovary may induce gonadal regression in the cyclic hamster.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to identify the incidence of hand symptoms related to pregnancy in a Danish population. Three hundred and thirty-five consecutive postpartum patients were interviewed by questionnaire. Hand symptoms had been noted by 16%, among these 30% described a classic median-nerve symptom distribution (carpal tunnel syndrome) and 24% of patients described an ulnar nerve distribution. Most symptoms were bilateral, commenced in the third trimester and resolved soon after delivery. There was a significant correlation of hand symptoms in pregnancy with the presence of swelling and a significant correlation to parity (first). Hand function and sleep had been disturbed in half of the patients. Half of the patients had mentioned their symptoms to their doctor and one had been sent to treatment. Hand symptoms during pregnancy are common, and their severity is often underestimated. Symptoms of the carpal tunnel syndrome are easily relieved by a night splint.

AB  - Objective: To study time distribution of spontaneous deliveries. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 1791 spontaneous deliveries over a 4-year period ( 1993-1996) was made at the department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Civil Hospital, Fano, Italy. Circular statistics techniques (maximization of mean vector length) were used. Results: Some unexpected infradian disuniformities (with 60- and 90-hour periods) were observed. Moreover, a correlation between the distribution of spontaneous deliveries and the lunar phases was found. Conclusions: In this study, some unexpected infradian disuniformities were found. However, no biological explanations appear to be reasonable in light of current knowledge, so the interpretation of these results remains an open question.

AB  - The effect of infusing the neuroactive steroids pregnanolone and iso- pregnanolone on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and electrocortical (ECoG) activity was studied in unanaesthetised fetal sheep, 130-135 days gestation. Intravenous infusion of pregnanolone (6 mg/kg per h) significantly increased the proportion of high voltage ECoG (56.1 Â± 4.8% vs. control 43.5 Â± 3.2% P < 0.05), and decreased low voltage ECoG (43.9 Â± 4.8% vs. control 56.6 Â± 3.2%, P < 0.05). Pregnanolone treatment decreased the amplitude of the N25 peak of the SEP (89.9 Â± 2.8% of control, P < 0.05) evoked following stimulation of the skin of the upper lip. In contrast, iso-pregnanolone treatment had no effect on ECoG activities, or on the amplitude and latency of peaks in the SEP. We conclude that 3Î±-hydroxy pregnane steroids are active at GABA(A) receptors in fetal sheep and can modulate sleep/wake activity before birth.

AB  - Rabbits exhibit an unusually restricted form of maternal care. The newborn young are only nursed for about 3 min every 24 h and drink up to one third of their body weight in this time. They show a circadian increase in activity in anticipation of the doe's visit which is entrained by suckling and appears analogous to feeding-entrained rhythms reported for other species. By investigating the expression of c-Fos protein in nursed and un- nursed pups at selected times before and after scheduled nursing, we were able to distinguish endogenous patterns of neuronal activation and patterns induced by suckling. Increased endogenous expression of c-Fos in the paraventricular thalamus and in the magnocellular neurons of the pareventricular hypothalamus coincided with the period of anticipatory arousal. By contrast, suckling induced c-Fos expression in the supraoptic nucleus and the pervocellular neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus, whilst decreasing expression in the magnocellular neurons. Furthermore, the endogenous pattern of c-Fos expression was less distinct in 3-day-old compared to 7-day-old pups, suggesting maturational or experience-related influences on the neural correlates of the anticipatory arousal. In conclusion, the close correspondence between c-Fos expression and pups' endogenous rhythm of behaviour suggests that the rabbit's natural schedule of restricted nursing provides an ideal model in which to investigate the ontogeny of circadian function without disrupting the mother-offspring relationship or normal neonatal development.

AB  - The presence of oestrogen receptor in the developing hypothalamo-hypophyseal system is an essential prerequisite for the development of sex-steroid feedback on gonadotrophin secretion. We have used dual immunocytochemistry to examine the ontogeny and regional distribution of oestrogen receptor and LHÎ² subunit in the ovine pituitary gland during foetal development. At day 65 gestation (term = 145 days) oestrogen receptor and LHÎ² immunopositive cells are found in a small region at the base of the anterior pituitary gland, and also in a band immediately adjacent to the neurointermediate lobe. By day 100 gestation there was a significant increase in the number of immunopositive LHÎ² cells accounting for around 12% of the total cell population, and these were widely distributed throughout the anterior pituitary gland. There was also a significant increase in the proportion of gonadotrophs which contain oestrogen receptor compared with day 65. By day 130 gestation the percentage of LH containing cells had declined to around 7% of the total population, but the proportion which also contained oestrogen receptor remained the same. There were no differences in the numbers or distribution of cells containing LH or oestrogen receptors between male and female foetuses, at any age. These data describing a parallel change in the number of oestrogen receptors and LHÎ² containing cells in the pituitary gland throughout gestation suggest that the development of pituitary sex-steroid feedback is not solely dependent on changes in the numbers of oestrogen receptor containing cells alone.

AB  - Early cocaine exposure is associated with a wide variety of neurobehavioral and teratogenic effects. The current study was conducted to determine the long-term effects of such exposure on the hamster circadian timing system. The circadian system drives rhythms in a tremendous diversity of physiological, behavioral, and endocrine functions. The fetal circadian pacemaker has recently been shown to express a functional D1 dopamine system that is involved in maternal-fetal entrainment. Maternally adminstered cocaine, acting on the fetal clock, could therefore potentially have long-lasting effects on exposed offspring. Pregnant SCN-lesioned hamsters or their pups, maintained in constant dim illumination (DD), were administered cocaine (30 mg/kg, SC, N = 10 litters) or saline vehicle (N = 5 litters) from embryonic (E) day 15 [day of mating = E0] through postnatal (P) day 5. Upon weaning (P21), cocaine- and saline-treated offspring were placed in individual running wheels for a period of 5-6 weeks. Individuals were then challenged with 1-h light pulses at three circadian times (CT7, CT14, CT18). Cocaine-treated litters had a statistically significant mean phase advance of +0.32 h at CT14 compared with the mean phase delay of -2.13 h of the saline-treated litters. No significant differences were seen at the other two circadian times, although there was heterogeneity in the responses among cocaine-treated animals. This represents the first demonstration of an effect of perinatal cocaine on the circadian timing system. Together with the recent demonstration of D1 receptors in the human SCN, these findings raise the possibility that gestational cocaine abuse by humans may also lead to later disturbances in the circadian timing system.

AB  - A behavioural state transition is the time interval between two different behavioural states. In low-risk fetuses, the fetal heart rate pattern (FHRP) is the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F ('non-REM-sleep' to 'REM-sleep') and the last variable to change in transitions from 2F to 1F. This is not the case in IUGR (intra-uterine growth retardation), and absence of a specific order in which behavioural variables are changing might be an indication for a (mild) disturbance of the fetal central nervous system (CNS). We investigated whether state transitions in twelve low risk term fetuses (39-41 weeks post menstrual age, PMA; control group) differ from those in twelve uncomplicated pregnancies > 41 weeks PMA (study group). All subjects underwent one behavioural study in which fetal heart rate pattern, eye and body movements were recorded simultaneously. We recorded 23 transitions from 1F to 2F and 20 from 2F to 1F. Median (range) duration for transitions from 1F to 2F was 85 (10-180) s in the study group, and 60 (10-180) s in the control group. Transitions from 2F to 1F lasted 80 (10-140) and 60 (30-100) s, respectively. In both groups, the FHRP was the first variable to change in transitions from 1F to 2F, however, in transitions from 2F to 1F, no specific order in change of variables could be demonstrated. We conclude that the study of transitions does not distinguish between the term and after term fetuses under optimal conditions. Whether or not the analysis of state transitions can be used to distinguish 'normal' from 'abnormal' fetuses and detect the fetus at risk after term awaits further study.

AB  - Background: Ground-based research has investigated the loss of cognitive function in the extreme conditions of G-induced loss of consciousness, however, little is known about pilots' abilities to maintain cognitive performance throughout prolonged conscious exposure in the high-G environment. The effects of fatigue and G layoff on performance during exposure to high G are mostly unknown for the female population. Methods: This research was conducted on the centrifuge Dynamic Environment Simulator. Active-duty personnel (8 male and 8 female) were trained to fly the F-16 simulation while 30 performance measures were recorded. Performance was re- evaluated after 24 h of sleep deprivation. Results: Neither male nor female overall performance was affected significantly by sleep status, although individual tasks showed sensitivity; call-sign reaction time was longer by 33%, and missile survival was less likely. Also, when sleep deprived, perceived effort and physical demand were higher while perceived performance was lower. No differences in performance were found in either gender due to lay-off, although some physiologic deconditioning was apparent. Women commanded and endured the same amount of G load as men, however, on average they could not perform the tracking task quite as well. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation (24 h) produced sensations of fatigue and frustration, but overall performance was not reduced. The ability of personnel to complete a complex defensive maneuver was reduced when they were sleep deprived. The women that we tested apparently could not optimize the tracking task as well as their male counterparts when Gz was in the simulation. None of these results were sufficient to suggest that women should not be allowed to compete for flying assignments in high-performance aircraft.

AB  - To investigate the effects of bilateral intrathoracic vagotomy on the establishment of continuous breathing and effective gas exchange at birth, we studied 8 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized, shamoperated and 14 vagotomized newborn lambs after a spontaneous, unassisted vaginal delivery. Fetal lambs were instrumented in utero to record sleep states, diaphragmatic electromyogram, blood pressure, arterial pH, and blood-gas tensions. Six of eight sham-operated lambs established effective gas exchange within 10 min of birth, whereas 12 of 14 vagotomized animals developed respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia (P = 0.008). Breathing frequency in vagotomized newborns was significantly lower during the entire postnatal period compared with sham- operated newborns. Vagotomized subjects also remained hypothermic during the entire postnatal period (P < 0.05). Bronchoalveolar lavage indicated an increased minimum surface tension, whereas lung histology showed perivascular edema and partial atelectasis in the vagotomized group. We conclude that stimulation of breathing and effective gas exchange are critically dependent on intact vagal nerves during the transition from fetal to neonatal life.

AB  - Penetration of light into the pregnant sheep uterus was studied in 9 ewes, gestational ages 40 to 142 days (term 147 days). Light Sensors were placed inside the pregnant horn and over the flank skin overlying the position of the uterine horn. To perform the experiments, the ewes were placed in a study cage outdoors and light sensors were connected to a luxometer. Simultaneous measurements were obtained from the intrauterine and the external sensors in the shade at noon. The amount of light detected inside the uterus increased with gestational age from two lux at 40 days to 51.1 Â± 16.5 (n = 5) lux at 142 days (0.2 and 5.4% of the amount of light detected at the maternal flank). Measurements through the 24 h were done in four pregnant ewes at 142 days gestation under natural photoperiod (13.5 light:10.5 dark). In these experiments, the intensity of intrauterine light changed through the 24 h, reflecting the changes in the intensity of the sunlight. Maximal intrauterine light values were observed at noon, corresponding to 4.7% of incident light. Small but detectable values were observed at 0900 and 1800 h. Our data show that, at mid gestation, light reaches the pregnant uterus and that, at late gestation, changes in intrauterine lighting throughout the 24 h are present reflecting the changes in external daylight. Therefore the sheep fetus is exposed to light-dark transitions at dawn and dusk, and to a peak of light at midday.

AB  - The quantification of subtle patterns in sequential data, and their changes, has considerable potential utility both in analysis of hormonal secretory dynamics, and of fetal heart rate rhythms. Approximate entropy, a recently developed statistic quantifying serial irregularity, has been applied in both these settings, and has yielded a number of new findings. Among endocrine applications, approximate entropy increases with increasing age for luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, for both women and men, indicating greater irregularity (more apparently random dynamics) in the older groups; for the luteinizing hormone-testosterone axis, both irregularity and asynchrony increases accompany advancing age for men. These findings produce a means to potentially predict time until menopause onset, the efficacy of infertility drugs, and also provide firm quantitative support of a partial male menopause. In fetal monitoring, antepartum, and postnatal heart rate studies, approximate entropy consistently detected subtle shifts in head rate rhythmicity, with greater regularity clinically corresponding to compromised physiology in all settings. Both the capability of approximate entropy to quantify rhythm changes undiscernible by auscultation, and a continuum interpretation linking per-individual antepartum, perinatal, and postnatal heart rate analyses provide considerable potential enhancement to the present clinical utility of fetal monitoring.

AB  - Although corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) was initially identified as a hypothalamic peptide it is also synthesised in the placenta and secreted into both the maternal and fetal circulation. The presence of large molecular weight forms in the placenta suggest that secretion may be constitutive rather that regulated. Placental CRH is bioactive but causes only modest increases in ACTH and cortisol in the pregnant woman because of agonist induced desensitisation of pituitary CRH receptors. CRH concentrations increase exponentially in maternal plasma as gestation advances. Elevated concentrations, compared with gestational age matched controls, occur in patients in preterm labour. The exponential curve describing the CRH increase is shifted to the left in women who will subsequently deliver preterm and to the right in women who will deliver post dates indicating that CRH is linked to a placental clock which determines the length of gestation. Maternal plasma CRH concentrations may be useful in identifying women at high risk of preterm delivery and CRH antagonists may prevent preterm labour. As significant CRH production by the placenta is restricted to primates future research must take into account the species specificity of the mechanisms regulating parturition.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis exerts profound, multilevel inhibitory effects on the female reproductive system. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and CRH-induced proopiomelanocortin peptides inhibit hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion, whereas glucocorticoids suppress pituitary luteinizing hormone and ovarian estrogen and progesterone secretion and render target tissues resistant to estradiol. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is thus responsible for the 'hypothalamic' amenorrhea of stress, which is also seen in melancholic depression, malnutrition, eating disorders, chronic active alcoholism, chronic excessive exercise, and the hypogonadism of the Cushing syndrome. Conversely, estrogen directly stimulates the CRH gene promoter and the central noradrenergic system, which may explain adult women's slight hypercortisolism; preponderance of affective, anxiety, and eating disorders; and mood cycles and vulnerability to autoimmune and inflammatory disease, both of which follow estradiol fluctuations. Several components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and their receptors are present in reproductive tissues as autacoid regulators. These include ovarian and endometrial CRH, which may participate in the inflammatory processes of the ovary (ovulaton and luteolysis) and endometrium (blastocyst implantation and menstruation), and placental CRH, which may participate in the physiology of pregnancy and the timing of labor and delivery. The hypercortisolism of the latter half of pregnancy can be explained by high levels of placental CRH in plasma. This hypercortisolism causes a transient postpartum adrenal suppression that, together with estrogen withdrawal, may partly explain the depression and autoimmune phenomena of the postpartum period.

AB  - Neonatal exposure to antidepressant monoamine re-uptake inhibitors produces a wide variety of effects on the behavior and physiology of adult rats which are consistent with features of clinical depression. Since depressed patients show characteristic alterations in circadian rhythmicity, our laboratory has examined free-running circadian drinking rhythms in this putative animal depression model. Previously, neonatal desipramine treatment was shown to lengthen free-running period, and increase circadian amplitude, spectral magnitude, and voluntary alcohol intake (10% ethanol v/v) of male rats. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of neonatal clomipramine treatment (25 or 30 mg/kg SC, postnatal days 8-21) on circadian drinking rhythms and alcohol intake of both male and female rats. In addition, effects of alcohol exposure on circadian rhythmicity were also examined. Contrary to expectations, free-running period of clomipramine-treated rats did not differ from saline-treated controls in either constant darkness (DD) or constant light (LL), but spectral magnitude was increased in clomipramine-treated males and females, and circadian amplitude was increased in clomipramine-treated females. Neonatal clomipramine also increased voluntary alcohol intake, and both clomipramine- and saline-treated groups displayed significant period-shortening during alcohol exposure Taken together, these results suggest that alterations in the amplitude and coherence of circadian rhythmicity may be more consistent than alterations in free-running period in animal depression models, as has been suggested previously for depressed patients.

AB  - Stimulating cardiac Î²1-adrenoceptors with oxyfedrine causes dilatation of coronary vessels and positive inotropic effects on the myocardium. Î²1-adrenergic agonists increase coronary blood flow in nonstenotic and stenotic vessels. The main indication for the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors pamrinone, mirinone, enoximone and piroximone is acute treatment of severe congestive heart failure. Theophylline is indicated for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, apnea in preterm infants ans sleep apnea syndrome. Severe arterial occlusive disease associated with atherosclerosis can be beneficially affected by elcosanoids. These drugs must be administered parenterally and have a half-life of only a few minutes. Sublingual or buccal preparations of nitrates are the only prompt method (within 1 or 2 min) of terminating anginal pain, except for biting nifedipine capsules. The short half-life (about 2.5 min) of nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) makes long term therapy impossible. Tolerance is a problem encountered with longer-acting nitric oxide donors. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of vasodilating drugs can prevent a too sudden and severe blood pressure decrease in patients with chronic hypertension. In considering the administration of a second dose, or another drug, the time necessary for the initially administered drug to reach maximal efficacy should be taken into account. In hypertensive emergencies urapidil, sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, hydralazine and phentolamine are the drugs of choice, with the addition of Î²-blockers during catecholamine crisis or dissecting aortic aneurysm. Childhood hypertension is most often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium antagonists, primarily nifedipine. Because of the teratogenic risk involved with ACE inhibitors, extreme caution must be exercised when prescribing for adolescent females. The propagation of health benefits to breast-fed infants, combined with more women delaying pregnancy until their fourth decade, has entailed an increase in the need fur hypertension management during lactation. Low dose hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol, nifendipine and enalapril or captopril do not pose enough of a risk to preclude breastfeeding in this group. The most frequently used antihypertensive agents during pregnancy are methyldopa, labetalol and calcium channel antagonists. Methyldopa and Î²-blockers are the drugs of choice for treating mild to moderate hypertension. Prazosin and hydralazine are used to treat moderate to severe hypertension and hydralazine, urapidil or labetalol are used to treat hypertensive emergencies. The use of overly aggressive antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy should be avoided so that adequate uteroplacental blood flow is maintained. Methyldopa is the only drug accepted for use during the first trimester of pregnancy.

AB  - Blood pressure (BP) differences between two consecutive 24-h monitoring periods (P1, P2) were analyzed in 159 hospitalized pregnant women. Reproducibility index, or twice the standard deviation of differences between individual systolic and diastolic means, was better for 24-h (7.8 and 5.8) and daytime (8.7 and 6.3) than for nighttime (12.2 and 9.7) BP means. It did not depend on BP level or gestation week. Alert reaction to monitoring procedure increased BP only in the first 2 h of P1. The high overall reproducibility of ambulatory BP in pregnancy supports the expanding use of the technique also in this condition.

AB  - Acute autonomic and sensory neuropathy (AASN) is a rare neuropathy characterized by acute autonomic dysfunction and objective sensory disturbances. A 26-year-old pregnant woman with severe autonomic and sensory dysfunction is reported. This patient suddenly developed marked nausea and vomiting in about 2 days after having a sore throat. She then developed signs of autonomic dysfunction including dilated non-reactive pupils, dryness of the eyes and oral mucous membranes, generalized anhidrosis, paralytic ileus, orthostatic hypotension, and continuous tachycardia. She also had severe generalized sensory impairments of all modalities, and all deep tendon reflexes were absent. Sensation was almost totally lost for all modalities below the neck. There was marked pseudoathetosis and sensory ataxia in all extremities. Motor examination was normal. She had inability to urinate. At this time she was 38 weeks pregnant, and when she showed signs of fetal distress, a Caesarean section was performed. Albumino-cytological dissociation was seen in the CSF. Serum noradrenalin was reduced, no sensory nerve action potentials could be elicited, and reduced coefficient of variation of the R-R interval on electrocardiography was observed. Plasma exchange was performed every other day for 3 days for about 3 weeks after the onset of the illness, but no favorable effects. Seven months after the onset, her autonomic dysfunction slightly improved, but there was no recovery from the sensory disturbances. Many symptoms and signs that characterize AASN occurred in this patient, and each was severe. The patient developed SIADH, sleep apnea, personality change, and amenorrhea in the course of the disease. We suggest that AASN patients might have both peripheral and central nervous system manifestations including seizures and personality changes.

AB  - Parturition is a multifactorial physiological process that involves multiple interconnected positive feedforward and negative feedback loops. Each of these loops is connected to others in a carefully time-regulated fashion. When parturition occurs normally, both fetal and maternal processes are involved. Recent research in pregnant sheep and nonhuman primates shows clearly that the fetus determines the duration of gestation and the mother determines the time of day at which labor begins. The fetal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a fundamental role in stimulating increased estrogen production in late gestation. Estrogen then activates maternal circadian rhythms that increase oxytocin secretion. As a result, uterine contraction patterns are switched from contractures to contractions.

AB  - The circadian melatonin rhythm with high levels in the dark period is important for the synchronization of reproductive response to appropriate environmental conditions in animals. The target sites of melatonin action on reproductive functions remain to be clarified. Using autoradiography (ARG) and radioreceptor binding assays with 2[125I]iodomelatonin, a melatonin agonist, as the radioligand, studies on the sites of melatonin action have increased significantly in the last ten years. The recent cloning of melatonin receptor subtypes also allowed the characterization of receptor(s) to the molecular level. Earlier reports have documented that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis plays a vital role in the regulation of reproduction by melatonin. This is supported in part by the demonstration of melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the brain and pars tuberalis (PT) in the pituitary. However, the nature of SCN and PT involvement in the reproductive action of melatonin remains unknown. In addition to the hypothalamus and pituitary, the two classical sites of melatonin action, other targets have been identified. The recent demonstration of 2[125I]iodomelatonin binding sites or melatonin receptors in the testis, epididymis, vas deferens, prostate, ovary and mammary gland suggest the concept of multiple sites of melatonin action on the reproductive system. The presence of melatonin receptors in the said tissues is consistent with earlier reports of direct melatonin actions on different levels of the reproductive system. This multiple levels of melatonin action, from the hypothalamus, pituitary, gonads to other reproductive tissues form a robust system of photoperiodic control in animal reproduction. This would guarantee successful gestation and delivery of the offspring at a time with optimum food availability and ultimately favourable for the survival of species. Molecular and cellular studies of melatonin signaling system(s), its regulation and effects on downstream functional events in the future may provide new insights and directions for the study of the physiology and pharmacology of fertility and contraception in animals and humans.

AB  - The role of the period of the environmental cycle during gestation and infancy on the circadian period of adult hamsters was studied. Tau-mutant hamsters of all three genotypes (+/+, 24-h circadian period; +/tau, 22-h period; tau/tau, 20-h period) were conceived and raised under either a 20-h light-dark cycle or a 24-h cycle. The circadian period in constant darkness was determined at 2 months of age by inspection of records of running-wheel activity. Differences in circadian period of up to 1.2 h were observed. However, changes of the same magnitude were also observed in animals conceived and raised under a 24-h cycle and exposed to a 20-h cycle at 8 months of age. Therefore, it is concluded that the aftereffects of entrainment can account for the apparent influence of the early environment. The free-running period of the circadian pacemaker seems to be under complete genetic control and not to be influenced by the period of the environmental cycle under which the animal is raised.

AB  - Within an interdisciplinary research project, the long-term outcome of children with fetal alcohol syndrome was studied. Methods for the assessment of psychopathology, behavior, and intelligence included psychiatric interviews, behavior checklists for parents and teachers, and intelligence tests. The children were assessed during preschool age, early school age (6 to 12 years), and late school age (â¤13 years). An excess of psychopathology, (including hyperkinetic disorders, emotional disorders, sleep disorders, and abnormal habits and sterotypies) with a strong persistence over time was found. Cognitive functioning was marked by a large proportion of mentally retarded children and also did not change considerably over time. This long- term outcome study reflects the handicapping effects of fetal alcohol syndrome.

AB  - The authors investigated risk profiles of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a function of age at death. A case-control study carried out in the Tyrol region of Austria enrolled 99 infants who died of SIDS between 1984 and 1994 and 136 randomly selected controls. Early and late SIDS (<120 days of age vs. â¤120 days) were defined according to the clear-cut bimodal age-at- death distribution. Inadequate antenatal care, low parental social and educational level, and the prone sleeping position were risk conditions that applied to both early and late SIDS. A marked seasonal variation (winter preponderance) was the most outstanding feature of late SIDS. A gestational age of <37 weeks (odds ratio (OR) = 8.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6- 26.0), repeated episodes of apnea (OR = 5.7, 95% CI 1.2-27.0), low birth weight (<2,500 g) (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-11.0), a family history of sudden infant death (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.5), and maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.5) were associated with early SIDS. This study identified two distinct subgroups of SIDS infants characterized by different risk conditions and ages at death. These results underline a multiple-cause hypothesis for SIDS etiology which involves a genetic predisposition, immaturity in the first months of life, and environmental factors acting at various ages.

AB  - The general pharmacological properties of a combination of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexipril hydrochloride (CAS 82586-52-5) and the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (CAS 58-93-5, HCTZ), ratio 7.5 + 12.5, were studied in generally accepted models in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the combination showed neither agonistic nor antagonistic activities on the isolated guinea pig trachea in concentrations up to 2 x 10-4 g/ml. In mice, there was no effect on intestinal motility or the thiopental-induced sleeping time up to 1000 mg/kg. The only activity observed in mice was an inhibition of spontaneous motility after oral dosing with 300 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively. Both HCTZ (1-10 mg/kg) alone and the combination moexipril/HCTZ (1.6 or 4.8 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in diuresis and electrolyte excretion in rats, however, without any potentiating effects for the drug combination. On the cardiovascular system of anaesthetised dogs, the effects observed were as expected, e.g. dose- related decrease in blood pressure. Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs revealed the kidney as target organ. This effect, based on highly exaggerated pharmacological activity, is well-known for other ACE inhibitors. No potential for teratogenic effects could be observed for the drug combination. In summary, the preclinical data indicate that the combination of moexipril and HCTZ (ratio 7.5 + 12.5) represents a safe drug without relevant side effects or gross toxicity.

AB  - It has previously been reported that active glottic adduction is present during prolonged apneas but absent during periods of breathing movements in fetal lambs in utero. The present study was aimed at examining the precise coordination between fetal breathing movements [diaphragm electromyographic (EMG) activity (Di EMG)] and glottic adduction [thyroarytenoid muscle EMG activity (TA EMG)]. Electrodes for electroencephalogram, eye movements, TA EMG, and Di EMG and an arterial catheter were surgically implanted in fetal lambs 123-142 days postconception. Polygraphic recordings were performed without sedation while the ewe breathed room air (n = 11) or various gas mixtures (hypoxia, n = 5; hyperoxia, n = 4; hypercapnia, n = 5; hypercapnia+hyperoxia, n = 5). Tonic TA EMG was observed throughout >90% of apneas (>6 s) in both non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep, and when Di EMG frequency decreased in rapid-eye-movement sleep. In all but two fetuses, TA EMG was immediately inhibited when Di EMG appeared. Altering blood gases did not modify these results. In conclusion, Di EMG and TA EMG are well coordinated in late gestation in fetal lambs, except in a few cases. These findings may have consequences for understanding the pathogenesis of mixed/obstructive apneas of prematurity.

AB  - A kinetic parameter (the V(m)/K(m) ratio), an index of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase catalytic efficiency, was studied in 36 women with normal pregnancies at 16-20 weeks' gestation. On each blood sample, determinations were achieved on enzyme extracted from maternal granulocytes by monitoring the phosphohydrolytic activity at 400 nm on a spectrophotometer equipped with software for computation of kinetic parameters. Infant sex was recorded at the delivery for all women included in this study. The recent introduction of NAP as a marker for some pathological pregnancies requires a better knowledge of the behaviour of that enzyme in physiological conditions. Data reported focus attention on fetal sex. It appears to be one of the factors involved in variations of kinetic parameters observed in maternal NAP. Sex-linked differences in placental maturation could explain these results.

AB  - The main objectives of this work were to determine the physiological patterns of progesterone on pregnancy and lactation in ewes, and to verify whether the hormone presents a 24h secretion rhythm. Serum levels of progesterone increased during gestation with an abrupt decrease by two days preterm. The autocorrelation analysis showed that this hormone, had a more evident circadian rhythm on preterm, than during early pregnancy and lactation.

AB  - Sleep is a brain function occupying nearly a third of our lifes and strongly afecting the remaining twothirds. Each year up to 40 per cent of the adult population complain about Â«trouble sleepingÂ». We know now that, regardless of the reason for the sleep disruption, its consequences for the individual and society can be serious. The goal of this review is to present an overview, both of the normal human sleep and its variations -special mention of the women's features- and most important sleep disorders in the general population or those of women's own.

AB  - Objective: To assess objectively the fetal autonomic response to vibroacoustic stimulation and test the method in cases with and without prior exposure to narcotic analgesics. Methods: Intrapartum fetal electrocardiographic recordings from 24 term pregnancies were analyzed by power spectral analysis of epochs of 256 consecutive beats. Recordings were taken before vibroacoustic stimulation, and 1 and 10 min after vibroacoustic stimulation both during periods of spontaneous and narcotic-induced fetal quiet sleep. Results: Vibroacoustic stimulation caused a significant rise in fetal sympathetic tone documented by an increase in total power and a shift towards the very low frequency band (0-0.05 Hz). This response was observed during both types of fetal sleep. Spectral analysis was, however, able to elucidate the difference between spontaneous and narcotic-induced fetal sleep by showing a sustained rise in sympathetic tone versus a complete recovery to prestimulation values within 10 min in each group, respectively. Conclusions: Spectral analysis of fetal heart rate variability provides an effective tool for quantifying the fetal response to vibroacoustic stimulation. This is shown by the ability to differentiate between spontaneous and narcotic-induced fetal sleep. The change in fetal state, but not the immediate 'startle response' is suppressed by narcotic analgesia.

AB  - Although the cause or causes of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) remain unknown, the incidence of SIDS is on the decline in the United States and other countries. This decline has been accomplished largely through public education campaigns informing parents about several important factors associated with an increased risk of SIDS. These factors are prone and side infant sleeping positions, exposure of infants to cigarette smoke and potentially hazardous sleeping environments. Risk-reduction measures such as placing healthy infants to sleep in the supine position, avoiding passive smoke exposure both before and after birth and optimizing crib safety are beginning to lower the SIDS rate in this country. Through patient education, family physicians can further reduce the incidence of the number one cause of death in infants one week to one year old.

AB  - To obtain insight into the development of the heterogeneous intracerebral populations of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons, their spatiotemporal appearance was examined at different stages in normal rat embryos, in nasal epithelial explants in vitro, and in intrauterine nasal-operated embryos. Following the appearance of nerve cell adhesion molecule in the nasal placode at embryonic day (E) 12.5, LHRH neurons, generated in the nasal placode at E13.5, penetrated the forebrain vesicle (FV) by E14.5-15.5. After E16.5, as the FV elongated to form the olfactory bulb, the migrating neurons traversed posteriorly through the interhemispheric space to penetrate the septopreoptic (S-P) area. By E18.5, LHRH neurons were detected in the preoptic-diagonal band (P-D) area as well as in the S-P region, along with some scattered extrahypothalamic LHRH neurons. To determine the source of these neurons, we separately cultured dissected parts of E12.5 nasal pit epithelium. Neuronal generation was predominantly from the medial wall epithelium (NAP), but some LHRH neurons originated in the roof epithelium. Cocultures of the NAP (E12.5) with the FV, median eminence-arcuate complex, Rathke's pouch, mesencephalon, or medulla oblongata from E14.5 embryos revealed the ability of LHRH cells to penetrate all of these tissues. Uni- or bilateral nasal destruction was conducted at E16.5 or E15.5, respectively, and examined at E18.5 and E21.5. In the operated embryos, most LHRH neurons were present in the P-D system and some in the S-P area. This finding suggests that the neurons generated before E15.5 are primarily predisposed to form the P-D system, whereas those derived afterward form the S-P system.

AB  - The behavioral state of active or rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is dominant during fetal life and may play an important role in brain development. One marker of this state in fetal sheep is neck nuchal muscle atonia (NA). We observed burst within burst NA patterns suggestive of recurrent fractal organization in continuous 13 day in utero recordings of NA during the third trimester. Consistent with fractal renewal processes, the cumulative mean and standard deviation (SD) diverged over this time and the tail of NA distributions fit a stable Levy law with exponents that remained invariant over the periods of development examined. The Hurst exponent, a measure of self-affine fractals, indicated that long-range correlations among NA intervals were present throughout development. A conserved complex fractal structure is apparent in NA which may help elucidate ambiguities in defining fetal states as well as some unique properties of fetal REMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To characterise the relationship between breast cancer and different aspects of the reproductive life, use of drugs and alcohol by family history of breast cancer. PADENTS AND METHODS: From the cancer registry of Girona, Spain, 330 women were identified with histologically confirmed breast cancer during 1986-1989. For each case, a control women was selected from a random sample of the population living in the matched area to the case by age (Â± 5 yr.). The information was collected by a personal interview and included: family history of breast cancer, reproductive history, presence of acne during the teenage years, use of oral contraceptives and drugs for sleep and anxiety disorders, and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: 18.5% of breast cancer cases and 8.9% of all controls had a family history of breast cancer. Family history on a first degree relative (mother or sister) was present in 10.6% of the cases and 2.8% of controls, which represented an odds ratio for breast cancer of 3.7 (95% Cl, 1.8-7.8) higher than the general population. Women with a first degree family history of breast cancer were at higher risk for breast cancer if the had a history of acne during the teenage period (OR = 2.4; 95% Cl, 1.1-5.2) and if they referred long menstrual periods in the early years of menarche (OR = 3.1; 95% Cl, 1.3-7.0). Women with no family history had a higher breast cancer risk if they had a late menarche, long menstrual periods, late first full term pregnancy, and history of acne during puberty. Alcohol consumption and use of drugs for anxiety and sleep disorders were associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: First degree family history of breast cancer seems to be the best risk indicator for developing breast cancer. Long menstrual periods and presence of acne during puberty may indicate hormonal imbalance that act independently of the family history in breast cancer development.

AB  - To test for the presence in utero of diurnal periodicity in the amount of time spent in organized behavioral states, seven records of 24-hour duration were obtained from each of five chronically instrumented fetal baboons between 144 and 158 days gestation (term=175 days). Concordance of fetal breathing activity, heart-period variability, and electroencephalographic parameters were used to define two distinctive patterns of fetal physiological activities. One pattern was characterized as EEG activity dominated by tracÃ© alternant, reduced heart-period variability, and fewer breaths in epochs of fetal breathing. This fetal behavioral state (1FB) is analogous to quiet sleep in infants. A second pattern was characterized by the relative absence of tracÃ© alternant, increased heart-period variability, and fetal breathing activity. This fetal behavioral state (2FB) is analogous to active sleep. Cycles of these states were present 29% of time, with a duration of approximately 26 minutes and a 1.7:1 predominance of 2FB/1FB. Cosinor analysis across fetuses revealed a significant (p<.01) 24-hour periodicity of the time spent by the fetus in organized behavioral states, with a peak around 1400 (lights-on 0700 to 1900) and a peak-nadir fluctuation of 15%. These periodicities in the incidence of organized state were significant (p<.01) in three fetuses, and approached significance (<.09) in the two others. Data demonstrate a diurnal rhythmicity in fetal behavioral states, with less time spent in organized state at night than during the day.

AB  - We report on a patient with a diagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) who became pregnant during treatment with the nCPAP (nasal continuous positive airway pressure) apparatus, and gave birth. In the literature search we didn't find any similar case report. The present view on OSAS treatment with particular regard to the use of nCPAP is also presented. Through reviewing literature we analysed positive effects of this kind of treatment on mother and fetus. The negative aspects of nCPAP treatment are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations periodically occur with uterine contractures during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia in goats. METHODS: In five chronically catheterized goat fetuses at 125-130 days' gestation, incidence of FHR decelerations was compared between 6 hours' control time and 6 hours' induced hypoxemia with two-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple range test. Three other fetuses were used as controls for circadian rhythm. RESULTS: Fetal PaO2 was significantly decreased from 26.1 to 16.3 mmHg without acidemia. During hypoxemia, 42 decelerations were induced along with 5 initial decelerations during the acute phase hypoxemia. Incidence of decelerations increased significantly from 0.07 Â± 0.15 per hour in 6-hour controls to 1.40 Â± 0.28 per hour during 6 hours' induced hypoxemia. Short-term variability and long-term variability of the 42 decelerations were significantly increased. These variabilities were also increased during the 5 initial decelerations. Frequency of uterine contractures did not change during hypoxemia. There was an observable association of FHR decelerations with uterine contractures during hypoxemia. CONCLUSION: Fetal heart rate decelerations occurred periodically in association with uterine contractures during induced 6 hours' hypoxemia, which were characterized by slow onset and recovery with increases in variability.

AB  - Our aim was to evaluate long-term effects of exogenous surfactant therapy on pulmonary functional outcome in children born very preterm. We examined 40 children aged 7-12 years who were born before 30 weeks of gestation with an immature surfactant system, and were randomized to one of three treatment groups: human surfactant given at birth (prophylactic), human surfactant given after development of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (rescue), and placebo (air) treatment. Spirometric parameters of preterm born children were compared with those of 20 children born at term. In addition, spirometric parameters were monitored twice daily for 4 weeks using a home spirometer. All spirometric parameters were significantly lower in the preterm groups than in the controls, except for the forced vital capacity (FVC) in the prophylactically treated group. Bronchial obstruction was found in 53% of the prophylactically treated group, in 36% of the rescue group, in 67% of the placebo group, and in 0% of the control group. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) and FVC values were higher in those children who received surfactant compared with the placebo group (P &lt; 0.05). In 16 children (40%) born preterm, a Î²2-agonist induced an increase in PEF â¤15% at least three times during 2 weeks of home monitoring; eight children (20%) had abnormal diurnal PEF variation. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the independent variables associated with favorable outcomes in spirometric parameters were surfactant therapy (P = 0.012-0.045) and short intubation time after birth (P = 0.0009-0.0044). Bronchial obstruction, responsiveness to a Î²2-agonist, and high diurnal PEF variation are common in children born before 30 gestational weeks. Surfactant supplementation reducing the need for mechanical ventilation or supplementary oxygen after birth may decrease the severity of immaturity related bronchial obstruction in childhood.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of an intervention for polydrug-using adolescent mothers. The program included educational, vocational, and parenting classes; social and drug rehab; and day care for their infants while they attended school half-day. The drug-exposed infants were similar to the non-exposed infants on traditional birth measures, although they had inferior Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale scores, including habituation, orientation, abnormal reflexes, general irritability, and regulatory capacity. The drug-exposed infants also spent less time in quiet sleep and more time crying and showing stress behaviors. Both the mothers and the infants in the drug groups demonstrated inferior interactions, and their dopamine and serotonin levels were significantly higher. As early as 3 months (following 3 months of intervention), the drug rehab mothers and their infants looked more like the nondrug group in their interactions; by 6 months, they looked similar on virtually every measure. At 12 months, the infants of drug rehab mothers (versus the drug control group) had superior Early Social Communication Scale scores and Bayley Mental scale scores, as well as significantly greater head circumference and fewer pediatric complications. The drug rehab mothers also improved on several lifestyle variables. They demonstrated a lower incidence of continued drug use and repeat pregnancy, and a greater number continued school, received a high school or general equivalency diploma, or were placed in a job. Thus, a relatively cost-effective high school based intervention had positive effects on both adolescent mothers who had used drugs and their infants.

AB  - The present study was conducted in a population living near a recycling plant for zinc and other metallic dusts to determine whether exposures to these substances were occurring and producing adverse health effects. The plant is situated in a suburb of Monterrey, which is the third most populous city in Mexico and the second most industrialized. A cross-sectional study design was used for the investigation, which was carried out from September 1994 to November 1994. Using cluster sampling procedures, homes in two areas were selected-one exposed through proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed to serve as a control-until the desired sample size was achieved (621 individuals, with an average of five per dwelling). A specially trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to an adult member of each family, soliciting data on the presence of acute and chronic infections, complications of pregnancy, and congenital diseases among the family members. One hundred twenty-seven questionnaires were administered in the exposed population, yielding information on 596 individuals. In the unexposed population, 147 questionnaires were administered furnishing data on 743 individuals. The sex and age distributions of the two populations were similar. The unexposed population had a slightly longer average duration of residence. The most common health problems in the exposed population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies, sleep disturbances, bronchitis, excessive fatigue, skin problems, otitis, and anemia. The exposed population had significantly higher risks for skin eruptions and diseases, excessive fatigue, sleep disturbances, upper respiratory infections, otitis, bronchitis, and allergies. Exposed and unexposed women had comparable prevalences of obstetrical problems, spontaneous abortions, congenitally malformed offspring, and low birthweight. The questionnaire used to detect health problems has low sensitivity and may have generated underestimates of some conditions. Nevertheless, the analysis controlled for several different biases, and thus it can be concluded that a positive association exists between environmental exposure to these wastes and increased risk of disease.

AB  - When oxygenation is compromised the fetus is capable of a number of adaptive responses, both protective and potentially pathologic, which can be categorized as those affecting fetal metabolism and those affecting fetal oxygen transport. However, both the extent and the duration of the impairment in oxygenation will bear on these adaptive responses. While fetal O2 extraction is increased when oxygenation is acutely compromised thus maintaining O2, consumption, with chronic hypoxemia there is a decrease in O2 consumption paralleling that in O2 delivery and contributed to by the resultant fall-off in growth and alterations in behavioural activity. While a redistribution of blood flow to vital organs continues to be evident, this will be less pronounced than that seen with acute hypoxemia reflecting diminished hormonal changes, underlying metabolic alterations, and the extent to which fetal blood gases are normalized. Much of this information is based on experimental data using unanesthetized fetal sheep with chronic catheterization; however, clinical outcome data and the use of investigative techniques including ultrasound scanning and cordocentesis have supported the relevance of this experimental data to the human situation.

AB  - Nocturnal incontinence (enuresis) affects 20% of children over four years old, and this figure typically decreases by 15% each year. At the age of 18, 1% of those people remain enuretic. Nocturnal enuresis can be treated by means of a conditioning device that awakens the patient once the urine level has reached a preestablished threshold of the capacity of his or her bladder. We have designed and implemented a portable miniaturized ultrasonic monitor, which permits estimation of the urine volume with an accuracy of 75%. Prototypes have been completed and validated on 41 patients (children) at Ste. Justine Hospital (Montreal). On the first group of 33 patients, we used a hand-held transducer to determine the volume detection range, which is accurate for volumes between 40 and 400 mL. With the second group of 8 patients, the device was mounted on an elastic belt around the abdomen. Measurements were taken in order to validate the accuracy of urine threshold detection and the activation of the corresponding alarm.

AB  - Fetal bladder volume and hourly fetal urine production (HFUPR) is calculated on the assumption that the fetal bladder is ellipsoid in shape. A recent validation study demonstrated a progressive overestimation at increasing bladder volumes. This may be due to changes in shape of the fetal bladder at increasing volumes. Two independent papers have shown increased HFUPR during fetal behavioural state 1F (S1F) when compared with S2F. The aim of the present study was to assess whether this increase of HFUPR during S1F, previously observed by others, could be the result of an error introduced by the method of volume calculation. A retrospective evaluation was performed in a series of 208 HFUPR measurements in 123 normal near term pregnant women attending a low-risk antenatal clinic. Adequate bladder filling in both states was identified in 43 recordings. Maximum fetal bladder volumes were greater (> 10 ml) during S1F in comparison to S2F in 56% of these recordings and HFUPR was significantly greater during S1F only in these cases. Bladder volumes are usually lower during S2F as a result of fetal voiding, which occurred in association with 22 of 36 transitions from S1F to S2F, and only 1 of 13 transitions from S2F to S1F (P < 0.001). When disregarding calculated bladder volumes in excess of 20 ml for the purpose of calculating HFUPR, eleven recordings remained. HFUPR calculated in this way was significantly lower in comparison to measurements where larger bladder volumes were included and no difference was observed between states. This implies that the differences observed are the result of the greater error in calculating bladder volumes and HFUPR during S1F, where volumes are usually greater and that calculation of fetal bladder volume should not be performed on the assumption that the bladder is ellipsoid in shape. Alternative techniques include limiting measurements to a maximum volume of approximately 20 ml, when the bladder is usually ellipsoid in shape or basing volume calculation on the surface area of a series of sagittal views as suggested by Hedriana and Moore.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) serves an important luteotrophic function in the rat during early pregnancy, expressed as a nocturnal surge in the early morning and a diurnal surge in the late afternoon. Several areas of the hypothalamus, including the preoptic area (POA), the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei (VM-DM) have been implicated in PRL surges. We investigated the temporal relationship between neuronal activity as measured by c-Fos immunocytochemistry in these areas and PRL secretion during early and late pregnancy. Brains were collected at nine time points (24:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00 and 20:00 h) on days 6-7 and three time points (02:00, 14:00 and 18:00 h) on days 14-15 of pregnancy. Plasma PRL levels determined by radioimmunoassay revealed two surges with peaks at 02:00 and 18:00 h and a trough at 14:00 h on days 6-7, which were absent on days 14-15 of pregnancy. The number of neurons expressing c-Fos in the anterior medial preoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic area and the medial preoptic nucleus, but not the anteroventral preoptic nucleus of the POA, and the VM-DM, showed a semicircadian rhythm which was maximal at 02:00 h or/and 04:00 and 18:00 h and reached the lowest value at 14:00 h, in parallel with the PRL surges in early pregnancy. However, the temporal pattern of c-Fos in these areas was reversed during late pregnancy, with a peak at 14:00 h and low levels at 02:00 and 18:00 h. PRL surges were absent and levels were uniformly low during these times. Neuronal activity in the SCN did not show any correlation with PRL surges. The dorsomedial subdivision of the SCN showed high neuronal activity during the daytime in both stages of pregnancy. Neuronal activity in the ventrolateral subdivision of the SCN was high during the nighttime in early pregnancy, however it exhibited high levels during the daytime in late pregnancy. These results suggest that the two daily surges of PRL secretion during the first half of pregnancy might be related to the temporal rhythm of neuronal activity in the POA and the VM-DM, and a major change in the pattern of neuronal activity in these hypothalamic areas might result in termination of the PRL surges at midpregnancy.

AB  - Melatonin, an indole amine, primarily derived from the pineal gland is secreted during the hours of darkness. Melatonin acts as a hormonal transduction of photoperiod influencing the timing of seasonal and daily (circadian) physiological rhythms. Maternal melatonin crosses the placenta and enters the fetal circulation providing photoperiodic information to the fetus influencing the subsequent circadian and seasonal rhythms of the offspring. The function of melatonin in humans is more obscure. However, melatonin has attained prominence as a treatment for disturbed circadian rhythms and sleep patterns which occur as a result of transmeridian travel, shift work or blindness. The biological clock, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), possesses melatonin receptors, in both the adult and fetal human. This concurs with the reported influence of melatonin on human circadian rhythmicity and indicates that this influence may begin in utero. Melatonin receptors are widespread in the human fetus and occur in both central and peripheral tissue from early in fetal development. Thus, the influence of melatonin on the developing human fetus may not be limited to entraining circadian rhythmicity. Considering the transplacental availability of melatonin to the fetus the ingestion of melatonin by pregnant women may be inadvisable.

AB  - The diurnal change ill baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) of four anencephalic fetuses at 20, 23, 24 and 30 weeks of gestation were examined. The mean baseline FHR in 00.00-06.00 h, 06.00-12.00 h, 12.00-18.00 h and 18.00-24.00 h were compared by one-factor ANOVA and Scheffe's test in each case. The diurnal variations in baseline FHR were recognized in all subjects (P < 0.01). In 3/4 subjects, the lowest values were at 00.00-06.00 h. The diurnal variation in baseline FHR might be caused by maternal factors because it was present even in the anencephalic fetuses that had no central nervous system having the oscillators of the circadian rhythm.

AB  - Dyspnea is so common during pregnancy that it is often referred to as 'physiologic' dyspnea. Generally this dyspnea occurs with exercise rather than at rest, but it is not a cause of significant exercise limitation. Although the mechanical impediment of the gravid uterus is often blamed, hyperventilation due to increased progesterone levels probably is the most important mechanism. It is essential to distinguish this physiologic dyspnea from breathlessness caused by disorders complicating pregnancy or diseases that may coexist with pregnancy. Sleep-disordered breathing is a much less studied phenomenon. Obstructive sleep apnea probably occurs in 1.5 to 2% of the population of child-bearing age. Only few data are available suggesting that pregnancy may cause or exacerbate this disorder, and most cases may simply represent the coexistence of two common conditions. Pregnancy does not appear to cause central sleep apnea. Since hypoxemia can cause intrauterine growth retardation and adverse fetal outcome, sleep-disordered breathing should be treated when of significant degree.

AB  - Tenascin-C (TN), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein which reveals both neurite outgrowth-promoting and growth-inhibiting effects, is generated in the central nervous system. A previous study reported that TN-gene null mutant mice display hyperlocomotion and do not easily habituate to unfamiliar environments. Additionally, these mice display poor appetite, abnormal circadian rhythm and low pregnancy rate. The present study demonstrated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression is reduced in the limbic area of the TN gene-deficient mouse brain as compared to wild-type mice. NPY has been shown to affect emotion, circadian rhythm and food intake, and the present results suggest that the some behavioural abnormalities exhibited by TN-mutant mice may be in part due to the low level of expression of NPY mRNA in the limbic system.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We quantified the presence of diurnal rhythms in various computerized analysis of continuous parameters in normal pregnancies to assess their clinical relevance. STUDY DESIGN: Modified cosine analysis was applied to the outcomes of computerized analysis of continuous 24-hour fetal heart rate recordings in 26 normal pregnancies. Diurnal rhythms in maternal heart rate and plasma hormones were assessed in 15 and 17 pregnancies, respectively. Correlations between maternal and fetal rhythms were calculated. RESULTS: A significant diurnal rhythm in basal heart rate was present in 73% of the fetuses and was closely related to the maternal heart rate rhythm. Diurnal rhythms in heart rate variability, accelerations, and activity were present in only 30% to 50% of the fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: The mother entrains fetal diurnal rhythms. The normal variability in neural development may account for the absence of diurnal rhythms in some fetuses.

AB  - Sleep log study, which was designed to study sleep characteristics by questionnaire, was performed on 172 pregnant women about the relationship between their pregnancy and their night sleep. Sleep behavior by sleep log revealed that they woke more frequently during the course of their pregnancy and that their total sleep time decreased gradually toward the end of their pregnancy. According to their subjective evaluations, these shortages of night sleep could not be made up with the morning naps in the multiparas as was the case of the primiparas. These changes in sleep characteristics have been studied from biological, psychological and social factors view points.

AB  - This study addresses the likelihood of false negative urine pregnancy test results, due to physiological urine dilution as described in some anecdotal reports. In this prospective study 320 pregnancy tests were performed on urine samples of varying concentrations obtained from 40 women, with suspected complications of early pregnancy, who had presented for ultrasound scans. Four different pregnancy tests were used and serum Î²hCG levels were measured quantitatively. Despite a mean fivefold increase in urine dilution, the pregnancy tests with low Î²hCG detection limits maintained maximal sensitivity. The detection of Î²hCG in dilute urine was adversely affected by using pregnancy tests with higher Î²hCG detection limits and these tests should be used with caution when assessing gynaecological emergencies.

AB  - We have examined prospectively whether the combined approach of establishing tolerance intervals for the circadian variability of blood pressure (BP) as a function of gestational age, and then determining the so-called hyperbaric index (area of BP excess above the upper limit of the tolerance interval) by comparison of any patient's BP profifle (obtained by ambulatory monitoring) with those intervals provides a high sensitivity test for the early detection of pregnant women who subsequently will develop gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. We analyzed 657 BP series from 92 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 378 series from 60 women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. BP was sampled for about 48 hours once every 4 weeks after the first obstetric consultation. Circadian 90% tolerance limits were determined as a function of trimester of gestation from 497 series previously sampled from a reference group of 189 normotensive pregnant women. The hyperbaric index was then determined for each individual BP series in the validation sample. Sensitivity of this test for diagnosing gestational hypertension was 93% for women sampled during the first trimester of gestation and increased up to 99% in the third trimester. The positive and negative predictive values were above 96% in all trimesters. Despite the limitations of ambulatory monitoring, the approach presented here, now validated prospectively, represents a reproducible, noninvasive, and high sensitivity test for the very early identification of subsequent gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, on the average, 23 weeks before the clinical confirmation of the disease.

AB  - Aldosterone concentrations in the plasma of specific-pathogen-free, domestic, short-hair cats given sodium replete diets were measured by a radio-immunoassay. Plasma samples assayed were taken from male and female cats of 8, 12, 17, 20, 26, 29, 40 and &gt;52 weeks of age, from adult non-pregnant queens, and from queens in the ninth weeks of pregnancy and in the second and fifth week of lactation. Plasma aldosterone concentration was also measured in samples taken four times over a 24 h period (06:00-06:30, 11:00-11:30, 17:00-17:30 and 23:00-23:30) in a group of seven adult male cats. Neither age nor sex had a significant effect on the plasma aldosterone concentration. Also, queens had similar aldosterone concentrations in plasma whether they were non-pregnant, pregnant, or lactating. No circadian rhythm was observed in plasma aldosterone concentrations in adult male cats. The plasma aldosterone concentrations of 148 cats (87 males and 61 females, ranging in ages from 8 to&gt;52 weeks) had a positive skew distribution with a median of 161 pmol 1-1. The upper value for plasma aldosterone concentration in healthy domestic cats as defined by the 95 percentile was 700 pmol 1-1. Â© 1998 BailliÃ¨re Tindall.

AB  - Sixteen multiparous, pregnant, lactating Holstein cows (weighing 600 Â± 50 kg, at 184.8 Â± 52 d of lactation, and at 101.9 Â± 43 d of gestation) were confined to wooden metabolism cages and exposed to a vertical electric field of 10 kV/m and a uniform horizontal magnetic field of 30 Î¼T. The trial was conducted using a switchback statistical design. Cows were divided into two sequence groups of 8 cows each. One sequence group was exposed for three periods of 28 d each. The electric and magnetic fields were off during the first period, on during the second period, and off during the final period. The second sequence group was exposed for three periods also, but the activity of the fields was reversed (on during the first period, off during the second period, and on during the third period). On d 25 of each exposure period, blood samples were obtained every 0.5 h for 14 h starting at 1700 h to determine melatonin concentration. Nocturnal melatonin concentrations did not show any variation that could be attributed to exposure to electric and magnetic fields.

AB  - Purpose: Several studies demonstrated that circadian blood pressure profile is impaired in patients with preeclampsia. Aim of the study was to evaluate the circadian blood pressure profile in pregnant patients with HELLP syndrome. Study design: Noninvasive 24-hour-blood pressure measurement (SpaceLabs 90207) was performed in 16 pregnant patients with HELLP syndrome and in 10 healthy, normotensive, pregnant controls. Results: The results indicate that the circadian blood pressure rhythm is disturbed in patients with HELLP syndrome as compared to normotensive healthy pregnant controls (p < 0.05). Mean arterial blood pressure decreased in patients with HELLP syndrome for 106.6 mmHg during day to 99.2 mmHg during night. The decrease of mean arterial blood pressure of 7.7 mmHg (6.9%) was less extensive as compared to the controls (15.7%). The low nocturnal decrease of blood pressure did not correlate with the maternal heart rate, which decreased significantly during the night. The pathological change of circadian blood pressure profile was transitory and normalised within four months post partum. Conclusion: Results suggest that the circadian blood pressure profile is altered in patients with HELLP syndrome leading to the recommendation of careful blood pressure monitoring throughout the night.

AB  - The objective was to study the impact of birth weight on the relationship between ambulatory blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion in children and adolescents. The study included 134 healthy children (61 boys), all Caucasians, who were born at term after a normotensive pregnancy. For each subject, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a complete urine collection were simultaneously performed according to the protocols designed. Average ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and the urinary excretion rates for sodium, potassium, and creatinine were calculated separately for 24-hour, awake, and sleep periods defined by a mini-diary. The excretion rate of sodium during sleep time was positively correlated with ambulatory systolic BP; such a positive relationship was not found for waking hours. Consequently, the impact of birth weight on the relationship between blood pressure and the urinary sodium excretion rate was analyzed during sleeping hours. Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that although current weight was the strongest predictor for the sodium excretion rate during sleep (P <.001), there was also an independent significant direct relationship for birth weight (P <.04) after controlling for age, sex, and the average of systolic BP during sleep. Adjusted for current weight, a significant difference in the regression slopes relating urinary sodium excretion rate and systolic BP during sleep exists between children in the lowest (< 3.100 kg) and the highest tertiles (> 3.500 kg) of birth weight (P <.02). Differences in sodium excretion rates, adjusted for current weight, between the two extreme tertiles of birth weight became significant at the highest systolic BP (P <.04). The children who had the lowest birth weight tended to excrete less sodium during sleep. The results of the present study show a blunted pressure natriuresis curve in children and adolescents with the lowest birth weight. Whether this abnormal renal sodium handling may be present as an initial or as an intermediate mechanism leading to higher BP values must be assessed in additional studies.

AB  - While circadian variations in birth and perinatal mortality rates have previously been described in the literature, the reasons behind these observed rhythms remain unclear. The principal hypothetical causes include variations in obstetric practices and an association between the time of birth and biological parameters. In order to explore this issue we analysed the distribution patterns for time and day of birth, as well as circadian variations in maternal characteristics, obstetric practices and neonatal risk in a population at low obstetric risk. The study population included 685 low- risk pregnant women consecutively admitted at an early stage of labour to six maternity units. The results showed hourly variations in the birth rate and circadian variations in obstetric practices that might explain the hourly pattern observed for the birth rate. By contrast, the frequency of a positive neonatal risk indicator was uniform across all time categories in this population at low obstetric risk.

AB  - One family group of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) was observed in captivity under natural environmental conditions to describe the circadian pattern of grooming behavior during the pregnancy of the reproductive female. The animals were observed by focal sampling, from the beginning to the end of animal's active phase, during two non-consecutive days per week, from August to November 1996. The duration of self-grooming and social grooming behavior of each animal were totalled each hour. The time series obtained were analyzed by Cluster Analysis and by Single Cosinor Analysis. The daily patterns of grooming behavior during pregnancy were divided by Cluster Analysis into two stages, one corresponding to the second half of the third month of pregnancy, and the other from the last half of the third month to the last week before parturition. The confidence intervals of acrophases overlapped in all stages. The acrophases values of the first stage occurred between 10:09 h and 11:00 h, and on the second stage between 8:51 h and 11: 13 h. The daily pattern of grooming behavior of adult male and female showed a trend to increase in the first hours of the active phase. This trend to advance grooming behavior during the second stage of pregnancy may be due to an effect of the coming parturition itself or to seasonal influences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the effects of the progestomimetic compound nomegestrol acetate on spontaneous and sulprostone-induced uterine contractility in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. STUDY DESIGN: Intrauterine pressure was continuously monitored with use of an implanted intraamniotic catheter and a telemetric pressure transmitter acetate (5 mg per day orally, n=3) or vehicle only (controls, n=3). The intramuscular prostaglandin E2 analog sulprostone (25 Î¼g) was administered as a single injection 10 days after amniotic catheter implantation. Spontaneous and sulprostone-induced uterine contractions were compared between nomegestrol acetate- and vehicle- treated animals. RESULTS: The frequency of spontaneous uterine contractions in control animals demonstrated a 24-hour pattern with a minimum at 12 hours and a maximum at 0 hours. The frequency of spontaneous contractions did not differ between nomegestrol acetate- and vehicle-treated animals. Sulprostone induced an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of contractions, reaching a maximum 12 hours after injection and fading out after 24 hours in vehicle-treated animals. In animals receiving nomegestrol acetate, the frequency of contractions increased moderately and transiently for a total durations of 6 hours only and returned to control levels thereafter. CONCLUSION: Nomegestrol acetate significantly the contractile response of the pregnant uterus induced by the prostaglandin E2 analog sulprostone.

AB  - The aim of these studies was to investigate maternal entrainment of developing circadian locomotor activity rhythms in the Siberian hamster. In Experiment 1, mothers were transferred from a 16:8 LD cycle into constant dim red light (DD) from the day of parturition, and wheel-running activity of the mother and pups was individually monitored from the time of weaning. The phases of the individual pups' rhythms were found to be synchronized both to the phase of the mother and to the phase of lights off (ZT 12) of the photo cycle that the mother was exposed to until the day of parturition. To investigate whether this synchrony might reflect direct effects of light acting upon the fetal circadian system in late gestation, the experiment was repeated but with mothers placed into DD early in pregnancy (â¤ day 7 of gestation). The results were similar to the first study, suggesting that the mother rather than the photo cycle during the latter part of gestation entrains the developing circadian system. The third experiment investigated whether this entrainment occurred during the postnatal period. Breeding pairs were maintained on alternative light-dark cycles, LD and DL, that were 12 h out of phase. Litters born to mothers on one light-dark cycle were exchanged on the day of birth with foster mothers from the reversed light-dark cycle, then raised in DD. Control litters exchanged between mothers from the same light-dark cycle had similar litter synchrony as shown by nonfostered litters of Experiment 1. However, pups cross-fostered with mothers on reversed LD cycles showed a very different distribution of pup phases. Pups were not synchronized to their natural mother but to their foster mother. Moreover, pups were more scattered over the 24-h period and were found to be significantly synchronized to the phase of the reversed LD cycle. These results demonstrate the occurrence of postnatal entrainment in the Siberian hamster. The increased scatter produced by the cross-fostering paradigm results from some litters being completely entrained to the phase of the foster mother, some with an intermediate distribution between the phases of the natural and foster mothers, and a minority being associated with the phase of the natural mother. These results suggest that Siberian hamster pups are initially synchronized either prenatally or at birth but that the mother continues to provide entrainment signals during the postnatal period.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (24 h amb BP) and its relation to the menstrual cycle in women with previous preeclampsia (PE). Study Design: A case-control study, 2 x 2 factorial (group x phase), was undertaken at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. The subjects, 25 women with a history of moderate to severe PE, were included 2-5 years after pregnancy. Twenty-four women with normal pregnancies matched for age, parity at index pregnancy, and time of delivery served as controls. Half of the subjects started recordings in the follicular phase and the other half in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Main Outcome Measures: Diurnal blood pressure (BP) recording in the early follicular and the late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Blood samples were drawn for determination of estradiol, progesterone, aldosterone, plasma renin activity, plasma angiotensin II, and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Results: The BP values were significantly higher in women with previous PE, including 24 h amb BP, mean day BP, mean night BP (p < 0.01). There were no phase differences in mean 24 h amb BP. Mean diastolic BP (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) recordings at night in the luteal phase were lower than in the follicular phase in both groups (p < 0.05). In a group of PE patients with one or more BP readings â¥ 140/90 mm Hg at night (n = 11), the mean 24 h amb BP, MAP, angiotensin II, and renin activity were significantly higher compared to the group with no BP readings â¥ 140/90 mm Hg at night. Conclusion: Two to five years after pregnancy, women with a diagnosis of PE have a significantly higher 24 h amb BP compared to women with normal pregnancies. A blunted diurnal BP reaction at night in the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase was seen mainly in the group of women with previous PE.

AB  - We studied basic sleep changes in pregnant rats in order to understand how pregnancy alters sleep. In the rat, pregnancy increased nocturnal nonREM sleep across the entire period but increased REM sleep only in the early period. By the end of pregnancy, diurnal sleep was decreased, showing that pregnancy in rats causes biphasic sleep changes as it does in humans. Termination of pregnancy returned the enhanced sleep to baseline as in the estrous cycle. Therefore, significant changes in the pattern of sleep occurred during pregnancy in rats, suggesting that the animal model may contribute to understanding the mechanism of sleep disorders related to human pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In previous studies we observed the existence of a circadian variation of the blood glucose response to oral glucose in pregnant women with higher values at 4 PM. Some women with increased risk of diabetes with normal oral glucose tolerance tests at 8 AM also had values above maximum normal levels at 4 PM. The aim of this trial was to determine the clinical significance of this impaired tolerance in the afternoon. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-seven pregnant women with normal risk of diabetes (65 of normal weight and 12 overweight), 75 with increased risk of diabetes (26 overweight), and 12 patients with gestational diabetes were incorporated in the study. All women underwent two oral glucose tolerance tests (1.5 gm/kg) at 31 to 32 weeks' gestation at 8 AM and 4 PM with a 1-week interval. At 33 weeks' gestation a whole-day blood glucose profile was performed with usual food intake; samples were withdrawn before each meal and at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after each meal. The weight of the newborns was recorded. RESULTS: (1) Results of oral glucose tolerance tests confirmed a circadian variation of the response in all groups; (2) 37 women with increased risk of diabetes had higher values after oral glucose tolerance testing than the normal threshold at 4 PM but not at 8 AM; (3) among women with normal risk of diabetes all values were within the normal range despite the circadian variation; (4) blood glucose levels during whole-day profiles were normal in women with normal risk of diabetes and with increased risk of diabetes with normal oral glucose tolerance testing at 4 PM, whereas all women with increased risk of diabetes and impaired tolerance in the afternoon showed hyperglycemic episodes; (5) the percentage of newborns with high weight (>90th percentile) among women with increased risk of diabetes and abnormal oral glucose tolerance tests at 4 PM was similar to the percentage found in women with gestational diabetes and much higher than the one observed in women with normal oral glucose tolerance tests in the afternoon. CONCLUSIONS: The impairment of the response to oral glucose tolerance testing seen in some patients with increased risk of diabetes at 4 PM but not at 8 AM seems of clinical significance in view of the abnormal whole-day blood glucose profile these women had and the weights of the newborns.

AB  - We investigated effects of different metabolic states on reproductive performance in lactating, primiparous sows. Sows were fed ad libitum (AL; n = 12), alimentated via a gastric cannula to 125% of AL feed intake (SA; n = 8), or restricted (R; n = 9) to 50% of AL from d 1 to 28 of lactation. At weaning, all sows were fed 2.5x maintenance energy requirements until standing heat and then fed twice maintenance energy requirement until slaughter. Sow weight, backfat, and litter weights were recorded weekly. After weaning, sows were tested twice daily for the onset of estrus and inseminated twice using pooled semen. At d 28 of gestation, sows were slaughtered, and the reproductive tracts were recovered to determine ovulation rate and embryo survival. Intensive blood sampling was performed before and after weaning for 12-h periods to characterize changes in plasma LH, insulin, and IGF-I. After weaning, additional samples were taken to monitor changes in LH and progesterone. Insulin and IGF-I were determined at standing heat. During lactation, AL and R sows lost, whereas SA sows gained, body weight and backfat (P < .001). Litter growth rates did not differ among treatments. Although plasma insulin was not different among treatments, plasma IGF-I concentration was lower (P < .001) in R sows. Mean LH and pulse frequency before (P < .03 and P < .06, respectively) and after (P < .001; for both) weaning were lower in R than in AL or SA sows. After weaning, SA sows lost more weight (P < .01) and backfat (P < .01) and ate less feed (P < .001) than AL or R sows. At standing heat, no differences in plasma IGF-I or insulin were observed, although energy balance for SA sows was lower (P < .01) than for AL or R sows. Weaning-to-estrus interval was extended (P < .02) in R sows. We observed no treatment difference in ovulation rate or embryo survival. Our results demonstrate that making sows anabolic during lactation did not ameliorate the negative impact of the suckling stimulus or improve fertility after weaning.

AB  - Pregnancy, childbirth, and early motherhood physiologically and psychologically affect a woman's sleep. Hormonal alterations during early pregnancy, enlargement of the fetus during late pregnancy, and a newborn with random sleep-wake patterns all contribute to disrupted sleep. Since the initial study of sleep and pregnancy in 1968, fewer than 20 articles have been published which address alterations in sleep architecture related specifically to childbearing women. Furthermore, many of these studies suffer from small sample sizes and lack statistical power for consistent interpretation and replication of findings. While almost all of these studies included both nulliparas and multiparas in their samples, rarely have effects of parity been reported. The majority of older studies were cross-sectional designs, with comparisons to age-matched healthy controls. More recent studies have been longitudinal designs to describe changes in sleep during the course of pregnancy. However, women's baseline, prepregnancy sleep patterns or sleep histories have not been considered. With very few published reports of sleep changes related to mental health outcomes, we are no closer to understanding the implications of altered sleep patterns on postpartum depression or other women's health outcomes than we were when it was originally questioned 30 years ago.

AB  - Leptin is a secretory product of adipocytes. It has been suggested that leptin acts as an afferent satiety signal to the brain modulating the expression of the orexigenic hypothalamic peptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY). Therefore leptin can be regarded as a marker of the nutritional status of the body. It was proposed that human obesity may result from a central resistance to leptin due to different pathophysiological mechanisms: saturation of the leptin transport into the cerebrospinal fluid of the obese subjects, abnormalities in the hypothalamic receptor for leptin, or post-receptor transduction mechanisms. It was shown that circulating leptin levels in humans significantly correlate with the body mass index (BMI). Although most studies point to white adipose tissue as a primary source of leptin there is still some uncertainty towards the relative expression of leptin between various body fat compartments. LEPTIN AND ONSET OF PUBERTY: Studies on animal models recognized various metabolic candidates for modulation of GnRH neuronal activity. It was supposed that mild changes in the body's metabolic status can serve to regulate the central drive to the reproductive axis. It is likely that leptin can serve as a "metabolic cue" that transmits signals of those mild metabolic changes towards activation of the GnRH neuronal system at the end of the prepubertal period. On the other side there is a possibility of altered leptin pulsatility during prepubertal period that can consequently influence hypothalamus and GnRH neuronal system. LEPTIN AND SEXUAL DIMORPHISM: Leptin levels in humans are similar in both sexes during the prepubertal period. During puberty leptin has a tendency to decline in boys and to remain constant in girls. Puberty is also characterized with a similar circadian rhythm pattern between sexes whil girls express different pulse characteristics. It seems that sexual dimorphism is established in early phases of human development. There is a possibility of sex steroid influence on such sexual dimorphism. LEPTIN AND REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION: It was shown that administration of recombinant leptin to ob ob mice could restore fertility in these infertile animals. There is certain difference in leptin levels according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. It was shown that leptin peak is in the luteal phase of the cycle and that correlates to the maximal progesterone level. It is possible that leptin could directly influence ovary and that disruption of such an effect could play a role in menstrual irregularities in both obese and mal nourished women. This could even become a pathophysiological mechanism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It was supposed that leptin resistance could be involved in infertility impairment of the obese women with PCOS. Leptin increases during pregnancy. Appearance of placenta as a new, nonadipose source of leptin production, increases a possibility of different leptin mRNA expression through gestation.

AB  - Previous studies have implicated oxytocin (OT) in the control of surge- type PRL secretion in the pregnant and pseudopregnant rat. The present studies examined the relationship between mating-induced activation of OT neurons in the paraventricular (PVN), supraoptic (SON), and anterior commissural (ACN) nuclei and PRL secretion. Activity within OTergic neurons, as measured by increased c-fos expression, was examined immediately and 5 days following mating in ovariectomized, estrogen-plus-progesterone-treated rats at the time when nocturnal PRL surges are expressed (0600 h) and at an intersurge time (2400 h). Females received fifteen intromissions (151), 15 mounts-without-intromission (MO), or no stimulation (homecage, HC) from a sexually experienced male. Receipt of 151 at 0600 h induced significantly higher numbers of OT immunoreactive (OT-IR) cells and FOS/OT-IR double- labeled cells in the parvocellular division of the PVN (PVN(parv)) and in the SON than did 15I at 2400 h. Numbers of OT-IR and FOS/OT-IR cells in the ACN and in the magnocellular compartment of the PVN (PVN(mag)) were not influenced by mating at either time. In contrast, acute PRL secretion induced within 5-30 min by 151 was not influenced by whether mating occurred at 1800 h (diurnal surge), 2400 h, or 0600 h, nor were plasma OT levels elevated during the 1 h following 151 or MO at these times. Examination of FOS-IR cells throughout the hypothalamus across the two times of day revealed previously unreported differences between 15I and control MO treatments in the PVN, SON, and the ventrolateral part of the arcuate nucleus (ARC(vl)). On day 5 post mating, numbers of OT-IR and FOS/OT-IR cells in the PVN, SON, and ACN were very low and were similar between 0600 h and 2400 h and between females that showed (15I) or did not show (MO) mating-induced PRL surges characteristic of pregnancy. The results of these studies demonstrate that intromissive but not mounts-only stimulation from males induces a rapid increase in OT-IR staining and OT neuron activation in the PVN(parv) and the SON. These mating-induced responses in OT neurons occurred within 1 h after mating only at 0600 h, suggesting a diurnal fluctuation in sensitivity to intromissive stimulation. Changes in OTergic function were not seen in response to mating at other times of day, nor at the time of the nocturnal PRL surge 5 days after mating. We conclude that OT activity induced by mating does not act to stimulate PRL secretion directly, but may be involved in the process(es) by which genitosensory stimulation initiates surge-type PRL secretion.

AB  - Obesity is known to increase maternal morbidity and mortality. We describe a case of obstructive sleep apnea due to obesity and discuss our treatment of the resulting pulmonary hypertension. A patient was transferred to our hospital at 29 weeks' gestation with severe anasarca and more than a 100-pound weight gain during pregnancy. Pulmonary hypertension due to obstructive sleep apnea was diagnosed. The patient was treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep and remained in the hospital the remainder of her pregnancy. She had a massive spontaneous diuresis during her hospital stay and lost more than 100 pounds. She was delivered at term via cesarean section because of transverse lie. Preoperative hemodynamic monitoring confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. This represents the first case in the literature of obstructive sleep apnea leading to pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy. This patient responded well to nasal CPAP as evident by the massive diuresis and good maternal outcome.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether problems with childhood sleep behaviour are associated with either maternal sleep patterns and emotional status during the pregnancy period, or levels of maternal distress and depression during the postnatal period. Methodology: A case/control comparison study. Cases were families presenting for admissions to a mother/baby hospital in Brisbane with the major presenting problem being the child's sleep behaviour. The control group consisted of families presenting for well child health care to one of four child health centers in suburban Brisbane. Each participating mother provided information by way of a self-report questionnaire on social and demographic variables, children's sleep patterns, maternal emotional adjustment and maternal sleep pattern during the pregnancy, and current problem with child's sleep behaviour. Current level of maternal distress/depression, was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Cases were compared with controls on all these variables. Results: Significant differences were found between groups in childhood sleep parameters, degree of problem related to childhood sleep, maternal sleep variables during the entire pregnancy, and current levels of maternal distress/depression. Conclusion: The origins of problematic childhood sleep behaviour may lie in the pregnancy period. Levels of maternal distress and depression are associated with problematic childhood sleep behaviour. The issue of whether childhood sleep problem predisposes to maternal distress/depression needs exploration. Assessment of maternal mood disorder or childhood sleep problems should be comprehensive and involve both the maternal infant dyad and the family network.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring holds great promise as a useful tool in the management of hypertensive pregnancies and pregnancies considered 'at risk' for development of preeclampsia. The purpose of this study was to define ambulatory blood pressure monitoring parameters throughout normal pregnancy, including women considered at risk for development of hypertension who continued to have a completely normal pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred seventy-six 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring studies were made cross-sectionally with use of a Spacelabs 90207 device (validated for use in pregnancy), at one or more of 9 to 17, 18 to 22, 26 to 30, and >30 weeks' gestation. Upper limits of normal were defined as the mean plus 2 SDs for awake and sleep ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results at each stage. RESULTS: Average awake upper limits of normal were 130/77, 132/79, 133/81, and 135/86 mm Hg at the four stages of pregnancy, respectively. Systolic blood pressure fell significantly by 12% to 14% (p < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure by 18% to 19% (p < 0.0001) during sleep at all stages of pregnancy. Awake ambulatory blood pressure monitoring systolic measurements were 11 to 12 mm Hg higher than 'clinic' measurements (p < 0.001) and diastolic measurements were 5 to 11 mm Hg higher (p < 0.0001) throughout pregnancy. Maximum blood pressure variability ranged from 8 to 13 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The upper limits of normal ambulatory blood pressure monitoring-derived measurements rise slightly as pregnancy progresses. Awake measurements are higher than 'clinic' measurements recorded under relaxed conditions by a clinical researcher. The diurnal blood pressure fall and variabilities are similar during pregnancy to those seen in nonpregnant subjects. These data should provide valuable references for further studies of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in high risk pregnancies.

AB  - The author summarises the main aspects of fetal activity and behavior. Fetal activity provides information about early stages of the neurodevelopmental processes. Fetal behavior offers an opportunity for the study of motor, sensory, and cognitive functions in the fetus and, thus, of fetal wellbeing. In high risk pregnancies, studies of fetal behavior may help to establish the optimal time for the delivery of the fetus.

AB  - We describe a case of lingual thyroid (LT) with primary hypothyroidism, presenting during pregnancy and continuing beyond it with oropharyngeal obstructive symptoms and sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) of mixed type. Although SAS of a combined obstructive and central type should not be too surprising in a case of LT with hypothyroidism, we were unable to find such a documentation previously. Only four weeks of L-thyroxin treatment resulted in a dramatic improvement in dysphagia, disturbed phonation, haemoptysis, arterial desaturation, sleep apnoea and overall sleep efficiency, in conjunction with a regression in the size of the lingual mass. This case highlights the vagaries confronted in the management of such a case and focuses on efforts towards accurate diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Disturbed sleep regulation is often observed in neonates of women who drank heavily during pregnancy. It is unknown if (and how) an occasional drink affects fetal sleeping behavior. In 28 near-term pregnant women we examined the effects on fetal behavioral state organization of two glasses of wine (0.25 g of ethanol/kg of maternal body weight). Simultaneous 2-h recordings of fetal heart rate and body, eye, and breathing movements were made on two successive days, once without alcohol exposure and once during maternal alcohol consumption. The study was standardized for time of day and fetal sleep state, i.e. the start of recording was either during quiet sleep (n = 16) or during active sleep (n = 12). Alcohol intake reduced fetal eye movements, disorganized behavioral state organization (rapid eye movement sleep was affected in particular), and suppressed fetal breathing activity almost completely. Modest maternal alcohol intake affects fetal behavioral state organization, which reflects an immediate effect on fetal brain function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to systematically investigate previous anecdotal reports of memory decline during pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: We used a longitudinal design to investigate memory in women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Closely matched, nonpregnant women were similarly studied at equivalent intervals. We also assessed degree of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: There was a significant time-by-group interaction (P < .01) for both immediate and delayed recall of paragraph length material. Contrasts showed a significant decline in memory for the pregnant group from the second to the third trimester (P < .01). No significant changes in memory were noted for the control group. The pregnant women scored higher on both depression and anxiety scales; however, somatic rather than cognitive items accounted for the elevated scores. Fluctuations in mood and memory did not coincide. CONCLUSION: There is a pregnancy- related decline in memory, which is limited to the third trimester. The decline is not attributable to depression, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or other physical changes associated with pregnancy.

AB  - Failure to autoresuscitate by hypoxic gasping during prolonged sleep apnea has been suggested to play a role in sudden infant death. Furthermore, maternal smoking has been repeatedly shown to be a risk factor for sudden infant death. The present experiments were carried out on newborn rat pups to investigate the influence of perinatal exposure to nicotine (the primary pharmacological and addictive agent in tobacco) on their time to last gasp during a single hypoxic exposure and on their ability to autoresuscitate during repeated exposure to hypoxia. Pregnant rats received either nicotine (6 mgÂ·kg-1Â·24 h-1) or vehicle continuously from day 6 of gestation to days 5 or 6 postpartum via an osmotic minipump. On days 5 or 6 postpartum, pups were exposed either to a single period of hypoxia (97% N2-3% CO2) and their time to last gasp was determined, or they were exposed repeatedly to hypoxia and their ability to autoresuscitate from primary apnea was determined. Perinatal exposure to nicotine did not alter the time to last gasp, but it did impair the ability of pups to autoresuscitate from primary apnea. After vehicle, the pups were able to autoresuscitate from 18 Â± 1 (SD) periods of hypoxia, whereas, after nicotine, the pups were able to autoresuscitate from only 12 Â± 2 periods (P &lt; 0.001) of hypoxia. Thus our data provide evidence that perinatal exposure to nicotine impairs the ability of newborn rats to autoresuscitate from primary apnea during repeated exposure to hypoxia, such as may occur during episodes of prolonged sleep apnea.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the recommendations that infants sleep supine could have adverse consequences on their motor and mental development. DESIGN: A prospective study of infants, delivered before, during, and after the Back to Sleep Campaign in the United Kingdom, followed to 18 months of age. SUBJECTS: The children were participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood born to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health districts of Avon, with expected date of delivery from April 1, 1991 to December 31, 1992. Questionnaires were completed on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of age and sets of standardized questions on development at 6 and 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Social, communication, fine and gross motor, and total developmental scales based on the Denver Developmental Screening Test at 6 and 18 months. RESULTS: After adjustment for 27 factors using multiple regression, 3 of the 10 scales and subscales significantly distinguished between front and back sleeping position. At 6 months of age, infants put to sleep on their front had a mean score 0.38 SD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.49) higher on the gross motor scale, 0.11 SD (95% CI: 0.00, 0.23) higher in the social skills scale, and a total development score 0.20 SD (95% CI: 0.10, 0.30) higher than those on their backs. These differences were no longer apparent at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in a reduced developmental score at 6 months of age, but this disadvantage appears to be transient. Weighing this against the adverse health effects demonstrated with the prone sleeping position, these results should not change the message of the Back to Sleep Campaign.

AB  - Studies in both the human and ovine near-term fetus have identified the clustering of physiologic and behavioral parameters into states. In a recent study in the human fetus a considerable decrease was found in fetal urine production during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) compared with REM sleep. Whether this decrease was caused by decreased renal blood flow or changes in urine concentration is not known. This prompted us to investigate the relation between fetal urine production rate and electrocortical activity in the near-term ovine fetus. We hypothesized that in the ovine fetus urine production and renal blood flow during REM [comparable to low voltage electrocortical activity (LV ECoG)] would be lower than during non-REM [(high voltage (HV) ECoG)]. In eight fetal sheep between 123 and 127 d of gestation (term 147 d), ECoG, renal blood flow, urine flow, and urine osmolality were measured continuously for 6 h on 2 consecutive days. Data were analyzed into HV ECoG and LV ECoG whereafter urine flow, urine osmolality, and renal blood flow data were averaged per state. We found no significant differences in urine flow, urine osmolality, or renal blood flow between the two behavioral states in the ovine fetus. Because these data are in sharp contrast to those found in the human fetus, we conclude that the observed dissimilarities in renal responses between the human and sheep fetus add to the already known differences in behavioral states between the two species.

AB  - The vibroacoustic characteristics of sound generated by artificial larynxes may not be the most suitable for fetal stimulation. To examine this, a study was made of the changes in fetal behavior produced by activating a larynx on the mother's abdominal wall in a sample of healthy pregnant women at term compared with a control group in which the larynx was not activated. In every case, the fetus was in a F1 steady state of deep sleep at the time of the test. Eighty percent of the fetuses in the study group entered a state of 4F behavioral agitation after the stimulus, 4% passed to a 2F state of active sleep, and 16% were incapable of coordinating a stable behavioral state. No changes in behavior were observed in the control group in response to the mock stimulus. The sound usually used for fetal stimulation produces an excessive reflex fetal response.

AB  - Being overweight increases the risk of developing many common diseases including type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, gallstones and various cancers of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. It can also cause or exacerbate osteoarthritis, breathlessness, heartburn, sleep apnoea, venous thromboembolism and psychological distress, particularly anxiety and depression. It makes anaesthesia and surgery more hazardous, and in pregnancy increases the risks associated with childbirth. Being overweight can also complicate day-to-day social functioning such as negotiating seats on public transport or purchasing clothes. In this article, we review the evidence that weight loss is beneficial and how this might be achieved using lifestyle changes, drug therapy, or surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Similar medications are effective in migraine and muscle contraction headache therefore the term recurrent headache is used to cover the spectrum of classic migraine and muscle contraction headache. OBJECTIVE: The concept of a threshold to headache triggers is proposed. Treatment for chronic headaches is directed at raising the threshold or removing triggers. DISCUSSION: The most important factors that lower the threshold to headaches are hormones, mood and sleep disturbance. Therapeutic strategies for raising the threshold and treatment of the acute headache are discussed.

AB  - The patient of insomnia in the advanced countries come up to 25 approximately 33% in populations. The pharmaco-therapy, especially hypnotic drug is useful treatment in insomnia. I reviewed the developing hypnotic drugs in Japan. One benzodiazepine and 2 non-benzodiazepines. These hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega 1 subtype. The half-life-time of the developing benzodiazepine hypnotic drug is long, therefore the rebound insomnia can not be recognized. Those of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are short, namely 1-3 hours. The former drug has finished the clinical studies and waiting the permission for marketing from the government. The latter have still been under the clinical studies. We can expect these hypnotics will bring a certain advantages for our insomnia treatment in future.

AB  - This pilot study documented maternal fatigue levels and patterns among breastfeeding primiparae; relationships between maternal fatigue and select physiological, psychological, situational, and performance factors; and fatigue interference with activities of daily living. A convenience sample of 41 mothers completed self-report instruments measuring breastfeeding experiences, fatigue, sleep characteristics, perceived stress, depression, and infant temperament at 3 days, 3, 6, and 9 weeks postpartum. Positive moderate relationships were detected at all four times for: breastfeeding problem severity (r=.38-.66, p<.05), depression (r=.45-.71, p<.01), and perceived stress (r=.36-.70, p<.05). Maternal sleep disturbance (r=.40-.54, p<.05) and/or effectiveness (r=-.33-.45, p<.05) correlated with fatigue at each time period. Infant difficulty was positively and mildly related to fatigue at 6 and 9 weeks (r=.32-.43, p<.05). Maternal age correlated positively and moderately to fatigue (r =.31-.50, p<.05). Finally, the impact of fatigue on activities of daily living and maternal role activities was low and nonsignificant. Results suggest fatigue is moderately significant to breastfeeding primiparae in the early to late postpartum period.

AB  - Aims - To analyse the contribution of certain social, familial, prenatal, perinatal, and developmental background factors in the pathogenesis of deficits in attention, motor control, and perception (DAMP). Methods - A population based case-control study was carried out with 113 children aged 6 years, 62 diagnosed with DAMP and 51 controls without DAMP. The children's health and medical records were studied and their history with regard to background factors was taken at an interview with the mother using a standardised schedule. Familial factors, possible non-optimal factors during pregnancy (including smoking), developmental factors (including early language development), and medical and psychosocial data were scored in accordance with the reduced optimality method. Results - Low socioeconomic class was common in the group with DAMP. Familial language disorder and familial motor clumsiness were found at higher rates in the DAMP group. Neuropathogenic risk factors in utero were also more common in the children with DAMP. Maternal smoking during pregnancy appeared to be an important risk factor. Language problems were present in two thirds of the children with DAMP. Sleep problems and gastrointestinal disorders, but not atopy or otitis media, were significantly more common in the DAMP group. Conclusions - Prenatal familial and neuropathogenic risk factors contribute to the development of DAMP. Primary prevention, such as improved maternal health care and early detection or treatment, or both, of associated language problems appear to be essential.

AB  - The health, growth and development of a cohort of children (n = 59) aged 6 months to 4 years and born after oocyte donation (OD) was compared with that from a group of children born after in-vitro fertilization (IVF) (n = 126). The study was performed by questionnaire, and the response rate was 100% in the OD group and 95% in the IVF group. All OD children were healthy. Three IVF children had a neurological disorder. Surgical intervention had been carried out in 8% of the OD and 13% of the IVF children. Height and weight development were normal, and eating and sleeping disorders were uncommon in both groups of children. The IVF mothers more often expressed concern about the child's behaviour than did the OD mothers. Thirty-eight percent of the OD parents and 60% of the IVF parents intended to tell the child about the nature of its conception (P < 0.01). Although oocyte recipients appear to have more complications during their pregnancies than conventional IVF patients, the general health status of OD children aged < 5 years is at least as good as that of IVF children. Growth and development in both groups of children is similar to that of the general population.

AB  - This study was conducted in Mexico among residents of an area near a recycling plant for zinc and other metallic dusts to find out if these substances produce various adverse health effects in the population that may come in contact with them. The plant is in a municipality close to Monterrey, which is Mexico's third most populous and second most industrialized city. A cross-sectional comparative design was used for the research, which took place from September to November 1994. By means of quota sampling, houses were selected in two areas-one exposed, by virtue of its proximity to the plant, and the other unexposed, which served as a control-until the desired sample size was reached (621 individuals, an average of five per household). In each dwelling, a trained psychology student administered a questionnaire to one of the older family members to gather data on the presence of acute and chronic illnesses, problems during pregnancy, and congenital illnesses among the household members. In the exposed population, 127 questionnaires were completed, providing information on 596 persons; in the unexposed population, data on 743 persons were gathered via 147 questionnaires. The sex and age distributions were similar in the two populations, and the length of residence in their respective area was slightly longer among unexposed individuals. The most frequently reported health problems in the exposed population were irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, allergies, sleep disturbances, bronchitis, fatigue, skin problems, ear infections, and anemia. The prevalence ratios for the exposed versus unexposed populations were significant with regard to skin eruptions and other skin diseases, fatigue, sleep disturbances, upper respiratory infections, ear infections, bronchitis, and allergies. Women from the two groups did not show significant differences in the prevalence of obstetric problems, miscarriages, or children born with congenital deformities or low birthweight. The sensitivity of the questionnaire used to detect health problems was poor, which could have resulted in an underestimation of some disorders. Nevertheless, various types of information bias were controlled, permitting the conclusion that the exposed population had a greater risk of suffering certain diseases and disorders than the unexposed population.

AB  - Objective - To investigate the association between altitude of residence and risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Methods - A retrospective, case control study in the Tyrol, Austria enrolled 99 infants with SIDS occurring between 1984 and 1994, and 136 randomly selected control cases. Data on pregnancy, delivery, child care practice, and sociodemographic characteristics including altitude of residence were collected with a standardised questionnaire. Results - The risk of SIDS increased gradually with increasing altitude of residence. This relation remained independently significant when the analysis was adjusted for gestational age, birth weight, prenatal care, mother's age at delivery, educational level of parents, and cigarette smoking during pregnancy. The prone sleeping position emerged as an obligatory cofactor in this association. In the whole of Austria, a similar trend of association emerged between the average altitudes in the 99 political counties and the rates of SIDS. Conclusions - This study identified altitude of residence as a significant risk predictor of SIDS, primarily in combination with the prone sleeping position. Respiratory disturbances, reduced oxygen saturation, and lower temperatures at high altitude might explain this association.

AB  - The possible effects of a wide range of sociodemographic and environmental factors on the incidence and distribution of petechiae were investigated in 485 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases from the New Zealand Cot Death Study. The number (nil, few, many) of macroscopic petechial hemorrhages in the visceral pleura, capsule of thymus, and epicardium was recorded in 458 of 474 autopsied SIDS cases. Other information was obtained from parental interview and obstetric records. Univariate analysis showed highly significant relation-ships (P â¤ 0.005) between the frequency of petechiae at one or more sites and socioeconomic status, parity, breast feeding, age at death, time of death, sleep position, and head covering at death and lesser but significant relationships (P â¤ 0.05) with Maori ethnicity, birth weight, gestation, pacifier use, and bed sharing. After multivariate analysis, significant associations remained between increased frequencies of thymic petechiae and parity (P = 0.0001), age at death (P = 0.0003), Maori ethnicity (P = 0.0019), pacifier use (P = 0.0001), and head covering at death (P = 0.0032); between increased frequencies of epicardial petechiae and head covering at death (P = 0.008) and an estimated time of death between 00:00 and 05:59 h (P = 0.056); and between increased frequencies of pleural petechiae and maternal smoking (P = 0.058) and parity (P = 0.022). There was a decreased frequency of pleural petechiae in infants placed prone for their final sleep (P = 0.058). The distribution and frequency of petechiae are affected by environmental factors, including known risk factors for SIDS, but these factors occur inconsistently across the three sites; The findings imply differences in the pathogenesis at each site but do not provide consistent support for previous theories of causation of petechiae.

AB  - Objective: To determine the influence of breast-feeding on the prevalence and persistence of sleeping problems in southern Finland (SF) and southern Germany (SG). Design: Prospective binational population study of infants admitted to special care units (SCUs) in geographically defined areas in SF and SG. Subjects: In SE the number of SCU infants was 1057 (very preterm, 47; preterm, 258; term, 752); 485 term infants were control subjects. In SG, the number of SCU infants was 4427 (very preterm, 284; preterm, 1419; term, 2724). Main outcome measure: Parent reports of child sleeping problems at 5, 20, and 56 months of age. Results: Night waking at 5 months of age was less frequent for SCU very preterm (25.5%), preterm (40.6%), and term infants (48%) than for term control subjects (56.7% to 59.9%) in SF. No differences in sleeping behavior according to gestation were found at 20 and 56 months. Sleeping problems were greater in SF infants (25.5% to 48%) than in SG infants (15.1% to 19.1%) at 5 months of age and were explained by a higher rate of breast-feeding in SF. Breast-feeding had no long-term effects on night waking or on co-sleeping in SF. In contrast, breast-fed infants continued to wake more often in SG. Conclusions: Breast- feeding rather than gestational age is strongly related to night waking. More support for dealing with night waking might prevent early termination of breast-feeding.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to describe medical findings and health- related concerns of sexual assault victims who returned for follow-up and to assess demographic and assault characteristics of victims who used follow-up services compared to those who did not. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a retrospective cohort analysis involving records from two sources: the acute sexual assault evidentiary examination and the SAFE (Sexual Assault Follow- up Evaluation) Clinic visit. Data were extracted from the records of 389 adolescent and adult victims who reported an acute sexual assault and underwent a complete evidentiary examination between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 1997. Descriptive statistics were generated on demographic and historical information, assault characteristics, and medical and laboratory findings. For the subgroup that presented for follow-up, additional descriptive statistics were generated to describe their interim history, concerns, medical outcomes, treatments, and psychosocial functioning. Ï2 analyses were used to identify differences in the group that returned for follow-up compared with the group that did not. Statistical significance was defined as P &lt; .05. RESULTS: There were no differences in age, race, or perpetrator factors between patients who used follow-up services and patients who did not return to the SAFE Clinic. Similarly, there were no other assault characteristics, relationships, or physical examination findings that were associated with follow-up patterns. A total of 31% (n = 122) of all sexual assault victims returned for a follow-up visit. Physical complaints were reported by 42.6%, but 98.0% had normal findings at a general examination, and 94.8% had a normal result of gynecologic examination. Pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus, were identified through the follow-up clinic. Since the assault, 49.2% had been sexually active, 10% with multiple partners and 73.3% without consistent condom use. Disturbances in sleep, sexual function, and appetite were commonly reported among victims at follow-up. Numerous assault-related fears were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among recent rape victims, follow-up rates are low, and there are no factors that correlate with the use of follow-up services. Those who do come in for follow-up have physical complaints and health-related concerns that are related to their recent assault, but most have normal physical findings. Efforts to reach sexual assault victims will require aggressive and innovative strategies to remain in contact with women and girls after rape.

AB  - Increased body temperature (fever or hyperthermia) is a physiological response to many different stimuli. In fact, fever (a 1-4Â°C elevation of the body temperature) is not only a clinical symptom common to many infectious diseases but also a side effect of immunostimulating or antiviral therapies. Hyperthermic reactions, on the other hand, can be observed after treatment with antipsychotic drugs, 5-hydroxytryptamine-receptor agonists, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and as a reaction to anesthesia. Moreover, hyperthermic reactions can be related to particularly stressful emotional states, to the menstrual ovulatory cycle, and to pregnancy. Transient hyperthermia or fever is also a common consequence of cerebral ischemic events, and it is present during stress as well as intense physical exercise. This review focuses on fever, one of the main components of the systemic acute-phase reaction to external proinflammatory stimuli. Special emphasis is given to neuronal mechanisms of fever induction, in which the hypothalamus plays a crucial role in both control of the febrile response as well as other centrally mediated neurological signs of inflammation, such as increased sleep, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, anorexia, and sickness behavior. This review pays particular attention to the role of proinflammatory cytokines as endogenous pyrogens.

AB  - To study the main predictors of childhood preschool headache, 1443 families expecting their first child were followed from the onset of pregnancy to the child's sixth year of life. Subject selection was based on stratified randomized cluster sampling. Of the children, 14.9% (144) suffered from headache disturbing daily activities at the age of 6 years. The mother's assessment of the infant's poor health (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.8) and feeding problems (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2) at the age of 9 months predicted later occurrence of headache. At 3 years, depression and sleeping difficulties (according to Achenbach's psychological test) and recurrent difficulties in falling asleep (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.2) were strong predictors. Headache in other family members (OR 3.5, 95% CI 2.0 to 5.9), especially in the mother (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4), predicted preschool headache in the child. At the age of 5 years, travel sickness (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.1), nocturnal enuresis (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0), and the presence of long-term disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0) were strong predictors of later headache. At the same age, concentration difficulties (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.2), behavioral problems (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.4), unusual tiredness (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 13.5), and, conversely, high socialibility (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.2) predicted headache. The three last-mentioned psychological factors seemed to be associated with concentration difficulties at the age of 5, which was found to be the strongest predictor. The parents of child headache sufferers often became aware of the child's problems long before the emergence of headaches.

AB  - A link between prenatal malnutrition and hypertension in human populations has recently been proposed. Rat models of prenatal malnutrition have provided major support for this theory on the basis of tail-cuff measurements. However, this technique requires restraint and elevated temperature, both potential sources of stress. To determine the effect of prenatal protein malnutrition on blood pressure under nonstress conditions, 24-hour radiotelemetric measurements were taken in the home cage. Male rats born to dams fed a 6% casein diet for 5 weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy were studied in early adulthood (from 96 days of age). During the waking phase of their cycle but not the sleep phase, prenatal malnutrition gave rise to small but significant elevations of diastolic blood pressure and heart rate compared with well-nourished controls. Direct effects of stress on blood pressure responses were determined in a second experiment using an olfactory stressor. Prenatally malnourished rats showed a greater increase in both systolic and diastolic pressures compared with well-nourished controls during the first exposure to ammonia. A different pattern of change of cardiovascular responses was also observed during subsequent presentations of the stressor. These findings of a small baseline increase in diastolic pressure consequent to prenatal malnutrition, but an augmented elevation of both systolic and diastolic pressures after first exposure to stress, suggest the need to reevaluate interpretation of the large elevations in blood pressure previously observed in malnourished animals using the stressful tail-cuff procedure.

AB  - With the aim to describe the circadian pattern of non-invasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 759 BP series sampled for about 48 hours every four weeks after the first obstetric visit in 71 women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 42 with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP variation for each group (complicated vs. uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. A highly statistically circadian pattern is demonstrated for systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (p<0.001 in all cases). The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (p always <0.001). This study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable circadian variability in BP during gestation. The differences in BP between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy. Those differences are found when both SBP and DBP for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiologic range of BP variability.

AB  - Although a relationship between reproductive factors and breast cancer risk has been known for long, there are many contradictions between different studies, and a connection with a biological mechanism has not yet been found. Recently, new details have been revealed about different effects of pregnancy on breast cancer risk. During pregnancy breast cancer risk is strongly reduced, while inversely some years after giving birth the risk is increased. Furthermore, risk is strongly reduced in women whose consecutive births of four or more children occur after short intervals and are terminated before the age of 30. Recently, we have postulated rhythmicity in the occurrence of breast cancer in a subgroup of young women. By analogy with circadian rhythms it may be assumed that circannual rhythms too are influenced by synchronizers and masking effects. In circadian rhythms masking may be by external or internal periodic factors, such as the sleep/wake cycle, meal timing and activity. Over the year pregnancy may be such a periodic factor, with alternation of an empty uterus and one which gradually enlarges as a consequence of a developing fetus. A masking factor is active only as long as present. Therefore the circannual rhythmicity of breast cancer is attenuated or nullified only during pregnancy. After giving birth, the temporal deficit of the rhythmic increase of tumor growth may be restored, leading to a rebound effect expressed as an increased clinical detection of malignancy some years later. When several consecutive pregnancies occur after short intervals the masking effect continues uninterruptedly, accompanied by a strong reduced breast cancer risk. The same biological mechanism may underly the remission during pregnancy in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease. The immune system, crucial in autoimmune disorders, is build up of several constituents which are clearly rhythmic, e.g. the lymphocytes. Masking of one or more of these rhythmicities may lead to disease attenuation, followed by relapses as soon as the masking factor has been eliminated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Our aims are to stud) whether temperature and cortisol circadian rhythms are present in newborm of another primate species, the Cehns apella, in whether these rhythms may be entrained bv environmental signals experienced during gestation. DESIGN STUDY. A group (n = 10) were fed 4 times a day while the second gioup (n = 6) were fed twice. Amount and composition of the diet was the same for the two groups. Females were weighed at weekly intervals lo follow up pregnancies. Gestational length and newborn weight at birth were recorded. At 4 d, newborns were separated from theii mother. Blood samples were taken at 2-3 h for 24 or 48-h, and rectal temperature at one or two h. Cortisol was measured bv RIA. The presence of 24-h rhythms in individuals and in the mean data was analyzed bv cosinor. A result was considered significant when p < O.OiÃ¯. RESULTS: The treatment had no effect on gestational length or intani weight. 24-h rhythms of temperature and cortisol were present in newborns oi both feeding regimes at 4 da\s of age. However, in newborns whose1 mothers were fed 4 times/dav during pregnancy, the temperature rlnthms were synchronized between newboius while the cortisol rhvtbmsweie not.

AB  - Objective: To determine the clinical trait of hypertension in pregnant women with a reversed circadian blood pressure (BP) rhythm. Study design: 24- h BP monitoring was performed in 56 hypertensive pregnant women, of whom 12 had a reversed systolic BP (SBP) rhythm (day/night mean BP ratio <1.0). Clinical data, ultrasound fetomerry and umbilical artery velocimetry were compared to that in women with a normal rhythm. Statistical analyses were performed with simple linear regression, Mann-Whitney U test, analysis of variance, contingency table analysis and Fisher's test. A two-tailed P value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: In the reversed SBP group, the nighttime BP, fetal weight, albuminuria and S-urate were higher, and the BP variations smaller. The birthweight correlated negatively to the SBP day/night ratio. Higher SBP day/night ratios and larger BP variations were associated with an increased vascular resistance in the umbilical artery and an impaired growth. Conclusion: A reversed SBP rhythm was associated with a more severe degree of preeclampsia but also with a smaller BP variation maintenance of fetal growth and higher birthweight. A sustained high nighttime BP preserved fetal growth. These novel observations challenge the opinion that a reversed circadian BP rhythm is merely an ominous sign.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effects of nitric oxide (NO) donors on quantitative and qualitative blood pressure changes in pregnancy. Methods: Twenty-five patients with gestational hypertension (16 with pregnancy-induced hypertension and nine with pre-eclampsia) and 11 normotensive patients with preterm uterine contractions were administered a 10-mg glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) patch for 24 h, randomly starting on the 2nd or 3rd day of hospitalization. A further eight hypertensive patients were submitted to bed rest only and served as controls. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded automatically, every 30 min, for 48 h. Data were analyzed with the cosinor algorithm for the evaluation of circadian rhythm changes. Blood and urine were collected for nitrite assays. Results: GTN decreased the 24-h mean systolic blood pressure in every group, while the diastolic blood pressure was decreased only in hypertensive patients. These latter showed a delayed acrophase (the clock time at which blood pressure reaches its maximum) of systolic blood pressure in respect to normotensive patients; GTN restored the rhythm to normal. Bed rest did not significantly affect blood pressure. In basal conditions, patients with pre-eclampsia showed reduced serum nitrite levels in comparison to the other groups. Conclusion: These data indicate that the transdermal application of NO donors could represent a useful means of managing patients with gestational hypertension and confirm a possible reduced activity of NO synthase in patients with pre-eclampsia.

AB  - The human hypothalamus is involved in a wide range of functions in the developing, adult and aging subject and disorders and degenerative changes in this brain region are responsible for a large number of symptoms of neuroendocrine, neurological and psychiatric diseases. This review discusses the functional and chemical neuroanatomy of a number of prominent nuclei in the human hypothalamus and adjoining structures in relation to normal development, sexual differentiation, aging and a number of neuropathological disorders. In this summary references are given for some useful neurochemical markers (i.e. stainings that largely characterize the borders of a particular (sub)nucleus). The borders of the hypothalamus as such are equivocal but the present paper is not concerned with the rather arbitrary answers to the question which structure does or does not belong to the hypothalamus. Instead, it discusses the major nuclei that are present in a block of brain tissue containing the hypothalamus and adjoining areas in order to provide a basis for the neuropathology of this brain region. Most authors distinguish three hypothalamic regions: (i) the chiasmatic or preoptic region, (ii) the tuberal region, and (iii) the mamillary region.o(i)PREOPTIC OR CHIASMATIC REGION. This region is thought to be important for temperature regulation, through the initiation of mechanisms that increase the loss of body heat, i.e. by sweating and vasodilatation. Acute lesions in this area may cause a rapid rise in body temperature. In this region and in adjoining areas the following nuclei are discussed:u-The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and the Diagonal Band of Broca that, together with the medial septal nucleus, are the major sources of cholinergic innervation for the cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Choline acetyltransferase histochemistry or immunocytochemistry stains the majority of these neurons (Pearson et al., 1983; McGeer et al., 1984; Chan-Palay, 1988b; Saper and Chelimsky, 1984). In addition, proenkephalin LHRH, delta sleep inducing peptide, vasopressin and galanin are found in NBM neurons. The NBM receives a dense innervation of at least 8 different peptides and is affected in Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, Korsakoff's disease and PSP. In Alzheimer's disease cytoskeletal alterations, increased Î²-amyloid precursor expression and neurofibrillary tangles are found and the neurons of the NBM show atrophy, decreased neuronal activity, and a loss of choline acetyltransferase staining. However, there is probably no major loss of neurons. In addition, compensatory and aberrant growth phenomena are observed in the NBM in Alzheimer's disease. In Parkinson's disease Lewy bodies are found in the NBM. The NBM contains low and high-affinity receptors for nerve growth factors. The latter (i.e. Trk receptors) decrease in Alzheimer's disease.-The islands of Calleja are characterized by a core of small (5-10 m) neurons. They are situated in the substantia innominata, dorsally to the NBM and laterally to the DBB, and contain fibers staining for cholinergic markers, catecholamines, neuropeptide-Y, substance-P and VIP. In fact, VIP innervation seems to be a good marker for the islands. In Alzheimer's disease they contain Î²/A4 staining amorphic plaques and cytoskeletal alterations stained by Alz-50.-The suprachiasmatic nucleus cannot be recognized reliably in thin sections without immunocytochemistry. It is characterized by a large population of neurotensin neurons (Moore et al., 1992), while vasopressin neurons (Swaab et al., 1985) so far best reflect their functions in relation to biological rhythms and reproduction. In addition, it contains neurons that are immunoreactive for VIP, neuropeptide-Y, TRH, somatostatin, galanin and proenkephalin. Melatonin receptors are also found in the SCN area. The entraining effect of light on the SCN is mediated by a retinohypothalamic tract which contains, e.g., substance-P and teminates mainly on VIP neurons.The SCN shows seasonal and circadian fluctuations in the number of vasopressin neurons in subjects of up to 50 years of age. Many functions show circadian and circannual fluctuations in human. Since seasonal depression and bulimia nervosa react favorably to light therapy, the SCN may be involved.The SCN is still immature at birth. The populations of vasopressin and VIP neurons in the SCN mature, to a large extent, after birth. Fetal rhythms during pregnancy are mainly driven by the mother, although, e.g., temperature rhythms are found in some 50% of the prematurely born children. Entrainment of premature children to circadian rhythms may stimulate their development. During normal aging the seasonal and circadian fluctuations in vasopressin neurons disappear after the age of 50. The number of vasopressin expressing neurons decreases after the age of 80 and even more so and at an earlier age in Alzheimer's disease. The SCN is affected in Alzheimer's disease, which may lead to wandering, agitation and sleep disorders, that can be treated with light therapy. In addition, the retina is involved in Alzheimer's disease. Retinal cell degeneration occurs without the presence of plaques and tangles.There are various differences in the vasopressinergic subnucleus of the SCN in relation to gender and sexual orientation. The number of VIP-expressing neurons is twice as large in men of 10 to 40 years of age as in women. The VIP difference reverses between 40 and 65 years of age. In homosexual men the vasopressin subnucleus is twice as large as in heterosexual men. VIP cell numbers in the SCN do not show a difference in relation to sexual orientation.Other hypothalamic structures that differ in size in relation to sexual orientation are the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH)-3, that is larger in heterosexual men than in homosexual men but for which no chemical marker is known at present, and the anterior commissure, that is larger in homosexual men than in heterosexual men and women.-The sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN, intermediate nucleus or INAH-1) is located between the supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus. In young adult men this nucleus is twice as large as in adult women. The human SDN contains galanin and TRH-expressing fibers and neurons (Fliers et al., 1994; Gai et al., 1990), just like the rat SDN. In addition it contains a high packing of preproenkephalin. At term, only 20% of the SDN cell number is present. At that moment cell numbers are similar in boys and girls. Postnatally 80% of the SDN cells are formed, whereas exhaustion of the matrix layer around the third ventricle is already complete around 23 weeks of gestation. The source of the majority of SDN cells is thus not clear. The difference between the SDN of men and women arises between about 4 years of age and puberty; the SDN in girls goes through a period of decreasing cell numbers. In the process of aging, a sex-dependent decrease in cell number occurs. In Alzheimer's disease cytoskeletal changes and amorphic Î²/A4 plaques are found in SDN neurons, but the decrease in neuronal number is similar to that in controls.Other hypothalamic sexually dimorphic structures are INAH-2 and 3, and two subnuclei of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (see below) that are larger in males. The shape of the vasopressin subnucleus of the SCN is sexually dimorphic, and the number of VIP neurons in the SCN changes in men in an age-related way (see before). Furthermore the anterior commissure that is larger in females.-The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) is situated on the junction of hypothalamus and septum and cellular bridges run through the hypothalamus between the BST and the amygdala. The BST contains at least two sexually dimorphic subnuclei. In the first place a 'darkly staining posteromedial component' (BST-dspm) that is 2.5 times larger in males than in females. Secondly, the central nucleus (BSTc or supracommissural part of the central nucleus of the BST or central sector) that is characterized by a massive immunoreactivity for somatostatin neurons and fibers and a strong VIP innervation from the amygdala (Walter et al., 1991; Zhou et al., 1995c). The BSTc is 40% smaller in women than in men. The size of the BSTc volume is independent of sexual orientation in men, but it is remarkably small (40% of the male reference group) in male-to-female transsexuals, suggesting a function in gender. The medial nucleus of the BST is characterized by less dense substance-P and neuropeptide-Y innervation, and the lateral nucleus of the BST by prominent somatostatin and enkephalin plexuses and the presence of neurophysins (Walter et al., 1991). The BST shows Î²/A4 amorphic plaques and Alz-50 positive cell bodies and dystrophic neurites in Alzheimer patients.-The vasopressin and oxytocin cells of the supraoptic and paraventricular (SON and PVN) nucleus (Dierickx and Vandesande, 1979) project to the neurohypophysis where these peptides are released as neurohormones that are involved in water metabolism, sexual arousal, ejaculation, labor and lactation. One year after hypophysectomy 80% of the SON and PVN neurons is lost. Centrally projecting vasopressin neurons terminate synaptically and may regulate autonomic processes while centrally projecting oxytocin neurons may function as satiety cells. In the human PVN (i) no subnuclei containing magnocellular or parvicellular elements can be distinguished, (ii) nor can we distinguish the cells projecting to the neurohypophysis, median eminence or to other brain regions. Vasopressin and oxytocin are synthesized as part of a large precursor containing neurophysin and in the case of vasopressin also a c-terminal glycoprotein.

AB  - Background: Although both expectant mothers and expectant fathers complain of fatigue during the last trimester of pregnancy, studies have focused exclusively on mothers. This pilot study examined parents' levels of morning or evening fatigue, number of uninterrupted sleep periods and length of sleep during the last trimester of pregnancy; and the relationship of sleep to parents' reports of fatigue. Methods: Data were collected from 24 midwestern, nulliparous couples, who completed the Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue each morning and each evening on 4 consecutive days during the last trimester. Concurrently, the couples recorded sleep and wake periods in an activity diary. Results: Expectant mothers but not expectant fathers reported increasing levels of fatigue, especially morning fatigue, as the pregnancy progressed. Expectant fathers and mothers did not differ either in the night-time mean number of minutes of sleep obtained, or in the mean number of night-time uninterrupted 90-minute sleep cycles obtained. Fatigue and sleep were not significantly related for either mothers or fathers. Conclusions: These findings support the multidimensional nature of fatigue and indicate a need for perinatal health caregivers to develop individualized interventions for mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy. Fathers should also participate in future research of factors influencing the prenatal and postpartum experience.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the development of the flash visual evoked potential (VEP) and to examine the influence of flash intensity, sleep state and gestational age on the resulting VEP waveform. Subjects and methods: Flash VEPs using two different intensities of stroboscopic light were recorded and sleep state was noted in 34 premature infants born between 28 and 35 weeks' gestation. Results: A long latency negative component (N3) was evident in all preterm infants tested at 3 days of age. The latency and amplitude of N3 were unrelated to gestational age, flash intensity or sleep state. A positive component (P2) was evident in 38% of these infants. The flash VEP of preterm infants matured greatly between day 3 and term age. At term age, the P2 component was prominent in all infants. Its latency decreased as wakefulness increased and its amplitude increased with an increase in flash intensity. Conclusion: There is vast neuroanatomical development in the visual cortex in preterm infants from birth to term age demonstrated by the maturing VEP. The study also highlights the effect of flash intensity and sleep state on the VEP waveform and the need for these variables to be carefully monitored.

AB  - The high rate of progesterone synthesis by the placenta in late gestation exposes the ovine fetus to high concentrations of progesterone and its metabolites that may affect activity of the fetal brain. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inhibiting maternal progesterone synthesis on sleep-wake activity in fetal sheep. Fetal and maternal vascular catheters, a fetal tracheal catheter, and electrodes for recording fetal electrocortical (ECoG), electro-ocular (EOG) and nuchal muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity were implanted. At 128-131 days gestation, progesterone production was inhibited by an injection of trilostane (50 mg), a 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor. Vehicle solution or progesterone (3 mg h-1) was then infused into the ewe between 6 and 12h after the trilostane treatment. Maternal progesterone concentrations were significantly reduced from 1-24 h after trilostane treatment (P &lt; 0.05) when followed by vehicle infusion. Fetal breathing movements (FBM), EOG, nuchal muscle EMG, and behavioural arousal increased 12 h after trilostane treatment (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, there was no change in fetal arousal, EOG, EMG or FBM activities when progesterone was infused after the trilostane treatment. These findings show that progesterone can influence fetal behaviour, and indicates that normal progesterone production tonically suppresses arousal, or wakefulness in the fetus.

AB  - PAX2 is one member of a family of paired box (PAX) gene encoding transcriptional regulaters in involved in fetal development. PAX2 was shown to be mutated in patients with eye and kidney abnormaliteies. Patient is an Japanese 11-year-old boy born to healthy unrelated parents after uncomplicated pregnancy. He was pointed out poor weight, gain and severe proteinuria at age 1 months. At age 2 yeas, he referred to us because of renal failure and he had continuous ambulatory oeritoneal dialysis. Bilateral optic nerve coloboma, choroid-retinal degeneration were detected. His visual activity was severly disturved. By ultrasound, he had bilateral hypoplastic kidneys. At age 9 he was diagnosed as epilepsy because EEC showed abnormal spike and wave complex during sleep. He had mild mental retardation but MRI and CT examination showed no remarkable change. Each of 12 exons of PAX2 were amplified by PCR and the products were analysed by single strand coformation polymorphism(SSCP). Abnormal SSCP pattern were observed in exon 2 and a deletion of 22 nucleotides by direct cycle sequencing. PAX 2 mutations were detected in ten patients up to now. Six of the mutations were detected in exon 2 and they suggested common mutÃ¢tional mechanism.

AB  - Introduction : the study of pulmonary mechanics in newborn (NB) receiving mechanical ventilation is potentially helpful in evaluating respiratory distress severity and elucidating their pathophysiology, to survey response to treatment, or to optimize ventilator settings. It is now well recognized that measuring lung compliance with the esophageal balloon or catheter technique is unreliable in NB. Measurement by occlusion technique is an attractive alternative. Previous studies have reported values for Crs in healthy spontaneous breathing full-term NB. Rarely were measurements performed in premature NB without respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Methods : respiratory functional investigations were performed using a Sensor Medics 2600 device (Sensor Medics, Yorba Linda, CA USA). Total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs) were measured using single occlusion of the respiratory pathways at the end of inspiration. Tests were performed in the supine position during quiet sleep, without any sedation, and after trachÃ©al suctioning. Results : 13 premature NB, gestational age over 28 weeks of gestation (mean 30,5 Â±2,7 weeks), and birth-weight over 940 grams (mean 1287 Â±417 grams) were studied. They were mechanically ventilated for apnea (n=4) cerebral asphyxia (n=3) or prematurity (n=6). Values of Crs (ml/cmH2O/Kg) and Rrs (cmH2O/ml/s) were as follows: NB l 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Mean Age (d) 3 1 2 2 2 1 1 5 6 13 4 1 1 3,2Â±2,4 Crs 1,97 0,89 1,53 2,69 0,51 1,21 0,68 1,04 0,72 0,86 1,00 1,08 1,33 l,I9Â±0,59 Rrs 132 221 187 150 184 217 385 248 145 188 135 168 155 193Â±65 Conclusion : the present results provide reference values for Crs in healthy premature NB. Since the occlusion technique, simple, reproducible and non invasive, is now used to measure passive total respiratory system mechanics in neonatal intensive care units, these values may be useful for studies of NB with RDS. Larger numbers of healthy premature NB need to he studied using this method to assert an inter and intra subject variability and the potential influence of factors such as postnatal and gestational age before reliable reference values can be established for this population.

AB  - General pharmacological properties of watanidipine hydrochloride (abbreviated as AE0047) were investigated using mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats and dogs, in comparison with those of nicardipine. AE0047 and nicardipine (over 10 or 30 mg/kg p.o.) decreased the reactivity on general behavior and the spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. AE0047 (up to 100 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect thiopental induced sleeping time, PTZ induced convulsion and other items in the central nervous system. In anesthetized dogs, AE0047 (over 30 Î¼g/kg i.v.) and nicardipine (over 3 Î¼g/ kg i.v.) produced a dose dependent fall in blood pressure. However, the duration of action of AE0047 was longer than that of nicardipine. AE0047 (10-5 g/ml) and nicardipine (over 10-7 g/ml) inhibited the contractile force and heart rate of the isolated guinea pig atrium. In the isolated smooth muscle, AE0047 (over 10-6â¼10-5 g/ml) and nicardipine (over 10-7 g/ml) inhibited spontaneous motility of rabbit ileum, rat non-pregnant and pregnant uterus. In the isolated guinea-pig ileum and seminal duct, AE0047 (over 10-6â¼10-5 g/ml) and nicardipine (over 10-7 g/ml) showed inhibitory effect on drug induced contraction. AE0047 (over 0.3 mg/kg i.v.) and nicardipine (over 0.1 mg/ kg i.v.) inhibited the spontaneous motility of pregnant and non-pregnant rat uterus in situ. AE0047 (over 10 mg/kg p.o.) and nicardipine (over 30 mg/kg p.o.) produced inhibitory effects on the intestinal transport of charcoal meal. AE0047 showed no effect on nictitating membrane contraction in cats and pupil size in rats. AE0047 (over 10 mg/kg p.o.) and nicardipine (over 30 mg/kg p.o.) produced a transient decrease of the urine volume and excretion of electrolytes in rats. AE0047 had no local anesthetic effect in guinea pigs and did not affect blood coagulation system in rats. In conclusion, the pharmacological properties of AE0047 were not quantitatively different from those of nicardipine and it appeared that the general pharmacological actions of AE0047 were weaker than those of nicardipine.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although behavioral state analyses have been useful in differentiating between groups of normal and at-risk fetuses, the large between-subject differences in the percent of time spent in the various behavioral states pose a major obstacle in identifying abnormal neurological functioning in individual fetuses. Stability in state control over time would certainly strengthen the argument that behavioral states reflect stable individual differences in CNS functioning. In fact, temporal variability in the percent time spent in each state is characteristic of newborn infants who are at risk for significant developmental abnormalities later in life. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of temporal stability in behavioral state organization for 33 low-risk human fetuses at 38-40 weeks gestation. METHOD: Each fetus was examined for 4 hours on each of 3 separate days. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on heart rate pattern and eye and body movements. The percent time spent in each behavioral state and in transition and insertion periods was determined for each of the three 4-hour study sessions. Since the within-subject state profiles were expressed as a percentage of the study time, which summed to 100% for each study session, the only source of variance was Between States and the interaction of States X Session. The F-ratio statistic, calculated for each subject by dividing the Between States mean-square by the States X Session meansquare, will be large if the state profile is similar across the three study sessions and will be small if the within-subject profile varies from session to session. The F-ratio was calculated for each fetus and used as an objective measure of state profile consistency for that particular fetus. RESULTS: The average F-ratio for the 33 fetuses was 77.9 Â±79.9 (range 1.9-357.7), and an F-value 4.50 defined the lower 10th percentile for this study population. When grouped according to the magnitude of the F-ratio, we found that fetuses with poor state control (mean F; 13.9 Â±9.7) spent significantly less time in active sleep (48.1 Â± 12.2% vs. 59.2 Â± 8.3%, p < .005) and more time in an awake state (13.1 Â± 18.2% vs. 1.4 Â± 2.6%, p < .001) than fetuses with more stable state profiles (mean F: 157.7 Â±90.9). CONCLUSION: Postnatal studies have convincingly demonstrated that determination of state profile consistency is a useful adjunct in assigning a risk status for the newborn infant. Using a descriptive sum-of-squares procedure developed to evaluate healthy infants, we found that the majority of low-risk fetuses exhibited significant within-subject consistency in their state profiles. Furthermore, even among this group of low-risk subjects, there were significant differences (i.e., a wide range in F-vahies) in the degree of state organization achieved by individual fetuses. These findings raise the possibility that state analyses may be useful in assigning a risk status within a clinically normal population of term fetuses.

AB  - The general pharmacology of azelnidipine, a novel dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist, was investigated. The results obtained were as follows Effects on the central nervous system Sedation was observed in rats and mice treated with azelnidipine at 300 mg/kg p.o.. In mice, except for a decrease in locomotor activity and prolongation of thiopental-induced anesthesia, azelnidipine at 100mg/kg p.o.neither affected general activity, behavior or reflex, nor did it cause anti-seizure effects or analgesia. In rats, the agent at 100mg/kg p.o.did not affect body temperature. With regard to spontaneous EEG in rats, azelnidipine at 100mg/kg p.o.increased the arousal pattern and decreased the paradoxical sleep pattern. Effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems In anesthetized dogs, azelnidipine at cumulative doses of 0.03, 0.07, and 0.2 mg/kg i.v.lowered blood pressure and increased cardiac output in a dose-dependent manner. A transient increase in the respiration rate and suppression of the presser response to norepinephrine were observed only after the highest dose. EKG was not affected. The agent at concentrations up to 10-6g/ml did not affect the contractile force or beat rate of isolated guinea pig right atrium. Effects on smooth muscle Azelnidipine at a concentration of 10-6g/ml suppressed the spontaneous movement of isolated rabbit ileum and both pregnant and non-pregnant rat uterus. In the isolated guinea pig trachea, the agent produced no changes in the basal tonus or histamine-induced contraction. At 10-7g/ml, the agent showed non-specific inhibitions on histamine- and barium chloride-induced contraction of isolated guinea pig ileum. Effects on the digestive system Azelnidipine induced stimulation of gastric secretion at 1 mg/kg i.d.and inhibition at higher doses of 100 mg/kg i.d.. When administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg p.o.in mice, the agent inhibited intestinal propulsion but did not affect defecation time. Effects on renal function Azelnidipine at doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg p.o.dose-dependently decreased urine volume and urinary electrolyte excretion in rats. Effects on blood function An oral administration of azelnidipine up to 100 mg/kg in rats did not affect blood coagulation. The agent at concentrations up to 10-4g/ml did not affect hemolysis in human blood and ADP-induced guinea pig platelet aggregation. Miscellaneous effects Azelnidipine at doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg p.o.dose-dependently increased blood glucose levels in rats. One and 5% suspensions of azelnidipine neither affected the corneal reflex in guinea pigs, nor did they induce local irritating effects on the rabbit eye. In conclusion, when administered at much higher doses than the effctive doses in pre-clinical studies, azelnidipine produced some general pharmacological effects, most of which are shared by other dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists.

AB  - Objectives. To identify the risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) following a national campaign to prevent SIDS. Methods. For 2 years (October 1, 1991 through September 30, 1993) data were collected by community child health nurses on all infants born in New Zealand at initial contact and at 2 months. Results. There were 232 SIDS cases in the postneonatal age group (2.0/1000 live births) and these were compared with 1200 randomly selected control subjects. Information was available for 127 cases (54.7%) and 922 (76.8%) of controls. The previously identified modifiable risk factors were examined. The prevalence of prone sleeping position of the infant was very low (0.7% at initial contact and 3.0% at 2 months), but was still associated with an increased risk of SIDS. In addition, the side sleeping position was also found to have an increased risk of SIDS compared with the supine sleeping position (at 2 months: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 6.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71, 25.23). Maternal smoking was found to be the major risk factor for SIDS. Bed sharing was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS. There was an interaction between maternal smoking and bed sharing on the risk of SIDS. Compared with infants not exposed to either bed sharing or maternal smoking, the adjusted OR for infants of mothers who smoked was 5.01 (95% CI = 2.01, 12.46) for bed sharing at the initial contact and 5.02 (95% CI = 1.05, 24.05) for bed sharing at 2 months. In this study breastfeeding was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of SIDS. The other risk factors for SIDS identified were: unmarried mother, leaving school at a younger age, young mother, greater number of previous pregnancies, late attendance for antenatal care, smoking in pregnancy, male infant, Maori ethnicity, low birth weight, and shorter gestation. Conclusions. After adjustment for potential confounders, prone and side sleeping positions, maternal smoking, and the joint exposure to bed sharing and maternal smoking were associated with statistically significant increased risk of SIDS. A change from the side to the supine sleeping position could result in a substantial reduction in SIDS. Maternal smoking is common in New Zealand and with the reduction in the prevalence of prone sleeping position is now the major risk factor in this country. However, smoking behavior has been difficult to change. Bed sharing is also a major factor but appears only to be a risk to infants of mothers who smoke. Addressing bed sharing among mothers who smoke could reduce SIDS by at least one third. Breastfeeding did not appear to offer a statistically significant reduction in SIDS risk after adjustment of potential confounders, but as breastfeeding rates are comparatively good in New Zealand, this result should be interpreted with caution as the power of this study to detect a benefit is small.

AB  - Aim: To determine the efficacy and safety of the different modes of post-operative analgesia in the first 24 hours for both caesarean section and major gynaecological procedures. Methods: Being a purely descriptive study, the patients were not randomised to the post-operative analgesic mode. The choice was made both by the patient and the anaesthetist. The modes employed were continuous intravenous morphine, continuous intravenous pethidine, epidural morphine/bupivacaine, epidural bupivacaine/fentanyl and spinal morphine. During the first 24 hours, the patients' maximum pain scores, ability to sleep well, presence of nausea and/or vomiting, pruritus, respiratory depression and drowsiness and/or giddiness were elicited. Backache and inflammation at the site of insertion of the epidural catheter were also elicited in patients on regional analgesia. They were also asked if they were satisfied with the Pain Service. Results: Out of 2,024 patients, 60% had undergone caesarean section and 40% had undergone major gynaecological procedures. Continuous intravenous morphine, the most common mode, was used in 83% of obstetric patients and 47.9% of gynaecological patients. Only one obstetric patient and one gynaecological patient complained of severe pain at rest while 12 obstetric patients and 3 gynaecological patients had severe pain on movement or coughing. Side- effects, most commonly nausea and/or vomiting and drowsiness and/or giddiness, were present in 8.8% of obstetric patients and 32.5% of gynaecological patients. 99.3% of obstetric patients and 99.6% of gynaecological patients were overall satisfied with their analgesia. Conclusion: Our post-operative analgesic modes were found to be effective and safe.

AB  - Fetal behavioural states, with similarities to adult sleep states, exist in both the human and ovine fetus near term. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of intracerebral administration of pharmacologic agents, known to affect sleep states in the adult, on fetal behavioural states and physiologic correlates using the chronically catheterized ovine fetus near term. Each drug was infused into either the cisterna magna or lateral ventricle for 90 min in one of two doses. Carbachol (1.35 x 10-5 and 4.25 x 10-6 M) led to an increase in low-voltage ECOG, eye movement and FBM activities, while scopolamine (4.68 X 10-4 and 1.56 X 10-4 M) led to a decrease in low-voltage ECOG and eye movement activity with an increase in high-voltage ECOG activity. L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (2.04 X 10-3 and 6.81 X 10-4 M) infusion led to an increase in FBM, while VIP (3.00 X 10- 7 and 1.00 x 10-7 M) infusion had no effect on fetal behavioural state parameters. Study results indicate that fetal behavioural states can be altered pharmacologically and in a manner similar to that seen in the adult but with notable differences that may relate to species, developmental or dose-response issues.

AB  - In order to clarify the general pharmacological profiles of ST-630, a new active form of vitamin D3, experiments were carried out in various animal species with the following results. The agent was administered orally at the 3 dose levels of 2.5, 7.5, and 25 Î¼g/kg in case of single administration, and at the 3-dose levels of 0.025, 0.075, and 0.25 Î¼g/kg in case of 7-day repeated administration, except as noted in the individual experiments. Experiments were conducted 1 hr after the single oral administration and 24 hrs after the final administration in the repeated administration regimen. Additionally, the general pharmacological profiles of ST-232 (a major metabolite of ST-630) were studied regarding the general physical condition of rats, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in anesthetized beagle dogs, and the isolated ileum of guinea pigs. 1) In single administration of ST-630, the rat's general physical condition was observed for 24 hrs after the administration, but no significant effects were observed at any of the dose levels tested. In repeated administration as well, no significant effects were observed at any of the dose levels tested. Intravenously administered ST-232 at 25 Î¼g/kg had no effect on general physical condition. 2) In curarized rats, ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration and 0.25 Î¼g/kg in repeated administration had no significant effect on the spontaneous EEG's led from the sensory and motor cortices or from the hippocampus. 3) Nociceptive responses induced by tail pinching or by intraperitoneal acetic acid in mice were not inhibited by ST-630 at any of the dose levels tested in either single or repeated administration. 4) Neither electroshock-nor intraperitoneal pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures were inhibited in mice by ST-630 at any of the dose levels tested in either single or repeated administration. 5) ST-630 at any of the dose levels tested in single administration and in repeated administration did not affect the threshold of electroshock-or intraperitoneal pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice. 6) Pentobarbital sleeping time in mice was not affected by ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration or at any of the dose levels tested in repeated administration. 7) Spontaneous motor activity in rats was not affected by ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration or at any of the dose levels tested in repeated administration. 8) Reserpine-induced palpebral ptosis in mice was not affected by ST-630 at any of the dose levels tested in either single or repeated administration. 9) Body temperature in rats was not affected by ST-630 at any of the close levels tested in either single or repeated administration. 10) Single administration of ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg had no significant effect on the respiratory or cardiovascular systems in anesthetized beagle dogs. Intravenously administered ST-232 at 25 Î¼g/kg had no significant effect on the systems. 11) ST-630 at all doses tested in both single and repeated administration had no significant effect on urine volume, excretion of electrolytes, pH, or osmolality in rats. In rats treated with calcitriol at 1.25 Î¼g/kg for 7 days, no significant effect was observed. In rats treated with 1 Î± -HC (1 Î± -hydroxycholecalciferol) at 1.25 Î¼g/kg for 7 days, urine excretion decreased slightly, but excretion of electrolytes, pH and osmolality did not change. 12) Salivation excretion in rabbits was not affected by ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration or at any of the dose levels tested in repeated administration. 13) Gastric secretion was not affected by single administration of ST-630 at 2.5 and 7.5 Î¼g/kg. At 25 Î¼g/kg gastric secretion volume and total acid output tended to decrease, whereas pH increased. 14) Charcoal meal passage through the small intestine in mice was not affect by single administration of ST-630 at any of the dose levels tested. 15) ST-630 at all doses tested in both single and repeated administration had no significant effect on bile secretion in rats. 16) Gastrointestinal motility in situ in anesthetized rabbits was not affected by ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration or at any of the dose levels tested in repeated administration. 17) ST-630 at all doses tested in both single and repeated administration had no significant effect on pupil size in rabbits. 18) Contraction of the nictitating membrane produced by pre- or post-ganglionic stimulation in anesthetized beagle dogs was not affect by single administration of ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg. 19) Uterine motility in situ in anesthetized rabbits was not affected by ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration or at any of the dose levels tested in repeated administration. 20) Grip strength and motor coordination in rats were not affected by ST-630 at 7.5 and 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration or at any of the dose levels tested in repeated administration. 21) Contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle produced by stimulation of the sciatic nerve in anesthetized rats was not affected by ST-630 at 25 Î¼g/kg in single administration or at 0.25 Î¼g/kg in repeated administration. 22) Cornea reflex produced by mechanical stimulation in guinea pigs was not affected by eye drop application of ST-630 solution at 0.0003% and 0.001%. 23) ST-630 at 10-5 M did not affect resting tension in isolated tracheal, ileum, or vas deferens preparations of guinea pigs. Also, the drug at the same concentration did not affect contractions of the ileum produced by acetylcholine or histamine or contractions of the vas deferens produced by l- noradrenaline or electric stimulation of the hypogastric nerve. In the same preparations isolated from guinea pigs and treated with the drug at 0.25 Î¼g/kg for 7 days, the drug did not affect the resting tensions or the contractions. ST-232 at 10-7 to 10-5 M did not show any direct effect on isolated ileum preparation, but inhibited the contraction elicited by acetylcholine, histamine, or barium at 10-5 M. 24) ST-630 at 10-5 M did not affect resting tension in isolated uterus preparations of non-pregnant rats. Also, the drug did not affect contractions produced by oxytocin. In the same preparation isolated from non-pregnant rats treated with the drug at 0.25 Î¼g/kg for 7 days, the drug did not affect either the resting tension or the contractions. 25) Spontaneous contraction of isolated pregnant rat uterus was not affected by ST-630 at 10-5 M. In the same preparation isolated from prenatal rats treated with the drug at 0.25 Î¼g/kg for 7 days, the drug did not affect spontaneous contractions. 26) ST-630 at 0.01 to 1.0 Î¼g/ml had no effect on prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time in rabbit plasma or on osmotic fragility in rabbit erythrocytes. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and osmotic fragility were not affected by treatment with the drug for 7 days. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were not affected by treatment with calcitriol at 1.25 Î¼g/kg for 7 days. In rabbits treated with 1 Î± -HC at 1.25 Î¼g/kg for 7 days, prothrombin time prolonged slightly, but activated partial thromboplastin time did not change.

AB  - The general pharmacological properties of SUN9216 (lanoteplase), a new modified recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen-activator were studied in various experimental animals and the following results were obtained. 1) SUN9216 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) did not exert any significant effects on the following: gross behavior, locomotor activity, hexobarbital-induced sleeping time, convulsions induced by pentetrazol or strychinine or maximal electroshock, pain reaction induced by tail pinch and skeletal muscle tone in mice; rectal temperature in rats; spontaneous EEG activity in rabbits. SUN9216 (3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a increase in the number of writhing induced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid in mice. 2) SUN9216 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) did not modify the bradycardiac response to vagal stimulation, the hypotensive response to bilateral carotid artery occlusion and the hypotensive response to intravenous injection of acetylcholine in the anesthetized dogs. SUN9216 (0.5-50 Î¼g/ml) did not show any effects on spontaneous movements, histamine, BaCl2-induced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum, and oxytocin-induced contractions of the isolated nonpregnant and pregnant rat uteri. 3) SUN9216 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect respiration rate, tidal volume, blood pressure, heart rate, blood flow (carotid, coronary, renal and femoral), left ventricular (LV) pressure, LVdp/dt (max), blood vessel resistance and ECG in the anesthetized dogs. SUN9216 (0.5-50 mg/ml) showed no effects on isoproterenol-induced maximum contractility in the isolated guinea pig atria. 4) SUN9216 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) had no effects on intestinal transport in mice and gastrointestinal motility in the anesthetized rabbits. However, in pyrolus-ligated rats SUN9216 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently increased pH and occult blood in gastric juice. 5) SUN9216 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) did not affect urine volume or urinary electrolyte (Na+, K+, Cl-) excretion in rats. These results suggest that SUN9216 would not induce any severe clinical side effect.

AB  - Studies in rodents suggest the presence of a dopaminergic system that influences the function of a biological clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). To provide insights into mechanisms of dopamine action in the SCN, we studied transgenic mice that had either one allele (+\-) or both alleles (-/-) of the D1 dopamine receptor gene deleted, along with normal (+/+) littermates. As expected, receptor labelling autoradiography studies using [125I] SCH 23982 showed a complete absence of D1 dopamine receptor binding sites in the SCN of -/- animals. When pregnant mice from +\- X +\- matings were injected with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393, or the dopamine reuptake blocker GBR 12909 at day 19 of gestation, c-fos mRNA expression was observed in the SCN of +/+ fetuses. In contrast, c-fos mRNA induction was not seen in -/- or +\- litter mates. Injection of cocaine into pregnant dams also resulted in robust SCN c-fos mRNA expression in +/+ mice. Increases in SCN c-fos mRNA expression were also seen in +\- and -/- mice suggesting that cocaine action in the SCN involves both D1 receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Collectively, our studies of transgenic mice deficient in D1 receptors support the presence of a functional dopaminergic system in the fetal SCN. We also identify D1 receptors as the prominent transducer of dopamine action in the fetal SCN.

AB  - Objective. Prone sleeping is a strong risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We investigated whether the combined effect of prone sleeping position and prenatal risk factors further increased the SIDS risk. Methods. In the Nordic Epidemiological SIDS Study, parents of SIDS victims in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden completed a questionnaire on potential risk factors for SIDS. Forensic pathologists verified the SIDS diagnosis. Four controls of the same gender, age, and place of birth were selected. This matched case-control study, which included 244 SIDS cases and 869 controls from 1992 to 1995, was analyzed by conditional logistic regression. Results. Odds ratios (ORs) for prone and side sleeping compared with supine sleeping for the last sleep were 13.9 (98% confidence interval 8.2-24) and 3.8 (2.1- 8.7). Infants 13 to 24 weeks old had particularly high risk in prone and side sleeping, at 28.5 (7.9-107) and 8.9 11.6-22). OR for prone sleeping was higher in girls, at 30.4 (11-88), than in boys, 10.3 (5.5-19). We found strong combined effects of sleeping position and prenatal risk factors (more than multiplicative). The OR for prone and side sleeping was increased for infants with birth weight <2500 g, at 83 (25-276) and 36.6 (13-107); for preterm infants, at 48.8 (19-128) and 40.5 (14-115); and for intrauterine growth retarded, at 38.8 (14-108)and 9.6 (4.5-22), compared with supine position in infants without these prenatal factors. The combined effect of nonsupine positions and intrauterine growth retarded was highest among 13- to 24-week-old infants. Effects of combined presence of nonsupine sleeping positions and each of the factors of smoking in pregnancy, young maternal, age, higher parity, low level of maternal education, and single motherhood were more than additive. Attributable fractions in the population for prone and side sleeping were 18.5% and 26.0%. Conclusions. Both prone and side sleeping increased the risk of SIDS. The risk was increased fUrtHer in low birth weight infants, preterm infants, and infants at the age of 13 to 24 weeks, suggesting that SIDS may be triggered by nonsupine sleeping in infants with prenatal risk factors during a vulnerable period of postnatal development.

AB  - The study population included 159 women aged 18 to 37 years requiring contraception (60 in Sydney, 99 in Los Angeles). The design consisted of a 6- month study of a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) releasing 20 Î¼g ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg of norethindrone acetate daily over two successive cycles with a new ring or each of three different insertion regimens. A total of 831 woman-months of exposure were recorded, and 129 women completed the study. The overall incidence of side-effects was similar in the two centers and differences between the insertion regimens were not observed. Transient nausea following insertion of a new ring (mainly lasting 0.5 to 48 h) was the most prominent side effect, with no significant difference between the insertion regimens (although the incidence tended to be highest with bedtime insertion (34%) and lowest with early evening insertion and temporary removal during the first night [27%]). Transient vomiting occurred in about 10% of women in the first 24 h after first insertion of a new ring. The incidence and severity of nausea was greatly reduced in cycle 2 with each regimen (6% to 9% of women). Nausea could be prevented by overnight soaking of the ring in water before use. Other side effects such as headache, dizziness, uterine campus, breakthrough bleeding, weight gain, and ring expulsion occurred with similarly low frequency in all three insertion groups. One pregnancy occurred with probable ovulation between cycles 5 and 6, the only pregnancy recorded to date in studies with this ring. The study demonstrated that this effective and generally well tolerated CVR causes a relatively high incidence of transient nausea after insertion of a new ring, which is probably due to accumulation of ethinyl estradiol on the ring surface during storage. Acceptability is still high, and this particular CVR merits further development.
A cross-sectional study involving 60 women from Sydney, Australia, and 99 women from Los Angeles, California (US), evaluated the impact of three different insertion regimens on the transient nausea associated with the contraceptive vaginal ring. The ring released 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg of norethindrone acetate per day. 128 women completed the 6-month study, providing 831 woman-months of exposure. The one pregnancy recorded during the 6-month study occurred during the 7-day break between cycles 5 and 6. 53% of women experienced nausea in at least one cycle. No significant differences in side effects were noted based on insertion group: 1) early evening (5-7 p.m.); 2) late night (10 p.m. to midnight); and 3) early evening insertion, removal at bedtime, and reinsertion the next morning. In each insertion group, the incidence of nausea was greatly reduced (to 6-9%) in the second cycle of use. 9% of women experienced transient vomiting in the 24 hours after first insertion of a new ring. The remaining side effects--headache, dizziness, uterine cramps, breakthrough bleeding, weight gain, and expulsion--were rare and occurred with equal frequency in all three insertion groups. Women at both study sites expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the vaginal ring, primarily because of its convenience and effectiveness. Overnight soaking of the ring before first use has the potential to reduce the side effect of transient nausea, presumed attributable to the accumulation of ethinyl estradiol on the ring surface during storage.

AB  - In order to determine a reference value for the hyperbaric index (HBI), the proper procedure is to derive reference limits from a test sample of clinically healthy subjects and then use those limits to calculate the distribution of HBIs on an independent sample from the same population. For the reference test sample of clinically healthy subjects, no clinically healthy subject included in the study had a maximum HBI above 15 mmHgÃhour.

AB  - Women with (n = 27) a history of late pregnancy loss (â¤ 20 weeks) due to congenital anomalies who had completed the subsequent pregnancy with a live-birth were compared with a group of mothers with newborns without such a history (n = 29) at 4 and 16 weeks post-partum. The following aspects were assessed: depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and mother-infant adaptation. The women with a previous pregnancy loss showed significantly more negative emotions than the women without such a history. In addition, they considered that their healthy baby experienced more problems with sleeping, crying, eating, and acquiring a regular pattern of this behaviour than the average baby. They also perceived their baby as being less ideal than the women without a previous pregnancy loss. These problems were particularly present 4 weeks post-partum and were significantly positively related to trait anxiety. The implications of this study are that in women with a history of late pregnancy loss, family physicians and welfare officers should be made aware of possible problems in the mother and in mother-infant adaptation shortly after a normal live-birth, particularly in those with high trait anxiety. They will then be able to arrange psychological support at an early stage.

AB  - We studied 142 preterm infants (mean gestation 31 weeks, mean birthweight 1364 g) fed prospectively varied protein and energy intakes. Infants were grouped as either slow or rapid growers based on rate of weight gain. Rapid growers had increased heart rates (166 vs 160 beats/min), respiratory rates (55.7 vs 53.9 bpm), energy expenditure (64.8 vs 61.6 kcal kg-1 day-1), urinary C-peptide levels (1.59 vs 0.79 ng ml-1) and time in active sleep (78.0 vs 75.2%), and decreased spectral edge frequency in the electroencephalogram (2.96 vs 4.45 Hz) compared to slow growers. We conclude that preterm infants growing at varying rates manifest physiological and behavioral differences, and that these patterns may reflect altered autonomic balance.

AB  - The oxytocin antagonist, atosiban (1-deamino-2-D-tyr(OET)-4-thr-8-orn- vasotocin/oxytocin), was infused i.v. to chronically instrumented pregnant baboons in the last third of pregnancy. Atosiban (6 Î¼g/kg per min) inhibited myometrial electromyographic activity associated with spontaneous myometrial contractions that occurred around the onset of darkness between 134 and 162 days gestation (term 180 days gestation). The effect of atosiban on maternal heart rate was minimal. Maternal blood pressure remained unaltered during atosiban infusion. Fetal carotid arterial PO2 was unchanged during a 2-h infusion of atosiban. Transplacental passage of atosiban from mother to fetus was assessed at cesarean section under halothane anesthesia in four baboons and in two chronically instrumented fetuses in the absence of anesthesia. The maternal:fetal concentration gradient ranged from 9.2 to 22.8. Maternal atosiban clearance rates were 9.2-16.9 ml/kg per min. In conclusion, atosiban was very effective at inhibiting spontaneously occurring nocturnal myometrial contractions during the last third of gestation in the pregnant baboon. Although atosiban crosses the placenta relatively freely, there was no effect on fetal oxygenation.

AB  - A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method to determine vitamins A, Ap and E simultaneously was developed with direct extraction of vitamins from rat tissues with n-hexane and probe sonicating. The dry residue was redissolved in chloroform-methanol. Vitamins A and Ap were detected by UV-Vis and vitamin E by fluorescence. Vitamin K, used as internal standard, was detected both by UV-Vis and by fluorescence. Standards and samples were checked for linearity giving correlation coefficients that were higher than 0.99 in the concentration range of 3.1-9.4 for vitamin A, 8.2-24.7 for vitamin Ap and 0.6-1.7 nmol/g in the case of liver extracts and 0.5-3.0 nmol/g in the case of placenta. The intra-assay precision (R.S.D.) varied between 1.48 and 7.25, whereas inter-assay precision was between 4.99 and 7.03. Recoveries ranged between 93 Â± 8 and 107 Â± 5%. Results from the application of this method to different rat tissues having wide range of vitamin content are presented.

AB  - The aims of this study were to examine whether the combined approach of 1) establishing tolerance intervals for the circadian variability of blood pressure as a function of gestational age, and 2) computing the hyperbaric index by comparison of any patient's blood pressure profile (obtained by ambulatory monitoring) with the tolerance limits, provides a new highly sensitive test for the early detection of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. We analyzed a total of 745 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours in each of several occasions in 189 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 71 with gestational hypertension, and 29 with preeclampsia. After synchronization of all data by expressing times of sampling in hours from bedtime, circadian tolerance limits were first computed from the normotensive subjects as a function of trimester of pregnancy. The hyperbaric index and percentage time of excess were then computed for each individual blood pressure series. The maximum hyperbaric index was below 15 mmHg X hour for normotensive pregnant women in all trimesters of pregnancy, and mostly above that value for women who subsequently developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. Sensitivity of the test based on the maximum hyperbaric index was 97% for women sampled during the first trimester of gestation, and increased up to 100% in the third trimester. The positive predictive value was 100% in all trimesters. Moreover, the computation of the hyperbaric index provided, on the average, an early identification of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia 20 weeks prior to the clinical confirmation of the disease. Conclusions: Ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure during gestation provides sensitive endpoints for use in early risk assessment and as a guide for establishing preventive interventions. The approach presented here represents a simple, reproducible, non-invasive, and highly sensitive test for the very early identification of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

AB  - Hardware for automatic long-term measurement of blood pressure is here used in combination with a set of software modules for the computation of time-specified tolerance intervals and the evaluation of measures of blood pressure excess in the design of a computer-based system for the assessment of gestational hypertension. The variability of blood pressure, both within any given day (circadian) as well as along pregnancy, is such that the identification and the proper definition of gestational hypertension are highly ambiguous when based on single measurements. A first step to deal with such variability is to replace to constant limits for blood pressure frequently used in the assessment of gestational hypertension by a time-specified reference interval. For clinical applications, the use of tolerance intervals has been recommended. Accordingly, we have developed a nonparametric method for the computation of tolerance intervals for hybrid time series on the basis of bootstrap techniques that, therefore, does not need to assume normality or symmetry in the data. Once such a reference threshold is available, a hyperbaric index, as a measure of blood pressure excess, can be computed by numerical integration as the total area (within one cycle) of any given patient's blood pressure above the threshold. We used the method for computation of tolerance intervals to establish time-qualified reference limits as a function of gestational age for 497 series of blood pressure monitored automatically in 189 women with uncomplicated pregnancies. This software system for the establishment of time-qualified tolerance limits and the assessment of the extent and timing of blood pressure elevation may be helpful in prognosis, diagnosis and treatment with a better assessment of health status, timely treatment less harmful, undesired effects, and better monitor of the subject's response to treatment.

AB  - Autonomic nervous activity in the fetus was chronobiologically examined by spectral analysis of fetal heart beat fluctuation and time-frequency analysis with a wavelet transform. Spectral analysis of fetal heart beat fluctuation was performed by an autoregression method. In the low frequency domain, a 0.025-0.125 cycle/beat, in the spectral analysis of the heart beat fluctuation was closely associated with sympathetic nervous activity in fetal lamb. In the human fetus, the time series of beat-to-beat intervals obtained by Doppler ultrasound can be used for the spectal analysis instead of those of R-R intervals obtained by scalp electrode guided ECG as far as the low frequency domain is concerned. Autonomic activity of the fetus, measured by the integration of the low frequency domain and designated low frequency area in the power spectrum, develops as the pregnancy proceeds from 20 to 37 weeks gestation, and particularly around 28 weeks of gestation it develops remarkably. The low frequency area correlated well with the fetal blood gas of a growth-restricted fetus obtained by percutaneous funipuncture, suggesting the promising possibility of the use of spectral analysis in fetal well-being monitoring. The ultradian rhythm of autonomic activity in the fetus as well as the mother was examined in five volunteers from 35 to 37 weeks of gestation. There was a characteristic 12 hour cycle rhythm in the fetus which was not detected in the mother. A 12 hour rhythm also was found in the low frequency area of the arterial blood pressure fluctuation hi lamb fetus. Two-component cosinor analysis based on the 12 hour rhythm in the fetus showed that the amplitude of the rhythm was larger in the night than in the daytime. In a growth-restricted fetus, this ultradian rhythm was not obvious because the amplitude of the rhythm was so small. We successfully analyzed real time change in the low frequency domain of the fetal heart beat fluctuation by time-frequency analysis with a wavelet transform. Looking at the pattern of the wavelet transform, the power of the low frequency domain fluctuated every 10 seconds and made another rhythm. Spectral analysis of the rhythm of low the frequency domain showed that it consisted of four daughter rhythms. In other words, the low frequency domain forms a fractal structure in terms of rhythm. The difference between the night and the daytime is not due to the change intrinsic rhythm structure but to the change in amplitude of the rhythm. Moreover, in the hypoxemic growth-restricted fetuses, the rhythm structure was maintained and formed the so-called 1/f, although the amplitude became very small. This decrease in the amplitude of the daughter rhythms can be brought about by external maternal stress such as cooling the hand in an ice bath, particularly when the mother suffers from a vascular disorder due to preeclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of intravenous of zidovudine (AZT) at a dose and duration of infusion comparable to that used clinically on parameters reflective of fetal well-being. METHODS: Thirteen chronically instrumented noninfected baboons were monitored during intravenous infusions of AZT. Fetal cardiorespiratory activity and neurobehavioral function were assessed with 4-48-hour infusion of AZT to ten mothers (0. 5-2.1 mg/kg per hour) and three fetuses (2-6 mg/h), which resulted in fetal plasma concentrations of AZT of 194-3100 ng/ml. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the mean values in control periods, before and after infusion with values during infusion for parameters of fetal heart rate and rate variability (n = 7), breathing activity (n = 8), electroencephalographic activity (n = 8), and behavioral state (n = 7). No correlations were found with drug level. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of associations between exposure of the fetal baboon to AZT and changes in parameters reflective of fetal condition suggests that comparable exposure of the human fetus during intravenous infusion of drug would not confound clinical monitoring used to assess fetal well-being. These findings supplement conclusions from clinical research in support of U.S. Public Health Service recommendations that intrapartum fetal monitoring be performed as clinically indicated, not specifically because pregnant patients are treated with intravenous AZT.

AB  - Leptin is a protein secreted by adipocytes that is important in regulating appetite and adiposity. Recent studies have suggested the presence of leptin receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ANH). Neonatal administration of monosodium glutamate (MSG) damages the ANH, resulting in obesity and neuroendocrine dysfunction. Neonatal administration of MSG was utilized to test the hypothesis that the anatomic site for many of leptin's actions is the ANH. Female control (n = 6) and MSG-treated rats (n = 7) were implanted for 14 days with osmotic minipumps containing phosphate- buffered saline or leptin (1 mg Â· kg-1 Â· day-1). Leptin suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) body weight gain in controls but did not suppress weight gain in MSG- treated rats. Leptin decreased (P &lt; 0.05) fat depots in controls but had no effect in MSC-treated rats. Night feeding was suppressed (P &lt; 0.05) in leptin-treated control rats. MSG-treated rate showed a suppression in food intake that was of a smaller magnitude and appeared later in the course of leptin treatment. These findings suggest that leptin mediates some physiological actions related to fat mobilization via receptors located in the ANH.

AB  - Objective. - To examine the hypothesis that diverse ties to friends, family, work, and community are associated with increased host resistance to infection. Design. - After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg, spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a common cold. Setting. - Quarantine. Participants. - A total of 276 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor pregnant. Outcome Measures. - Colds (illness in the presence of a verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount of viral replication. Results. - In response to both viruses, those with more types of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus. These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index, education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more) types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence, low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being introverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and incidence of colds. Conclusions. - More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.

AB  - The respiratory control system guarantees acid-base-homeostasis as well as the rhythmic acitivities of the respiratory motor system in accordance with exercise and behavioural programmes of the human being. Cortical patterns and synchronized respiratory patterns with tracheal flow and pressure variations in the fetus indicate the common network of respiration and sleep-wake mechanisms in an early stage already. During fetal life acid-base-hoemostasis is dependant on progesterone controlled mechanisms. CO 2 partial pressure of the uterine artery reduces to 32 mmHg. The O 2 Partial pressure of the umbilical vein is 25-30 mmHg only. The raise of PCO 2, during delivery is accompanied by a shower of sensory input to the reticular formation causing arousal and the opening of the lungs. The continuation of postnatal breathing is the consequence of the integration of the central chemosensitive mechanism and the reticular activating system at an adequate threshold. Perinatal defense reflexes, functional patterns and strategies in early life may outline later pathophysiological mechanisms for sleep apnea, apparently life threatening event (ALTE), sudden infant death, and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.

AB  - A survey by telephone interviews has been carried out in 1993 in the canton of Geneva, in order to measure the prevalence of 3 risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and to evaluate the potential for SIDS prevention based on these factors: prone sleeping position, tobacco smoking by the parents during pregnancy, and no complete breast-feeding at 8 days of age. 278 families participated in the study, of 320 families who could be contacted by telephone in Geneva, from a random sample of 550 families having had a child in Geneva in the preceding 12 months. 40% of the infants had been put to bed in the prone position on the preceding evening. 18% of the mothers had smoked during pregnancy. Prevalence of low birth weight was 4.9% for 0 to 4 cigarettes per day during pregnancy, 17.2% for 5 cigarettes and more. At one week, 16.5% of children were not exclusively breast-fed. On the basis of these results, it can be estimated that an effective prevention programme, centred on prone sleeping position could decrease the incidence of SIDS by 50% or more. An even greater fraction of cases, up to 80%, could be avoided by the prevention of the 3 studied factors. These estimates show the need to develop a mother and child health programme in Switzerland.

AB  - Development of the daily rhythm of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) mRNA in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a main locus of circadian oscillation, was investigated by in situ hybridization. The phenotypic expression of VIP neurons occurred in two developmental stages in the ventrolateral portion of the SCN (VLSCN): the first was found before birth in the rostral part, and the second occurred in the main part between postnatal day (P) 10 and P20. The latter period coincided with the time that the massive VIP-efferent fibers project to the subparaventricular zone. In the adult and P20, the VIP mRNA signals of the SCN showed a clear diurnal rhythm with a trough in the light phase and a peak in the dark phase under light/dark (LD) conditions, but under constant dark (DD) conditions, no VIP mRNA fluctuations were observed. At P10, however, it was found that SCN VIP mRNA showed a peak at the transition from night to day and a trough at early dark period in LD conditions, in sharp contrast to the night peak in the adult rhythm. In DD conditions, a light-phase peak and a dark-phase trough were also observed at P10, contrasting the arrhythmic feature at adult stage. The present findings suggest that daily VIP rhythm was first generated in the early developed clock-controlled rostral SCN neurons, and later regulated by light-dependent main VLSCN neurons.

AB  - The development of the fetal central nervous system can be effected by drugs. In this paper we review the neurological consequences of intrauterine exposure to alcohol, cocaine, opiates and marijuana. Ethanol causes the fetal alcohol syndrome: mental retardation, intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, and peculiar dysmorphic features. Pathogenesis has been explained on the basis of maternal deficiencies or due to abnormalities in the conversion of ethanol to aldehyde, or abnormalities in the metabolism of prostaglandins or retinoic acid, the neurotransmitter systems, the neuronal excitotoxic activity, the development of the white matter; the production of gangliosides, and/or genetic regulation cell-cell adhesion. Cocaine has been related to congenital malformation, neurologic abnormalities during the neonatal period and psychomotor and cognitive development deficits. Characteristic dysmorphic features and a higher incidence of the sudden infant death (SIDS) have also been described. The following mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis: vascular effects, superoxide formation, chelation of calcium ion channels, and abnormalities in the production of glycosphingolipids, the synthesis of DNA, the functioning of neurotransmitter systems, the neuronal growth and differentiation, the neuronal excitotoxic activity and/or the expression of early immediate genes. Opiates produce intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, neonatal obstinence syndrome, and deficits of the psychomotor and cognitive development. They also increase the incidence of SIDS. The pathogenesis has been related to abnormalities in the sensitivity of the locus ceruleus, the functioning of the neurotransmitter systems, and/or the expression of early immediate genes. Marijuana has been associated with intrauterine growth retardation, dysmorphic features, and abnormalities of the behavior during the neonatal period, the psychomotor and cognitive development, and sleep. The pathogenesis is thought to be due to an action upon specific receptors, or upon the neurotransmitter systems, and/or an increase in the production of carbon monoxide. The best treatment of the syndrome of intrauterine exposure to drugs in the prophylaxis. The identification of emotional and drug addiction problems in the motor can avoid disastrous consequences. The care of these children is complex and requires a good pediatric follow-up and an early intervention program while the mother of the parents continues with the drug addiction therapy. The coordinations of all the necessary services with the active participation of social workers, physicians, educators and teachers is crucial for a successful treatment.

AB  - In a discordant anencephalic twin the hypothesis was tested that the fetal brain is necessary for the expression of a diurnal rhythm in fetal heart rate. Fetal heart rate recordings were made over a 24 h period in a discordant anencephalic twin pregnancy and in three normal twin pregnancies. Cosinor analysis was used to assess rhythmicity in fetal heart rate and maternal heart rate or activity. Correlations between maternal and fetal rhythms were calculated. A significant diurnal rhythm was found for the fetuses of the control twins, but in neither of the fetuses of the discordant anencephalic twin pregnancy. The maternal rhythm was 1-2 h in advance of the heart rate rhythms in all fetuses except the anencephalic one, whose heart rate did not show any correlation with the maternal diurnal rhythm. We conclude that the fetal brain contributes to the generation of the diurnal rhythm in fetal heart rate and synchronization of maternal-fetal rhythms.

AB  - Although variable, labor pain is among the most severe of pain syndromes, and has been described as severe to excruciating in 50 to 70 percent of primiparas. 'Twilight sleep' or amnesia was commonly used in the first half of this century via potent intramuscular, intravenous and inhalational agents. Subsequently, epidural anesthesia, first caudal then lumbar was used which offered superior pain relief without clouding the sensorium. However, epidurals with local anesthetics also contributed to dense sensory and motor blocks which are not neccesary for labor. Presently, both spinal and epidural opioids are used along with decreasing doses of local anesthetics, rendering the laboring patient a relatively pain-free labor but allowing her more mobility and control of her environment.

AB  - Pregnant Syrian hamsters with lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) received single injections of melatonin or the D1-dopamine receptor agonist, SKF 38393 on day 15 of gestation (1 day before birth). Pups were weaned on postnatal day 20 and their freerunning activity rhythms recorded for 3-4 weeks. The pups' phases on the day of weaning were significantly clustered in both of the treatment groups, but the average phases differed by approximately 180Â°. The results demonstrate that a single prenatal stimulus is sufficient to set the phases of the hamsters' rhythms and that the phase established depends on the stimulus. Both c-fos mRNA and Fos protein were expressed in the fetal SCN alter SKF 38393 injection but neither were expressed after melatonin injection. Simulations showed that a single stimulus could produce the observed synchrony from a population of uniformally distributed phases if the phase shifts were three to four times the magnitude of the adult barrister light phase response curve (PRC). A light pulse PRC mimicked tile effect of an SKF 38393 injection and a dark-pulse PRC mimicked the effects of a melatonin injection. Together these results suggest that dopamine and melatonin either are, or mimic, maternal entraining signals that represent day and flight.

AB  - Lithium carbonate is used for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Because of its widespread use, many women of childbearing age are taking lithium carbonate, which belongs to the US FDA Category D. Administration during pregnancy can result in fetal toxicity. A 17-y-old female with pre-eclampsia and a history of manic depression gave birth to an infant at 37-w gestational age. Several hours prior to delivery, the mother had a lithium level of 2.6 mEq/L. The infant's initial lithium level after birth was 2.1 mEq/L. A subsequent lithium level on the 3rd d of the child's life was 1.4 mEq/L; the half-life in the infant was >24 h. During the first 4 d of life, the infant was lethargic and exhibited poor suck-swallow coordination that required supplemental enteral feeding. By the 7th d of life, the infant was alert and tolerating all oral feedings. Lithium carbonate readily crosses the placental barrier and can produce teratogenic effects and toxicity. Neonates exposed in utero should be carefully monitored for symptoms of toxicity. In this case only minor toxic effects occurred.

AB  - An animal model was used to see if maternal genetic factors contribute to ethanol-induced fetal malformations. Susceptible C57BL/6J (B6) and resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mice were used in a reciprocal cross-breeding design. This design produced four fetal genotypes: true-bred B6B6 and SSSS litters and hybrid B6SS and SSB6 litters. Dams were intubated with either 5.8 g/kg of ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose-dextrin on day g of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed on day 18 of pregnancy and assessed for soft tissue and gross malformations. Results show different prenatal treatment effects on malformations depending on the fetal genotype. Mean percentage of total malformations in ethanol-treated groups were 61% (B6B6), 28% (B6SS), 3% (SSB6), and 16% (SSSS), respectively. Litters exposed to maltose-dextrin showed low (â¤4%) malformation rates regardless of fetal genotype. The difference in teratogenic response between genetically identical hybrid litters (B6SS and SSB6) suggests a maternal genetic contribution to susceptibility. Of the two major types of malformations, forelimb but not kidney malformations showed a pattern characteristic of a maternal genetic effect. It was concluded that maternal genetic effects can be distinguished from fetal genetic effects responsible for ethanol teratogenesis. Genetically based physiological responses to alcohol in the mother may confer varying degrees of risk for prenatal alcohol effects in the child.

AB  - Tobacco is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the United States. The role of some of the specific components of tobacco and tobacco pyrolysis in causing human disease has been well described. However, the health risks attributable to nicotine alone have not been fully determined, especially for long-term use. Nicotine is a potent chemical that has powerful effects on the human body, especially when administered rapidly or at high doses. Although many of these effects are deleterious, others may be beneficial. In certain special populations, such as the developing fetus, or persons with significant cardiovascular disease, nicotine has greater adverse effects. Because of the recent emphasis on using nicotine to treat tobacco dependence, as well as the interest in using nicotine as a possible agent for reducing overall tobacco use, clarifying the effects of long-term nicotine use on human health is important.

AB  - Alterations in plasma and amniotic fluid prolactin (PRL) levels have not been previously described in the pregnant baboon. In addition, PRL increases dramatically in response to estrogens and thus might be a good marker for expression of estrogen's biologic action. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the changes in plasma and amniotic fluid PRL with advancing gestational age and assess whether there was a correlation between plasma estradiol and PRL levels. A tethered pregnant baboon model was utilized for these studies. Blood was collected from five animals every day at 0900-1000 h (AM value) and 1800 h (PM value) from 125 to 135 days of pregnancy until delivery. Amniotic fluid was collected every day in the morning. Samples were analyzed by RIA for PRL, estradiol, and progesterone. PRL did not change with advancing gestational age. However, PRL showed a significant diurnal variation, with the PM values significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than the AM values. In contrast to findings for PRL, AM values for estradiol and progesterone were on average higher than PM values (p &lt; 0.05). A significant correlation was observed between the log10 estradiol (AM+PM) and log10 PRL (AM) from the following day (r = 0.52; p &lt; 0.05). Finally, amniotic fluid PRL was present in high concentrations (200-400 ng/ml) but did not vary with gestational age. In conclusion, PRL, estradiol, and progesterone show distinct diurnal variations during the last one-third of pregnancy in the baboon. In addition, plasma PRL is positively correlated with estradiol.

AB  - The relationship between dietary fat content and milk composition, production and litter growth was studied in rats fed during pregnancy and lactation purified diets of equal energy density containing 2.5 or 20 g fat/100 g diet. A subsample of rats (HL-EP group) fed the high lipid (HL) diet but pair-fed on an energy basis with the low lipid (LL) diet group was also studied in a separate experiment. Food intake, dam body weight and litter weight were recorded daily. Rate were milked on d 14 of lactation. Milk lipid, lactose and protein concentration and milk production were measured. Lactating rats fed the HL diet had significantly higher energy intakes (P < 0.01) and milk production (P < 0.05) than rats fed the LL diet. Milk lipid concentration and daily milk volume and lipid production were significantly higher in the HL group. The HL-EP dams had significantly higher milk lipid, protein and lactose concentrations (P < 0.05) and tended to have higher daily lipid and energy outputs (P = 0.08) than LL rats. Birth weights of pups were similar among groups, but from d 6 on, the pups from the HL and HL-EP groups were significantly heavier (P < 0.05) than pups from the LL group. This investigation presents evidence that the milk fat concentration and the daily output of fat, protein and lactose of lactating rats are altered by dietary fat manipulations, which in turn affect growth of the litter.

AB  - To determine if the type of environmental lighting or reproductive status influences secretory patterns of serum melatonin, gilts were exposed to artificial light or full sunlight during the summer months. In Experiment 1, eight prepubertal and eight postpubertal gilts (Hampshire x Yorkshire x Duroc) were exposed to light intensity of 700 lux in an environmentally controlled room from 0730 to 1900 h daily. An additional eight prepubertal and eight postpubertal gilts were reared outdoors in an open modified-front gestation building and fed on a concrete apron outdoors where light intensity approached 50,000 lux in full sunlight. After 2 mo of acclimating to environmental conditions, blood samples were drawn from each gilt at 2-h intervals from 1000 to 0200 h. Serum concentrations of melatonin were assayed utilizing Guildhay antisera. The experiment was repeated during the same months of the following year utilizing different gilts (Experiment 2). During both replications, neither light intensity nor reproductive status affected the secretory patterns of melatonin during the sampling period (P > 0.05). In both prepubertal and postpubertal gilts, serum concentrations of melatonin were not reduced (P > 0.05) by exposure to direct sunlight. Since baseline concentrations of serum melatonin were not reduced by sunlight during the day, the incidence of nocturnal rises of melatonin was not increased (P > 0.05) in either prepubertal or postpubertal gilts.

AB  - With close cooperation and communication among the obstetrician, neurologist, pediatrician, and patient, most women with idiopathic epilepsy who become pregnant will have an uneventful pregnancy with an excellent outcome. To optimize the neonatal outcome in a patient requiring medication, using a single drug at the lowest possible dose that keeps her free of seizures is preferable. The prevention of tonic-clonic seizures, however, is of utmost importance. Simple interventions such as avoiding sleep deprivation, having the patients take folic acid before conception, and giving the infant a vitamin K injection at birth will help optimize the outcome. There is an increase of congenital malformations in infants born to women with epilepsy; however, the incidence is low. Most women with epilepsy will experience normal pregnancy and labor and will have spontaneous vaginal deliveries of healthy babies.

AB  - 1) Maternal blood pressure (BP) decreased in the 2nd trimester and increased in the 3rd trimester, while heart rate (HR) increased until term, and these changes during pregnancies were more prominent in chronic hypertensive pregnancies. Although the circadian rhythm of BP and HR were obvious in normal and chronic hypertensive pregnancies, the amplitude of circadian variation of BP and HR decreased as gestational age advanced. The continuous high BP and low HR observed in severe preeclampsia resulted in decreased diurnal variation in BP and HR. The parasympathetic control examined by using nonspectral (RR50, %RR50, Lorenz plot) analysis were functionally decreased as gestational age advanced. 2) Fetal circadian rhythms were correlated obviously to maternal circadian rhythms such as HR, 1/f and especially to core body temperature. In severe preeclamptic pregnancies, the parasympathetic control was more pronounced in the mother, while it was reduced in the fetus. 3) The neonatal HR increased by the 30th day after delivery and thereafter decrease and these changes were inversely related to the value of width calculated by Lorentz plot. The circadian rhythm of HR in neonate and/or juvenile infant appeared from the 30th day and clearly established from the 100th day postpartum. 4) Melatonin from the mother might be one of the factors for materno Â· fetal entrainment and melatonin and D1-Dopamine in the milk for the materno-neonatal entrainment. The binding sites of melatonin receptors in rat pups SCN were up regulated and that of B1-Dopamine receptor were modulated by reduction of maternal melatonin after pinealectomy on the 7th day of pregnancy. The establishment of Locomotor activity circadian rhythms were delayed by prenatal infusion of D1-Dopamine antagonist from 15th day to delivery whereas prenatal timed injection of D1-Dopamine agonist at 8: 00 am to SCNX rat entrain the litters locomotor activity.

AB  - Objective To examine frequency domain measures of heart rate variability and their circadian rhythms in pregnancy. Design A longitudinal study. Setting University hospital in Turku, Finland. Participants Sixteen healthy women between 11 and 27 weeks of pregnancy; 12 women before pregnancy; and four women postpartum. Main outcome measures Heart rate variability as measured in frequency domain from 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. Results Pregnancy was associated with a lower standard deviation of R-R intervals (P < 0.01), with reduced very low (P < 0.05), low (P < 0.01), and high frequency (P < 0.05) power spectral components of heart rate variability. The high frequency power was lower at night in pregnancy, but similar in the daytime in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Conclusions Pregnancy is associated with an overall reduction in heart rate variability, most markedly reflected in the low frequency component. This suggests altered baroreflex or sympathetic modulation of heart rate, and decreased vagal activation at night. Â© 2017 Wiley. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the aim to describe the circadian pattern of noninvasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, we analyzed 759 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours every 4 weeks after the first obstetric visit in 71 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 28 with gestational hypertension, and 14 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of blood pressure variation for each group (complicated versus uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. A highly statistically circadian pattern is demonstrated for systolic and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P <.001 in all cases). Blood pressure decreases from the first trimester to the second and rises again in the third for healthy pregnant women. For women who developed gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia, blood pressure is stable during the first half of pregnancy and then continuously increases until delivery. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (always P <.001). This study confirms and extends to ambulatory everyday life conditions the predictable circadian variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences in blood pressure between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Those differences are found when both systolic and diastolic blood pressures for women with a later diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are well within the accepted normal physiological range of blood pressure variability.

AB  - Melatonin has clear acute and delayed effects on sleep and circadian rhythms. Decrements in core temperature and alertness have been found at different times of day following low pharmacological and physiological doses of melatonin. When correctly timed, melatonin induces both phase advances and phase delays of the circadian system in humans. When timed to advance, the decrement in temperature and alertness and the degree of shift are closely related to dose. In both stimulation and field studies, correctly timed melatonin can alleviate some of the problems of shiftwork and jet lag, notably enhancing sleep and alertness and hastening adaptation of rhythms to the imposed schedule. Performance effects and changes in sleep architecture need to be fully evaluated. The optimization of dose and formulation is also an area that requires furter work. Whether or not recently developed melatonin analogs will prove more or less useful than melatonin in adapting to phase shift remains to be seen. If incorrectly timed, melatonin has the potential to induce deleterious effects. While short-term studies indicate that it has very low toxicity, there are no long-term safety data. All of the studies reported here concern healthy adult volunteers and the use of a preparation licensed for human experimental use and available on a named patient basis on prescription. There are not data on uncontrolled preparations available over the counter in some countries. Its effects in pregnancy, interaction with other medications, and many other considerations remain to be addressed. Thus, while melatonin is useful in well-controlled conditions, the indiscriminate use of unlicensed preparations is not advisable.

AB  - Two herds of approximately 50 dairy cows were observed for oestrous behaviour for 6 weeks, 12 times a day for 30 minutes. It appeared that 3.08% of the pregnant cows showed oestrous behaviour during pregnancy (EBP) in such an intensity that they would have been considered in oestrus. With a less rigid oestrus detection threshold, 10.8% of the pregnant cows would have been considered to be in oestrus. Animals showed EBP during all months of pregnancy, but most of the behavior was observed in the middle of the gestation period. Â© 1997 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the circadian pattern of non-invasive ambulatorily monitored blood pressure during the trimesters of pregnancy in clinically healthy women as well as in pregnant women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, and to compare sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis based on the average of the blood pressure series with the values obtained on the basis of casual measurements. We analyzed a total of 745 blood pressure series sampled by ambulatory monitoring for about 48 hours in each of several occasions in 189 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 71 with gestational hypertension, and 29 with preeclampsia. The circadian pattern of BP variation for each group (complicated vs. uncomplicated pregnancies) and trimester of gestation was established by linear least-squares methods. Highly statistically different circadian patterns are demonstrated for systolic, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure for both groups of pregnant women in all trimesters (P < 0.001 in all cases). Blood pressure decreases from the first trimester to the second and raises again in the third for healthy pregnant women, but continuously increases during gestation in women who developed gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. The differences in circadian rhythm-adjusted mean between complicated and uncomplicated pregnancies are highly statistically significant in all trimesters (P < .001). Sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing gestational hypertension based on the circadian mean are 73% and 48%, respectively, too low for a proper individualized diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. This study confirms the predictable circadian variability in blood pressure during gestation. The differences between healthy and complicated pregnancies can be observed as early as in the first trimester of pregnancy, but the use of the 24-hour mean BP does not provide a good approach for early diagnosis of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

AB  - Although thyroid fuction has been extensively investigated in pregnancy, the data have failed to identify clearly true changes in thyroid status mainly because various artefacts affect the results of several TSH (thyroid- stimulating hormone) and free thyroid hormone assay techniques. To overcome the problem, serum TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured in 74 and 71 women in early and late pregnancy respectively and compared with those in 63 non-pregnant women using a highly-sensitive and specific immunoradiometric TSH assay (IRMA), free of any bias due toa pregnancy serum effect, and a two-step FT4 assay previously validated against an equilibrium dialysis reference method. In addition, the circadian changes of TSH in early and late pregnancy were studied in an effort to identify possible alterations related to feto-placental unit function. The median TSH level in early pregnancy (1.07, range: 0.27-3.76 mU/I) was found to be significantly lower than in late pregnancy (1.27, range: 0.26-3.57 mU/I, P&lt;0.001) and in the control group (1.30, range: 0.35-3.38mU/I, P&lt;0.001). Conversely median FT4 level was found to be significantly higher in early (16.85, range: 11.0- 24.20 nmol/l) than in late pregnancy (14.00, range: 10.60 20.40 nmol/l, P&lt;0.001) and in the control group (14.50, range: 10.40-18.80 nmol/l, P&lt;0.001). There was no significant difference between the median TSH or FT4 levels in the late pregnancy population and the control group. A normal TSH circadian rhythm was observed in both early and late pregnancy groups. In conclusion, a mild increase in thyroid activity is observed in early pregnancy, while the thyroid status in late pregnancy is unmodified.

AB  - Since urine contains cross-reacting substances to anti-cortisol(F) antibody, we extracted F from urine samples with dichloromethane. Using this specific assay system for F with TDX dynapack(fluorescence polarization immunoassay system), clinical significance of urinary F was tested by measuring urine samples from normal subjects, patients with pituitary-adrenal diseases and liver cirrhosis, and pregnant. The circadian rhythm of urinary F was evaluated by using samples collected every 4-hour period. The amount of urinary excretions of F during 4 hours were the highest during between 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then gradually decreased reaching at the lowest level at between 0 a.m. and 4 a.m. in normal volunteers. Such circadian rhythm was not found in 6 patients with Cushing's syndrome. The urinary F levels in pregnant women started to increase in the samples from between 21 to 30 weeks of gestation, and the level was maintained even at the 5th day of post-partum. The urinary F levels in patients with liver cirrhosis were significantly lower than those for age-matched healthy volunteers. In patients with abnormal steroidogenesis, the urinary F levels in patients with Cushing's syndrome were extremely high, 165-3358 micrograms/day. On the other hands, those in patients with deficient steroid synthetase were 2.8-26.5 micrograms/day, and those in patients with neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma were 7.8-43.8 micrograms/day. The urinary F levels were about 50-fold higher in the patients with Cushing's syndrome than those in the normal reference interval, whereas serum F and urinary 17-OHCS levels were only 2.5-fold and 7-fold higher than those healthy volunteers, respectively. These results indicate that the assay of urinary F extracted with dichloromethane is the most useful test for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

AB  - Melatonin is the mammalian fetus's window to periodicity of the outside world. Through melatonin, the fetus "knows" what time of year it is and, in all likelihood, also knows the time of day. The best known function of melatonin during development is to communicate information about photoperiod and thereby adaptively regulate reproductive development. A second likely function of melatonin during development, which may be related to but more widespread than the first, is to entrain the developing circadian pacemaker. Prenatal maternal entrainment occurs in all of the eutherian mammals in which it has been examined, and in Syrian hamsters exogenous melatonin during development causes entrainment. The broader distribution and greater abundance of melatonin receptors during development, relative to mature animals, suggests that developmental effects of melatonin are greater and more diverse. The human fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus expresses melatonin binding sites and is therefore likely to be affected by both endogenous and exogenous melatonin with consequences for the prenatal and postnatal expression and entrainment of circadian rhythms. Caution is warranted, not only concerning the use of exogenous melatonin during pregnancy and lactation but also concerning behavior that might disrupt the mother's endogenous melatonin rhythm.

AB  - Using modified Barnard and Eyres (1979) Sleep/Activity Records, 44 mothers recorded diurnal sleep and awake times for themselves and their infants during the 4th week postpartum. Independent two-way analyses of variance, using a two-factor design (3a x 2b), compared data from each mother and each infant. Independent variables were (a) parity groups (mothers feeding their first, second, or third infant) and (b) feeding method (breast vs. bottle). A statistically significant difference (Î± = 05) was apparent between breast-fed and bottle-fed babies regarding the number of awakenings and the hours of night sleep, with breast-fed babies awakening more and sleeping less at night. But there was no statistically significant difference in the hours of total sleep diurnally. Mothers exhibited corresponding differences in sleep patterns, with a statistically significant increase in night waking for breast-feeding mothers. Infants in this study averaged 14.6 hr of sleep in 24 hr, which is in contrast to the 15.5 to 17.3 hr of sleep commonly reported in nursing texts based on studies from the 1960s.

AB  - Fetal hypothalamic grafts containing the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) restore circadian locomotor rhythmicity when implanted into the third ventricle of SCN-lesioned hamsters. However, the quality of restored rhythms is variable, and the locomotor rhythms of grafted animals are generally less robust than those of intact animals. The present study explored whether anatomical features of the graft predict the quality of the recovered rhythm and whether such information might provide insight as to the target of the signal from the SCN that controls locomotor rhythmicity. The following graft parameters were assessed: distance between the attachment site of the graft and potential targets for the output signal from the SCN, number and overall size of SCN clusters, the size of the cluster closest to the SCN lesion site, and extent of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and vasopressin-associated neurophysin (NP) positive fiber outgrowth from the graft. The restored circadian activity rhythm was assessed by quantifying the precision of activity onset and the amount, period, and robustness of rhythmicity. The results indicate a significant positive correlation between the precision of activity onset and the proximity of the closest SCN cluster to the site of the lesioned host SCN. A more detailed analysis of the spatial location of the graft indicates that proximity of the graft in the dorsal and caudal directions, but not the rostral direction, is positively correlated with the precision of the recovered rhythm. This suggests two possibilities: the coupling signal may act on a site very near the SCN and travel preferentially in a rostro-caudal direction. Alternatively, the coupling signal may act on a site rostral to the SCN. That the site is not far rostral to the SCN was suggested by the lack of a correlation between the precision of the restored rhythm and the rostrally lying anterior medial preoptic nucleus. Finally, evaluation of NP- and VIP-ergic fibers in nuclei known to receive input from the SCN indicates that the extent of such innervation by graft efferents does not predict either the occurrence of recovery or the precision of the recovered rhythm. Overall, these results suggest that the target(s) of SCN pacemakers regulating locomotor rhythmicity lie in the hypothalamus, close to or rostral to the SCN.

AB  - The last decade has seen increased interest in the role of hormones, including oestrogens, not only in regulating growth, sexual development and reproduction but in maintaining a sense of psychological well-being. Episodes of change in oestrogen levels, whether increasing or decreasing, are high-risk periods for the emergence of psychological symptoms in some women. This may be due to a 'kindling effect' for women with previous psychological disturbance, an effect on circadian rhythm activity and therefore altered neurovegetative functions, or an effect on central rhythmic functioning between the hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex, all mediated by effects on neurotransmitter systems. Data supporting these hypotheses come from animal studies as well as converging research in several areas including the study of psychological side-effects of oral contraceptives, the study of mood and cognitive disturbances related to the menstrual cycle, the studies of states of hormonal change such as pregnancy and the menopause and, of course, studies of women with psychiatric disorders such as major depression, seasonal affective disorder and dementia. Improvement in such symptoms via hormonal therapies or other interventions will probably lead to better quality of life for women and may actually impede the deterioration associated with ageing and certain medical illnesses. Current data support a relationship between oestrogen and psychological well-being.

AB  - Objective. This paper reviews the recent literature on uterine activity during gestation with term and preterm delivery. Methods. A review of the literature on uterine activity during gestation with term and preterm delivery was conducted by searching Medline file from 1990 to the present, using the key terms 'uterine activity', 'uterine monitoring', 'preterm delivery', 'term delivery'. Additional references were accessed by cross referencing the bibliographie of the articles obtained through this search. Results and conclusions. Contractions are infrequent in normal pregnancy. The mean 24-hour frequency of uterine contractions increase progressively with advancing gestationnal age. A strong diurnal rhythm is present from 24 weeks to the term with surge of contractions at night. These uterine activity nocturnal surges precede term delivery. These surges are lost in women who deliver prematurely. These studies suggest that early identification of increase in uterine activity is not the most appropriate intervention for prediction of preterm delivery. The reason lies in a flawed contraction - based theory of the pathogenesis of prematurity.

AB  - The efficiency of glycemia control was compared in two groups of insulin dependent diabetic pregnancies treated with insulin, with and without the aid of the Camit-Diacomp system. The efficiency of glycemia control was analysed in all three trimesters of pregnancy. Mean diurnal fluctuations of glycemia levels in both study groups were compared. The clinical state of newborns, their glycemia and insulin levels in cord blood were analysed as well. No statistically significant differences of glycemia levels between the two compared groups of patients were found, however the observed significant differences of the HbA1C levels between these groups can speak in favour of the efficiency of treatment under the Camit-Diacomp system, which enables a more precise self control of the treatment and dosage of insulin.

AB  - This study was planned to evaluate the effect of pregnancy on diurnal variation of intraocular pressure (IOP) after placing control on all the IOP affecting factors. The IOP was measured with the Goldmann applanation tonometer. Both in the control and 3rd trimester subjects, the peak of mean IOP appeared in the morning when the subjects waked, and the trough of mean IOP happened at 2 am to 4 am. The diurnal intraocular pressure curves revealed that the IOP peaks were 15.4 +/- 0.9 and 12.9 +/- 0.6 mmHg in the control and third trimester pregnant subjects, respectively. Whereas the trough were 13.1 +/- 0.4 and 11.8 +/- 0.3 mmHg, respectively. The mean diurnal variation were 2.3 +/- 0.6 mmHg (P < 0.01), and 1.1 +/- 0.8 mmHg in the control and third trimester subjects, respectively. There are two main findings of present study: first, compared with non-pregnant control subjects, the IOP was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the third trimester pregnant subjects. Second, in the third trimester of pregnancy, the lower IOP level was associated with the less degree of IOP fluctuations at various hours of the day.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate hypertensive pregnant women by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and to compare results with those obtained at the office. Methods: The study population consisted of 17 women with preeclampsia (PE), 15 with mild chronic hypertension (CH), and a control group of 15 normotensive pregnant women. All the patients were evaluated by 24-h ABPM during the third trimester of pregnancy. Results: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured by daytime ABPM in patients with PE or CH was significantly lower than that measured at the office. In each group, the mean values of nighttime ABPM were significantly lower than the mean of daytime office measurements. In the PE group, a significant decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP evaluated by nighttime ABPM was observed. In CH, the decline was significantly smaller and less pronounced than in PE. Conclusion: 24-h ABPM appears to be a promising method for the evaluation of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

We present an overview of these studies, First, concerning healthy normotensive children and adolescents, such basic topics of ambulatory blood pressure studies as reproducibility, reference values, tracking and the extent of circadian variability have been addressed, Moreover, the impacts of the weight at birth on the elevation of blood pressure values and on several other anthropometric parameters of children have been studied. Next, for a group of pregnant normotensive women, the blood pressure values and the diurnal blood pressure profile during normal pregnancy and after delivery have been assessed. Finally, for a group of the elderly selected randomly from a large population-based survey, the distribution of ambulatory blood pressure values has been presented.

AB  - There are no published long-term safety data on the use of melatonin for whatever purpose, assuming long term to mean more than 6 months of daily medication. In the light of its physiological role in animals, the potential deleterious effects include inhibition of reproductive function, delayed timing of puberty, and influence (when taken during pregnancy and lactation) on the circadian status of the fetus and neonate and on future development. Its interactions with other medications are virtually unexplored. For most positive effects published, there also exist negative reports. There are insufficient data on its use in organic or psychiatric disease for any evaluations to be made. There are insufficient data on dose, formulation, and consequent relationships of individual pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for recommendations at present. However, in normal healthy adults over 18 years old, not pregnant or lactating, with no personal or family histories of psychiatric disorder, and unmedicated except for oral contraceptives and minor analgesics (if necessary), the only significant short-term side effect in the author's experience has been sleepiness following oral ingestion of synthetic melatonin (5 mg or less, oral fast release), licensed for human experimental use and for prescription on a named-patient basis.

AB  - The relationship between perinatal outcome and daily glucose profile throughout pregnancy was assessed in 31 White Class B through R pregnant diabetic women. The study population was divided into two groups on the basis of perinatal outcome: 20 patients (Group I) without neonatal complications; 11 patients (Group II) with at least one form of neonatal complications. The overall capillary blood glucose average levels of Group I (98.53 Â± 22.33 mg/dl) and of Group II (110.14 Â± 20.77 mg/dl) was significantly different (ANOVA p < 0.0001). From the first trimester of pregnancy Group I showed significantly lower mean glycemic levels for daytime, evening and night (Bonferroni test p < 0.05) than Group II and both presented daily glycemic profiles with very extensive excursions. During the second trimester the groups continued to maintain these differences in mean glycemic levels (Bonferroni test p < 0.05) but a daily glycemic rthythm with relative nocturnal hypoglycemia with closer fluctuations. In contrast, during the third trimester the two groups presented both a daily rhythm of glucose and glycemic values for daytime, evening and night not statistically different (Bonferroni test p < 0.06). The distribution of women according to glucose levels reached during the night showed a mode of distribution in both Group I and II collocated in a range 70-100 mg/dl. These findings suggest that an optimum perinatal outcome can be achieved only if the pre-pregnancy diabetic women can achieve a metabolic equilibrium during the second trimester which matches the daily excursions of glycemia present in a non-diabetic pregnant women avoiding individual episodes of night-time hypoglycemia.

AB  - Red deer (Cervus elaphus) exhibit highly seasonal rhythms in physiology and behaviour. The influence of photoperiod on the timing of these changes begins in utero where the fetus receives photoperiodic information via the diurnal pattern of maternal melatonin secretion. The potential sensitivity of deer fetuses to melatonin was ascertained by mapping specific receptors and characterizing them using 2-[125I]iodomelatonin and quantitative autoradiography in vitro. Specific binding occurred from day 31 of gestation onwards (term = 233 days) over the spinal nerves and respiratory system. At later stages of gestation binding occurred over the brain, particularly the brainstem, the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, gastrointestinal tract including the pancreas, metanephros, cochlea of the ear, spinal cord, and spinal and cranial nerves. Binding was abolished in the presence of 10-7 mol melatonin l-1 and diminished in the presence of 10-4 mol GTPÎ³S l-1 (guanosine-5-0-(3-thiotriphosphate)), confirming that binding represented functional G-protein-coupled melatonin receptors. Characterization studies, carried out on fetal lung, revealed that binding was time-dependent, reaching equilibrium at about 3 h at room temperature (22Â°C), and saturable with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 104 pmol l-1. This study demonstrates the presence of G-protein-coupled melatonin receptors over a wide range of tissues in red deer fetuses from early in gestation, indicating that in addition to its role in the communication of photoperiodic information to the fetus in this species, melatonin may be involved in fetal growth and development.

AB  - The possible effects of radiofrequency (RF) radiation on prenatal development has been investigated in mice. This study consisted of RF level measurements and in vivo experiments at several places around an "antenna park." At these locations RF power densities between 168 nW/cm2 and 1053 nW/cm2 were measured. Twelve pairs of mice, divided in two groups, were placed in locations of different power densities and were repeatedly mated five times. One hundred eighteen newborns were collected. They were measured, weighed, and examined macro- and microscopically. A progressive decrease in the number of newborns per dam was observed, which ended in irreversible infertility. The prenatal development of the newborns, however, evaluated by the crown-rump length, the body weight, and the number of the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal vertebrae, was improved.

AB  - It is the comfort obstetricians gain from a normal fetal-heart-rate tracing which has made cardiotocography so attractive as a tool for monitoring the condition of the fetus during pregnancy and labour. This aspect, and the relative simplicity and reliability of the applied methods, led to the widespread introduction of cardiotocography into obstetric practice in the early 1970s. The introduction has been merely on an empirical basis, without prior extensive considerations and investigations of the technical pitfalls, the many factors influencing the fetal heart rate (FHR), the validity under various obstetric conditions, the indications for monitoring, and the advisable duration and frequency of monitoring. This paper will concentrate on recent knowledge gathered regarding antepartum fetal-heart-rate monitoring and will provide some guidelines. Factors influencing the FHR patterns, characteristics of the normal and abnormal FHR patterns and the potential of automated quantitative analysis will be discussed. A more extensive review on the developments in cardiotocography analysis has recently been presented in Bailliere's Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

AB  - In 15-day-old control and vehicle-treated rats, the evening rise of the pineal N-acetyltransferase occurred at the same time as in their mothers, whereas in 5-day-old pups, the rise occurred by 2-3 hr earlier. Four-day administration of melatonin in the late day phase advanced the N-acetyltransferase rise in 15-day-old rats as compared with the rise in the vehicle-treated animals; a slight melatonin induced phase advance in 5- and 27-day-old rats was not significant. The data indicate that the newborn rat's circadian pacemaker controlling the rhythmic N-acetyltransferase rise may be entrained by exogenous melatonin. It appears, however, that the maternal melatonin transferred via milk cannot entrain the pup's pacemaker by phase advancing it, since the N-acetyltransferase rise in the pups begins earlier or at the same time as maternal melatonin production driven by the N-acetyltransferase rhythm.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effect of inseminating Jersey cows and heifers once per day or according to the a.m.-p.m. rule. A total of 337 artificial inseminations (AI) were completed by three technicians at the University of Tennessee Dairy Experiment Station at Lewisburg for 6 mo. Cows and heifers were inseminated at estrus using the a.m.-p.m. rule on even days of the month. On odd days of the month, AI were once daily between 0800 and 1200 h. Estrus detection was conducted two to three times daily. Pregnancy was confirmed by rectal palpation 60 to 80 d after AI. Herd DHIA averages were a 12.2-mo calving interval, 76 d to first AI, 83% observed estruses,and a 50% conception rate during the trial. Pregnancy data were analyzed with a model including treatment, AI, lactation number, parity, technician, and group. This study grouped cows and heifers according to when they were in estrus and inseminated (a.m.-a.m., a.m.-p.m., or p.m.-a.m.); means were 43.7, 57.9, and 59.0%, respectively. The a.m.-p.m. AI versus once per day AI yielded a pregnancy rate of 55.6% versus 51.3%. These results show no difference among Jersey cows or heifers that were inseminated artificially once daily in the a.m. However, those cows and heifers inseminated in the a.m. of first estrus detection had a lower pregnancy rate.

AB  - Preliminary data have suggested that female infertility due to corpus luteum insufficiency may be caused by subclinical hypothyroidism [exaggerated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation]. L-Thyroxine supplementation has been recommended to achieve pregnancies in subclinical hypothyroid women. This controlled study was carried out in order to investigate the biochemical diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism as a possible infertility factor. Five infertile patients (aged 25-36 years) with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 4, stimulated TSH > 20 Î¼U/ml) or primary hypothyroidism (n = 1) and five healthy controls (aged 22-39 years) with normal thyroid function (stimulated TSH < 15 Î¼U/ml), regular cycles and no history of infertility were studied in the early follicular phase. In the pre-study evaluation, eight of 23 volunteers (34.8%) had to be excluded because of subclinical hypothyroidism with stimulated TSH values (TSH(s)) > 15 Î¼U/ml. Cycle function of patients and controls was compared by the method of LH pulse pattern analysis. Therefore blood samples were drawn every 10 min during a 24 h period. Sleep was recorded from midnight to 7 a.m. Repetition of the TRH tests at the end of the 24 h blood sampling period confirmed the difference in stimulated TSH values of the two study groups. Pulse analysis for luteinizing hormone (LH), TSH and prolactin showed no differences between patients and controls for pulse frequency, amplitude, height, length, area under curve (AUC) and the 24 h mean. Even the hypothyroid patient had a normal LH pulse pattern. Additional measurement of melatonin in pooled sera every 30 min gave the well-documented diurnal profiles during day and night for both groups. Patients had significantly higher melatonin values at seven time points during the night. Peaks for LH, TSH, prolactin and cortisol were correlated with the sleep stages wake, rapid eye movement, 1 + 2 and 3 + 4. We concluded that corpus luteum insufficiency in female infertility cannot be explained by subclinical hypothyroidism and thus should not be treated with L-thyroxine for fertility reasons.

AB  - The results of a direct radioimmunoassay (RIA) for porcine plasma melatonin, suggesting a relationship among plasma melatonin, feed intake and photoperiod, were investigated by comparison with the results of an extracted RIA. These findings were further examined by analysis of a small number of samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results identified inadequacies in the specificity of the direct RIA and failed to provide evidence for an effect of feed intake on melatonin secretion. Instead, it appeared that feed restriction exacerbated nonspecificity in the direct RIA. The cause of nonspecificity, and its effect on analysis of daily plasma melatonin profiles, were examined. The plasma component(s) responsible for nonspecificity was (were) not identified. However, the results suggest that characteristics of the antiserum used in the direct RIA are involved in the mechanism by which nonspecificity is induced. Results obtained using the extracted assay revealed that plasma melatonin concentrations in prepubertal gilts and pregnant sows exhibit a diurnal pattern, in which concentrations are low during daylight and modestly increased during darkness. Using the direct RIA, the same profiles exhibited highly variable melatonin concentrations showing little association with the light-dark cycle. Thus, assay specificity was identified as a factor contributing to inconsistencies in the literature describing plasma melatonin in the domestic pig and the importance of rigorous validation of RIAs was demonstrated. Furthermore, the results indicate that plasma melatonin concentrations in domestic pigs, as in other mammalian species, are entrained by the light-dark cycle. Â© Munksgaard.

AB  - To delineate the development of melatonin (MLT) production during childhood, we measured the excretion of MLT and 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate (MLTS) in the urine of children (n = 134) from the 26th week of gestation until the age of 20 years. MLTS excretion showed a diphasic pattern with declining values in preterm babies with lowest values around term. After birth, the values remained low for the first 6 months of life. The highest values were reached between 4 and 7 years of age with a smooth but steady decline thereafter. A night-day difference was not detectable before the age of 6 months; the greatest night-day variations occurred at the time of the highest MLTS excretions. The MLT values showed an identical pattern but with amounts 1,000 times smaller; the ratio of MLTS to MLT increased from 40:1 in preterm babies to 900:1 in prepubertal children. In summary, the MLT/MLTS excretion exhibits the highest activity with respect to total secretory capacities as well as night-day differences at the time of gonadal quiescence during childhood. The strong inverse correlation of MLT and MLTS excretion with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal activity points to a causal relationship between pineal gland activity and pubertal development.

AB  - Pregnancy usually induces alterations in maternal sleep patterns: sleepiness is the most common feature during the first three months and is mainly dependent on the central actions of progesterone. Conversely, women often complain of insomnia during late pregnancy. Vigilance states progressively develop during the fetal life. Paradoxical sleep first emerges from the undifferentiated sleep-like state of the fetus, followed by quiet sleep and by short periods of arousal. Paradoxical sleep is most prominent during fetal and early postnatal life. A birth, the neonate losses its fetal circadian sleep pattern and shows prolonged spontaneous wake periods. The sleep pattern then rapidly changes during the third month of postnatal life. At that time, the infant recovers a circadian sleep pattern, displays slow-wave sleep onset, acquires electroencephalographic features similar to those of adult sleep, while paradoxical sleep duration rapidly decreases. This knowledge of sleep alterations during pregnancy and of the development of fetal an neonatal sleep helps to deal with the frequent complaints about and infant's sleep during this period, and to better delineate normal or pathologic changes in sleep patterns.

AB  - A teenager in week 24 of pregnancy complained of a disagreeable sensation in her lower limbs at rest, particularly when she tried to sleep, since day 20 of her pregnancy. These symptoms caused her to move her legs incessantly to calm her discomfort. Restless legs syndrome was diagnosed and the patient was screened for potential causes. No cause was found, but her symptoms disappeared after delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify key predictive variables of functional status after childbirth. DESIGN: An investigative survey design. SETTING: Primary health care maternal child health centres in one large city in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 200 mothers selected from a culturally diverse population. All were aged 20 to 35 years, had experienced normal pregnancies, labours, deliveries and delivered a healthy baby between 37 and 42 weeks' gestation. MEASURES AND FINDINGS: The Inventory of Functional Status After Childbirth (IFSAC) (Fawcett Tulman & Myers 1988) was used as the main outcome measure. Three variables predictive of functional status after childbirth were identified, namely, satisfaction with level of stamina and well-being, sleep pattern at night and perceived lack of support following childbirth. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Return to full functional status as measured by IFSAC takes longer than physiological recovery after childbirth. Women who experience diminished well-being, interrupted sleep patterns and lacked support, appeared to be at greater risk of role congestion, overload and dysfunction. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To help women avoid the additive nature of assuming the motherhood role while also resuming past role responsibilities, practitioners could encourage pregnant women to develop a postnatal support plan. Women need to be proactive in negotiating specific and ongoing support from others with household responsibilities and some aspects of baby care.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of consistency in behavioral state organization for 30 low-risk human participants examined as fetuses at 38-40 weeks gestation and again as neonates at approximately 2 weeks postnatal age. Behavioral states were assigned similarly for fetuses and neonates in terms of heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. We found that the time spent in a sleep period was distributed among quiet sleep (QS), active sleep (AS), and indeterminate states in virtually identical proportions for fetuses and neonates. However, the only within-subject consistency between the fetal and neonatal periods was in the duration of complete QS epochs. Fetuses made fewer transitions between QS and AS, but neonates had shorter and more structured AS â QS transitions. These findings suggest that, whereas central nervous system processes governing QS do not change appreciably, the control of AS undergoes significant changes in the 4 weeks spanning the fetal and neonatal periods. We believe that the duration of enclosed QS epochs provides the only stable measure of behavioral state development between the prenatal and postnatal periods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have been published on postnatal depression (PND) over the last 10 years. A controversy has arisen regarding the specificity of the diagnostic concept. It is based on 2 points: the hormonal environment and the course and recurrence of PND. EEG Sleep studies are also numerous, but this paper presents the first study on EEG sleep profile during PND. METHODS: 24 women suffering from major depression according to RDC were placed in 3 groups: 1) Group A (n =8): PND ; 2) Group B (n = 8): depression with a past history of PND ; 3) Group C (n = 8): depression without a past history of PND. Women were agematched and according to the Hamilton 24 item severity score. Group A patients were delivered within less that 6 months, groups B and C within a minimum of 3 years. None were pregnant or alcoholic, and none were physically ill. RESULTS: There was no difference between groups B and C. Group A was characterised by a significantly longer stage IV sleep. There was also a strong tendency to a shorter stage I sleep and a better quality of sleep (total sleep time and number of awakenings) during PND. DISCUSSION: Our study shows that, even if similar to major depression, specific polysomnographic alteration can be found during post-partum depression. This finding is relevant to the hypothesis of PND's diagnostic specificity. The perfect similarity between groups B and C strengthens this evidence. Nevertheless, the significance of SWS alterations are difficult to explain and additional studies are required. CONCLUSION: The EEG Sleep profile during PND differs from major depression of the same severity. This appears to favour the specificity of the diagnostic concept.

AB  - We examined the effects of a behavioral intervention and methylphenidate (MPH) on inappropriate behavior and sleep disturbance displayed by a 6-year-old boy who had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Results showed that the behavioral intervention was effective in reducing inappropriate behaviors to near-zero levels regardless of the presence or absence of MPH.

AB  - With close cooperation and communication among the obstetrician, neurologist, pediatrician, and patient, most women with idiopathic epilepsy who become pregnant will have an uneventful pregnancy with an excellent outcome. To optimize the neonatal outcome in a patient requiring medication, using a single drug at the lowest possible dose that keeps her free of seizures is preferable. The prevention of tonic-clonic seizures, however, is of utmost importance. Simple interventions such as avoiding sleep deprivation, having the patient take folic acid before conception, and giving the infant a vitamin K injection at birth will help optimize the outcome. There is an increase of congenital malformations in infants born to women with epilepsy; however, the incidence is low. Most women with epilepsy will experience normal pregnancy and labor and will have spontaneous vaginal deliveries of healthy babies.

AB  - A team approach with close communication among the obstetrician, neurologist, pediatrician, and patient will result in an uneventful pregnancy in most epileptic women. Women should be counseled regarding the greater than 90% likelihood of a favorable outcome. Maternal and neonatal outcome can be optimized by carefully evaluating the clinical necessity of anticonvulsant medications preconceptionally. One can then prescribe an appropriate choice based on seizure type and history of response, with a goal of achieving monotherapy at the lowest effective dose. Nonpharmacologic intervention, such as avoiding high levels of stress and sleep deprivation, will also help the patient to remain seizure-free during the pregnancy. In addition, folic acid and vitamin K can help optimize neonatal outcome. In short, most epileptic women will experience a normal pregnancy, labor, and delivery of a healthy baby and can breastfeed if desired. Although the incidence of congenital malformations with any anticonvulsant is increased, the actual incidence remains relatively low. Despite the shortcomings and risks of anticonvulsants, adequate therapy is clearly preferable to uncontrolled seizure activity. Women should be encouraged to optimize their anticonvulsive therapy prior to pregnancy, usually resulting in adequate therapy throughout the pregnancy and postpartum, with a happy and healthy outcome for mother and infant.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the recommendations that infants sleep supine could have adverse health consequences. DESIGN: A prospective study of infants, delivered before, during, and after the Back to Sleep Campaign in the United Kingdom (UK), followed to 6 months of age. The children were part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). Subjects. Singletons born to mothers resident in the three former Bristol-based health districts of Avon in the period June 1991 to December 1992, and for whom questionnaires were completed on sleeping position at 4 to 6 weeks of age (n = 9777); for these infants 8524 questionnaires were also completed at 6 to 8 months of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective measures of health, the presence of specific signs and symptoms, duration of sleep at night, and calling the family doctor to the home. RESULTS: Of 43 outcomes considered, after adjustment for 12 factors using logistic regression only 2 were associated with raised risk among infants put to sleep on their back (diaper rash and cradle cap). Infants put to sleep prone had increased risk of a number of health outcomes, including cough and possibly pyrexia. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that putting infants to sleep in the supine position results in increased morbidity, although changes in prevalence of rare disorders would not have been identified.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of stimulus intensity on heart rate response in 18 low-risk human fetuses between 37 and 40 weeks gestation. Each fetus was stimulated in quiet sleep with a 30-s voice sound at intensities of 80 dB and 90 dB. The fetal cardiac electrical signal was captured transabdominally at a rate of 1024 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal-processing techniques. We found that fetuses generally exhibited a 5- to 10-s decrease in heart rate following stimulus onset at an intensity of 80 dB. The response pattern changed from deceleratory to acceleratory when stimulus intensity was increased to 90 dB. Our findings suggest that a heart rate deceleration at low-stimulus intensity may be a component of the orienting reflex in the human fetus. Â© 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Objective: This study assesses intrahousehold allocation of energy in rural Bangladesh and tests the hypothesis that, when daily energy intake is adjusted for energy expenditure, no age or gender bias will be apparent in intrahousehold energy allocation. Design: Data were collected at two-month intervals over a one year study. Setting: Four villages in Matlab Thana, rural Bangladesh. Subjects: Two hundred and seven children up to 5 y of age and their 145 mothers and 123 fathers. Interventions: Data included six measurements of observed 24 h dietary energy intake and physical activity recorded from waking to sleeping. Total daily energy expenditure was derived using the factorial method. Results: Women's energy intake ranged from 75-88% of the FAO/WHO recommended energy intake over the six periods of data collection, significantly less (P < 0.0001) than the men's (range 89-114%). Although the women had moderate levels of physical activity, frequent pregnancies and long lactation periods increased their energy needs. Among children no longer breast fed, energy consumption, unadjusted for energy expenditure, provided 86-108% of the FAO/WHO recommended energy intake by weight. Conclusions: Women consistently received less of their energy requirements than either their children or their husbands.
Data collected during 1977-78 in 4 villages in Matlab Thana, Bangladesh, on 207 children under 5 years of age and their 145 mothers and 123 fathers were used to investigate the hypothesis that, when daily energy intake is adjusted for energy expenditure, energy needs are met and no age or gender bias will be evident in intrahousehold energy allocation. During the 12-month study period, data were collected every 2 months on 24-hour dietary energy intake and physical activity. Women's energy intake ranged from 75% to 88% of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) recommended intake, even though their physical activity levels, frequent pregnancies, and long lactation periods increased their energy needs. Men's energy intake ranged from 89% to 114% of the FAO/WHO standard. Among weaned children, energy consumption, unadjusted for energy expenditure, provided 86-108% of the recommended energy intake by weight. The finding that fathers generally met their energy requirements is assumed to reflect their role as producers of the family's food supply. Feeding men during periods of peak agricultural labor demand, even at the expense of lower intakes for their wives and children, may be perceived as essential to the household's survival. Agricultural and income generation programs to increase total energy availability to households, family planning services to diminish the burden of childbearing, and enhanced educational opportunities for women all have the potential to help mothers meet their energy needs.

AB  - Children of substance abuse mothers have an increased risk of severe pathological disorders such us perinatal diseases (prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, infections) with their neurological and respiratory complications and sequelae, and transmission of drug addiction related infections, ie human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C virus, syphilis. Many of these children present a drug withdrawal syndrome characterized by restlessness and jitteriness during the neonatal period. This is frequently followed by a post withdrawal period of several weeks duration with crying, excitement, sleep and feeding difficulties. Although these drug withdrawal manifestations have no incidence on the vital prognosis, it severely impairs the mother-infant interaction. Despite these disorders it appears that the outcome of these children is mainly related to their familial environment which is exposed to many risk factors: mother-child separation, violence, delinquency, precariousness, unhealthy housing, prostitution, drug dependency, parental death or imprisonment... Early medico-psycho-social intervention starting during pregnancy and a prolonged support for several years are the only way to improve their spontaneously poor outcome.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) is a peptide hormone secreted by the lactotroph of the anterior pituitary. Secretion of PRL is regulated negatively by hypothalamic hormone. Dopamine is the major physiologic prolactin inhibiting factor (PIF). PRFs as TRH, VIP and oxytosin have prolactin releasing activity. Prolactin secretion is induced by sleep, stress, sexual intercourse and suckling stimulus. Serum level of PRL is increased by estrogen. Therefore, PRL level is higher in women, especially in the late follicular phase and during pregnancy. Lactation is the major biologic function of PRL in humans and essential to reproduction. Other function of PRL, such as regulation of ovarian function, osmoregulation and immunoregulation is not fully established. Many action of PRL remained to be clarified.

AB  - 32 children born from HIV infected mothers (8 HIV infected and 24 seroreverted uninfected) were followed up from 1990 to 1995 at the Neurological Institute "C. Mondino" in Pavia to study the mother and baby relationship. At the end of the follow-up period, from the birth to the end of the second year of age, all children had psychosomatic disorders (repeated rejections, anorexia, sleep disturbances characterised by difficulty in falling asleep and frequent wake-ups, gaseous colics many times during the day). The psychosomatic disorders are considered as the result of an early distortion of the mother and baby relationship. Thus children born from HIV positive mothers are exposed to the possibility of developing psychological problems related to a distorted relationship with their mother.

AB  - Texas' health objectives include reducing the infant mortality rate from 8.1 per 1000 live births in 1990 to no more than 7 per 1000 by the year 2000. To help target potentially preventable causes of infant mortality, we examined the underlying cause of each of the 2545 infant deaths that occurred in Texas during 1990. Potential existed for primary prevention of the underlying cause of at least some of 778 infant deaths and for secondary prevention by treating the underlying causes of 1127. The following appear to be the most promising targets and strategies for prevention: causes of neonatal mortality by improving the clinical care of high-risk newborns; sudden infant death syndrome by having infants sleep in the supine position; respiratory complications of preterm birth by preventive and therapeutic surfactant; death from bacterial infections by optimal antibiotic therapy; injuries and accidents by optimal parental supervision; preterm birth and adverse pregnancy outcomes by optimal prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal care; and neural tube defects by adequate paraconceptual folic acid.

AB  - Objective: To determine the frequency of adverse reactions, particularly the occurrence of apnea, among preterm infants after immunization with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine adsorbed (DTP) and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (HibC) vaccine in the neonatal intensive care unit. Study design: After the occurrence of apnea in two preterm infants following immunization with DTP and HibC, a prospective surveillance of 97 preterm infants younger than 37 weeks of gestation who were immunized with DTP (94 also received HibC at the same time) in the neonatal intensive care unit was performed to assess the frequency of adverse reactions and in particular, the occurrence of apnea. For each infant, data were recorded for a 3-day period before and after receipt of the immunization. Results: The majority of preterm infants tolerated immunizations with DTP and HibC without ill effects. However, 12 (12%) infants experienced a recurrence of apnea, and 11 (11%) had at least a 50% increase in the number of apneic and bradycardic episodes in the 72 hours after immunization. This occurred primarily among smaller preterm infants who were immunized at a lower weight (p = 0.01), had experienced more severe apnea of prematurity (p = 0.01), and had chronic lung disease (p = 0.03). Conclusion: The temporal association observed between immunization of preterm infants and a transient increase or recurrence of apnea after vaccination merits further study. Cardiorespiratory monitoring of these infants after immunization may be advisable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether antenatal betamethasone or dexamethasone is the preferred drug by use of neurobehavioral development assessment of exposed mice offspring. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty adult CD-1 mice were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 10) to be administered a single subcutaneous dose of either a placebo (0.9% sodium chloride), betamethasone (0.10 mg), or dexamethasone (0.10 mg) on day 14 (74%) of gestation. The offspring then performed a battery of sensory, motor, motivational-anxiety, cognitive, and social tasks. Data were compared with use of analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, or Ï2 testing where appropriate. RESULTS: The offspring from the three treatment groups were indistinguishable at birth. Dexamethasone exposure induced a brief developmental delay. Separation anxiety was increased in the dexamethasone- exposed group in the perinatal period, whereas exposure to both corticosteroids decreased anxiety in the juvenile period, continuing into adulthood among male betamethasone-exposed mice. Selective enhancement of a memory process occurred in betamethasone-exposed mice, whereas dexamethasone exposure resulted in a decrement. Socialization as to place preference while awake and asleep varied among the three treatment groups. Corticosteroid treatment did not induce significant changes in sensory, motor, motivation, and learning performances or in reproductive capability and progeny development. CONCLUSION: Subtle differences in offspring performances of neurobehavioral development tasks favored antenatal betamethasone rather than dexamethasone. This finding, along with the knowledge that dexamethasone is less potent in accelerating lung maturity in the fetal mouse, suggests that betamethasone may be the preferred corticosteroid to use when human preterm delivery is imminent.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare average stress levels during the month of conception to those of previous infertile months. We postulated that stress level during the actual month of conception would be lower than that during previous non-conception cycles. Thirteen normal women from the general community, who were attempting pregnancy, kept daily records of coital activity and basal body temperature, and twice a month completed self-administered questionnaires and provided a 12 h overnight urine sample. On average, women reported significantly more favourable mood states on standard psychometric tests, during the month of conception than during the previous non-conception cycles. In addition, they felt significantly less 'hassled' during the month of conception. However, mean urinary hormone excretion of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol did not significantly differ between conception and non-conception cycles and there was little relationship between the psychological measures of mood state and excretion of adrenaline and cortisol. There was no evidence of increased coital frequency during the month of conception when mood states were improved, suggesting that stress effects on libido were unlikely to account for the findings. The results support the conclusion that psychosocial stress influences fertility in females but as yet mechanisms remain unclear.

AB  - We performed a questionnaire survey about 42 patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 who were currently alive. Information was obtained on their age, sex, birth weight, gestation, parental consanguinity, other family members affected, age of onset of jaundice, neonatal and postneonatal bilirubin values, neonatal and postneonatal therapy, problems faced with phototherapy, liver transplantation, current growth status, current neurologic status, and the status of hearing. Patients were between 2 months and 21 years of age. There were 18 males and 24 females. Thirty-nine patients had been born at full term gestation and 3 had been preterm. Jaundice was noted on postnatal day 1 in 34%, between days 2 and 4 in 55%, and after day 11 of life in 11% of patients. In the neonatal period bilirubin values (mean +/- SD) were typically 19.8 +/- 4.5 mg/dL. Eighty-six percent of patients had neonatal peak bilirubin values of >20 mg/dL. Parental consanguinity was present in 44% and a history of Gilbert's disease in one parent was present in 10% of patients. Causes of exacerbations of jaundice reported were respiratory infections, febrile illnesses, vaccinations, fasting, surgery, emotional stress, and noncompliance with treatment. Neonatal therapy consisted of exchange transfusion in 28%, phototherapy in 79%, phenobarbitone in 20%, and cholestyramine, albumin, infusions, and plasmapheresis in one case each. The mainstay of postneonatal therapy was home phototherapy for 10 to 16 hours, primarily at night during sleep, using blue lights or a combination of blue and fluorescent lights. Some patients used innovatively designed phototherapy units. Problems reported with phototherapy were decreased effectiveness with age, poor compliance, restriction of activity and play, inability to travel or take vacations, irritation from eye shades, difficulty keeping eye protection on, difficulties in temperature maintenance, tanning of the skin, embarrassment from the need to be nearly nude during phototherapy, and difficulty in procuring phototherapy lamps. Other therapies that had been tried included oral agar, albumin infusions, antioxidants, acupuncture, bilirubin oxidase, calcium infusions, clofibrate, cruciferous vegetables, cholestyramine, chlorpromazine, flumecinol, plasmapheresis, tin mesoporphyrin, ursodeoxycholic acid, and urinary alkalinization. Fifteen children had undergone liver transplantation (5 auxiliary and 10 orthotopic). All 42 patients are reportedly of normal height and weight. Neurodevelopmental status is said to be normal in 77% of patients. Two patients have kernicterus, 4 have cerebellar symptoms, and 1 each has developmental delay, mild intention tremor, and mild speech delay. Hearing was reported to be normal in 94% of patients. The 2 children with hearing loss have conductive loss from otitis media. With home phototherapy prolonged, survival free of neurologic deficits is possible in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1, but there are many problems associated with phototherapy. Avoiding exacerbations of jaundice is an important aspect of management. Liver transplantation offers the prospect of cure but its risk versus benefit ratio is undetermined. Hearing loss was absent in the patients surveyed despite prolonged exposure to high bilirubin levels, which suggests that bilirubin may not be as ototoxic as is commonly believed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES. Parental and maternity leave policies are a popular fringe benefit among childbearing employed women and a benefit employers frequently are required to offer. However, few rigorous evaluations of the effect of maternal leave on maternal health exist. METHODS. Using a hybrid of the household and health production theories of Becker and Grossman and a sample of women identified from state vital statistics records, a nonlinear relationship between maternal postpartum health and time off work after childbirth was estimated. RESULTS. For women taking more than 12 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on vitality. With more than 15 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on maternal mental health, and with more than 20 weeks leave, time off work had a positive effect on role function. Subjects' mental health scores were comparable and vitality scores slightly lower than age-and gender-specific norms; 70% of women studied reported role function limitations. CONCLUSIONS. Findings suggest employed women experience problems in well-being at approximately seven months postpartum. Variables associated with improved health include: longer maternity leaves, fewer prenatal mental health symptoms, fewer concurrent physical symptoms, more sleep, increased social support, increased job satisfaction, less physical exertion on the job, fewer infant symptoms, and less difficulty arranging child care.

AB  - 234 pairs of twins were studied from pregnancy up to 21 years of age on the basis of records from maternity hospitals, neonatal wards and children's health centres and questionnaires filled in by the parents when the twins were aged 2-10 and 12-21 years, and by the twins themselves at age 12-21. 74 twins were personally interviewed about human relationships in their families and with the Present State Examination (PSE) at age 15-21. When the evaluation of parental preference was made by the parents, the mother's favourites had learned to speak earlier and were more often the psychic leader of the pair, but they more often had sleeping difficulties and other psychosomatic symptoms in adolescence. They were most often scored in class 2-3, non-specific neurotic symptoms in the PSE, but none of them was placed in the higher classes of possible or probable psychiatric disorder. Mothers seem to develop a tighter affectionate bond towards their favourites than do fathers, thus inducing a good basic trust and faster language acquisition in childhood, but probably also transient non-specific neurotic symptoms in adolescence in face of the developmental task of entering autonomous adulthood. The father's favourites were more often the physical leaders of the pair, showed less accident proneness and most often reported tendencies towards autonomy from their co-twins, thus indicating that the fathers' attitudes may be more encouraging towards independence. As the least psychosomatic symptoms were seen in twins in the intermediate position regarding parental preference, it seems reasonable that the division of twins between parents on the grounds of favouritism should not be strict.

AB  - Objective: The heart rate (HR) responses to high and low intensity sounds reflect different central nervous system processes. The HR acceleration evoked by high intensity stimuli is part of a defensive reaction to limit sensory intake, and the HR deceleration elicited by low intensity stimuli is a specific physiological correlate of cognitive processing. The fetal defensive reaction to vibroacoustic stimulation has been studied extensively, but little is known regarding the fetal response to low intensity sounds. This study was undertaken to evaluate the HR response to a low intensity speech sound in 58 human fetuses at 36-40 weeks gestation. Methods: The fetal cardiac electrical signal was sampled transabdominally at a resolution of 1 ms, and fetal R-waves were extracted using adaptive signal processing. A 30-s speech sound was delivered at an intensity of 83 dB while fetuses were in quiet sleep. For each fetus, the HR response was analyzed in consecutive 10-s periods (P1, P2, P3) using very conservative statistical criteria; HR changes during stimulation were then compared with spontaneous changes in HR in a 10-s control period. The HR response was examined in terms of maternal (abdominal wall thickness, placental location, and amniotic fluid volume) and fetal (gestational age, prestimulus HR and HR variability, and prestimulus respiratory pattern) variables. Results: Compared with the control period, a HR deceleration occurred more often (38 (65.5%) versus 11 (19.0%), P &lt; 0.001) and was of greater amplitude (-5.8 Â± 3.2 bpm versus -2.6 Â± 1.0 bpm, P = 0.003) during stimulation period P1. More fetuses exhibited a HR deceleration in P1 compared with either P2 (P = 0.011) or P3 (P = 0.017), although the frequency of a HR deceleration in these latter two periods was still significantly greater than in the control period (P2 versus control: P = 0.038; P3 versus control: P = 0.022). These results were independent of maternal characteristics. However, fetuses with increased prestimulus HR variability exhibited a greater decrease in HR than fetuses with relatively lower base-line variability (r = 0.591, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Approximately two-thirds of low risk human fetuses exhibited a HR deceleration during the first 10 s following the onset of an 83-dB speech sound. The frequency and magnitude of the HR deceleration were independent of maternal factors, raising the possibility that the HR deceleratory response may provide a physiological measure of fetal cognition.

AB  - Substance abuse in women of childbearing age is global public health problem. The most common drugs of abuse are cocaine, diamorphine (heroin) and alcohol. Fetal drug exposure can be identified by maternal history (which is not always reliable), maternal and infant urine toxicology screening, and meconium and infant and maternal hair analysis. The opioids most commonly associated with withdrawal in neonates are diamorphine, morphine and methadone. Neonatal withdrawal or abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurs in 50 to 80% of infants exposed to opioids in utero, usually within the first 24 to 72 hours after birth. Only 5 to 20% of these infants will have sever symptoms and need pharmacotherapy. Signs of withdrawal include effects arising from the central nervous, vasomotor, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. The most serious problems are vomiting and diarrhoea resulting in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, bodyweight loss, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory alkalosis from tachypnoea, and seizures. There are a number of scales that can be used for assessing the need for pharmacotherapy in NAS. The goal of treatment is for the infant to be comfortable and able to sleep between feeds without being deeply sedated. Pharmacological agents used for treating opioid NAS include both opioid and non-opioid drugs. The most commonly used drugs are paregoric, diluted tincture of opium, and phenobarbital (phenobarbitone). Paregoric, a solution of opium alkaloids - morphine and codeine (analgesics), narcotine and papaverine (anti-spasmodics) - is used in doses of 3 to 6 drops every 4 to 6 hours. Tincture of opium alkaloids, for use in the neonate, must be reconstituted (25-fold dilution) by the hospital pharmacy to a concentration of 0.4% to reduce the content of morphine to that in paregoric (0.4 mg/ml). This avoids the adverse effect associated with the presence of other ingredients in paregoric. Phenobarbital is an analgesic and anticonvulsant. It has a prolonged half-life and is especially useful in reducing the hyperactive behaviour associated with NAS. It is important to closely monitor the efficacy of therapy by assessing patient response through the use of objective measures. The psychosocial aspects of drug abuse are important to keep in mind, as the infant continues to be at high risk for neglect, abuse and foster care placement.

AB  - Although variations in monoamine neurotransmission have been implicated in a variety of psychopathologic outcomes in man, little is known about how monoamines influence or are affected by developmental processes early in childhood. In this study, assays for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were obtained from 'leftover' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 119 human newborns. The levels of these monoamine metabolites were in keeping with pre-existing 'normative' data from two small previously published studies. The levels were largely unaffected by variations in the infants' physiologic condition at the time of lumbar puncture, and exhibited evidence for circadian rhythms. Among 32 infants (8 neurologically normal, 24 neurologically compromised) for whom more than one CSF sample was obtained during the first year of life, the correlations between baseline and follow-up measurements for 5-HIAA and HVA were on the order of 0.75. Correlations between twins (four sets) were significantly higher than those between unrelated individuals for 5-HIAA and HVA. At 9-month follow-up, neurologically normal infants in the lower extreme 15% of the distribution for 5-HIAA exhibited a trend toward lower scores for sociability on the Colorado Childhood Temperament Inventory (maternal report) than their counterparts at the upper extreme of the 5-HIAA distribution. Leftover CSF is a readily available resource for measurements of monoamine metabolites (and possibly other CSF constituents) in population-based samples of human newborns.

AB  - The hormone melatonin is known to influence the circadian rhythm, and it probably also mediates some of the physiological changes that occur in the body at night. Inasmuch as uterine activity is greater during darkness, we investigated whether melatonin could modulate uterine contractility. Biopsies were performed during caesarean sections to obtain uterine tissue from women who had reached full term. The obtained samples were mounted in organ baths, and spontaneous contractions were recorded. Melatonin alone did not change myometrial contractility, whereas melatonin in combination with noradrenaline potentiated contractions. These results may indicate that melatonin plays a role in the timing of labour, since labour often begins late in the evening.

AB  - Previous studies show that prenatal exposure to alcohol results in sleep deficits in rats, including reductions in paradoxical sleep. Little is known, however, about the extent or duration of sleep impairments beyond the neonatal period. The present experiment examined effects of prenatal exposure on sleep in young adulthood. Three-hour, daytime sleep EEGs were obtained in 6-month-old female rats prenatally exposed to alcohol. Compared to isocaloric pair-fed and ad libitum control groups, the alcohol-exposed group showed reduced paradoxical sleep. Non-paradoxical sleep did not differ between groups. Concurrent deficits were obtained in radial arm maze, but not inhibitory (passive) avoidance, performance. One year later, at the age of 18 months, alcohol-exposed rats showed deficits in spontaneous alternation behavior which were reversed by administration of glucose (100 mg/kg). Deficits in paradoxical sleep at 6 months of age were highly correlated with deficits in spontaneous alternation behavior at 18 months of age, in individual, alcohol-exposed animals. These results provide the first evidence that prenatal exposure to alcohol results in selective and persistent deficits in sleep. They also show that measures of paradoxical sleep can predict impaired memory over a large portion of the life span, and suggest that glucose can attenuate memory deficits in this population.

AB  - Segawa's syndrome is a hereditary progessive dystonia with diumal fluctuation, which in contrast to other chronic dystonia in childhood responds dramatically to levodopa therapy. Very little is known on how it affects pregnancy or how it is affected by the pregnancy. We present a case of pregnancy of a patient, suffering from Segawa's syndrome. The patient received levodopa throughout entire two consecutive pregnancies and gave birth to two healthy male infants. The only perinatal pathology was non-progressive labor. The safety of levodopa use in pregnancy is also discussed.

AB  - The developmental aspects of sleep and breathing are rarely treated as one subject. This report attempts to link the fields of sleep research and developmental pulmonology in a comprehensive description of development and control of sleep and breathing from gestation to adulthood. Unfortunately, much of the investigation in this area is basic physiology and was done some time ago. Although this subject matter need not be updated, some of these references are older; however, this may be new information for the pulmonologist. The second part of this report details the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the development of sleep-disordered breathing in children and adults. In fact, developmental abnormalities that occur in childhood may recrudesce in adulthood. We conclude with a discussion of the familial and genetic aspects of sleep-disordered breathing and consider the place of sudden infant death syndrome in the spectrum of these disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an over-the-counter mechanical nasal dilator during sleep in pregnant women with nasal congestion. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women with symptoms of nocturnal nasal congestion not attributed to allergies or 'cold' symptoms were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either a spring-loaded device or placebo device without a spring. Each patient assessed breathing and sleep quality for a three-day baseline and three-day treatment period. A 10-question diary was utilized to assess breathing, ease of falling asleep, sleep quality, and continuity and depth of sleep. Averaged scores for each question were computed for baseline and treatment periods, and differences were calculated. Statistical analyses were by the sign test, Fisher's exact test and Student's t test. RESULTS: Thirty-four (21%) of 160 screened patients were enrolled into the study; 24 (15%) completed the study. All agreed to being assigned to receive either the spring-loaded device (n = 12) or a placebo (n = 12) device. Responses to 8 of the 10 questions favored the former as compared with the placebo (P = .05, sign test). Moreover, patients treated with the spring-loaded device gave more favorable responses to the question, 'Overall, compared with most nights, how easy was your breathing throughout last night?' (P = .02, t test). CONCLUSION: Use of this drug-free external nasal dilator improved the ease of breathing among patients with pregnancy-related nocturnal congestion.

AB  - Relationships between wakefulness of mothers and their infants' movements during night sleep in postpartum period were studied under conditions in daily life. Subjects were ten primiparae, aged 23-31 yrs (mean age, 26.8 yrs), who had a normal course of pregnancy and delivery. Eight of their infants were breast-fed, and two were formula-fed. Mother's polysomnograms, (EEG, EOG, EMG, and ECG) and actigrams of infants' legs were simultaneously recorded using Medilog 9000 at home in the 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks. Mothers' sleep stages and their infants' movements were visually scored by an epoch of one minute. The infants' movements were classified into four states, MOV0, MOV1, MOV2, and MOV3. We defined MOV0 as no activities during one epoch, MOV1 as less than 20 seconds activities, MOV2 as from 20 to 40 seconds activities and MOV3 as from 40 to 60 seconds activities. The average times of wakefulness on the mothers were 102.6 min (SD = 23.5), 84.8 min (SD = 52.8) and 79.4 min (SD = 40.5) for 1st, 3rd and 6th postpartum weeks, respectively. There were no significant differences among them. The mothers' wakefulness coincided with the infants' movements MOV3 was 86.9% for total epochs of MOV3, while deep sleep of the mothers was observed during epochs of MOV0 and MOV1. This trend did not change across the postpartum weeks. The time-lag between the mothers' wakefulness and their infants' movements was calculated. In 85.4% of 48 times of mother's awakenings for feeding their infants, their infants began to move before their mothers woke up. In 63.4% of the cases, the mothers woke up within two minutes after their infants began to move. In the present study, eight of the ten mothers satisfactorily adapted themselves to the life style in the postpartum period, while two had difficulties in adaptation. In conclusion, ten mothers' wakefulness during night sleep in postpartum period was related to their infants' movements, and its relationship did not change through the 1st, 3rd and 6th weeks of delivery.

AB  - Recent trends in the vital statistics of the United States continued in 1995, including decreases in the number of births, the birth rate, the age- adjusted death rate, and the infant mortality rate; life expectancy at birth increased to a level equal to the record high of 75.8 years in 1992. Marriages and divorces both decreased. An estimated 3 900 089 infants were born during 1995, a decline of 1% from 1994. The preliminary birth rate for 1995 was 14.8 live births per 1000 total population, a 3% decline, and the lowest recorded in nearly two decades. The fertility rate, which relates births to women in the childbearing ages, declined to 65.6 live births per 1000 women 15 to 44 years old, the lowest rate since 1986. According to preliminary data for 1995, fertility rates declined for all racial groups with the gap narrowing between black and white rates. The fertility rate for black women declined 7% to a historic low level (71.7); the preliminary rate for white women (64.5) dropped just 1%. Fertility rates continue to be highest for Hispanic, especially Mexican-American, women. Preliminary data for 1995 suggest a 2% decline in the rate for Hispanic women to 103.7. The birth rate for teenagers has now decreased for four consecutive years, from a high of 62.1 per 1000 women 15 to 19 years old in 1991 to 56.9 in 1995, an overall decline of 8%. The rate of childbearing by unmarried mothers dropped 4% from 1994 to 1995, from 46.9 births per 1000 unmarried women 15 to 44 years old to 44.9, the first decline in the rate in nearly two decades. The proportion of all births occurring to unmarried women dropped as well in 1995, to 32.0% from 32.6% in 1994. Smoking during pregnancy dropped steadily from 1989 (19.5%) to 1994 (14.6%), a decline of about 25%. Prenatal care utilization continued to improve in 1995 with 81.2% of all mothers receiving care in the first trimester compared with 78.9% in 1993. Preliminary data for 1995 suggests continued improvement to 81.2%. The percent of infants delivered by cesarean delivery declined slightly to 20.8% in 1995. The percent of low birth weight (LBW) infants continued to climb in 1994 rising to 7.3%, from 7.2% in 1993. The proportion of LBW improved slightly among black infants, declining from 13.3% to 13.2% between 1993 and 1994. Preliminary figures for 1995 suggest continued decline in LBW for black infants (13.0%). The multiple birth ratio rose to 25.7 per 1000 births for 1994, an increase of 2% over 1993 and 33% since 1980. Age-adjusted death rates in 1995 were lower for heart disease, malignant neoplasms, accidents, and homicide. Although the total number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection deaths increased slightly from 42 114 in 1994 to an estimated 42 506 in 1995, the age-adjusted death rate for HIV infection did not increase, which may indicate a leveling off of the steep upward trend in mortality from HIV infection since 1987. Nearly 15 000 children between the ages of 1-14 years died in the United States (US) in 1995. The death rate for children 1 to 4 years old in 1995 was 40.4 per 100 000 population aged 1 to 4 years, 6% lower than the rate of 42.9 in 1994. The 1995 death rate for 5- to 14-year- olds was 22.1, 2% lower than the rate of 22.5 in 1994. Since 1979, death rates have declined by 37% for children 1 to 4 years old, and by 30% for children 5 to 14 years old. For children 1 to 4 years old, the leading cause of death was injuries, which accounted for an estimated 2277 deaths in 1995, 36% of all deaths in this age group. Injuries were the leading cause of death for 5- to 14-year-olds as well, accounting for an even higher percentage (41%) of all deaths. In 1995, the preliminary infant mortality rate was 7.5 per 1000 live births, 6% lower than 1994, and the lowest ever recorded in the US. The decline occurred for neonatal as well as postneonatal mortality rates, and among white and black infants alike. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rates have dropped precipitously since 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations that infants be placed on their backs or sides to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. SIDS dropped to the third leading cause of infant death in 1994, after being the second leading cause of death since 1980. Infant mortality rates (IMRs) have also declined rapidly for respiratory distress syndrome since 1989, concurrent with the widespread availability of new treatments for this condition.

AB  - This study was designed to explore risk factors for breast cancer with emphasis on the detection of clinical markers of the hormonal imbalance during the perimenarche. Three hundred and thirty women diagnosed with breast cancer and 346 population controls were identified and interviewed in Girona, Spain between 1986 and 89. Cases were more likely than controls to have had long menstrual periods in the first 5 years after menarche [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0], to experience menopause at a late age (OR = 1.5) and to report acne during adolescence (OR = 1.6). Family history of breast cancer was associated with an increased risk (OR = 2.3). Cases reported a lower use of drug treatments for anxiety and sleep disorders than controls. Moderate alcohol drinkers and smokers were at lower risk for breast cancer. No statistically significant association with breast cancer was observed for number of children, age at last pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, hormonal treatment after menopause and weight perception during the teenage years. Hormonal changes in the years following menarche may be relevant to breast cancer risk. The roles of menstrual period length and acne during adolescence should be further explored.

AB  - The effect of fetal thyroidectomy on thermoregulation in newborn lambs was investigated. Seven of 14 lambs born normally at term were thyroidectomized at Day 127 of gestation. Colonic temperature and oxygen consumption were measured during non-rapid eye movement sleep 6-45 h after birth. All lambs were then killed and perirenal brown adipose tissue was sampled for measurement of thermogenic activity (guanosine diphosphate binding), uncoupling protein and lipid contents. Thyroidectomized lambs tended to have a mean colonic temperature 2.35Â°C lower (P = 0.067) than controls and two became hypothermic (i.e. colonic temperature < 35Â°C). Thyroidectomized lambs exhibited lower rates of oxygen consumption (P = 0.05) and an increased incidence of shivering thermogenesis. The perirenal adipose tissue of these lambs had a lower thermogenic activity (P < 0.01), less uncoupling protein (P < 0.01) and higher lipid content (P = 0.072) compared with intact controls. It is concluded that fetal thyroidectomy results in a decreased ability of newborn lambs to utilize nonshivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue as well as increasing the incidence of hypothermia. These changes are associated with decreased synthesis of uncoupling protein and functional development of brown adipose tissue in the late gestation fetus.

AB  - In mammals the photoperiodic synchronization of circadian system starts before birth. During fetal and neonatal period mothers relay the photoperiodic information to their litter. The maternal pineal melatonin 24 h cycle acts as a synchronizing signal. We have studied the effect of pineal maternal sympathetic denervation and administration of melatonin to mothers denervated during gestation on the prenatal synchronization of testicular malate dehydrogenase (MDH) activity circadian rhythm of the offspring 25 days after birth. When mothers were denervated at the 7th, 10th or 11th day of gestation, pups showed disruption of testicular MDH activity circadian rhythms. In contrast, no disruptive effect was observed when the mothers were denervated on the 12th or 14th day of gestation. When denervated mothers (7th day of gestation) were treated with a daily dose of melatonin from the 11th to the 14th day of gestation, pups showed a MDH activity circadian rhythm. The hormone failed to impose a daily phase when administered from the 9th to the 12th day of gestation. Results suggest that prenatal synchronization in the rat occurs very early in the development, before suprachiasmatic nuclei morphologic arrangement and functional activity begin.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the autonomic response in preterm neonates born after an at-risk pregnancy. Methodology: Twenty-one preterm neonates (gestational age; GA) 29-37 weeks; bodyweight (BW): 720-2113 g; postnatal age: 2-126 days), born after at-risk pregnancies (stressed (STR) group), were compared to 30 preterm neonates (GA: 26-36 weeks; BW: 813-2380 g; postnatal age: 2-86 days) without any intrauterine risk factor (C group). A 10 s pain stimulus was given on the forefoot and heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure were measured at 15 and 30 s, at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min. After 10 s ocular compression six cardiac variables were recorded. Results: After the pain stimulus the STR-group had a significant increase of heart rate at 15 s and an increase of diastolic blood pressure at 30 s. In the C group a significant increase of heart rate at 15 s was recorded. For the respiratory rate both groups showed an initial depression (significant at 15 s in the C group) followed by an increase. The time to react to the ocular compression was significantly shorter in the STR-group than in the C-group and thus more parasympathetic. Conclusions: We hypothesize that the different sympathetic and parasympathetic reaction patterns of the vital parameters to triggers in the STR-group are due to chronic stress, pointing to an altered maturation of the two components of the autonomic nervous system after chronic intrauterine stress (CIUSTR).

AB  - We investigated the importance of pre- and postnatal maternal rhythmicity for the development and synchronization of the juvenile circadian core temperature (T(c)) rhythm in rats by evaluating the T(c) of artificially reared pups in six litters derived from mothers maintained in continuous bright light (LL) and impregnated after drinking behavior stopped showing circadian periodicity. Pups removed from their a periodic mothers on postnatal day 9 and artificially reared for 3 days showed a free-running T(c) rhythm whose amplitude (3.1 Â± 0.1Â°C, n = 47) was only slightly smaller than that of control pups born to mothers maintained in a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. In four litters the acrophases were not much less synchronized than in the four control litters (mean vector lengths 0.79 Â± 0.05 vs. 0.94 Â± 0.04). In two litters synchronization among littermates was not significant. Additional experiments with cross-fostered pups showed that synchronization is not caused by the time of birth. We conclude that synchronization among littermates can develop even when maternal rhythmicity has been suppressed even before conception, possibly because the T(c) decrease of several littermates happening to have similar phases at birth acts as zeitgeber.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of methadone on the biophysical profile. STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen narcotics-dependent gravidas on methadone maintenance were selected for the study. Biophysical profiles and nonstress tests (NSTs) were performed on women between 28 and 40 weeks' estimated gestational are before and two hours after methadone was given. The reactivity of the nonstress tests, biophysical profile scores and time needed to complete the biophysical profile before and after methadone dosing were compared. RESULTS: Significantly more NSTs were nonreactive after methadone (P < .001), and it took more time for the NST to become reactive (P <.01). Although it took longer for the modified biophysical profile to be completed after methadone dosing, with the mean time going from 3.8 to 19.8 minutes (P <.01), the scores were the same before and lifter methadone in 75% of the women, with the mean score not significantly different before or after methadone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the modified biophysical profile is a clinically useful test in the methadone-maintained gravida.

AB  - Ten term infants who were exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy and 10 age- and sex-matched control infants participated in the study. At the age of 48 hours (Â±10), all infants underwent a 150- to 200-minute polygraphic study in a soundproof laboratory. Respiratory and heart rates, distribution of sleep states, and oxygen saturation were comparable in the two groups. The number and length of apneic events were similarly distributed in the two groups. The proportion of obstructive apneic events followed by arousal was significantly higher in the control group especially during quiet sleep (p = 0.001). It appears that exposure to smoking during pregnancy is associated with a higher arousal threshold in term infants. This finding could be of relevance in the assessment of maternal smoking as a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  - We characterised the 24-h arterial pressure (AP) profile and the left ventricular (LV) structures and functions in pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Thirty pregnant women after 20 weeks' gestation - (10 normotensive; 10 with PIH; and 10 with GDM) - were investigated haemodynamically using 24-h AP monitoring and Doppler echocardiography for determination of LV structures and functions, both systolic and diastolic. The PIH women had significantly higher AP determinations throughout the 24 h, with no change in the diurnal variation, ie, nocturnal decline and early morning peaks. The LV mass was greater in PIH and GDM than in the normotensive women, despite normal AP in GDM. The increased LV mass in GDM was mainly due to LV dilatation and not to increased thickness of its walls. In PIH, the increase in AP was due to peripheral vasoconstriction, while cardiac output was preserved. The LV systolic functions did not differ among the three groups. However, a slight reduction in the myocardial contractility was found in PIH and GDM. The LV relaxation was significantly impaired in both PIH and GDM. Thus, GDM and PIH, although differing in their 24-h AP profile, are characterised by LV hypertrophy and reduction in diastolic function.

AB  - Introduction. Infants of mothers who smoke have reduced respiratory function and are more likely to develop wheezing. Little evidence is available on the effect of in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure as opposed to postnatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. We used a previously validated non-invasive method to measure the time to peak tidal expiratory flow (tPTEF) as a proportion of expiratory time (tE) in newborn infants soon after birth to examine the effects of a family history of asthma and in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure on the infants' respiratory function. Methods. We collected respiratory-function data from 500 healthy infants of mothers taking part in the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort Study. During behaviourally defined quiet sleep, measurements were obtained a median of 58 h (range 26-159) after the infants were born. We used uncalibrated inductance plethysmography. The uncalibrated volume signal was differentiated to flow and used to calculate respiratory rate, total inspiratory time, tE, and tPTEF. Mothers answered questionnaires on demographic, medical, and pregnancy characteristics, including smoking history. Serum cotinine measurements were available to validate self-reported smoking history in a subset of mothers (238). Results. Data suitable for analysis were obtained from 461 infants. In multivariate regression analysis, lower values of tPTEF/tE were independently associated with respiratory rate (Î² coefficient per 10 breaths/min 0.018 [SE 0.005], p < 0.01), age (Î² coefficient per 10 h -0.008 [0.003], p < 0.01), maternal smoking during pregnancy (> 10 cigarettes daily; Î² coefficient -0.049 [0.022], p < 0.05), maternal hypertension during pregnancy (-0.037 [0.015], p < 0.02), and a family history of asthma (-0.028 [0.014], p < 0 05). Conclusions. In-utero smoke exposure, a family history of asthma, and maternal hypertension during pregnancy are associated with reduced respiratory function after birth. We speculate that these factors adversely affect lung development in utero.

AB  - The tolerability of the fluoroquinolones is particularly pertinent in the context of widespread prescription of this category of antibiotics. The most frequent adverse events associated with fluoroquinolones involve the digestive tract, the central nervous system, the skin and the musculoskeletal system. In comparison with the nonfluorinated quinolones, some specific adverse events have been described, such as chondrotoxicity, tendinitis of the Achilles' tendon with possible rupture and acute myositis. All of the adverse events associated with fluoroquinolones resolve spontaneously upon treatment discontinuation with the exception of chondrotoxicity and tendinitis, which may be responsible for sequelae. Chondrotoxicity contraindicates the use of fluoroquinolones in children and pregnant women. Further data are required on the long term tolerability of fluoroquinolones in relation to their effects on DNA metabolism. Pefloxacin appears to have a tolerability profile similar to that of ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin; the choice of one of these agents should therefore depend on differences in their pharmacological properties in relation to the clinical needs of individual patients.

AB  - Sleep disorder during the course of pregnancy has been recently recognized in humans. However, the underlying mechanism of pregnancy- associated sleep disorder remains undetermined, and sleep changes even during normal pregnancy have not been fully understood. To describe the effects of pregnancy on sleep, sleep-wake patterns before and after fertile mating were compared in an animal model. Baseline recordings of sleep and brain temperature were made throughout a normal 4-day estrous cycle in female rats. After the rats became pregnant, the recordings continued across the entire pregnant period. Compared with baseline sleep before mating, both non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep increased significantly from the first night of pregnancy. Although rapid eye movement sleep returned to the baseline level from midpregnancy, nocturnal non-rapid eye movement sleep stayed enhanced during the entire pregnant period. Daytime sleep fluctuated toward the end of pregnancy. Brain temperature was elevated during the early period of pregnancy but did not correlate with enhanced sleep. The results suggest that physiological changes in different stages of pregnancy may contribute to the regulation of maternal sleep and temperature.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides a profile of blood pressure (BP) during daily activities and sleep and could uncover the inter-individual variability of BP. The aims of this study were to establish the normal values of the ABPM during the three trimesters of normal pregnancy, and to compare these values with those obtained in the office. ABPM was carried out on 22 normotensive pregnant women. BP values were compared with those obtained in the office. BP during the third trimester was significantly higher than the BP recorded during the first two gestational periods. In the three trimesters of pregnancy mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP were lower than the BP measured in the office in lying and standing positions. On the other hand, mean ambulatory BP (systolic and diastolic) measured during daily activities was not significantly different from the BP measured in the office. Sleeping BP was significantly lower than waking values in all trimesters, while there were not significant differences in the degree of BP fall among the three trimesters. Six women were sequentially studied during the three trimesters of pregnancy and particularly at the 12, 24 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. In these women, a small but significant rise in mean 24 h systolic and diastolic BP was observed at 32 weeks of pregnancy. Sleeping BP was significantly lower than waking values in the three trimesters. No significant difference in the degree of BP fall on the three gestational dates was found. It is concluded that ABPM is a useful tool for the evaluation of BP variability during pregnancy. During normal pregnancy ambulatory BP levels are highest in the day and lowest at night at all gestational ages and increased at the third trimester of pregnancy compared to the values observed during the first two gestational periods.

AB  - Aims. To compare the prevalence of risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in New Zealand (SIDS mortality 3.53/1000) with that in the South West Thames (SWT) region of the United Kingdom (SIDS mortality 1.36/1000). Methods. The methodology of the study was essentially identical in New Zealand and SWT. The subjects in both countries were randomly selected from all births in the study regions. The subjects were randomly allocated an age at which to be interviewed using the same questionnaire in the two study areas. Obstetric records were also examined. Eighteen hundred subjects were selected in New Zealand and 700 subjects in SWT. Results. Younger and unmarried mothers were slightly more common in New Zealand than in SWT. The prevalence of maternal smoking, prone sleeping position and infants' sharing of beds with another person were all higher in New Zealand than SWT, thus increasing the risk of SIDS (maternal smoking in pregnancy: 31.0% vs 23.8% respectively, Ï2 = 11.6, = 0.001; prone sleeping position: 32.9% vs 25.9%, Ï2 = 18.9, &lt; 0.001; bed sharing: 10.5% vs 6.8%, Ï2= 6.0, = 0.14). However, New Zealand infants were breast fed more frequently and for longer than infants in SWT, which would tend to reduce the risk of SIDS in the New Zealand population. In combination the differences in the prevalences of these four risk factors explain only 20% of the excess risk of SIDS in New Zealand. Conclusions. The high SIDS mortality rate in New Zealand is not simply explained by a high prevalence of known and modifiable risk factors for SIDS.

AB  - Diurnal periodicities of cardiorespiratory function were monitored between 144 and 156 days of gestation (term = 175 days) in six chronically instrumented fetal baboons. For each fetus, 5-11 days of electrocardiographic and tracheal fluid pressure data were summarized as hourly means of fetal heart rate (FHR), standard deviation of FHR, breath-to-breath interval (B-B,) and percent time spent in fetal breathing activity (PFB). Summaries were evaluated by cosinor analysis to determine the least squares fit to a 24-h cycle. For all fetuses, FHR had a significant (P < 0.001) diurnal rhythm with peak to nadir fluctuations of 17.4 beats/min around a 24-h mean of 163.2 beats/min. The time of the peak FHR was similar across animals occurring in the mid-day between 10:49 h and 14:45 h. For each fetus, standard deviation of FHR also had a significant (P < 0.01) diurnal periodicity with highest values at night between 20:15 h and 02:04 h. The times of the acrophase for these heart rate parameters were correlated (R = 0.88, P < 0.02) across fetuses. Significant (P < 0.001) 24-h rhythms were found in four of six fetuses for B-B, and five of six for PFB. These PFB rhythms accounted for a fluctuation of 14.4% around a mean of 36.9 Â± 4.5%. In contrast to heart rate, the acrophases of fetal breathing parameters were distributed throughout the entire 24-h cycle and not significantly correlated across fetuses. It is concluded that diurnal rhythms of fetal heart rate, which are synchronized with light/dark conditions in the environment, are evidence for a passive response or entrainment of fetal systems to maternal circadian influences. Alternately, the absence of synchronization across fetuses in daily rhythms of fetal breathing activity provides evidence for a functioning fetal pacemaker, and not simply the imposition of maternal rhythms on her fetus. This differential in the cardiac and breathing activity of the developing primate indicates that pathways for entrainment of fetal pacemaker function are subject to important maturational influences during late gestation.

AB  - Natural family planning (NFP) is a low-cost, user-controlled contraceptive method void of side effects. Couples who choose to rely on NFP must recognize normal physiological changes (e.g., a rise in the woman's temperature and changes in the consistency of the cervical mucus) indicating ovulation so as to avoid sexual intercourse during the fertile period. Couples must be motivated to use NFP if they wish to prevent pregnancy. Physical or emotional factors can alter the signs used to predict fertility, however. They and other factors can reduce NFP's effectiveness. The pregnancy rate is 3% for perfect use of NFP and 20% for typical use. Training in identifying fertility signs and counseling concerning the need for sexual abstinence during the fertile period improve NFP's contraceptive effectiveness. Many physicians do not recommend NFP. About 14% of women worldwide use some form of periodic abstinence. Concerns about NFP include its efficacy under typical-use conditions, particularly when compared with other contraceptive methods; the need for participation and cooperation of both partners; difficulty in using NFP if women have factors that affect fertility symptoms (irregular menses, infections, lack of sleep, alcohol use, emotional stress, and use of some drugs); and no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. There has been the question of whether NFP increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, since some studies have found an association between spontaneous abortion and sperm or eggs that have been in the reproductive tract for a prolonged period and are at the end of their life span. Recent studies do not indicate an association between NFP and spontaneous abortion, however. Effective NFP training takes about 3 months. Non-medical personnel can effectively teach NFP. In a European study, many women using NFP use a barrier method during the fertile period. New technologies and ways of identifying fertility signs are being developed. Ovulation detection kits tend to revolve around measuring the body temperature or the levels of luteinizing hormone or other hormones in urine.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine resting body temperature (BT) and heart rate (HR) of healthy pregnant women in Japan and the United States, and if differences exist, to examine if fetal HR and fetal behavior also vary between the groups. Methods: A convenience sample (n = 49) was applied to the study with a cross-sectional design at two data sites (the Kansai region of Japan and the Midwest region of the United States) involving three subgroups, namely Japanese, African-American, and European-American. Healthy volunteers at late gestation (37.2 Â± 1.0 weeks; mean Â± SD) were recruited. Subjects sat quietly for 30 min in a controlled environment before the data collection began. Maternal BT was measured multiple times by an infrared thermometer, and HR was measured at the radial pulse for 30 s. Both measurements were repeated at 10-min intervals. Fetal heart rate (FHR) and fetal behavior were measured continuously for 60 min by a fetal actocardiograph. Results: Significant differences in BT among the three groups were evident. The mean BT and HR of Japanese participants were significantly lower (35.7 Â± 0.5Â°C; 72.1 Â± 6.3 beats/min) than those in their other groups (36.8 Â± 0.6Â°C; 86.2 Â± 11.4 bpm for African-Americans and 36.7 Â± 0.9Â°C; 80.9 Â± 11.1 bpm for European-Americans) (P < 0.05, ANOVA). The mean FHR of European-Americans and was significantly lower (129 Â± 3.5 bpm) than those in the other groups (138 Â± 8.0 bpm for African-Americans and 135 Â± 9.5 bpm for Japanese) (P < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA)). European-American fetuses also spent significantly more time in the active sleep phase (P < 0.05, Tukey-HSD). Maternal HR correlated with FHR (r = 0.33; P = 0.01) and with maternal BT (r = 0.27; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Different populations present different normal resting physiological conditions. Given the difference among populations studied, FHR correlates with maternal HR and BT but not with birth weight.

AB  - Ante- and postpartum noninvasive 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurements were performed in 18 normotensive pregnant and 36 patients with mild (n = 16) or severe preeclampsia (n = 12) or HELLP-syndrome (n = 8). In contrast to normotensive pregnancy (n = 18) displaying a decline of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in comparison with normotensive nonpregnant, preeclamptic women demonstrate significantly elevated blood pressure profiles before delivery that remain elevated up to the eighth week postpartum. 9 out of 12 patients with severe preeclampsia and 6 of 8 women with HELLP-syndrome show a nocturnal increase of blood pressure within the first week postpartum and a non-dipping up to the eighth week after delivery. As a result of this, in preeclamptic women blood pressure control should be extended into the night and antihypertensive therapy should include a sufficient evening dose.

AB  - Our purpose was to investigate an effect of prolonged intravenous ritodrine tocolysis on maternal carbohydrate metabolism in women with normal glucose tolerance. In patients with preterm labor, diurnal plasma glucose levels were measured both during the 24 hours after beginning the therapy (phase 1) and each day during over five days of continuous ritodrine tocolysis (phase 2). We also measured diurnal plasma glucose levels in normal pregnant women without any therapy (control group). In phase 1, comparison with before therapy, a significant increase in the plasma glucose levels was observed with the highest level at 9 hours after starting ritodrine (146.4 Â± 31.6 mg/dl). The higher plasma glucose levels persisted during phase 1. Although infusion rates were similar in both phases, maternal plasma glucose levels in phase 1 were significantly higher than in phase 2 (mean plasma glucose level, 128.1 Â± 21.3 mg/dl vs. 92.7 Â± 11.6 mg/dl, p < 0.05; maximum plasma glucose level, 159.5 Â± 25.2 mg/dl vs. 106.6 Â± 14.5 mg/dl, p < 0.05). Diurnal glucose levels in phase 2 were similar to those in the control group. In phase 1, there seemed to be a dose-dependent relation between the ritodrine infusion rates and plasma glucose levels, but we did not find any relationship between them in phase 2. In conclusion, although hyperglycemia occurs during the initial phase of continuous ritodrine therapy (at least 24 hours), prolonged ritodrine leads to normalization of the maternal plasma glucose levels.

AB  - Objective - To investigate the role of sleeping arrangements as risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome after a national risk reduction campaign. Design - Two year population based case-control study. Parental interviews were conducted for each infant who died and for four controls matched for age and date of interview. Setting - Three regions in England with a total population of 17 million people. Subjects - 195 babies who died and 780 matched controls. Results - Prone and side sleeping positions both carried increased risks of death compared with supine when adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestation, birth weight, exposure to smoke, and other relevant factors in the sleeping environment (multivariate odds ratio = 9.00 (95% confidence interval 2.84 to 28.47) and 1.84 (1.02 to 3.31), respectively). The higher incidence of side rather than prone sleeping led to a higher population attributable risk (side 18.4%, prone 14.2%). More of the infants who died were found with bed covers over their heads (21.58; 6.21 to 74.99). The use of a dummy had an apparent protective effect (0.38; 0.21 to 0.70). Bed sharing for the whole night was a significant risk factor for infants whose mothers smoked (9.25; 2.31 to 34.02). No protective effect of breast feeding could be identified on multivariate analysis. Conclusions - This study confirms the importance of certain risk factors for the sudden infant death syndrome and identifies others - for example, covers over the head, side sleeping position - which may be amenable to change by educating and informing parents and health care professionals.

AB  - Using Fos immunohistochemistry as a marker of cellular activity, we have shown that neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of fetal sheep are active by 75 days gestation. From at least 90 days gestation (term is 146 days), these neurons are more active during the day (12.00) than at night (03.00) when pregnant ewes are exposed to a 12-h light-dark cycle with lights on at 07.00. The day-night difference in Fos immunoreactivity persisted when the lighting schedule was extended by 8 h to 03.00, although neurons were now more active at 03.00 than they were in fetuses maintained on the normal difference in Fos immunoreactivity in the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus was abolished, suggesting that diurnal activity of the fetal suprachiasmatic nucleus is maintained by a signal related to the external lighting regime. In a twin pregnancy where one fetus was optically enucleated at 100 days gestation, the density of Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus during the day at 138 days was similar to the unoperated twin. This suggests that the effects of dim light in the uterus on the fetal retina do not account for the high level of Fos immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the daytime. We propose that a chemical messenger of maternal origin, possibly melatonin, suppresses the activity of fetal suprachiasmatic neurons during the night, and that fetal suprachiasmatic neurons have endogenous activity which is expressed fully during the daytime.

AB  - General pharmacological effects of recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were investigated. 1. Central nervous system: Basic FGF produced almost no effect on the general symptoms and behaviors of mice. Basic FGF did not influence the spontaneous motor activity, hexobarbital-induced anesthesia, electroshock seizure threshold, pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure in mice and normal body temperature and spinal reflex in rats up to a dose of 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). As regards pain sensation, it inhibited the acetic acid-induced writhing at 1 mg/kg (s.c.). No abnormal waves were observed in spontaneous EEG of the rabbit up to 1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF, but at 0.1 mg/kg it had a slight effect on the ratio of EEG levels and at 1 mg/kg induced an increase in rest period, disappearance in the period of fast wave sleep and a decrease in the period of deep sleep. 2. Somatic nervous system: Basic FGF did not influence the corneal reflex, twitch response of the skin and diaphragm-phrenic nerve preparations. 3. Autonomic nervous system and smooth muscle: Basic FGF showed little effects on the spontaneous movement of the isolated ileum, contraction induced by various agonists in isolated ileum, resting tension and noradrenaline(NA)-induced contraction of the aorta, resting tension and histamine-induced contraction of isolated trachea, spontaneous movement and 5-HT-induced contraction of isolated strips of stomach fundus, NA-induced contraction of isolated vas deferens of the rat up to the concentration of 10-4 g/ml. Basic FGF augmented the tone of the isolated non-pregnant uterus at the concentrations of 10-5 g/ml and above and inhibited or tended to inhibit the contractile tension of non-pregnant or pregnant uterus at 10-4 g/ml, but it did not influence the spontaneous movement of the uterus, either the nonpregnant or pregnant, under in situ conditions even at a dose of 1 mg/kg (i.v.). Basic FGF did not influence the pupil size. 4. Respiratory and circulatory systems: Basic FGF had no effect on the isolated heart. The influence was not exerted on the heart rate for the isolated atria but slight inhibition of contractile force was observed at 10-4 g/ml. In anesthetized dogs a decrease in blood pressure, a slight increase in heart rate and respiratory rate and a decrease in femoral blood flow were observed at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.) of bFGF. Similarly, a slight increase in heart rate and a slight decrease of blood pressure were observed at 1 mg/kg (s.c.) in conscious rats. 5. Digestive system: Administration of bFGF at 1 mg/kg did not result in changes in the transport capacity within the gastrointestinal tract (s.c., i.v.) and the secretion of the gastric juice (s.c.). 6. Urine output and electrolyte metabolism: Basic FGF produced a decrease in urinary Na+ excretion at 1 mg/kg (s.c.), and showed a tendency to increase in urinary volume at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.). At 1 mg/kg (i.v.) urinary excretion of Na+ and Cl- was decreased significantly. It had no effect on the ability of rats to excrete PSP (phenol red) up to 1 mg/kg (s.c.). 7. Blood system: Basic FGF did not influence the coagulation time of the whole blood, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time of rats up to 1 mg/kg (s.c., i.v.). It did not influence the aggregation of rabbit platelets induced by collagen and ADP up to 10-4 g/ml. Basic FGF at concentration of 10-4 g/ml exhibited no hemolytic action. 8. Local action: Plantar subcutaneous injection of bFGF at above 0.005 mg/site induced edema by itself on and after the next day, and also reinforced carrageenin-induced edema from 1 day after injection. The results show that bFGF did not produce any acute effects on the somatic nervous system, autonomic nervous system, smooth muscle and blood system. In contrast, bFGF produced slight effects on the circulatory system, central nervous system and kidney function when injected systemically. Subcutaneous administration may produce edema at the site of injection.

AB  - The German Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics has published standards for obstetrical services concerning equipment, personnel and organisation. All obstetrical services must be able to perform an emergency Caesarean section with a 20 minutes interval from decision to delivery (D-D time). This study represents an analysis of the 75 emergency Caesarean sections performed at the University hospital Grosshadern of Munich during the interval from 1987 to 1994. This being a level III hospital, there is a 24 hour obstetrical, anaesthesia and neonatal service, and personnel is readily available. The operation can and has been done in each delivery room. 1. The incidence of emergency Caesarean sections was 0.6% compared to a total Caesarean rate of 21.5% in a high risk population having a preterm rate of 19% during the period of the study. 55% of the patients who had emergency Caesarean sections presented with a gestational age of less than 37 weeks and 35% of less than 32 weeks. 2. The mean time elapsed between decision and delivery (D-D time) was 12.8 minutes; however, the 90 percentile was 22 minutes and exceeded the recommended D-D time of 20 minutes. The mean decision to incision interval represented 9.1 minutes, and 3.6 minutes were needed between incision and delivery. 3. There was a significantly higher frequency of emergency Caesarean sections, performed during daytime and evening hours compared to early morning (0-8 a.m.). However, the D-D time intervals examined for these three time periods showed only minor, non-significant differences. In conclusion, an efficient emergency Caesarean delivery requires a coordinated team effort with excellent cooperation between obstetrics, anaesthesia and neonatology. Our study demonstrates that even in this optimal setting a decision to delivery time within the 20-minute interval can not always be achieved. Based upon our results and other studies, we recommend a D-D time of 30 minutes.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea is a common medical condition characterized by periodic apneas during sleep that produce hypoxia and sleep disruption. Several cases of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy have been reported. In the case reported the woman admitted for evaluation and management of preeclampsia was observed experiencing apneic episodes and oxygen desaturation during sleep. Subsequent evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Pregnancy may be complicated by obstructive sleep apnea with potential adverse effects on the mother and fetus. Prompt diagnosis would allow early treatment and may prevent low birth weight and the development of preeclampsia.

AB  - Eight time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation (145 days = term) underwent surgery for placement of fetal vascular catheters, electrodes for recording fetal behavioural state, and maternal venous catheters. Three days later, fetal cerebral and myocardial blood flow were determined by the coloured microsphere technique under four conditions: (1) during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, before fetal cocaine infusion, (2) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion to the fetus at 0.2 mg/kg per min, (3) during REM sleep, before maternal cocaine infusion, and (4) 30 min after initiation of a cocaine infusion to the ewe at 0.3 mg/kg per min. Cocaine infusion directly to the fetal lamb did not cause hypoxaemia or significantly change cerebral or myocardial blood flow or oxygen delivery. Cocaine administered to the ewe led to a drop in fetal oxygen tension from 3.0 Â± 0.5 to 2.5 Â± 0.3 kPa (P &lt; 0.0001) and in fetal oxygen content from 3.8 Â± 0.7 to 2.8 Â± 0.4 mmol O2/L (P &lt; 0.0001). Prior to maternal cocaine administration, fetal cerebral blood flow was 146 Â± 103 mL/100 g per min and during maternal cocaine infusion it went to 184 Â± 147 mt/100 g per min (P = NS) while myocardial blood flow increased from 156 Â± 92 to 333 Â± 178 mt/100 g per min (P &lt; 0.002). This increase in blood flow negated the effects of hypoxaemia so that cerebral oxygen delivery was unaffected while myocardial oxygen delivery increased an average of 67%. It is concluded that cocaine administration to pregnant sheep does not impede fetal cerebral or myocardial oxygen delivery.

AB  - Objective. To verify and determine the cause of an increase in the referral of infants with plagiocephaly without synostosis (PWS) to a single tertiary craniofacial center. Design. A chart review was performed for 269 infants with a diagnosis of PWS who presented to a single tertiary craniofacial center between 1979 and 1994. The pattern of referral for PWS was analyzed using both simple linear regression and time series regression analyses. In addition, the referral pattern for PWS was compared with that for infants seen at the same center who received a diagnosis of synostotic plagiocephaly. Changes in the distribution of several demographic, perinatal, and clinical variables during the study period were also assessed. Finally, in an effort to identify correlates of the risk of PWS developing, characteristics of patients who were Missouri residents and presented between 1992 and 1994 were evaluated and compared with those of the 1993 Missouri live birth cohort. Setting. The Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Deformities Institute, St Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University Medical Center. Results. The average annual number of referrals to our center for PWS in the period 1992 to 1994 was more than sixfold greater than that for the preceding 13 years. There was a statistically significant increase in the annual number of referrals to our center during the 16-year study period. Moreover, there was evidence that the average annual increase in referrals was significantly greater during the last 3 years (1992 through 1994) of the study than in the first 13 years. This shift in the referral patterns is roughly contemporaneous with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations regarding infant sleep position. There was no evidence that either the mean number of referrals or the average annual increase in referrals for patients with synostosis changed during the study period. Among patients with PWS, the average age at presentation did not change during the study period. There were also no significant changes in the distribution of other demographic, perinatal, and clinical variables. When compared with the Missouri birth cohort, infants with PWS were significantly more likely to be boys and to have been delivered by forceps. There was also some evidence that patients with PWS were more likely to be born prematurely and to be products of multiple-gestation pregnancies. These associations were, however, of only borderline statistical significance. Conclusion. Referrals to our center for PWS increased markedly in 1992 relative to previous years. The temporal coincidence of this increase with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to avoid the prone sleeping position, to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, suggests a possible causal relationship. If this association is causal, education regarding the need for head position rotation coupled with that for sudden infant death syndrome should obviate positional PWS.

AB  - Objective. Prematurity has been associated with prenatal cocaine exposure, but most studies on the behavioral effects of prenatal cocaine exposure have been restricted to full-term infant samples. The current study focused on behavioral and hormonal responses in preterm cocaine-exposed infants compared with a cohort of non-cocaine-exposed infants of similar gestational age. Methodology. A comparison between 30 cocaine-exposed and 30 non-cocaine- exposed preterm neonates suggested that the cocaine-exposed neonates were born to mothers who had higher parity and more obstetric complications. In addition, mothers of cocaine-exposed preterm neonates visited, touched, held, and fed their infants less frequently than mothers of nonexposed infants. Results. The cocaine-exposed infants had smaller head circumferences at birth, spent more time in the neonatal intensive care unit, and had a greater incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhages. They also had inferior Brazelton cluster scores, including lower state regulation and range-of-state scores, and greater depression. During sleep-wake behavior observations, they showed difficulty maintaining alert states and self- regulating their behavior, and they spent more time in indeterminate sleep and had decreased periods of quiet sleep and increased levels of agitated behavior, including tremulousness, mouthing, multiple limb movements, and clenched fists. Finally, higher urinary norepinephrine, dopamine, and cortisol levels and lower plasma insulin levels were noted in the cocaine- exposed preterm neonates. Conclusions. These findings highlight the need for follow-up assessments and early intervention.

AB  - The twice-daily surges of prolactin (PRL) present during the first half of pregnancy abruptly terminate at midpregnancy concurrent with the appearance of high levels of placental lactogen-I (PL-I) in the blood. This study addressed the role PL-I and other pituitary or placental hormones have in terminating PRL surges in pregnant rats. Implantation of rat PL-I (rPL-I) or ovine PRL into the arcuate-median eminence area of the hypothalamus of day 7 pregnant rats totally eliminated nocturnal PRL surges on days 8 and 9. To assess the specificity of the inhibitory effects of hormones from the PRL-growth hormone (GH) family, rat growth hormone (rGH), human growth hormone (hGH), and rat prolactin-like protein-A (PLP-A) were tested. Only the lactogenic hormone, hGH, had any effect. Since lactogenic hormones may inhibit PRL by stimulation of dopamine synthesis and release into the hypophysial portal blood vessels leading to the anterior pituitary, the effect of these hormones on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine activity, was determined. In pregnant rats, both ovine prolactin (oPRL) and hGH significantly increased (64%) TH activity, whereas rPL-I was less effective. In ovariectomized, bromocriptine-treated rats, both rPL-I and oPRL increased TH activity 207 and 151%, respectively. This supports the concept that termination of PRL surges at midpregnancy are owing to secretion of placental lactogens (PLs) from the placenta. However, the mechanism for the inhibition cannot be entirely attributed to an increase in tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neuronal activity.

AB  - The role of glucocorticoids in the intrauterine programming of hypertension was assessed in the progeny of rats fed either 18 g casein/100 g diet (control diet) or 9 g casein/100 g diet (low protein diet), before conception and throughout pregnancy. Rats exposed to the low protein diet had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher systolic blood pressures than control animals, when weaned. These rats had elevated brain and liver activities of specific glucocorticoid-inducible marker enzymes, relative to controls. Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was also higher (377%) in whole brains of newborn rats exposed to low protein diet in utero, but no similar effect of corticosteroids was noted in brains of d 20 fetuses. Weanling rats of the low protein group exhibited a blunted diurnal pattern of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) concentrations in plasma. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were unaltered by prenatal dietary experience and exhibited a normal pattern of diurnal variation. Brain regional 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities were unaltered by prenatal dietary experience, as was binding of 3H-corticosterone to type I glucocorticoid receptors in hippocampus, hypothalamus and liver. Type II glucocorticoid receptor binding capacity and receptor numbers in male rats were apparently elevated in hippocampus of low protein-exposed rats and were significantly lower in liver (P &lt; 0.05), relative to control rats. Programming of the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis is inferred, and the observation that binding of steroid to type II receptor sites in vascular tissue is increased in low protein exposed rats may provide a direct mechanism for modulation of blood pressure by glucocorticoids in this model.

AB  - Comparison of 1 mg Gemeprost-Vaginal Suppositories Serial Application versus Sulproston i.v.: Three different regimens for the termination of second and third trimester pregnancies by the use of prostaglandins (PG) were compared in a retrospective analysis. In group A (n = 16) terminations were attempted by continuous i.v. infusion of Sulproston 9 hours after administration of a 3 mg-PGE2-vaginal tablet overnight. In group B (n = 22), i.v. Sulproston was started 2 hours after priming with 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories. The outcome of these two regimens was compared with that of repeated administration of 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 6-hourly intervals (group C, n = 25). In each group, if uterine contractions failed to appear after one day, the treatment was discontinued for a sleep rest over night and then resumed. Genetic disorders or fetal malformations were the most frequent reasons for termination. Patients with intrauterine fetal demise, rupture of the membranes, preterm labour or a ripe cervix (Bishop Score &gt; 3) were excluded. Median time intervals from induction to abortion were 33 hours in group A and 23 hours in each Group B and C. The rate of fetal expulsions within 12, 24 and 36 hours in groups B and C were similar. Women of parity â¥ 1 showed significantly shorter intervals than nulliparae in groups A and C. Only one woman (in group A) failed to expel after induction, in four other cases (in groups A and B) complications (local thrombophlebitis, bronchospasm) were noted. The serial administration of 1 mg Gemeprost-vaginal suppositories at 6-hourly intervals showed fewer side effects and seems to be as efficient as sulproston i.v. after cervical ripening.

AB  - The emergence of melatonin rhythmicity was studied in 163 infants between 46-55 weeks postconception by monitoring the excretion of the urinary melatonin metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT.6S). From this population, we examined the effects of gender, season, multiple birth, home birth, previous sudden infant death syndrome in the family, premature labor, spontaneous rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and nursery lighting on pineal rhythmicity. As previously reported, rhythmic excretion of aMT.6S appeared between 49-55 weeks postconception (9-15 weeks of age) in singleton babies born at term in the hospital. Full-term infants who had a sibling die of sudden infant death syndrome had a pattern of melatonin rhythm development no different from that of the control full-term infants. In contrast, full-term infants born at home and full-term twins born in the hospital had significantly lower aMT.6S excretion than hospital-born singleton infants at the same ages despite similar body weights (e.g. at 52 weeks postconception; 1.8 Â± 0.4, 1.1 Â± 0.3, and 3.6 Â± 0.5 nmol/day, respectively). In full-term infants, there was no difference in the development of melatonin rhythmicity between the sexes, with season or method of delivery (vaginal vs. caesarean). The premature infants were divided into 5 groups (babies born after premature labor, premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and fetal distress). All premature infants had a delay in the appearance of aMT.6S rhythms in the urine in relation to chronological age. When the infants were compared on the basis of weeks since conception, those infants born after spontaneous premature labor excreted amounts of aMT.6S no different from those of full- term singleton infants during the period of study. In contrast, the premature rupture of membranes, preeclampsia, and fetal distressed infants excreted 50% less aMT.6S, and intrauterine growth restricted infants excreted 67% less at the same postconceptional ages. These differences were due to reduced nocturnal excretion of the metabolite. In an attempt to accelerate the development of melatonin rhythmicity, premature labor and premature rupture of membranes infants were randomly assigned to be totally deprived of light (using phototherapy eye shields) or partially deprived of light by moving them to a dimly lit room each night for the last 3-8 weeks of their stay in the hospital nursery. Babies born after premature labor produced normal amounts of aMT.6S between 46-52 weeks postconception, and this pattern was not affected by the nocturnal light deprivation. Infants born after premature rupture of membranes and totally deprived of light at night had aMT.6S excretion rhythms at 52 weeks postconception no different from those of full- term hospital-born infants or premature labor infants, whereas those in infants placed in dim light were similar to those in untreated premature rupture of membranes infants. These results suggest that premature birth alone is not the sole cause of altered rhythm development; other factors, such as preeclampsia, growth restriction, and nursery lighting, play an important role. The consequences of the delayed appearance of melatonin in infants are not known, but deserve further study.

AB  - The circadian rhythms of fetal and neonatal rodents are entrained by their mother. This entrainment is dependent upon the maternal suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but the mechanism of entrainment is unknown. Administration of the pineal hormone melatonin to pregnant, SCN-lesioned female Syrian hamsters entrains the activity rhythms of their hamster pups. The aim of this study was to determine whether melatonin injected directly in neonatal Syrian hamsters is able to entrain circadian rhythms and, if so, for how long this effect persists during development. Injection of melatonin in two groups of hamster pups at opposite phases on postnatal days 1-5 entrained the onset of activity rhythms on the day of weaning to two phases 10.67 h apart. Melatonin injection did not entrain activity rhythms to opposite phases on either postnatal days 6-10 or 21-25. Vehicle injection did not entrain animals to opposite phases at any of the ages studied. These results demonstrate that melatonin is able to act directly on the neonate to cause entrainment and that this effect disappears after postnatal day 6.

AB  - Objectives: To study the pharmacokinetics of theophylline and its correlations to pharmacodynamic effects in apnea of prematurity in small for gestational age babies. Design: Prospective case control study. Setting: Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Subjects: Ten small for gestational age (SGA) babies and 10 gestation matched appropriate for gestational age (AGA) babies with recurrent apnea of prematurity. Methods: All babies were investigated to exclude secondary causes of apnea. 5 mg/kg of aminophylline loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg as maintenance dose every 8 hourly intravenously was used. The trough and peak levels of theophylline were assessed on different days of therapy. Clinical monitoring was done for the efficacy and toxicity of the drug. Analysis was done using unpaired Student's 't' test and the correlation between plasma theophylline levels of different days was performed by using ANOVA. Results: The therapeutic drug levels were achieved within 24 hours in all babies. The SGA babies showed 25% higher drug levels as compared to AGA babies. The mean trough plasma theophylline levels ranged from 8.15 Â± 1.59 to 12.37 Â± 1.54 Î¼g/ml in SGA babies while in AGA babies they ranged from 6.26 Â± 1.93 to 9.96 Â± 1.96 Î¼g/ml in first 8 days of therapy. The mean peak levels in SGA babies ranged from 11.91 Â± 1.84 to 17.13 Â± 1.63 Î¼g/ml and in AGA babies ranged from 8.17 Â± 1.84 to 13.02 Â± 1.48 Î¼g/ml. Twenty per cent SGA and AGA babies each developed clinical toxicity through toxic drug levels were found in 50% SGA and 30% AGA babies. Conclusion: There is need to modify dosage schedule for these babies.

AB  - Shift work has been associated with various unfavorable pregnancy outcomes (ie, pregnancy loss, spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, etc). The suggested underlying mechanism is the interference of shift work with the circadian regulation of human metabolism and, in particular, with the temporal pattern of endocrine function. To analyze the effect of shift work on fecundity, the Time of Unprotected Intercourses (TUI) has been measured in couples recruited in the European Studies on Infertility and Subfecundity, which were undertaken in seven European countries. A low (odds ratio < 2.0) but consistent excess risk of subfecundity (TUI â¥ 9.4 months) has been observed both in a representative sample of the general population of women in reproductive age and in a sample of pregnant women or women who had just given birth. The excess risk was also consistently evident both in the subsample of the first pregnancies and in the subsample of the most recent pregnancies. Only the exposure of women to shift work seemed to affect a couple's fecundity; men working shift work did not modify the fecundity pattern of their own couples. No specific job title among shift workers concentrated the risk of subfecundity. No association of menstrual disorders with shift work was identified. Even though residual confounding could partly account for the results and the fact that a plausible biological explanation of the claimed effect is still lacking, data from this study are in favor of an association between shift work and prolonged waiting time to pregnancy.

AB  - In contrast to results from previous research, a surge of progesterone (P4) on the afternoon of proestrus was consistently detected in Djungarian hamster females. However, the timing of maximal P4 levels varied from 1200 to 1900 h across females; this impeded detection of the surge in earlier studies. No role for P4 in the induction of behavioral receptivity was found. Behavioral receptivity was induced in ovariectomized females with physiological levels of estradiol typical of an estrous cycle (60-180 pg/ml). P4 did, however, terminate receptive behavior within 48 h. Prolactin (PRL) was present at surge levels on each day of the cycle except diestrus 1, during which PRL remained at basal levels in all females. This pattern distinguishes the Djungarian hamster from the rat and mouse, which have PRL surges only on the afternoon of proestrus, and the golden hamster, which has a PRL surge on each of the 4 days of the estrous cycle. Diestrus 1, with P4 high and PRL low, was clearly distinct from Day 2 of Djungarian hamster pregnancy, during which P4 is low and PRL is surging. Therefore, postcoital P4 levels change within 34 h and before rescue of the corpus luteum. As Day 2 of pregnancy is also the most sensitive time for a mate-removal pregnancy- blocking response in P. campbelli, this hormonal profile may be associated with sensitivity to those stimuli.

AB  - We report the clinical features in 27 Australasian patients with Angelman syndrome (AS), all with a DNA deletion involving chromosome 15(q11-13), spanning markers from D15S9 to D15S12, about 3.5 Mb of DNA. There were nine males and 18 females. All cases were sporadic. The mean age at last review (end of 1994) was 11.2 years (range 3 to 34 years). All patients were ataxic, severely retarded, and lacking recognisable speech. In all patients, head circumference (HC) at birth was normal but skewed in distribution, with 62.5% at the 10th centile. At last review HC was around the 50th centile in three patients (12.5%) while 15 had poor postnatal head growth. Short stature was not invariable, 5/26 (19%) were on or above the 50th centile. Hypotonia at birth was recorded in 15/24 (63%) and neonatal feeding difficulties were recorded in 20/26 (77%). Epilepsy was present in 26/27 (96%) with onset by the third year of Life in 20 patients (83%). Improvement in epilepsy was reported in 11/16 patients (69%) with age. An abnormal EEG was reported in 25/25 patients. Hypopigmentation was present in 19/26 (73%). One patient had oculocutaneous albinism. Five patients could not walk independently. Of the remaining 22 who could walk, age of onset of walking ranged from 2 to 8 years. Disrupted sleep patterns were present in 18/21 patients (86%), with improvement in 9/12 patients (75%) over 10 years of age. The clinical features in this group of deletional AS patients were similar to previous reports, but these have not separated patients into subgroups based on DNA studies. In our group of deletional cases, 100% showed severe mental retardation, ataxic movements, absent language, abnormal EEG, happy disposition (noted in infancy in 95%), normal birth weight and head circumference at birth, and a large, wide mouth. These features occurred with a higher frequency than in AS patients as a whole. Our study also provided information on the evolution of the phenotype. The data can act as a benchmark for comparisons of AS resulting from other genetic mechanisms.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the sleep-wake patterns of fullterm (â¥ 37 weeks) newborns and to evaluate the effects of specific factors including maternal gestational diabetes, infant size and anthropometric measures, gender, gestational age and delivery variables. Methods: Two-hundred twenty newborns were studied in the hospital nursery for a continuous 24-h period with miniature activity monitors attached to the infants' ankles. The sample consisted of 102 infants of gestational diabetic mothers (IGDM) and 118 controls. Anthropometric measurements were obtained and maternal and infant characteristics were recorded. Results: The newborns had a discernible diurnal sleep pattern and slept twice as much during the nighttime as daytime hours (P < 0.001). Higher skinfold measurements correlated significantly with increased quiet and motionless sleep (P < 0.05) for the IGDM but not for controls. Sleep of infants born at later gestational ages was characterized by increased percent of quiet and motionless sleep (P < 0.0001). No direct gender effects were identified. Conclusions: Multiple factors were associated with the sleep-wake patterns of the newborns on our study cohort including maternal glucose values during pregnancy, increased measures of adiposity in IGDM, increased gestational age, mode of delivery and delivery Sequence. Investigation of the sleep-wake characteristics of neonates using activity monitors is a noninvasive method for gaining new understanding of the relationships between sleep wake activity patterns and infant characteristics.

AB  - Purpose. To investigate the maturation of the visual pathways in premature infants using flash visual evoked potentials VEPs) and to examine the influence of flash intensity, sleep state and gestational age on the resulting VEP wave form. Methods. Thirty-three healthy preterm neonates (gestational age 28-35 weeks, mean 32.8 weeks) were assessed using flash VEPs within 5 days from birth and term age. Binocular VEPs were recorded from Oz and referenced to Fz using Grass intensities 2 and 8. Sleep states were monitored for each VEP recording by assessing eye, body and facial movements. Results. At the preterm visit, the most consistent finding was a large negative peak (N3) at approximately 300ms from stimulus onset. N3 was invariant with both sleep state and flash intensity (p>0.1). At term age an additional component, a positive peak (P2) was present at approximately 200ms. The latency of P2 at term was significantly shorter in alert infants compared to those asleep (p<0.001) and its amplitude increased with an increase in flash intensity (p<0.01 repeat measures of ANOVA). When present at birth, the P2 was significantly later and smaller on comparison with the term P2. The N3 was also considerably shorter at term (p<0.001). Conclusion. Prior to term age, major maturational changes occur in the flash VEP wave form. The VEP of the preterm infant prior to 35 weeks gestation is relatively immature and is not significantly affected by sleep state or light intensity. By term age the VEP has matured significantly, the latency of N3 has reduced and a positivity emerged at 200ms. The latency and amplitude of P2 appear to reflect alertness and stimulus intensity respectively.

AB  - Restless legs syndrome is characterized by unpleasant, deep-seated paresthesias in the legs and sometimes the arms. These sensations occur at rest and are relieved by movement. Sleep disturbance is common. Many patients also have periodic movements of sleep. Mild symptoms of restless legs occur in up to 5% of the population. Restless legs syndrome is idiopathic in most patients, but it may be the presenting feature of iron deficiency and is also common in uremia, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and polyneuropathy. Treatment of the underlying cause, when possible, usually relieves the symptoms. For patients with severe symptoms, levodopa, bromocriptine mesylate, opioids, carbamazepine, clonazepam, and clonidine hydrochloride have proved to be effective.

AB  - Thyroid hormone production is regulated via pituitary thyrotropin (TSH) modulation of thyroxine (T4) prohormone secretion by the thyroid gland and regulation of active triiodothyronine (T3) production in peripheral tissues via metabolic events influencing activities of the iodothyronine monodeiodinase enzyme systems. Control at both levels is developmentally regulated and modified in serious nonthyroidal illness (trauma, infection, cancer, metabolic diseases). Racial and gender differences are of little significance except for the effects of placental estrogens and thorionic gonadotropin during pregnancy. There is a circadian rhythm of TSH secretion, with peak values at the onset of sleep and nadir concentrations during the afternoon hours. Peak and nadir concentrations differ by ~Â±50%. The effect on circulating T4 and T3 concentrations is not significant because of the large size of the extrathyroidal T4 pool. In healthy subjects there is no significant impact of body weight, physical training, body habitus, posture, immobilization, exercise, or ambulatory status on thyroid function, and no significant geographic environmental variation. Nutrition also has a minimal impact except for variation in iodine intake. Subthreshold concentrations of iodine intake are associated with increased TSH secretion, goiter, increased thyroid iodine uptake, decreased T4 production, an increased T3/T4 secretion ratio, and an increased ratio of circulating T3/T4 concentrations. Excessive iodine intake can block thyroid hormone biosynthesis by inhibiting the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic process, resulting in reduced T4 secretion, increased TSH concentrations, goiter, and hypothyroidism if the iodine excess is chronic.

AB  - Objectives: To describe average levels of free-living energy expenditure in people from affluent societies and to determine the influence of body weight, height, age and sex. Design: Analysis of 574 measurements of total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by the doubly-labelled water method); basal metabolic rate (BMR, directly measured or derived from similar directly measured proxy measures such as during sleep); activity energy expenditure (AEE, derived as TEE - BMR); and physical activity level (PAL, derived as TEE/BMR) from people aged 2-95 years. The dataset was extracted from 1614 published and unpublished measurements in 1156 subjects after exclusion of repeat estimates and subjects in special physiological or behavioural states (eg pregnancy, athletic or military training etc). Results: A separate analysis of data from non-ambulant subjects, and from elite endurance athletes (all excluded from the main dataset) established the limits of human daily energy expenditure at around 1.2 Ã BMR and 4.5 Ã BMR. In the main analysis, the validity of PAL as an index of TEE adjusted for BMR was tested and confirmed. Regression equations were then derived to describe TEE, BMR, AEE and PAL in terms of body weight, height, age and sex. As anticipated, TEE, BMR and AEE were all positively related to weight and height, while age was a negative predictor, especially of activity. The influence of weight disappeared when TEE was expressed as PAL, but height and age remained as highly significant predictors. For all three components, females expended 11% less energy on average than males after adjustment for weight, height and age. Average levels of energy expenditure in different age and sex groups are tabulated. Conclusions: There now exists a large and robust database of energy expenditure measurements obtained by the doubly-labelled water method. Analysis of the data from affluent societies shows that, in general, levels of energy expenditure are similar to the recommendations for energy requirements adopted by FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) and UK Department of Health (1991). PAL values for active subjects tend to be higher than is currently assumed. The current analysis provides a substantial body of normal data against which other estimates can be compared.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in sleep patterns during pregnancy to better understand sleep regulation during pregnancy. We uninterruptedly recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and brain temperature (Tbr) throughout pregnancy in rats. The duration of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep decreased after day 5 of pregnancy associated with an inverse increase in the number of non-REM sleep episodes. Thus, the amount of total non-REM sleep time remained constant throughout pregnancy. The amount of total REM sleep time decreased on day 17 of pregnancy after which the reduced state was sustained. That was mainly due to a decrease in the number of REM sleep episodes. Brain temperature (Tbr) gradually decreased as pregnancy advanced, reaching its lowest value 3 days before delivery. These observations provide a better understanding of the sleep patterns during pregnancy, and useful information for investigation of mechanisms of sleep regulation during pregnancy.

AB  - To elucidate the mechanism of the resting-active cycles (RAC) of fetal heart rates (FHR), in the resting and non-resting phases (RP and NRP), 24-h FHR recordings were made on 16 normal full-term pregnant women. RP, NRP, RAC-1 (NRP-NRP cycle), and RAC-2 (RP-RP cycle) were defined based on the criteria of Nijhuis et al. Frequency distributions were plotted separately for the entire 24-h period as well as for the day-time (07:00-21:00 h) and night-time (21:00-07:00 h), and were compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample tests. The mean durations (Â± S.D.) (min) of RP, NRP, RAC-1, and RAC-2 were 22.7 Â± 11.2, 67.3 Â± 47.2, 90.0 Â± 47.6, and 89.9 Â± 48.6 during 24-h periods, 20.1 Â± 7.7, 68.3 Â± 52.3, 88.6 Â± 53.1, and 88.4 Â± 53.0 during the day-time, and 25.4 Â± 13.2, 66.2 Â± 41.2, 91.4 Â± 41.0, and 91.5 Â± 143.4 during the night-time. Length of RP was the only factor significantly different during the day and night (P < 0.05). We propose that there are different mechanisms controlling RP and NRP.

AB  - The early development of circadian rhythms in primates, including man, was reviewed. Continuous 24-h recordings were carried out for maternal and fetal circadian rhythms during gestation as well as in preterm infants. Several propositions were made based on these new findings: 1. The fetal biological clock is an endogenous clock capable of generating circadian rhythms and responding to maternal entraining signals long before the moment of birth. 2. Through the fetal biological clock, maternal circadian rhythms influence the fetal overt rhythms. 3. Maternal rhythms influence the fetus, and fetal rhythms feed back to the mother (via the placenta). Disruption of this fetal-maternal interaction during gestation leads to: a. disturbances of maternal and fetal circadian rhythms; b. disappearance of circadian rhythms at the time of birth; c. a gestational period which is either too short or too long (see also Honnebier and Swaab, 1973); d. delayed or impaired maturation of the circadian rhythms of the infant.

AB  - Objective: To ascertain whether circadian rhythms for fetal movements and fetal heart rate (FHR) characteristics are detectable in early pregnancy with three one-hour observations. Methods: Ten nulliparous women were studied at 13 weeks gestation by real-time ultrasound observations, and 10 additional nulliparous women were studied at 22 weeks by real-time ultrasound observations synchronous with computerised fetal heart rate recordings. All the observations took place at 8:00, 14:00 and 22:00 hours. Results: No circadian rhythms were found at 13 weeks. At 22 weeks significant circadian changes were observed for motor activity in terms of total activity and gross body and breathing movement distribution over time. The lowest values were found in the morning and the highest in the evening. No circadian rhythms were found for the incidence of accelerations and decelerations at 22 weeks. However, circadian rhythms were observed for both basal FHR and FHR variability, with basal FHR being lowest in the evening observations and FHR variability in the morning observations. Conclusions: At 22 weeks of gestation circadian rhythms are detectable for fetal movements, basal FHR and FHR variability, even with three one-hour observations. This procedure is no far from common clinical practice, thus confirming the importance of considering circadian rhythms when performing biophysical examinations, also in the early pregnancy.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this work were to establish automated blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) standards during the three trimesters of pregnancy and to analyze the chronobiological trend of blood pressure during gestation. Methods: A longitudinal study using 24-h ABPM was performed on 192 healthy pregnant women, (aged 20-42 years, mean Â± S.D. 28 Â± 5) both nulliparas (n = 85) and multiparas (n = 107), and also on 26 pregnant women with chronic hypertension and 132 preeclamptic patients. The arterial pressure (AP) of the healthy women, at the start of the pregnancy, was < 140/90 mmHg, as measured by the standard mercury sphygmomanometer, and it remained so at subsequent check-ups throughout the pregnancy and puerperium. AP was monitored using the Spacelabs 90207 (Nippon Collin, Takeda UA 751), beginning at 08:00 h. Results. The normal pregnancies demonstrated an AP circadian rhythm with daytime systolic (SAP) and diastolic (DAP) values about 8-9 mmHg (P < 0.01) higher than at night. In the normal pregnancies, the mean 24-h AP values, like mean daytime and night-time, SAP and DAP values, remained the same in the first two trimesters, while a slight but significant increase occurred in the third (P < 0.05). Conclusions. This study enabled a range of normal pressure values to be deduced for each hour of the day throughout the three trimesters of pregnancy. This may facilitate a more accurate evaluation of individual pressure readings in pregnant women so as to ensure a more reliable and timely diagnosis of hypertension.

AB  - The influence of dosing time on the embryotoxicity of sodium valproate (valproic acid, VPA) was investigated in ICR mice under a light-dark (12:12) cycle. A significant circadian rhythm was shown for VPA-induced embryotoxicity, with the highest value at 1700 and the lowest at 0100. A similar pattern of rhythm was also shown for VPA-induced toxicity in pregnant and nonpregnant mice. No significant dosing time-dependent difference between injection at 1700 and 0100 was demonstrated for VPA concentrations in the embryo, plasma and brain. The rhythm in the embryotoxicity seems to be related to the rhythm in the sensitivity of the embryo and dam to the drug. Embryotoxicity and VPA concentrations were significantly higher on gestational day 13 than day 7. The pharmacokinetics of VPA contribute, at least partly, to the gestational stage-dependent embryotoxicity of VPA. The timing of drug administration (i.e., gestational stage and circadian phase) appears to be essential for studies on the embryotoxicity of VPA in mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to study the diurnal variation in angiotensin II sensitivity. STUDY DESIGN: Angiotensin sensitivity tests were performed at 9 AM and at 2 PM in 12 normotensive pregnant women, with each woman serving as her own control. RESULTS: In all patients the effective pressor dose was higher in the afternoon. CONCLUSION: We suggest the greater sensitivity to angiotensin in the morning is related to an intrinsic circadian variation in vascular reactivity. When the result of an angiotensin sensitivity test is interpreted, the time of day it is performed should be taken into account.

AB  - A 24-h rhythm of plasma PRL is present in fetal sheep. This rhythm is synchronized to an environmental clue (zeitgeber). We determined whether the light-dark cycle (L:D) is a zeitgeber for the fetal PRL rhythm and, if so, whether the mother might convey this zeitgeber to the fetus. We kept nine ewes (twin pregnancies) in constant light (L:L) and five ewes (singleton) in 14:10 L:D from 110 days gestation. Fetuses and mothers were catheterized at 119 days gestation. Blood samples were taken hourly for 24 h after 16 days under L:L or L:D. A mean 24-h rhythm of PRL was found (by RIA) in fetuses under L:D, but not in those under L:L. However, fetuses under L:L showed individual 24-h PRL rhythms (cosinor analysis) whose acrophases were distributed around the clock. Nonsynchronized rhythms persisted after 23 and 30 days of L:L. Acrophases of PRL rhythms within a set of twins were closer than those between sets, suggesting that twins were responding to a common signal. These findings indicate that the L:D cycle is a zeitgeber for the PRL rhythm in fetal sheep and suggest that the mother might convey the zeitgeber.

AB  - Objective. The third trimester of pregnancy is characterized by a mildly hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, possibly driven by elevated circulating levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) of placental origin. In-vitro studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids and oestrogen stimulate while progesterone inhibits the expression of CRH mRNA and/or protein, suggesting that several potential interactions between the placenta and the HPA axis may exist. Design and patients. To investigate the detailed pattern of circulating immunoreactive (ir) CRH, ACTH, cortisol, oestradiol and progesterone during the third trimester of pregnancy, plasma samples were drawn serially every 30 minutes from 22 healthy pregnant women (age 32.0 Â± 1.1 years, mean Â± SE) between the 34th and 36th week of gestation. Ten women had plasma samples drawn between 0800 h and 2000 h (daytime group), and 12 between 2000 h and 0800 h (night-time group). The hormone concentrations obtained were analysed for pulsatility by the Detect program, for detection of circadian rhythmicity by comparison between the first and second 6-hour periods within each group by Student's t-test, and for time-dependent correlations by cross-correlation analysis. Results. All five hormones were secreted in a pulsatile fashion. There was no apparent circadian rhythm of CRH or oestradiol secretion, whereas there was a clear circadian rhythm in plasma ACTH, cortisol and progesterone secretion, with the latter in reverse phase (P < 0.05). No significant correlations were observed between CRH and ACTH, whereas, as expected, ACTH and cortisol concentrations were strongly correlated with each other over time (r = 0.32 and 0.70 at lag time 30 minutes for the daytime and night-time groups, respectively), with ACTH leading cortisol. A weak positive correlation was observed between CRH and cortisol concentrations for the night-time group at lag time 0 minute, suggesting that the latter may have a positive effect on the former in vivo. Conclusions. These data suggest that placental CRH, although pulsatile, drives quantitatively the maternal HPA axis in the third trimester of pregnancy in a non-circadian, non-pulsatile fashion. The maternal HPA axis is probably driven in a circadian and pulsatile fashion by another major ACTH secretagogue, most likely AVP or parvocellular paraventricular nucleus origin.

AB  - Objective. Animal work suggests that maternal oxytocin secretion is influenced by the secretion of endogenous opioids in pregnancy. Spontaneous labour and pre-labour uterine activity follow a 24-hour rhythm the origin of which has not been explained but may be related to diurnal changes in oxytocin secretion. This study was performed to document the changes over a 24-hour period in maternal oxytocin and Î²-endorphin secretion. Design. A 4-hourly blood profile was undertaken for a 24-hour period. Patients. Sixteen women with singleton pregnancies of more than 36 weeks gestation and 10 women with pregnancies in the mid trimester were studied. Measurements. Blood was sampled 4-hourly for 24 hours beginning at 1200 h. Oxytocin was measured in all patients and Î²-endorphin-like immunoreactivity was measured in 15 patients. Results. A simple index was defined for comparing night-time levels to daytime levels for both oxytocin and Î²-endorphin. In all cases more than 36 weeks gestation the index was positive for oxytocin (night-time levels were higher) and in all cases the index was negative for Î²-endorphin (night-time levels were lower). In the mid trimester women all values of the index for oxytocin were positive but in the Î²-endorphin group equal numbers demonstrated a positive or a negative index. Conclusions. Reciprocal 24-hour rhythms were demonstrated between oxytocin and Î²-endorphin; however, it is not clear whether this relationship is causal.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate diurnal variation in blood pressure (BP) in normal gravidas and those with preeclampsia, using ambulatory BP monitoring. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative observational study was performed in three teaching hospital maternity units. Twenty-four normotensive and 24 preeclamptic women who were similar in age, weight, and mean duration of gestation (35 weeks) were studied. Diurnal variation and BP measurement were assessed using ambulatory BP monitors validated for use in pregnancy and for which normal reference ranges for pregnancy have been derived. Results: At night, the BP fall was less in preeclamptic women than in normotensive women. The day-night BP difference decreased as average BP rose (diastolic gradient = â0.54 [95% confidence interval (CI) â0.77 to â0.31], systolic gradient = â0.36 [95% CI â0.58 to â0.14], where gradient denotes a unit increase in BP leading to an increase or decrease in the day-night difference). Conclusion: The decrease in day-night BP difference observed in preeclampsia is inversely related to average BP. This blunting of the day-night BP difference may be a useful adjunctive measure of disease severity in preeclampsia. Â© 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Pregnant B6D2F1 mice were treated with ethanol (25% Kcal) from days 5-17 of gestation. The diet was supplemented with either 18: 2n-6 [linoleic acid (LA)] or 18: 3n-6 [Î³-linolenic acid (GLA)] throughout the study. Ethanol reduced 20 and 22 carbon n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in the brains of adult offspring. Feeding of GLA, compared with LA, increased levels of 20: 3n-6 and 22: 4n-6, but reduced 22: 6n-3, particularly in the offspring of dams administered ethanol during gestation; adult brain weight was also lower in this group. Ethanol reduced the number of viable litters and adult body weight, and GLA reduced birth weight. Neither prenatal ethanol nor GLA affected open-field activity in adult males, nor did either treatment have an effect on the duration of immobility in the forced swimming test. However, GLA did affect circadian activity by increasing running wheel activity during the dark cycle, and decreasing it slightly during the light cycle. These results do not support a beneficial effect of GLA in preventing the developmental effects of ethanol; we suggest caution in the administration of high doses of GLA with ethanol during pregnancy.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that full term neonates actively secrete melatonin and that light deprivation during the first 72 h of life significantly increases plasma melatonin levels. In order to evaluate pineal gland activity and responsiveness to light in premature infants, we measured plasma melatonin levels in 23 healthy infants, 33-36 weeks of gestation, during their first week of life. Nine infants (Group A) remained under constant illumination conditions for 48 hour prior to melatonin measurements. Fourteen infants (Group B) were exposed for the same time period to an artificial alternation of day and night cycles by covering the eyes of the infants with eye pads during the night (20.00-08.00 h). Mean Â± SEM plasma melatonin at 20.00 h, 04.00 h, 12.00 h and 20.00 h was 14.8 Â± 1.6, 16.2 Â± 2.8, 18.7 Â± 3.1, 20.9 Â± 3.1 pg/ml in Group A and 20.5 Â± 3.2, 22.3 Â± 2.9, 20.2 Â± 2.2, 18.5 Â± 2.2 pg/ml in Group B respectively. The differences observed between the two were not statistically significant. Our indicate that at this gestational age the pineal gland is actively secreting melatonin but does not respond to the light alternations attempted. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the developmental maturation of the pineal gland in humans.

AB  - Objective: To compare blood pressure (BP) measurements in ambulatory pregnant women with well-taken office readings. Methods: A cohort of 209 nulliparous pregnant women who underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring throughout pregnancy was studied; 62 of these women were also studied 12 weeks after delivery. In addition, 30 nulligravid, nonpregnant women were studied as controls. Results: The 24-hour median systolic and diastolic ambulatory pressures were higher than office pressures during pregnancy (the differences between the office and ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP measurements were +5 and +5.5 mmHg at 18 weeks, +3 and +6.5 mmHg at 28 weeks, and +5 and +5.5 mmHg at 36 weeks, P < .001). Ambulatory BP showed a consistent rise over the three measurement points, resulting in higher levels of pressure at 36 weeks than those found 12 weeks after delivery (the difference between ambulatory BP at these measurement points was +5 and +1 mmHg). At the postpartum measurement point, the relationship between ambulatory and office BP was similar to that in other surveys in nonpregnant women of comparable ages and in our own control group of nulligravidas (the difference between ambulatory and office BPs after delivery was +1.5 and +2 mmHg, a nonsignificant difference). Conclusion: There are important differences between ambulatory and office BPs measured throughout pregnancy, findings that could not be explained by activity or our present knowledge of cardiovascular hemodynamics in pregnancy. Ambulatory BP readings must be considered different entities than office BP readings. Care should be taken in predicting obstetric outcome from the results of ambulatory BP recordings.

AB  - The heart rate during whole day, periods of activity and sleep as well as repeatable daily activities were identified in a group of 22 women, aged 19-40, and pregnant for 12-36 weeks, following a 24-hour recording of the heart work. In four women only, mean circadian heart rate was under 87/min, a value considered as normal in moderate active persons. That indicates a significant pregnancy-related increase of heart rate. A considerable great variation of heart rates was observed during a day. The highest heart rate (97-140/min) was caused by mounting the stairs; it was also noted during performing minor household jobs and/or preparing meals. While using transportation means, heart rate ranged from 78 to 130/min, and at leisure form 89 to 108/min. It was found that the level of an acceptable load for women (100 heart beats/min) was already higher than the mean value for the whole period of activity. An analysis of the relationship between heart rate in certain situations and the age of women under study, and the pregnancy advancement, shows that heart rate was, in each period of recording, positively correlated with the women's age. That means an increasing, with age pregnancy-related load. Heart rate during a 24-hour period, periods of activity and sleep, during the use of transportation means, watching television and resting in a sitting position, was positively correlated with the duration of pregnancy. Negative correlation between heart rate and the duration of pregnancy was observed while mounting the stairs, preparing meals and performing other household jobs. The negative correlation indicates that the pace of activities performed can be easily regulated, and thus, the load magnitude adjusted to physical abilities, whereas the positive correlation indicates that such a possibility does not exist in regard to the expenditure of energy (work pace). To sum up, the data presented shows that the use of transportation means increased the women's load but they could easily perform minor household jobs. However, there were no occupationally working women in the study group, it can be concluded that this kind od analysis, and conclusions drawn, can be used in identifying types of work and workplaces which pose too much load to pregnant women.

AB  - Objective: To compare the 24-hour blood pressureâ (BP) pattern in physiologic pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and chronic hypertension. Methods: We investigated four groups of women with singleton pregnancy: 73 controls, 48 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension, 38 with preeclampsia, and 53 with mild to moderate chronic hypertension. The 24-hour BP monitoring was performed longitudinally in controls and in patients with chronic hypertension, and at the time of diagnosis in those with pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia. Results: Nineteen thousand eight hundred seventy-two BP measurements were analyzed. In controls, the mean values of BP indices were lower than those first reported in nonpregnant women, and the acrophase was always localized in the first part of the afternoon. In pregnancy-induced hypertension and especially in preeclampsia, besides the obvious quantitative increase in BP, circadian BP oscillations were less pronounced than in controls, and the severity of hypertension seemed to favor the loss of diurnal rhythm. Conversely, in chronic hypertension, circadian oscillations were the same as in controls. Conclusion: Standardized 24-hour BP monitoring during pregnancy allows quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the hypertensive status. However, if such a technique is used routinely in every clinical setting, we should establish specific thresholds of normality for pregnancy. (Obstet Gynecol 1996;88:503-10).

AB  - An in-house radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of androstenedione levels in serum was established and validated. Levels of androstenedione were measured by RIA using serum samples from various normal population groups and patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Analytical recovery and linearity results were > 95%, while intra- and inter-assay CVs were < 10% and < 22% respectively. The assay sensitivity was 0.5 nmol/l or 25 fmol/tube. In normal population groups, the highest androstenedione levels were found in preterm neonates (1.6-12.4 nmol/l), followed by adult females (1.5-10.2 nmol/l), adult males (1.6-8.0 nmol/l) and term neonates (0.8-8.8 nmol/l), while the lowest values were observed in prepubertal children (0.5-3.4 nmol/l). There were no significant differences in diurnal variation and between follicular and luteal phases. The range of androstenedione levels in untreated or poorly controlled CAH patients (7.6-355.0 nmol/l, median 42.5 nmol/l, n = 20) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the upper normal limit of 3.4 nmol/L for prepubertal children. The normal androstenedione reference ranges for paediatric and adult groups have thus been established.

AB  - Immunological monitoring of disease progression following HIV infection and seroconversion illness, latency and AIDS, not only helps in the basic investigation of the natural history of the viral infection in man, but also can assist in prognosis and treatment of AIDS-defining illnesses. However, outside clinical trials, these tests should be selected and used in clinical practice only if they are validated as relevant and effective. The absolute CD4+ T-helper lymphocyte count, measured by flow cytometry, has emerged as the best available investigation, but needs care in sampling due to diurnal and circadian rhythms, effects of age, pregnancy, therapy, intercurrent infections and technique. Sampling should provide a baseline and trends - monthly intervals initially, then quarterly in uncomplicated cases. Thresholds may be given for counts (e.g. 200/Î¼l) below which prophylaxis against pneumocystis pneumonia should be administered, and repeating persistently low counts (e.g. below 50/Î¼l) is seldom helpful in practice. Serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin, neopterin and immunoglobulins rarely add information. Physicians and laboratories should have testing guidelines based on clinical audit of best practice, based in turn on scientific understanding of the immunological processes involved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether there is a relationship between changes in atmospheric pressure and spontaneous onset of labor in term pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: All women admitted to Medical Center of Central Massachusetts-Memorial Hospital with spontaneous onset of labor at term and who were delivered on the service during a 12-month period represent the cohort for this study. Each maternal chart was abstracted to ensure that each member of the cohort met the inclusion criteria. Hourly recordings of atmospheric pressure made at the Worcester Station of the National Weather Service, Department of Commerce, were used as the meteorologic data points of interest. Least-squares regression was used to determine an equation that expresses the probability of the onset of labor in this cohort as a function of gestational age, which was used to calculate expected numbers far the statistical analyses. Two relationships were studied: (1) the ratio of the observed to the expected number of onsets of labor and (2) the initiation of labor and atmospheric pressure changes in the preceding 3 hours. RESULTS: Three-hour periods of falling atmospheric pressure were less often followed by initiation of labor than were the periods with other types of pressure sequences. No association was observed between the onset of labor and days of low mean pressure. CONCLUSION: Although there was an observed statistically significant association between falling barometric pressure and onset of labor, the magnitude of the difference is not of clinical significance.

AB  - Objective: To investigate if the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (24-h ABP) monitoring technique could be useful in predicting the development of preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension. Design: A prospective study in which 24-h ABP was measured in each trimester and 12 weeks postpartum. Method: Twelve women with untreated chronic hypertension had 24-h ABP monitoring performed with SpaceLabs 90207 monitor; eight normotensive women served as controls. Results: In both the hypertensive and the control group there was a nocturnal reduction of the blood pressure. However, when the 24-h blood pressure profiles were analyzed separately for each woman, it was found that six women in the hypertensive group and six women in the control group at least at one measurement occasion during the pregnancy did not have any nocturnal blood pressure fall; one of the women in the hypertensive group developed preeclampsia. In the hypertensive group four women had no nocturnal blood pressure fall during the whole pregnancy, of these, one developed preeclampsia and one was subsequently in need of pharmacological treatment of the hypertension. When the 95% confidence limits for the hourly recordings of the hypertensive women with pregnancies without complications were calculated it was found that during the nighttime, two of the women who subsequently developed preeclampsia had a blood pressure level at the upper limit whereas the other woman who developed that condition had a blood pressure level at or below the lower confidence limit. Conclusion: The 24-h ABP monitoring technique in hypertensive pregnancies seems to be of limited value in predicting the development of preeclampsia. The predictive value of an absent nocturnal blood pressure dip is limited as both normotensive and hypertensive women on several occasions during pregnancy showed such absence.

AB  - The corpus luteum, one of the biological clocks of the estrous cycle and pregnancy, is known foremost for its production of progesterone that blocks the pituitary release of gonadotropins and prepares the uterus for a pregnancy. The cellular sources of this progesterone are the steroidogenic small and large luteal cells. Other luteal cells that are not steroidogenic, but are believed to have an important role in the function of this gland are the fibroblast, macrophages and endothelial cells. The most prominent luteal cell is the large steroidogenic cell characterized by an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and densely packed spherical mitochondria that are indicative of its contribution to most of the circulating progesterone believed to be constitutively secreted and not under the control of LH. Other distinguishing features of the large luteal cell are the presence of rough endoplasmic reticulum, prominent Golgi, and secretory granules that are indicative of endocrine cells. This cell undergoes dynamic changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, believed to reflect a change in progesterone and protein secretion that will eventually influence a successful pregnancy or another ovulation if pregnancy fails. The morphological characteristics of the bovine luteal cells are the focus of this review.

AB  - It is known that dopamine (DA) is the major PRL-inhibiting factor, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is one of the most potent and physiological PRL-releasing factors. We have investigated the implication of DA and VIP in PRL gene expression and peptide secretion regulation during the physiological hyperprolactinemic states of pregnancy and lactation. Pregnant rats were studied on days 8, 15, and 20 of pregnancy. Lactating rats suckled by eight pups were studied on days 3 and 8 of postpartum, and nonsuckling postpartum rats were used as controls. Plasma estradiol, progesterone, and PRL were measured by RIA, as well as pituitary immunoreactive (IR-) PRL, pituitary IR-VIP, and hypothalamic IR-VIP. DA was studied by measuring changes in gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. TH, PRL, and VIP messenger RNA (mRNA) were assessed by Northern blot hybridization. The results showed very high plasma PRL levels in early pregnancy and during lactation, whereas plasma PRL concentrations were normalized at the end of gestation and in nonsuckling control rats. The physiological hyperprolactinemia of both early pregnancy and lactation correlated with higher pituitary PRL mRNA levels and lower pituitary IR-PRL content. Moreover, hypothalamic TH mRNA levels were lower in early pregnancy and lactation than at the end of gestation and in nonsuckling rats, respectively. The hypothalamic IR-VIP content was lower on day 8 of pregnancy than on days 15 and 20. However, VIP gene expression in the hypothalamus did not change throughout pregnancy. During lactation, neither hypothalamic IR-VIP content nor VIP mRNA was significantly altered. In the pituitary, IR-VIP content did not significantly change, and VIP mRNA levels were higher on day 15 of pregnancy than on the other days. During lactation, the pituitary IR-VIP content was very low on day 8 compared with those on day 3 of lactation and in nonsuckling control rats. VIP mRNA 1.0-kilobase transcript levels were higher in the lactating rats than in the control animals. These data show that both early pregnancy and lactation are physiological hyperprolactinemic states in which increased PRL mRNA accumulation coincides with decreased IR-PRL content in the pituitary and higher plasma IR-PRL, indicating regulation at the gene expression level and of PRL secretion. Low TH gene expression also occurs during hyperprolactinemia, suggesting that the diminution of DA activity that occurs during early pregnancy and lactation might be the major regulator of PRL alterations. If hypothalamic VIP plays a role as a neuroendocrine PRL- releasing factor during pregnancy and lactation, this may occur at the secretory level, as suggested by the alterations in IR-VIP, with no modifications in VIP mRNA accumulation, in the hypothalamus. Pituitary VIP does not seem to be a major regulator of PRL secretion during pregnancy, whereas during lactation, it regulates PRL secretion in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner.

AB  - Suprachiasmatic nuclei, derived from neonate rats, were maintained for several weeks in stationary organotypic culture. Hypothalamic slice explants, supported by Millicell filters and incubated in Petri dishes containing serum-based medium, flattened appreciably, yet preserved the organization of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the surrounding hypothalamic tissue. After two to three weeks, cultures were fixed, and three neuronal sub-populations were identified as vasopressinergic, vasoactive intestinal peptide-containing, or GABA-containing. The GABAergic component of the cultured suprachiasmatic nucleus was particularly profuse, projecting extensively into the hypothalamic slice. Unilateral ablation of the nucleus in the explant dramatically reduced ipsilateral GABA-immunoreactivity in the slice. Explants in which an incision separated the bilateral suprachiasmatic nucleus from the paraventricular nucleus, deprived the latter of its fine-caliber GABA-immunoreactive input. Extra- or intra-cellular electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nucleus were obtained in 51 of 58 cultures. The electrical properties of the long-term cultured suprachiasmatic nucleus were similar to those recorded in acute slices from adult rats. In six cultures recordings were extended for up to 10-24 h. Within long-term stationary organotypic cultures of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, sub-populations of neurons, intrinsic to the nucleus in vivo, were identified immunocytochemically. Lesion studies supported the observation that the main source of the GABAergic innervation within the entire hypothalamic slice explant appeared to be the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Electrophysiological studies confirmed the viability of the long-term cultured nucleus and revealed changes in spontaneous electrical activity that may indicate circadian fluctuation.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine whether a discrepancy between the genetically determined endogenous circadian period and an abnormally long Zeitgeber period disturbs the development of melatonin synthesis. Breeding pairs of rats were kept under 12:12- or 14:14-hr light:dark (LD) conditions. Pineal melatonin contents in the offspring were measured by radioimmunoassay. At 2 weeks of age high melatonin contents were found from lights-off to lights-on in both conditions suggesting dominance of the photic regulation. At 3 weeks of age the signs of the circadian regulation in the melatonin profiles were evident: a lag period after the light offset in control conditions and a significant decline before the light onset in both conditions. However, in 14:14-hr LD conditions the melatonin content did not decrease to daytime levels until the lights were on. This could suggest incomplete maturation of the circadian system. The phase relationships between the melatonin peak and LD cycle were different in the two conditions. A statistically significant LD difference was first found at the age of 8-10 days in male pups and at 14 days in female pups under both lightings. The results suggest that the abnormally long LD cycle did not cause any major disorders in the development of photic or circadian regulation of the melatonin synthesis. Â© Munksgaard.

AB  - Objectives: (1) To develop an image analysis method for the measurement of neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP); (2) To establish a correlation of urea-resistant fraction of NAP (URNAP)/NAP scoring between the manual and automated methods, and (3) to assess the value of URNAP/NAP in the prenatal screening of Down syndrome. Study Design: Slides from 15 unaffected controls were blindly scored by both methods. The Pearson test was used for correlation analysis. Slides from 15 Down syndrome pregnancies and 25 unaffected controls were scored manually. Results: A coefficient r = 0.93 was obtained comparing the URNAP/NAP scores generated by the two methods. Average time for scoring by the automated method was 8 min. The median URNAP/NAP values for Down syndrome and unaffected controls were 112/86.1 and 51/51.5, respectively. Conclusions: Scores obtained by both methods highly correlate. Automated scoring is threefold faster. Down syndrome cases have higher URNAP/NAP scores compared to unaffected controls, which suggests that URNAP/NAP is an extremely useful marker for mid-trimester prenatal screening. Â© 1996 S.

AB  - Two experiments were designed to determine whether gonadal steroids during the estrous cycle may modify the characteristics of the plasma melatonin rhythm. In the first experiment, 12 ovariectomized estradiol-treated ewes were used and exposed to constant short days. The experimental design was a latin square to distinguish between steroid treatments and individual effects on melatonin secretion. Twenty four hours before the bleeding period (hourly during 20 hr) and with a 1 week interval, animals were treated with a) additional subcutaneous estradiol implants, b) progesterone devices, or c) control. In the second experiment, nine ewes received a treatment combining fluorogestone acetate devices and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin to induce synchronous ovulations. Samples for melatonin determination were obtained hourly for 13 hr at three stages of estrous cycle: follicular phase, early luteal phase, and late luteal phase. Ovarian activity was monitored by taking daily samples for progesterone analysis and ovulation rate was determined by laparoscopy. Duration and mean melatonin plasma concentrations of the elevation were calculated for each ewe and each night and analysed by latin square test (experiment 1) or ANOVA (experiment 2). Melatonin concentrations of elevation and duration of elevation were not significantly affected by hormonal treatments or by phase of estrous cycle. A strong individual effect was detected (P<0.01) for both parameters in both experiments. It was concluded that melatonin secretion is unaffected by steroid administration or by phase of estrous cycle. The existence of very high inter-individual variation suggest that both parameters are individual characteristics of each animal which may have a strong genetic basis. Â© Munksgaard.

AB  - A significant number of studies have demonstrated a rhythmicity in the time of day of birth. For day active mammals, the normal time of delivery is during the hours of darkness, while the converse is true for nocturnal animals. This concept also applies to human pregnancy. Both the start of labor and actual time of delivery appear to occur more frequently at night than other times of the day. Although the mechanism(s) regulating this pattern remains undefined, there seems to be a relationship to rhythms in hormone secretion. The underlying hypothesis suggests that rhythmic changes in circulating hormone concentrations have a profound influence on the contractile characteristics of the myometrium. The changing hormone concentrations result in rhythms in uterine contractions, with the peak of activity occurring at night. This 'temporal priming' of the uterus may be responsible for the nocturnal dominance of the initiation of labor and parturition. Data from non-human primates also suggest a strong influence of photoperiod on these rhythms. However, the influence of light:dark cycles on endocrine and uterine activity patterns during human pregnancy has yet to be determined.

AB  - The article examines relationships between pregnancy and maternal sleep. Specifically, sleep as a restorative process is considered with regard for the metabolic and arousal demands of childbearing. The analysis draws attention to the limited number of studies in the area and the need for greater research interest in pregnancy sleep phenomena. The available evidence indicates that maternal slow-wave and rapid eye movement which are key to anabolic activity and neural-cerebral recharge, are protected throughout pregnancy until perhaps the last 3 to 4 weeks before delivery. The sleep disturbances about which term gravidas complain appear to be based on increased periods of wakefulness after sleep onset. Â© 1996 Aspen Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Descriptions of dreams of women during pregnancy have appeared in the literature for more than a century. Daydreams and sleep dreams are differentiated. A review of the literature published during the last four decades uncovered a limited number of empirical articles. The general consensus is that the sleep dreams of pregnant women are indicative of their concerns regarding safety for self and for the expected child. The most recent information focuses on the use of groups to help pregnant women explore the content of their dreams. Â© 1996 Aspen Publishers, Inc.

AB  - We previously reported a marked enhancement of nocturnal sleep in pregnant and pseudopregnant rats and suggested a possible involvement of prolactin (PRL) in the modulation of sleep during pregnancy. In the present study, the release of PRL was blocked by a dopamine agonist, bromocriptine (CB-154), and time-course changes in sleep were analyzed in pregnant rats. After pregnancy was induced by fertile mating with males (Day 1), rats (n = 5) were injected with 1 mg of CB-154 subcutaneously 3 h before the onset of darkness for a 3-day period (Days 1â3 or 6â8). Electroencephalogram and electromyo-gram for evaluating the state of sleep and wakefulness were monitored continuously up to the reappearance of an estrous cycle in the treated rats. The CB-154 treatment resulted in abortion in all rats and suppressed the pregnancy-associated nocturnal increase in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). The CB-154 treatment also decreased the diurnal amount of NREMS significantly. The sleep-suppressing effect of CB-154 on Days 6-8 was induced more promptly than that on Days 1-3. In the night of proestrus following the termination of pregnancy (Day 4 or Day 12), both NREMS and REMS decreased to the baseline level observed at prepregnant proestrus. Thus, our results indicated that CB-154 neutralized the pregnancy-associated sleep changes, which might be due to the inhibition of the PRL release. It is suggested that PRL is at least partially responsible for the regulation of sleep during pregnancy. Â© 1996 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Brief periods of hypoxia during labour and birth are a frequent occurrence. Within the CNS, the hippocampus is known to be particularly vulnerable to the damaging effects of hypoxia/ischaemia in both adult and immature animals. The hippocampus also contains the highest concentration of corticosteroid receptors of any brain region and both mineralocorticoid (type I) receptors and glucocorticoid (type II) receptors in the hippocampus play a role in the regulation of basal diurnal and stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion. Given this background, the aim of this study was to test whether an acute period of anoxia during the birth process may have lasting effects on CNS corticosteroid receptor levels and/or pituitary-adrenocortical function. Type I and type II corticosteroid receptor binding sites in the hippocampus and hypothalamus were compared in adult rats that had been born vaginally, born by a Caesarean procedure or born by a Caesarean procedure with 5,10 or 15 min of added anoxia. Using 14 nM [3H]corticosterone as radioligand, mineralocorticoid receptor binding was reduced by approximately 50% in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of adult rats that had been born by the Caesarean procedure either with or without an added period of anoxia, in comparison to vaginally born controls. Saturation analysis revealed that these reductions resulted from decreases in affinity of the mineralocorticoid receptor for [3H]corticosterone, with no change in numbers of receptors. Birth condition had no effect on glucocorticoid receptor binding capacities in the hippocampus or hypothalamus. A small increase in basal corticosterone secretion during the diurnal trough was observed in adult animals that had been born by Caesarean section with 5 or 15 min of added anoxia. The plasma corticosterone response to a 20-min restraint stress was reduced in adult animals born by Caesarean section with or without an added period of anoxia, in comparison to vagmally born controls. However the adrenocorticotropin response to stress was largely unaffected by birth condition. The results indicate that an acute birth insult is sufficient to produce long-lasting alterations in hippocampal and hypothalamic mineralocorticoid receptor sites, accompanied by changes in basal and stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlations between retrospective and prospective assessments of sleep. Subjective reports of sleep characteristics and sleep quality were obtained from 146 young (20-40 years, average age 29.15) healthy men (n = 43), nonpregnant (n = 70) and from 146 young (20-40 years, average age 29.15) healthy men (n = 33). Three types of subjective sleep reports were obtained: (1) general estimates of sleep habits (retrospective measures); (2) sleep logs completed upon awakening on three successive workdays (prospective measures); and (3) general sleep complaints. Men showed the greatest stability in the sleep log reports, followed by nonpregnant women, with pregnant women showing the least stability. Significant positive correlations between prospective (log reported) and retrospective (general estimates) sleep measures were found only for men. However, for measures of sleep quality, such as feelings of fatigue upon awakening, women showed greater agreement between their general estimates and three nightly reports. The limitations of using retrospective estimates in sleep surveys are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the differences between primigravidae and multigravidae women in their experience of sleep efficiency, fatigue and vitality, and level of functioning in the third trimester of pregnancy and the first month postpartum. A secondary analysis of a descriptive, longitudinal study was done. A convenience sample of 31 pregnant women was used to test the hypothesis tliat multigravidae would have significantly higher levels of functioning in the household, increased fatigue, and decreased steep efficiency and vitality than prtmigravktae at both phases of the study. Results Indicate, however, that primigravidae experienced significantly more disturbed sleep, with sleep efficiency falling from 89.79% in the third trimester to 77.25% postpartum. Muhigravidae had only a minor reduction in sleep efficiency from 86.76% in the thir1 trimester to 83.99% postpartum. Although there was no sta tisticaUy significant difference in kvel of vitality, primigravidae experienced more fatigue (73.58 Â± 15.22) than muttigravidae (64.35 Â± 18.96) at 1 month postpartum. These results suggest that maternal role "acquisition," experienced by primigravidae, results in more fatigue and sleep disruption than does maternal role expansion. The significant decrease in sleep efficiency and increase In fatigue in primigravidae after delivery indicate that heahh care professionals need to provide anticipatory guidance to p'imigravidae to help smooth the transition from pregnancy to motherhood.

AB  - Genetically based alcohol sensitivity may influence the severity of alcohol-related birth defects. To examine this question, measures of growth and survival were examined in offspring of the alcohol sensitive Long-Sleep (LS) and alcohol-resistant Short-Sleep (SS) mouse lines following prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant LS and SS mice received an ethanol dose of either 6 or 8 g/kg/day from days 7 through 18 of pregnancy. Control groups received a maltose-dextrin solution made isocaloric to the 8 g/kg/day dose. Ethanol and maltose-dextrin solutions were administered as split doses, 6 h apart, via gavage. Nonintubated lab chow control groups were also included for both mouse lines. Offspring were fostered at birth to lactating mice of an outbred stock. Pregnancy was longer for ethanol-treated LS dams compared to maltose dextrin and lab chow LS control groups, whereas pregnancy length for ethanol- treated SS dams was similar to SS controls. Prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in dose-related growth deficits in LS but not in SS litters. Line differences in postnatal growth deficits in response to prenatal alcohol exposure suggest maternal or fetal alcohol sensitivity influence alcohol- related birth defects.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the incidence of self-reported snoring in pregnant compared with nonpregnant women. To compare indicators of fetal outcome in pregnant women with self-reported frequent snoring vs those without snoring. Study design: Prospective, nonrandomized screening and comparison between groups. Patients: Three hundred fifty pregnant women and 110 age-matched nonpregnant women. Methods: Survey evaluating self-reported snoring. For the pregnant women, infant birthweight, APGAR scores, and other indicators of fetal outcome were obtained by record review. Results: Frequent snoring was reported in 14% of the pregnant women vs 4% of the nonpregnant women (Ï2=6.2; df=1; p&lt;0.05). The pregnant women who reported frequent snoring did not have deliveries resulting in infants with evidence of an increase in compromised outcomes. Conclusions: Frequent snoring is reported more often in pregnant than in nonpregnant women. Snoring mothers do not appear to be at increased risk for delivering infants with fetal compromise as might ha expected with the concomitant occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to study whether multiple pregnancy at the third trimester predisposes to breathing disturbances and arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep. STUDY DESIGN: Nocturnal breathing, oxygenation, and movement activity were studied in 10 mothers: 8 with twins, 1 with triplets, and 1 with quadruplets. RESULTS: No obstructive and few central sleep apnea episodes were observed. Four subjects had episodes of increased respiratory resistance, but only one, the mother with quadruplets, was significantly affected. Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation was always maintained above 90%. Periodic leg movements were present in all mothers, with a frequency range of 3.7 to 49.7 movements per hour. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the large uterus in multiple pregnancy, nocturnal breathing and oxygenation are well maintained. Increased motor activity and frequent awakenings suggest poor sleep quality, which may be further compromised by intensive periodic leg movements.

AB  - Autism, Asperger's syndrome and other autistic syndromes are developmental brain disorders that cause serious impairments in communication, social interaction, empathy, mood and play. In addition to such deficits, the autistic syndromes involve pathologically high levels of repetitive, stereotypic, ritualistic, compulsive or obsessive behavior, together with extreme resistance to change. According to the Crick-Mitchison theory of the biological function of rapid eye movement sleep, normal brain development in the fetus and infant depends on undisrupted function of a 'reverse learning' mechanism during rapid eye movement sleep. Could abnormalities in this hypothetical reverse learning during rapid eye movement sleep in the fetus explain some aspects of the autistic syndromes? Does the Crick-Mitchison theory suggest if a drug could interfere with rapid eye movement sleep and cross the placental barrier, then that drug might cause developmental brain disorders in the fetus? Should all pregnant women completely avoid caffeine or any agent that might disrupt serotonergic or cholinergic systems?.

AB  - A wide variety of hypotheses have been put forth that address the functional significance of active sleep. Despite the well-accepted fact that active sleep expresses itself predominantly in the perinatal period, the vast majority of these functional hypotheses are applicable largely, if not exclusively, to the adult. We build on the developmental approaches of previous researchers and propose that the individual components of active sleep (e.g., myoclonic twitches, rapid eye movements) exhibit unique developmental and phylogenetic histories and may serve independent functions in the developing organism. This dynamic perspective leads to specific experimental approaches aimed at the developmental roles of these components in the neonate, their maintenance roles in the adult, and the means by which these various components coalesce temporally in what is commonly referred to as a behavioral state.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the prone sleep position was associated with an increased risk of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Study design: Population-based case-control study. Participants: Case subjects were infants who died of SIDS in King County, Washington. Control subjects were randomly selected infants born in King County. Up to four control subjects were matched on date of birth to each case subject. Methods: During the study period, November 1992 through October 1994, sleep-position data were collected on infants who died of SIDS by the King County Medical Examiner's Office during their investigation of the deaths. Parents of infants chosen as control subjects were contacted by telephone, and sleep position information was obtained. Infants who usually slept on their abdomen were classified as sleeping prone; those who usually slept on the side or back were categorized as sleeping nonprone. The adjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position as a risk factor for SIDS was calculated with conditional logistic regression after control for race, birth weight, maternal age, maternal marital status, household income, and maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy. Results: Sleep position data were collected on 47 infants with SIDS (77% of eligible infants) and 142 matched control subjects; 57.4% of infants who died of SIDS usually slept prone versus 24.6% of control subjects (p <0.00001). The unadjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position as a risk factor for SIDS was 4.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.17, 10.17). After control for potentially confounding variables, the adjusted odds ratio for prone sleep position was 3.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 9.03). Conclusion: Prone sleep position was significantly associated with an increased risk of SIDS among a group of American infants.

AB  - To investigate the effects of lung distension and oxygenation on umbilical blood flow (UBF) and plasma prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in relation to arousal and stimulation of breathing movements, we studied eight chronically instrumented, unanesthetized fetal sheep between 137 and 143 d of gestation. Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, nuchal and diaphragmatic electromyograms, arterial pH and blood gas tensions. Hb oxygen saturation, body temperature, and UBF were recorded in each fetus. Electrocorticogram, electro-oculogram, and nuchal electromyograms were used to define sleep states. No sooner than 4 d after surgery, fetal lungs were distended with 100% O2 or N2 in a randomized order via an in situ Y-endotracheal tube. PGE2 concentrations were analyzed by RIA. A significant increase in fetal arousal and stimulation of breathing during nonrapid eye movement sleep was observed during lung distension with O2 as compared with control periods and lung distension with nitrogen. In all sleep states, UBF significantly decreased during oxygenation as corn pared with the control values. However, no significant correlation was observed between the time of the onset of arousal and the decrease in UBF. Lung distension with N2 resulted in increased plasma PGE2 concentrations, whereas, no change was observed during oxygenation. Our data suggest that an increase in fetal partial pressure of arterial O2 leads to a decrease in UBF. However, the onset of arousal and stimulation of breathing during lung distension and oxygenation are not dependent on a decrease in plasma PGE2 concentrations.

AB  - Two patients with Type I Klippel-Feil syndrome presented at the antenatal clinic. The first patient, who suffered from sleep apnoea, was delivered of a healthy infant by vacuum extraction. The second, who was profoundly deaf and had marked kyphoscoliosis, developed pregnancy-induced hypertension and urinary tract infection and was delivered at 38 weeks by vacuum extraction. In both cases epidural analgesia was employed to allow pain relief during labour. Anaesthetic management of Klippel-Feil syndrome is discussed and the benefits of early anaesthetic assessment and continued involvement of senior anaesthetic and obstetric staff emphasized.

AB  - A questionnaire survey was conducted amongst parents in the military community in British Forces Germany to investigate the prevalence of known and suspected risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Over a thousand questionnaires were returned (response rate 58%) and these showed that the prevalence of babies being placed in the prone position to sleep is now extremely low and the use of room thermometers to help control ambient temperature is widespread. However 29% of the mothers had smoked in pregnancy and 44% of households with a new-born baby had at least one parent who smoked. Additional health promotion activity aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking in pregnancy and amongst the parents of new-born babies is recommended.

AB  - Periods of no coincidence (PsNC) among state variables appear to be more predictive of neurobehavioral outcome than the amount of time spent in any particular behavioral state. It has recently been suggested that analysis of the ordering of state variables during a state transition may provide results equivalent to full state analysis. If this were the case, then there ought to be a relationship between the duration of PsNC and fetal heart rate (FHR)-fetal eye movement (FEM) sequencing at the time of a state change. To test this hypothesis, we compared full state analysis with analysis of individual state transitions for 52 normal human fetuses between 38 and 42 weeks of gestation. For the study population as a whole, FHR was the first variable to change in 62 (77%) of 81 1F â 2F transitions and FEM was the first variable to change in 50 (63%) of 79 2F â 1F transitions (Ï2 = 67.9, P &lt; 0.001). Ordering of FTIR and FEM at the time of a state change was reversed in 8 (67%) of 12 fetuses with PsNC â¥ 15% and in only 6 (15%) of 40 fetuses with PsNC &lt; 15% (Ï2 = 12.5, p &lt; 0.001). We conclude that fetuses who exhibit poor state organization more often display a FHR-FEM sequence at the time of a state transition which is opposite that of fetuses with considerably better state control. However, since only one-third of fetuses with reversed FHR-FEM sequencing actually exhibited more than one such episode, it is unlikely that isolated analysis of state transitions will provide a reliable measure of behavioral state organization in the individual fetus.

AB  - This study examined the chaotic deterministic structure in fetal heart rate variability using fast (Df) and slow (Ds) dispersion coefficients. The Poincare plot was used for quantification of dynamic changes in electrocardiographic activity of inter-beat intervals. A 30-minute continuous segment of transabdominal fetal electrocardiography was sampled at a rate of 1 kilohertz during active sleep from a 36-week human fetus. Poincare plots of the original and randomized data were calculated for all combinations of 3-, to 20- minute segments. A Poincare plot of the original 30-minute sample is shown on the left with the associated chaotic structure. After randomization, this structure can no longer be identified in the figure on the right. The mean Df ranged from (31.96-33.80) Â± (5.04 at 20-minutes to 17.76 in the 3-minute segments). The mean Ds had a range of (31.18-35.35) Â± (2.04 at 20-minutes to 12.47 at 3-minutes). To conclude, the fetal heart rate pattern appeared to be chaotic with the structure being maintained across small intervals. Variability in the dispersion pattern increased during shorter intevals. Comparison with randomized plots showed little or no organized 3 chaotic structure. This information may prove useful in the evaluation of high-risk pregnancies as well as other clinical populations.

AB  - Chronic and debilitating, affective disorders are becoming more common among youth and the elderly population. Depression, a diagnosis that is often missed, is twice as common in women who have been pregnant compared with nulliparous women and men. When diagnosed, it is often untreated. When treated, most patients respond to adequate doses of an antidepressant. Risk factors for recurring depression include a history of two or more depressive episodes; comorbid psychiatric and medical problems; and psychosocial factors, such as heightened vulnerability to the stress of life events.

AB  - The uptake of Listeria monocytogenes by cells in primary dissociated brain cell cultures prepared from ovine fetuses at approximately 50 to 60 days of gestation was studied using a sequential double immunofluorescence technique with antibodies against cell type-specific markers and the bacterial pathogen. Cell cultures were inoculated with bacteria at day 4, 8, and 15 in vitro. Listeria monocytogenes was predominately internalized by CD68-positive macrophages, followed by astrocytes, fibronectin-expressing cells, and neurons. An uptake of the bacterium by galactocerebroside (GC)-positive oligodendrocytes, which were first detected at day 15 in vitro, did not occur. Although a tropism for neurons was not observed, the susceptibility of neurons for infection with Listeria monocytogenes is in accordance with the supposed intraaxonal migration of the bacterium in the pathogenesis of focal brain stem encephalitis. The pattern of the infection rates of ovine brain cell types was similar to that shown in murine fetal brain cell cultures, indicating that there is no species-specific brain cell tropism of the bacterium.

AB  - As part of a larger study we established a remote physiological monitoring network to investigate cardiorespiratory function during sleep in 400 infants in their homes. The objective of the study was to link measurements made at three weeks and three months of age with detailed measurements of maternal and fetal nutrition during pregnancy and subsequent outcome (growth, development and cardiorespiratory diseases). Five infants per night were monitored anywhere within a radius of 10 miles (16 km) of the remote hub. Of 800 overnight studies on 64 (of 400) infants, 99 were completed. Options allowed downloading data from monitor memory as well as review (on- and off-line) from the infants' or nurses' homes, the hub and the Oxford telemonitoring centre. The reasons for these measurements being made at home were to ensure physiological accuracy and to reduce cost. The network was effectively run by local community nurses; with the exception of the size and cost of the monitors, it had all the elements of a remote primary-care clinical service.

AB  - Beside well-established clinical benefits, the current doses of ocstrogens may induce clinical side-effects leading to non-compliance and loss of efficacy. During a normal menstrual cycle the incidence of any cyclic discomfort is consistently reported to be lowest during the mid- follicular phase when plasma E2 remains between 60 and 150 pg/ml. The incidence of pregnancy-like symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness and mood swings tends to increase in mid-luteal phase when E2 increases upto 150 pg/ml. On the other hand incidence of asthenia, sleep disturbances, depressive mood, headaches and migraines increase during perimenstrual days when E2 drops to 40 pg/ml or below. Accordingly experimental and human studies in castrated animals and postmenopausal women suggest that plasma E2 around 100 pg/ml is optimal for treatment of hot flushes, prevention of bone loss and cardiovascular protection. Due to large interindividual variation in estrogen clearance rate, it is unlikely that any standardized unique dose of oral or non- oral formulations will reproduce the optimal levels in all postmenopausal users. Efforts for individual titration are mandatory to improve compliance and actual efficacy on a long term. Because older postmenopausal women tend to have a better clinical tolerance to low E2 levels, objective markers of efficacy should also be identified when the aim of HRT is the prevention of osteoporosis or vascular diseases. In addition clinical and metabolic side-effects related to added progestins can be substantially reduced by the use of lower dose inducing amenorrhea and by progesterone instead of synthetic steroids.

AB  - There is growing interest in using melatonin as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, glaucoma, stress, jet lag, and sleep disorders. In addition, melatonin is being evaluated in a clinical trial to test its efficacy as an oral contraceptive. In order to test any possible adverse effects of melatonin on preimplantation embryos, we used the mouse as a model system. Two strains of mice, a Ped fast, melatonin-deficient strain, C57BL/6, and a Ped slow strain previously found to have detectable melatonin levels at nighttime, CBA/Ca, were studied. Two cell embryos were incubated with melatonin concentrations from 10-5 M to 10-13 M for 48 or 72 hours and the number of cells per embryo assessed quantitatively at the end of the incubation period. We used sufficiently high levels of melatonin to mimic the pharmacological concentration used in the oral contraceptive. It was found that there was no effect of melatonin on embryos from either mouse strain at any of the concentrations tested. Our results suggest that if conception occurs while melatonin is being administered to treat a range of conditions, it would not adversely affect the embryo. Â© Munksgaard.

AB  - Pentobarbital sleeping time was used as an in vivo pharmacological biomarker to determine the prenatal effects of 4-substituted amphetamines on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes in 6-week old progeny of mice. Although the pentobarbital sleeping time was significantly shortened in both males and females exposed to 4-benzyloxyamphetamine (4-BEA), marked reductions in sleeping time were seen only in females prenatally exposed to 4- hydroxyamphetamine (4-HA) and 4-propoxyamphetamine (4-PPA); suggesting thereby a sex-related difference in the pentobarbital hypnosis after intrauterine exposure to 4-substituted amphetamines. Gender differences were also found in the gross liver weights and liver to body weight ratios of 6 week-old mice born from mothers dosed with 50 mg/kg/day of 4-substituted amphetamines on pregnancy days 6-18. The marked sleeping time reductions among female pups exposed to 4-HA, 4-PPA and 4-BEA were accompanied by a corresponding increase in liver to body weight ratio, suggesting that shortening of sleeping time could have resulted from the increased metabolic disposition of pentobarbital in these animals. No differences in sleeping time were found in the offspring of dams treated with 4-ethoxyamphetamine or 4-methoxyamphetamine. The sleeping time measurements indicate that 4- substituted amphetamines produce variable postnatal effects in mixed function hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes when the developing mouse fetuses are exposed to designer amphetamines.

AB  - Cyclic AMP-responsive genes are regulated both positively and negatively by a number of constitutively expressed nuclear proteins. These proteins bind to cAMP-responsive DNA elements in their target genes and they are activated by protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation. The cAMP response element modulator gene encodes for several constitutively expressed products. However, a second intronic promoter within the gene is inducible and produces another negatively acting transcription factor, inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). ICER shows a diurnal pattern of expression in the pineal gland, but to date it has not been noted elsewhere in the brain. Here we show expression of ICER mRNA in hypothalamic magnocellular neurons following osmotic stimulation over a time course consistent with a modulatory effect on the expression of other immediate-early genes, such as c-fos. However, since ICER was not present in magnocellular neurons during parturition, its presence is not a prerequisite for the transient expression of c-fos. Â© 1995.

AB  - The relationship between plasma CORT concentration and reproductive state was investigated in New Zealand's common gecko, Hoplodactylus maculatus. This primarily nocturnal gecko has an unusual biennial reproductive cycle in which females are pregnant for about 14 months. In contrast to a previous report for a viviparous lizard, plasma CORT concentrations did not vary significantly in daytime samples among females at four different stages of reproduction (vitellogenic, mid-pregnant, late pregnant prior to winter dormancy, and spent). Significant seasonal variation in concentration (independent of reproductive state) was observed in daytime samples collected over an 8-month period (P < 0.001), perhaps reflecting seasonal patterns of growth and/or lipid deposition. Plasma CORT concentrations in summer were compared between night and day in spent and mid-pregnant females. A significant difference in concentration was detected in mid-pregnant females (P < 0.01), but unexpectedly, the concentration was higher by day than by night. No relationship of CORT with time of day was detected in spent females. There was a significant positive correlation between CORT and body temperature in day samples, but not in night samples. In contrast to many previous reports for reptiles, concentrations in females held in cloth bags showed no significant elevation during up to 2.5 hr in captivity. All groups sampled in this study had relatively low mean concentrations of CORT (â¤6.1 ng/ml), even those held captive for up to 2.5 hr. We conclude that plasma CORT plays no obvious role in maintaining the long gestation period in H. maculatus and that relationships among CORT, activity period, and body temperature need examination in a wider range of nocturnal and diurnal reptiles before consistent patterns can be identified.

AB  - Twelve-hour overnight pneumocardiograms were assessed for sleep architecture and sleep efficiency in two groups of healthy term newborn infants: a group exposed prenatally to cocaine alone or in combination with other drugs and a non-exposed group. Sleep was differentiated from wakefulness by an increase in heart rate, an increase in or variation in the duration and amplitude of the respiration and increased artifacts on the heart rate channel. Quiet and active sleep were determined by the regularity or irregularity of heart rate and respiration. In a sub-set of infants, the number of arousals during active sleep was calculated. Overall significance was confirmed by ANOVA followed by paired comparisons using the Student's-test. When compared to non-exposed infants within the first week of life, infants exposed prenatally to cocaine alone or in combination with other drugs demonstrated more wakefulness and less steep (P < 0.05), more frequent arousals during active sleep (P < 0.01), and the tendency of a higher proportion of active sleep compared to quiet steep. These findings may have implications to both behavioral and respiratory control findings associated with prenatal cocaine exposure. Â© 1995.

AB  - The influence of dosing time on embryotoxicity of valproate was investigated in ICR (Institute of Cancer Research, USA) mice under light-dark (12:12) cycle. A significant circadian rhythm was shown for embryotoxicity, with the highest value at 17:00 and the lowest at 01:00. No significant difference between injection at 17:00 and 01:00 was demonstrated for valproate concentrations in the embryo. The rhythm in the embryotoxicity seems to be related to the rhythm in the sensitivity to the drug. Embryotoxicity and valproate concentrations were significantly higher on gestational day 13 than day 7. The timing of drug administration (i.e, gestational stage and circadian phase) appears to be essential in the study of embryotoxicity of valproate in mice. Â© 1995.

AB  - Fetal intrauterine behaviour is not a stable situation but a continuous alternation of states characterized by significant changes in fetal motility, heart rate, hemodynamics, metabolism and response to stimulation. Associations between fetal heart rate patterns and movements occur from 26-28 weeks of gestation onwards. As fetuses grow older these variables become gradually more related temporally and clustered in behavioural states similar to those present in newborns. This article describes the technique of recording and analyzing fetal behaviour, its development in normal pregnancy and its influence on different physiological parameters that are assessed in clinical practice. Furthermore the deviations from the norm occurring in compromised fetuses are described. Â© 1995.

AB  - Nocturnal nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is increasingly used to treat chronic respiratory failure in a wide variety of conditions (myopathies, Ondine's curse, kyphoscoliosis, etc.) and allows a normal everyday life. Some of these diseases affect women of childbearing age. We report on a young woman suffering from primary alveolar hypoventilation, who presented with limitation of daytime activities, severe oxygen desaturation during sleep, polycythaemia and pulmonary hypertension. These abnormalities completely reversed after a few months of NIPPV applied through a nasal mask. Whilst under ventilatory assistance during sleep, she had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery of a normal baby. We suggest that in selected patients requiring NIPPV, pregnancy can be contemplated with a reasonable level of safety both for the mother and the child, provided that adequate mechanical ventilatory assistance during sleep is maintained throughout pregnancy.

AB  - Rabbits nurse briefly only once each night and are frequently both pregnant and lactating. To investigate the influence of the daily timing of nursing on parturition, does (n = 10 per group) were remated after giving birth and were allowed to nurse under one of three schedules: group 1 every 24 h in the light, group 2 every 24 h in the dark, and group 3 at any time. Whereas does from groups 2 and 3 nursed and gave birth normally, does of group 1, forced to nurse out of phase with the normal schedule, showed disturbed nursing behavior and prolonged gestation followed by many stillbirths. In a second experiment, pregnant does (n = 10 per group) were treated daily either with oxytocin (OT) in the light (group 4), with OT in the dark (group 5), or with progesterone (P; group 6) or saline (group 7) in the light. All does gave birth normally except those of group 4, which responded similarly to group 1 does. These findings demonstrate that in the rabbit, parturition may be seriously compromised if does nurse out of phase with the normal schedule and suggest that a shift in the daily timing of OT release may underlie this.

AB  - Previous attempts to find relationships between weather and parturition (childbirth) and its onset (the beginning of labor pains) have revealed, firstly, limited but statistically significant relationships between weather conditions much colder than the day before, with high winds and low pressure, and increased onsets; and secondly, increased numbers of childbirths during periods of atmospheric pressure rise (highly statistically significant). To test these findings, this study examined weather data coincident childbirth data from a hospital at Bryan-College Station, Texas (for a period of 30 cool months from 1987 to 1992). Tests for (1) days of cold fronts, (2) a day before and a day after the cold front, (3) days with large temperature increases, and (4) decreases from the day before revealed no relationship with mean daily rate of onset. Cold days with high winds and low pressure had significantly fewer onsets, a result that is the opposite of previous findings. The postulated relationship between periods of pressure rise and increased birth frequency was negative, i.e., significantly fewer births occurred at those times - again, the opposite of the apparent occurrence in an earlier study. The coincidence of diurnal variations in both atmospheric pressure and frequency of childbirths, was shown to account for fairly strong negative associations between the two variables. This same reasoning might explain the positive association found in an earlier study. A comparison has been made between childbirth and onset as the response variable, and the advantage is emphasized of using data from women whose labor is not induced. Â© 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of intrathecal sufentanil with a low dose of local anesthetic in an attempt to prolong analgesia in labor. Fifty-two patients received one of the following intrathecal study solutions: 2.5 mg of bupivacaine; 10 Î¼g of sufentanil; or 2.5 mg of bupivacaine plus 10 Î¼g of sufentanil. The mean duration of analgesia (min Â± SD) was significantly different among all three groups: 70 Â± 34 min for bupivacaine, 114 Â± 26 min for sufentanil, and 148 Â± 27 min for bupivacaine-sufentanil (P < 0.001). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were significantly higher in the bupivacaine group compared to both the sufentanil group and the bupivacaine- sufentanil group (P < 0.02), and were significantly higher in the sufentanil group compared to bupivacaine-sufentanil at 75 min postinjection and beyond (P < 0.02). Hypotension was not observed in the sufentanil group but occurred transiently in the other two groups (P = 0.09). There was no evidence of motor blockade, excessive somnolence, fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities, or postdural puncture headache (PDPH) in any of the patients. The addition of 2.5 mg of bupivacaine to 10 Î¼g of intrathecal sufentanil significantly prolonged labor analgesia without adverse maternal or fetal effects.

AB  - In Kenya, a sexually transmitted disease (STD) program implemented in 10 medical centers in Nairobi allows nurses to diagnose syphilis based on symptoms, have blood tests conducted to confirm syphilis, prescribe treatment, and provide counseling. About 5% of pregnant women in Kenya have syphilis but do not know that they are infected or are afraid to seek sexually transmitted disease treatment in health centers. This program tests all pregnant women for syphilis during the prenatal examination. Once syphilis is confirmed, the nurse educates the pregnant woman about syphilis and tells her that syphilis poses a risk to her baby and that she can be treated for syphilis. The nurse must also emphasize the need to treat the pregnant woman's sexual partner. Even though most women agree that the partner must be informed, many fear that the partner will react violently. Each pregnant woman with syphilis receives several partner notification cards asking the partner to go to a health center. The card does not mention syphilis. Once at the center, the man is told that his partner has syphilis. He is told that syphilis can affect the baby. Usually, the men are concerned about the baby. The men receive education on condom use and sexual practices because they have more control and initiative in sexual activity matters. Even though the men and women are advised to abstain from sexual intercourse for a week after treatment, some men have difficulty following this advice. The nurse discusses options relevant to both sexes (e.g., condom use with all partners). It is difficult for women to propose condom use because these decisions are to be made by the men. Women can learn how to use a condom and how to persuade her partner to use the condom. Some women sleep in a separate room or return to their family if their partner insists on sexual intercourse. Almost all pregnant women involved in the project were successfully treated and their partners were informed. More than 50% of the partners were successfully treated. The nurses are pleased with the program.

AB  - Studies of rodent photoperiodism have almost exclusively employed fixed photoperiods with abrupt shifts in day length (DL) of 4-8 h effected in a single day. Because DLs in nature change continuously and incrementally, rates of gonadal and somatic development were compared in the present study in hamsters exposed to gradually increasing vs. fixed DLs. Male hamsters gestated in 12 h light/day (12L) and exposed to DLs that increased gradually from 12L to 15.5L (experiment 1) or from 12L to 16L (experiment 2) weighed more and had larger gonads than did hamsters gestated and maintained from birth in a DL of absolutely greater duration (16L). Gradual increases in DL from 10L to 12L also resulted in more rapid somatic development than did gestation and maintenance in a static 12L photoperiod. The pattern of gradual increases in DL was not sufficient to accelerate development at all DLs but was effective in the range of 12L to 19L. Siberian hamsters are responsive to the pattern of photoperiodic change; the maximally stimulatory photoperiodic stimulus is not a fixed long day, but is instead increasing DLs, even those with absolutely shorter photophases; short gestational DLs potentiate the effects of longer postnatal DLs. The relations heretofore elaborated between fixed DLs and physiological responses differ from those obtained with more natural photoperiodic transitions.

AB  - To examine whether differences in sleep maturation could be identified before birth, behavioural studies were carried out in 28 fetuses. Studies were possible in all 28 fetuses at 28 weeks, but only in 26 fetuses at 36 weeks (two fetuses delivered before 36 weeks). The risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was determined using the Oxford SIDS scoring system. The fetuses at greater risk of SIDS had coincidence of behavioural characteristics for a significantly lower percentage of the time than those at low risk. This difference reached significance (p â¤ 0.05) only at 36 weeks.

AB  - Conclusion: IVF babies have more periodic breathing episodes indicating an immature respiratory pattern than normally conceived babies. Babies born after in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are increasing in number, and, although these babies are considered as very precious, no data are available regarding their risk for sudden infant death or apnoea. To evaluate the respiratory maturity of IVF babies, we evaluated the incidence of apnoea during an 8-h polysomnography in 50 consecutively presented IVF babies and in a group of 50 unselected naturally conceived babies. All infants were in good health and matched for term (born >38 weeks of gestation), birth weight, sex and age at the time of investigation (6-11 weeks post term, median 8.0). There were 24 twins in the IVF and 6 twins in the control group. The incidence of obstructive and isolated central apnoea was comparable in the IVF and control group. However, IVF babies had significantly more periodic breathing episodes than control babies (median 2.30 (range 0-15.30) in IVF, and 1.02 (range 0-11.2) in control babies;P<0.01). This difference was not related to the higher number of twins in the IVF group. Single IVF babies had significantly more short central apnoeas (5-10s) than IVF twins (5-10s) (mean 38.80Â±18.63 and 22.33Â±13.35;P<0.001). This difference between single and twin babies was not found in the control group. Â© 1995 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This article discusses the forms of sexual abuse of female children and the psychosocial impact on the well-being of girls in India. Child sexual abuse statistics reveal an estimated 50% of girls being sexually abused before the age of 15 years. Girl children are abused and then are made to feel personally responsible, guilty, or persecuted. Girls are threatened with violence if they tell about the sexual abuse. Pregnancies arising from sexual abuse result in shame and early marriage. Male children are also abused but they are not made to feel punished. Child sexual abuse is technically any sexual activity (rape, fondling of genitalia, masturbation, forced oral sex, sodomy, or vaginal penetration) that is committed by someone in a position of authority, power, or trust over the child or by a stranger. The World Health Organization estimates that 1 in 10 children worldwide is sexually abused. Rape within the family is particularly difficult for the victim. In almost 60% of rape cases, the victim was unwilling to report the name of the abuser. Families remain silent about sexual offenses in order to protect the family image. Mothers remain silent if the abuser is the father, which interferes with a child's relationship to both parents. Sexual abuse can result in bed wetting, nightmares, sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, running away from home, multiple personality disorders, precocious sexual behavior, or sexual inhibition and low self-esteem. Parental responses tend to be inappropriate discipline or ignoring it. Children may experience flashbacks or other long-term effects. Girls who experience sexual abuse once tend to be more vulnerable to abuse in adult life. Healing is slow and systematic. The first aim is to restore a girl's ability to say no and to teach her to protect herself. Healing is about removing guilt and resolution of the conflict between blame and the grossness of the violation.

AB  - Insomnia is a complex complaint which is often multifactorial in origin. Pharmacotherapy can only be an adjunct in the treatment of insomnia and hypnotics should be given on an intermittent basis for short periods of time. An overview is presented of the currently available hypnotics, of which benzodiazepines are still the most widely prescribed. New drugs which bind to specific receptor subtypes or which are partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists might overcome the disadvantages associated with chronic benzodiazepine use, but more longterm investigations are needed.

AB  - Flat heart rate recordings may be observed in different fetal states such as chronic distress and sleep. Their visual analysis do not allow the distinction between these two states. We used spectral analysis to study the heart rate patterns in 25 fetuses. Two significant (P &lt; 5 Ã 10-5) groups were apparent from the determination of the position of the maximum energy peak (PMEP) in the high-frequency band (0.20-0.50 Hz): a PMEP at about 0.20 Hz (group 1), and another around 0.30 Hz (group 2). The two groups did not differ in spectral density (SD). The outcome of neonates showed that group 1 fetuses made good progress and produced healthy neonates; whereas group 2 comprised cases of chronic fetal distress, or even death in utero, and neonatal distress. The significance of this difference in PMEP between fetal heart rate patterns in chronic distress and sleep is unclear. Studies combining the assessment of fetal movements and the determination of PMEP are planned. Â© 1995 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Torpor-like circadian variations of core temperature are well documented for suckling-age Zucker rat pups. To determine (1) whether this juvenile circadian rhythm is as strongly expressed in other rat strains, and (2) whether a similar rhythm is expressed in rabbit pups, we recorded core temperature and metabolic rate of artificially reared pups. Wistar, Brown Norway, and Long Evans pups were studied for 30 h under moderate cold loads (ambient temperature=28Â°C) when 9-11 days old, i.e. at the age and ambient temperature for which the rhythm has been most thoroughly characterized in Zucker rats. Chinchilla bastard rabbit pups were studied under similar conditions when they were 3-8 days old, the youngest age at which the rhythm can be easily detected in rats. Rat pups of each strain showed clear circadian rhythms with sharp decreases of core temperature and metabolic rate in subjective morning. Core temperature amplitudes were in the order Wistar < Brown Norway < Zucker < Long Evans strain. In contrast, the rabbit pups maintained stable high levels of core temperature and metabolic rate throughout the day. A torpor-like decrease of core temperature in the morning is thus not a pecularity of the Zucker rat strain but also occurs in other pigmented rat strains, whereas rabbit pups at a similar developmental stage do not show a circadian core temperature rhythm.

AB  - Profiles of serum prolactin (PRL) and progesterone (P4) were determined in repeatedly (every 2 h) sampled female Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus campbelli) over a 24-h period on Days 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 of the 18-day pregnancy. The first half of pregnancy was characterized by significant surges of PRL within a 2-h period around dawn (0500 h) and dusk (1900 h), with some females also showing a weak midday surge at 1300 h. By Day 9, dusk and midday surges were absent, but the dawn surge remained at its initial amplitude. On Day 12, no PRL surges were seen. Resumption of both the dusk and dawn PRL surges occurred on Day 15 of gestation. Considerable interindividual variability in the amplitude of PRL surges, the timing of PRL surges, and the number of surges per day was detected and would complicate any assessment of PRL levels based on single samples per female. Serum P4 concentrations were 8-10 ng Â· ml-1 before doubling on Day 15. A 3-day treatment of 50 and 300 Î¼g bromocryptine (CB 154; on Days 13-15) effectively suppressed PRL during late pregnancy (Day 15) but did not alter serum P4 concentrations or interfere with parturition. Therefore, surges of PRL are not an essential luteotropic stimulus during late gestation. Compared to oil- injected controls, CB 154-treated females had a higher incidence of infanticide postpartum. Growth rates of the pups, mammary gland development, and successful delivery of milk to pups, however, did not differ between groups. Further studies will be required to determine the function of late- gestation PRL surges.

AB  - The advent of ultrasound fetal imaging and the evolution of dynamic imaging (real-time) methods have opened great new vistas in which fetal responses can be monitored with remarkable precision and clarity. Contained within this new wealth of information may lie the key to direct determination of the fetus at risk for death or injury in utero. Consideration of fetal activities so plainly recognized by conventional dynamic ultrasound methods and an assessment of fetal environment appear to be integral parts of this process. It is reasonable to assume that composite assessment by the dynamic ultrasound-based PBS will remain a valuable adjunct in caring for the high- risk fetus.

AB  - To investigate the development of Arg-vasopressin (AVP) content and its diurnal rhythm in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), AVP was measured by enzyme immunoassay in the rat pup SCN punched out from tissue slices obtained at postnatal day (PD) 1, 5, 10, 12 and 20 from animals maintained under a light-dark cycle (LD). The AVP levels, measured at a restricted time of day, increased from PD1 reaching the adult level at PD10-12. Diurnal rhythm similar to that in adults was evident at PD10-12 under the LD conditions used. The peak value of AVP was observed at the earlier light period, and its trough occurred at the end of the light period. The circadian rhythm remained for 7 days under constant dark (DD) or constant light (LL) conditions. These results indicate that the AVP, one of the output signals from the SCN, starts to oscillate after PD10-12, and shows a free-running rhythm during the nursing period.

AB  - Exposure to nicotine by active and passive cigarette smoke is a common public health problem. Recent studies have demonstrated that human fetuses are also exposed to significant levels of nicotine and that there is a five-fold increase in the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome among infants born to smoking mothers. We examined the effect of nicotine administration and expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in the maternal and fetal rat brain by in situ hybridization. Nicotine injection (1 mg/kg s.c.) on embryonic day 20 (E20) induced detectable c-fos mRNA in the maternal habenula and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus whereas, in the fetal brain, c-fos was induced in both these structures and also in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Nicotine-induced c-fos expression in the fetal SCN was confirmed by Northern analysis and found to return to near basal levels by 3 h post-injection. These responses were blocked by pre-administration of mecamylamine, indicating that the effect of nicotine is mediated through the cholinergic system. Investigation of the development of this response revealed that nicotine failed to induce c-fos expression in the SCN on E16, caused minimal expression on E18, robust expression on E20 and postnatal day 0 (P0), and no expression on P2 or thereafter. These observations suggest that an alteration in the composition of the nicotinic receptors (nAChR), or the subsequent intracellular responses leading to c-fos expression, occurs in the SCN during the perinatal period. Induction of c-fos mRNA in the SCN by light has been associated with phase-shifts of the circadian system, however, the behavioral consequences of the transient sensitivity of the fetal and neonatal SCN to nicotine administration and the consequences for maternal-fetal entrainment remain to be directly determined.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the risk of the sudden infant death syndrome is increased in bottle fed babies. Design: Population based case-control study matching for age and time. Subjects: All babies aged 1 week to 1 year dying of sudden infant death syndrome during November 1987 to April 1989 or February 1990 to June 1991 and two live controls. Setting: Avon and north Somerset. Main outcome measures: Breast or bottle feeding, sleeping position, maternal smoking, parental employment, and length of gestation. Results: Compared with being fully breast fed, the crude odds ratio for sudden infant death in fully bottle fed babies was 3.1 and for mixed breast and bottle fed babies 1.5. These odds ratios fell to 1.8 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 4.8) and 1.2 (0.5 to 2.7) respectively after maternal smoking, parental employment, preterm gestation, and sleeping position had been adjusted for. Sleeping position partly masked the effect of being bottle fed on sudden infant death as breast fed babies were more likely to have slept prone than bottle fed babies. Conclusions: Bottle feeding is not a significant independent risk factor for the sudden infant death syndrome. Patterns of maternal smoking, preterm gestation, and parental employment status account for most of the apparent association with bottle feeding. Key messages Bottle fed babies are more likely to have mothers who smoke, to be born preterm, and to come from poorer families, factors which are in themselves linked with the sudden infant death syndrome Inclusion of maternal smoking, preterm gestation, and parental unemployment in the analysis substantially reduced the association between risk of sudden death and being bottle fed Being fully bottle fed is not a significant independent risk factor for the sudden infant death syndrome.

AB  - To evaluate the usefulness of a concurrent infusion in patient- controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), 40 patients scheduled for elective cesarean section under a combined spinal-epidural technique were assigned randomly in a double-blind fashion to receive sufentanil by PCEA with a concomitant infusion of either sufentanil or saline. The sufentanil 24-h consumption was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in those patients receiving the opioid-containing infusion (212.7 Â± 9.5 vs 128.4 Â± 10.8 Î¼g, SEM). The number of additional demands and the quality of sleep did not differ between the two groups. The degree of sedation was significantly less pronounced in patients treated with incremental sufentanil doses only. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at rest were identical in both groups except at 6 h (2.5 Â± 0.4 vs 3.7 Â± 0.3, in favor of the patients treated with the sufentanil background infusion). We conclude that, except for a lower pain score during the initial hours, a background infusion in PCEA with sufentanil does not offer major advantages in terms of sleep quality or sufentanil consumption. Side effects may be more pronounced owing to increased drug administration.

AB  - In mammals, a unidirectional communication exists between the biological clocks of the mother and fetus. As a biological clock begins oscillating in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the fetus, redundant circadian signals entrain the fetal clock to the prevailing light-dark cycle. Recent studies have revealed an activatable dopamine system within the fetal hypothalamus which may serve as a final common pathway by which maternal signals entrain the fetus. An entrained biological clock during fetal life makes the developing mammal better prepared for life in the outside world.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a circadian oscillator in mammals and shows day-night changes in metabolic activity. To investigate whether the fetal sheep SCN behaves as a circadian oscillator, day-night changes in c-fos expression, a marker of neuronal activity, were measured. Eight fetal sheep were sacrificed at 135 days gestationâfour at day-time (1200 hours) and four at night-time (2400 hours). Fetal brains were fixed, removed and cut in 40-/im serial coronal sections. Alternate sections were incubated with anti-Fos antibody (1:500) and Fos expression was revealed with extra-avidin-peroxidase and 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine or stained with cresyl violet. The number of Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-ir) neurons per mm2 in the rostral, intermediate and caudal regions of the fetal sheep SCN was counted. Fetuses sacrificed in the day-time showed a higher number of Fos-ir neurons per mm2 (meanis.e.; 516-7Â±60-l) in the three regions of the SCN than fetuses sacrificed at night-time (140-5Â±21-8). In addition, at night-time Fos-ir neurons were mainly localized to the ventrolateral area of the SCN. These findings demonstrate day-night changes in molecular activity consistent with the presence of a circadian oscillator in the fetal sheep SCN. Â© 1995 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To determine whether the circadian rhythm of circulating levels of insulinâlike growth factor binding proteinâ1 (IGFBPâ1) is evident at the time of delivery. Design Prospective observational study in six pregnant women and crossâsectional study in 65 women at the time of delivery. Subjects Six pregnant women sampled over a period of 24 hours, 23 women sampled at the time of elective caesarean section, and 42 women sampled at the time of vaginal delivery. Results In the women sampled serially over a 24 hour period there was an obvious circadian rhythm of IGFBPâ1 with a peak between 01.00 and 09.00 hours. In the women sampled at the time of delivery there was no evidence for any relationship between the time of delivery and maternal or fetal levels of IGFBPâ1. Conclusions The circadian rhythm of IGFBPâ1 is not observed in women in labour. Therefore, the time of day is not an important confounding variable in studies on IGFBPâ1 levels at the time of normal delivery. Copyright Â© 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration circadian rhythm is abolished in many endocrine and non-endocrine diseases. In the present study we have measured serum TSH concentration over 24 h every 2 h in second and third trimester pregnant women. During the 24-h period, serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine concentrations did not change significantly. In contrast, serum TSH concentrations demonstrated significant circadian variations both in the second and third trimester pregnant women (p < 0.02 and p < 0.005, respectively). In summary, second and third trimester pregnancy is associated with a normal circadian TSH rhythm.

AB  - A lowâmolecularâweight form of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), urinary gonadotropin peptide (UGP), has been isolated from the urine of pregnant women and of patients with cancer, mainly of gynecological origin. The clinical value of UGP measurement in gynecological diseases is under investigation but a preliminary study is necessary in order to ascertain whether there is a circadian rhythm in UGP production, to clarify the best way to express the results, and to establish the cutoff and decisional values. In our work we demonstrated a significant correlation between the UGP output and the UGP excretion normalized for urinary creatinine. A very significant agreement was even found in 24âhr urine collections and UGP concentration of a single morning specimen from the same patients. No evident circadian rhythm was found, although some patients presented morning levels of UGP higher than in other collections. UGP postmenopausal levels were higher than premenopausal. The cutoff level, adopting the 95.0 percentile, was 200 pmol/mol creatinine. Copyright Â© 1995 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Objective: Aim of the study was to identify one or more markers, among four variability indexes of the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) able to indicate the circadian biorhythm of the fetal activity at term of gestation. Methods: The Mean Minute Range (MR), the Long Term Irregularity (LTI), the Short Term Variability (STV) and the Interval Index (ID) of the FHR, are calculated by the computerized system Hewlett-Packard 2CTG during 90 minutes of cardiotocography, in the morning (8-10 a.m.) and in the evening (11 p.m.-2 a.m.), among 20 normal and 10 IUGR fetuses, and the averages in the morning and evening are compared. Results: Among the normal fetuses these indexes resulted greater in the evening compared to the morning. Among the IUGR fetuses these indexes resulted greater in the morning compared to the evening. The statistical significance has been evaluated (T-Test). Conclusion: The trend of these indexes between morning and evening indicate the preservation or the loss of the circadian cycle of the fetal activity, in order to recognize an early sign of fetal discomfort.

AB  - Circadian wheel-running activity was monitored in intact and gonadectomized female and male golden-mantled ground squirrels maintained in a 14L:10D photoperiod at 21 Â°C. Marked advances in phase angle of activity onset and increases in the duration of the daily active phase occurred each year in intact animals coincident with the phase of reproductive activity. Surprisingly, long-term gonadectomized squirrels of both sexes manifested similar seasonal changes in the circadian system. Seasonal circadian variations in locomotor activity are generated by a circannual clock independent from and not influenced by concurrent changes in secretion of gonadal hormones.

AB  - In consideration of the frequent association of hypertension and diabetes mellitus and also taking into account the acceleration of diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy by hypertension there are the following special uses of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in diabetic patients: Support in achieving the day and night tight blood pressure control according to the goals set by US recommendations on 130/85 mmHg for counterbalancing the increased cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. After a 10-year history of diabetes even normoalbuminuric diabetics have a reduced circadian blood pressure variation compared to newly diagnosed diabetic patients or to controls. A higher blood pressure load because of a reduced fall of blood pressure during night is a typical sign of all forms of diabetic nephropathy, beginning in the stage of microalbuminuria and probably even in a 'prealbuminuric' stage of high normal urinary albumin excretion. 10-30% of all nephropathic diabetic patients have an inverse circadian rhythm of blood pressure with higher blood pressure during night compared to daytime values. These 'inverters' have an advanced form of autonomic neuropathy and also of orthostatic symptoms. Recent analyses of heart period variability in 24-hour electrocardiogram have shown objective signs of autonomic neuropathy not only for advanced, but also for the early form of microalbuminuric nephropathy. This form of autonomic neuropathy is usually associated with a reduced circadian blood pressure variation. In pregnancy and in autonomic hypotension after insulin-injection 24-hour blood pressure monitoring is an important aid for risk analysis.

Design Circadian variability in urinary albumin excretion was studied both in pregnant women and in nonpregnant controls either during normal daily activities or in contrast during continuous bedrest with standardised fluid and food intake to study endogenously generated rhythm. Setting Outpatient department and metabolic ward of a university hospital. Main outcome measures Urinary albumin excretion during fixed time periods over the day and the night. Results Both ambulant pregnant and nonpregnant women have circadian rhythm in urinary albumin excretion but pregnant women have, firstly, a hgher 24 h urinary albumin excretion, secondly, smaller relative dayânight differences than nonpregnant controls and thirdly, in the metabolic ward some pregnant women demonstrate absence of rhythm. Conclusions The higher albumin excretion during pregnancy in 24 h urine collections can largely be explained by a higher excretion during the night, compared with that of nonpregnant women. The dayânight difference in urinary albumin excretion of ambulant pregnant women is exogenously determined. Copyright Â© 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - This communication reports the first use of a transmitter implanted into the abdominal cavity of a small pregnant rodent to simultaneously measure the heart rate, core body temperature and general locomotory activity with no apparent side effects to the animals. Using this method the heart rate of one female Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) decreased from a mean of 303 Â± 6 (SE) (beats per minute) during gravidity to a level of 248 Â± 3 (SE) (beats per minute) during lactation. At the same time, the core body temperature increased from 37.7 Â± 0.05 (SE) Â°C to 38.0 Â± 0.03 (SE) Â°C. During pregnancy the general locomotory activity of this female followed the normal nocturnal pattern for this species (i.e., greater activity during the dark period) but there was an overall reduction in activity to 85% of the nonpregnant state. The level of activity was further reduced during lactation to about 43% of the nonpregnant state. This was largely the result of less activity during the dark period so that activity in the dark period and light period became more or less equivalent. Â© 1995.

AB  - We have monitored parturition and different behavioral rhythms of does, the activity of suckling pups and behavioral rhythms of rabbits after weaning until adulthood. All animals were living in continuous light conditions (LL). As a consequence of the free-run of the does parturition, which takes place during the resting period of the animal, occurred at almost any time of the day. The once/day nursing was advanced during the first 7-10 days until it was in synchrony with the time of main activity. The pups significantly anticipated nursing by day 5: the 60 min bin prior to nursing exceeded the 24-h mean by 63 Â± 30%. The anticipatory activity (AA) was entrained by an artificial nursing schedule of T = 24 h, the 60 min bin prior to nursing exceeding the 24-h mean by 123 Â± 50%. Since AA persisted during a 48 h fast, its phase is controlled endogenously. At weaning behavioral rhythms of rabbits free-ran with a main tau <24 h (average 23:35 Â± 17â²), period length extending with increasing age. 7 10 animals had an additional component >24 h (average: 24:24 Â± 16â²) which became increasingly dominant, the components <24 h fading out within 30 days after weaning. Between days 340-350 a stable period length of 24:35 Â± 8â² and a consolidation of the circadian rhythms was attained. These results confirm that during the first days of the rabbit's life the circadian system is controlled by a feeding entrainable oscillator, the light entrainable oscillators taking over control later.

AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate by means of ambulatory 24 h monitoring the diurnal systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure profiles in a group (n = 18) of gravid patients with pre-eclampsia compared with a group (n = 17) of healthy control subjects matched for age and week of gestation to assess whether: (i) ambulatory BP is also raised in pre-eclampsia; (ii) the increase of BP, if present, occurs to the same extent during both daytime and night; and (iii) a blunted BP pattern is consistently present in preeclampsia. BP was recorded at intervals of 15 min for 25 h using a TM2420 non-invasive pressurometer. The presence of a circadian rhythm of BP was assessed by cosinor analysis. SBP was higher in women with pre-eclampsia (24 h average 115 Â± 11 vs. 136 Â± 12, P = 6 x 10-6; daytime 117 Â± 12 vs. 139 Â± 13, P = 6 x 10-6; night 110 Â± 11 vs. 129 Â± 14, P = 5 x 10-5) as well as DBP (24 h average 67 Â± 5 vs. 86 Â± 6, P = 8 x 10-12; daytime 69 Â± 6 vs. 89 Â± 5, P = 2 x 10-11; night 62 Â± 4 vs. 80 Â± 8, P = 5 x 10-10). DBP percentage reduction from day to night did not differ between the control subjects and the women with pre-eclampsia (9.6 Â± 6.5 vs. 9.8 Â± 4.6, P = 0.96), whereas SBP percentage reduction was greater in the latter group (5.4 Â± 4.6 vs. 8.1 Â± 5.5, P = 0.13). Cosinor analysis demonstrated the presence of a significant circadian rhythm of BP (P &lt; 0.0001) in both the control and pre-eclampsia groups. In conclusion, the results of our study show that ambulatory SBP and DBP are raised in pre-eclampsia and that a blunting of the diurnal BP pattern is not present in most women with the disease.

AB  - Experiments were carried out to define the effects of pregnancy on body temperature (T(b)) regulation in rats. T(b) was measured by biotelemetry in six animals from day 10 of pregnancy (term day 21) to postpartum day 10. Average 24-h T(b) decreased from day 15 of gestation to the time of parturition. Furthermore, there was a loss of the normal circadian variation of T(b) late in gestation, which was again present by postpartum day 2. The decrease in 24-h T(b) on day 15 of gestation resulted from this loss of circadian variation, as T(b) did not increase during the dark period. The further decrease in T(b) on day 20 of gestation resulted from an overall decrease in T(b) during the light and dark periods as well as from a loss of the circadian variation in T(b). T(b) increased dramatically within 4 h of birth of the first pup, which always occurred on day 21 during the light period. The mechanisms responsible for these dramatic changes in thermoregulation during late gestation and around the time of parturition are presently unknown.

AB  - Chronic sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland by bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) was performed on female rats 30 days before impregnation. The offspring, maintained in the dark from birth, had disruption of the malate dehydrogenase circadian rhythm in the testes at 25 days of age. A daily injection of melatonin (1 mg/kg s.c. at 10:00 or 18:00 h) to denervated mothers from the 14th day of pregnancy up to the 10th day postpartum produced one daily phase in the enzyme activity of testes in the offspring. Entrainment of daily enzyme activity also was obtained when the hormone was administered orally to the pups during the postnatal period or when pups were reared by intact (not denervated) foster mothers. The results indicate the involvement of the maternal pineal gland in the maternal transfer of photoperiodic information necessary for the coordination of the circadian system in young rats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies on the effects of cocaine in fetal animals have been limited to acute exposures to the drug. We hypothesized that a prolonged infusion of cocaine to the fetal sheep would initially interrupt normal behavioral state cycling but the effects would be short lived as the fetus gained tolerance to the drug. STUDY DESIGN: The study was performed in a university laboratory on six time-dated pregnant ewes at 125 days' gestation. Fetal sheep, surgically instrumented 3 days before study, were given cocaine hydrochloride 0.6 mg/min for 6 hours. Fetal behavioral state before, during, and after the infusion was compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Infusion of cocaine caused a drop in the percentage time that the fetuses spent in both rapid-eye-movement (p < 0.03) and non-raid-eye-movement (p < 0.001) sleep, which was sustained throughout the 6-hour infusion. This was related to a decrease in the number of rapid-eye-movement and non-rapid-eye-movement episodes as opposed to a decreased in the lengths of these behavioral states. With cessation of cocaine infusion, the fetal sheep showed an increase in rapid-eye-movement sleep, with a higher percentage than during control periods (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine disrupts fetal rapid-eye-movement sleep without evidence for tolerance to the drug over a 6-hour period. âCatch-upâ rapid-eye-movement sleep occurs with cessation of cocaine infusion. Neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with in utero cocaine exposure may be caused by chronic disruption of rapid-eye-movement sleep. Â© 1995, All rights reserved.

AB  - We report the existence of a âplacental clockâ, which is active from an early stage in human pregnancy and determines the length of gestation and the timing of parturition and delivery. Using a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 485 pregnant women we have demonstrated that placental secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a marker of this process and that measurement of the maternal plasma CRH concentration as early as 16â20 weeks of gestation identifies groups of women who are destined to experience normal term, preterm or post-term delivery. Further, we report that the exponential rise in maternal plasma CRH concentrations with advancing pregnancy is associated with a concomitant fall in concentrations of the specific CRH binding protein in late pregnancy, leading to a rapid increase in circulating levels of bioavailable CRH at a time that coincides with the onset of parturition, suggesting that CRH may act directly as a trigger for parturition in humans.

AB  - We investigated for the presence of circadian variation in uterine artery blood flow indices during the fate follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Twenty women with regular menstrual cycles underwent transvaginal color Doppler assessment of blood flow in the uterine arteries on two occasions precisely 12 h apart on the same day in the follicular phase. Ultrasound examinations were performed between 06.00 and 10.00 and repeated between 18.00 and 22.00. Indices of uterine artery blood flow included the pulsatility index (PI) and the timeâaveraged maximum velocity (TAMX). The changes in PI and TAMX were related to variations in serum concentrations of estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH). We noted a significantly higher PI and lower TAMX in the evening compared to the morning values, p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively. There was no significant change in estradiol or LH concentrations between morning and evening (p > 0.05). There appears to be a circadian rhythm in uterine artery blood flow occurring independently of these hormonal parameters. The circadian changes in PI and TAMX may be larger than the previously described effects of hormones on these parameters. The accurate interpretation of uterine artery blood flow indices should take these timeârelated fluctuations into account.

AB  - In this study it has been tested the usefulness of serum glycosyl protein (fructosamine) to diagnose diabetic pregnant women requiring insulin therapy. The analysis was performed on the base of obtained results of glucose tolerance test, glycemia level in diurnal profile, fructosamine level and its relationship to albumin level and total protein amount in serum pregnant women with carbohydrates intolerance. Calculated specificity and sensitivity of above mentioned measurements was too low. We can not concluded that it is necessary to include insulin-therapy in diabetic pregnancy on the base of fructosamine serum level even corrected by protein or albumin serum level.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether women with pregnancy-related leg cramps would benefit from oral magnesium supplementation. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-three women with pregnancy-related leg cramps were interviewed about their symptoms in a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial. Initial serum magnesium levels and diurnal magnesium excretion was determined in 50% of the patients. Oral magnesium or placebo was given for 3 weeks, after which new interviews and laboratory analyses were performed. RESULTS: Serum magnesium levels in these patients were at or below the lower reference limit, as is also often the case in healthy pregnant patients. Oral magnesium substitution decreased leg cramp distress (p < 0.05 compared with the placebo group, p < 0.001 compared with initial complaints), but did not significantly increase serum magnesium levels, excess magnesium being excreted as measured by an increase in urinary magnesium levels (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Oral magnesium supplementation seems to be a valuable therapeutic tool in the treatment of pregnancy-related leg cramps. Â© 1995, All rights reserved.

AB  - Circadian activity/Prenatal irradiation /Mouse The spontaneous circadian motor activity of first generation (F1) hybrid male C57BL/6XC3H mice irradiated with gamma rays on the 14th day of gestation was studied at the following ages: young (6â7 months), adult (12â13 months), and old (19â20 months). Doses were 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy. A 12-hour day-night cycle was maintained with light on at 6:00 hr. Spontaneous circadian motor activity was recorded with a capacitance-induction motility monitor for 48 consecutive hours. Activity was measured at 2-hour intervals, and the data stored on computer discs. The activity of the 1.0 Gy group recorded at 22:00 and 2:00 hr for young mice and at 2:00 hr for adult ones was significantly higher than that of the age-matched control group. Results suggest that male mice irradiated with 1.0 Gy at gestational day 14 show nocturnal hyperactivity in the young and adult stages. Â© 1995, Journal of Radiation Research Editorial Committee.

AB  - Light-dark (LD) cyclicity contributes to a number of reproductive events in the rat, including estrus cyclicity, and the timing of parturition and postpartum estrus. Constant light (LL) disrupts the female's cyclicity, and fertility is typically diminished. To ascertain whether constant light similarly diminishes the fertility of postpartum females, LL and LD animals were compared over three successive pregnancies on several reproductive measures including parturition, postpartum estrus and spontaneous ovulation, the timing of estrus relative to parturition, and the number, body weights, and viability of offspring. While the 24 h pattern of parturition differed for LL and LD groups, postpartum estrus and ovulation occurred reliably in both groups. The LD group showed greater variation in the birth-estrus interval, the result of a delayed estrus in those females giving birth late in the light phase. The likelihood of spontaneous ovulation and overall successful reproduction was high for both groups. Thus, unlike the cycling female, the fertility of the postpartum female is relatively unaffected by constant light. As such, these findings suggest that LD cyclicity is not critical for postpartum ovulation and estrus. Â© 1995.

AB  - Abstractâ Anecdotal reports have suggested that sleeping problems are a frequent complaint from parents of preterm infants. This prospective epidemiological study examined the incidence and stability of sleeping problems of very preterm (<32 weeks gestation at birth), preterm (32â36 weeks gestation) and fullterm infants, all admitted to special care baby units (SCBU) after birth, in comparison to healthy term infants over the first 5 years of life. Preterm infants were found to have fewer and shorter nightâwakings at 5 months. No differences in sleeping behaviour compared with healthy term children were found at 20 and 56 months of age. Similar significant, and moderate, stability of nightwaking from one age to the next were found for exSCBUâgraduates and healthy fullterm infants. Parental interventions such as staying the child until asleep and taking the infant into bed at night were related to nightwaking problems and increased parental distress. It is concluded that prematurity, and thus neurological immaturity and special care experience are less important than caretaking bf behaviour in the development of sleeping problems in both preterm and fullterm infants.

AB  - Blood pressure measurement is one of the most frequently used screening tests in pregnancy. However, conventional blood pressure measurement has several shortcomings; it provides a measurement that represents only a fraction of the 24-h blood pressure profile, usually under circumstances that may have a pressor effect, and the technique is fraught with potential errors. In the nonpregnant population the development of devices capable of accurately measuring 24-h blood pressure noninvasively is proving valuable in predicting the cardiovascular complications of hypertension. It is likely that this technique will also prove useful in pregnancy. Validation in pregnancy of such monitoring techniques should precede any widespread application. Reference values using oscillometric monitors are now available for 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement in pregnancy. Provisional data suggest that ambulatory blood pressure measurement could overcome the large sampling, measurement, and "white coat hypertension phenomenon" errors associated with conventional measurement. In addition, changes in the diurnal rhythm of blood pressure may have diagnostic significance in the prediction of preeclampsia. Outpatient monitoring using 24-h ambulatory blood pressure devices may reduce the need for inpatient assessment, which has very considerable implications in terms of cost and patient satisfaction.

AB  - The diagnosis of Gushing's Disease during pregnancy is complex because the biochemical features are obscured by changes in the normal hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis that occur during gestation. To date, treatment has not been successful and there is a high incidence of maternal and fetal complications. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with Cushing's disease who presented during her 16th week of pregnancy. Diagnosis was confirmed by the finding of elevated serum and urinary free cortisol levels with loss of the normal circadian rhythm of serum cortisol. Cortisol levels failed to suppress after a low-dose dexamethasone test but suppressed after a high-dose test, There was an exaggerated serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). Magnetic resonance (MR) scanning demonstrated a pituitary tumour and cure was effected by transsphenoidal surgery where tumour immunostaining for ACTH was removed. Postoperatively the patient made an uncomplicated recovery; serum cortisol and plasma ACTH levels were undetectable at 9 days following surgery and recovery of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis occurred at 99 days after surgery. Caesarean section was performed at 38 weeks of pregnancy and a healthy but small female infant was delivered. This case illustrates the biochemical features of Gushing's disease during pregnancy and is the first report of the use of CRH testing and MR scanning in this clinical situation. The cure by surgery and successful outcome for mother and infant, with preservation of normal anterior pituitary function, suggest that transsphenoidal surgery may be the treatment of choice.

AB  - Study objective. To study variations in serum relaxin concentrations during normal and abnormal human pregnancy and parturition and in umbilical cord blood. Design and patients. Diurnal variations were determined in samples collected every 2 hours for 24 hours (n=4). Variations during pregnancy were studied in samples taken every 4th week from normal pregnant women (n=26). Additionally samples were collected once a week from the 37th week of pregnancy and until spontaneous delivery (n= 5). Changes in relaxin during early pregnancy (gestational age: 30 to 97 days) were studied in serum from 12 normal pregnant women, 13 with spontaneous abortion and 38 with an ectopic pregnancy. Fetal serum was obtained at delivery from the umbilical vein (n=20). All samples were analysed for relaxin by an ELISA based on human relaxin antibodies. Main results. No diurnal variation in relaxin concentrations were found. In normal pregnant women relaxin concentrations increased during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. From week 14 to 24 a gradual decrease was found and the concentrations remained constant during the last part of pregnancy. No changes in concentrations were found immediately before or during spontaneous delivery. Women with abnormal pregnancies had lower serum relaxin values than normal early pregnant women. The relaxin concentration was significantly correlated to the serum HCG concentration in early pregnancy but not to the serum HPL levels after week 28. In the umbilical vein relaxin concentrations were low. Conclusion. The variation in circulating levels of relaxin during human pregnancy differs markedly from those found in other species. This suggests a different role for relaxin in human pregnancy. 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted

AB  - The introduction of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in pregnancy redresses the errors inherent in conventional sphygmomanometer measurement. The ambulatory monitors used need to be patient friendly and validated for pregnancy. Reference values for normotensive pregnancy have been established. Ambulatory blood pressure measurement may have potential in the further investigation of pre-eclampsia. In addition to describing absolute levels of blood pressure, the monitors facilitate investigation of diurnal variation and the newly described phenomenon of 'white coat hypertension'. On-going studies are currently evaluating prognosis with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in women referred with elevated blood pressure from the antenatal clinic. Among patients referred with conventionally diagnosed hypertension in the antenatal clinic and who were subsequently assessed on the day care unit with simultaneous ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the greatest number of adverse obstetric outcomes was associated with those patients identified as hypertensive by ambulatory monitoring.

AB  - Objective: To determine the long term cardiovascular effects in adolescents exposed to ritodrine during prenatal stage. Study design: Twenty-seven ritodrine-exposed subjects and 19 controls, of both sexes, clinically healthy, and born at normal term, were evaluated for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) each during 48 hours, with a Colin Ambulatory monitor. Data analysis were performed by individual Cosinor method, and non-parametric Mann Whitney's test and Lamotte procedures. Adolescents who were exposed to ritodrine showed losses in the HR rhythm and rising middle pulse values. Although SBP and DBP rhythm remains constant, the increase of maximum and minimum values for SBP as well as a rise of maximal rates of DBP suggest a possible hypertensive effect mediated by beta mimetic exposure. This study suggests a hypertensive effect mediated by beta mimetic exposure. Â© 1995.

AB  - Large room calorimeters are capable of rapid measurements that are usually made in hoods or small rooms. We evaluated the performance gains of four calorimeters constructed with modern control systems, sample gas preparation and data processing. Calibration of the calorimeters and instruments was performed in place, with traceability to international standards. Performance was evaluated by infusion of N2-CO2 gas and 243 24-h studies of individuals. Our subjects included children weighing 20 kg and adults engaged in heavy exercise. Errors for 24-h infusion measurements (n = 23) were -0.34 Â± 1.24% for oxygen consumption rate and 0.11 Â± 0.98% for carbon dioxide production rate. Calorimeter 90% response times were 2 to 8 min over a range of oxygen consumption rates from 100 to &gt;4000 mL/min. Closed-loop control of supply and exhaust air flows provided consistent 24-h mean CO2 levels (0.39 Â± 0.015%) and pressures (13.2 Â± 4.4 Pa). Room calorimeters operated with closed-loop control can be used for accurate measurement of energy expenditure rate dynamics for a wide range of individuals.

AB  - Effects of chronic maternal food restriction and time of day on maternal and pup behaviors were examined in ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 26). Dams were fed ad lib (AL) or were restricted to 85% (85 AL) or 70% (70 AL) of ad lib intake. Dams and their 5-pup litters were observed for 45 min at night on days 9, 14, and 19 of lactation and during the day on day 14. A novel behavioral instrument was used to observe maternal and pup behaviors. At night, food-restricted animals engaged in more nursing behaviors than AL animals. Differential pup stimuli may account for this difference. AL animals engaged in more nursing behaviors during the day than night, whereas 70 AL animals demonstrated the opposite diurnal pattern. Time of feeding may explain this difference. On the other hand, 85 AL animals behaved similarly during the day and at night. Therefore, alterations in circadian behavior patterns are less pronounced in rats mildly restricted (85 AL) than in rats more food restricted (70 AL). Â© 1995.

AB  - We have investigated whether the maternal melatonin rhythm provides the fetus with either a circadian or seasonal 'signal' during development. Our findings provide evidence that melatonin can generate and entrain the early evening peak in the daily rhythm of fetal breathing movements. In contrast, daily variations in maternal and fetal prolactin concentrations are present in pinealectomized ewes, are altered by changes in the time of onset of darkness, but are unaltered by changes in the phase of the daily melatonin rhythm. The mechanisms that generate and control the daily prolactin rhythm before and after birth are therefore unknown. It is clear from a number of studies that the duration of the nocturnal melatonin signal provides the adult and fetal sheep with photoperiodic information. We investigated whether there are differences in the fetal plasma concentrations of prolactin in ewes held in long and short photoperiods after surgical disconnection of the fetal hypothalamus and pituitary and demonstrated that there was a fetal prolactin response to the external photoperiod in sheep fetuses in which the hypothalamo-pituitary axis was either intact or surgically disconnected. We have suggested that one potential extrahypothalamic site of action of maternal melatonin is at the pars tuberalis of the fetal pituitary. It appears therefore that there are a number of different mechanisms for the neuroendocrine transmission of information about the time of day and duration of the external photoperiod to the sheep fetus throughout late gestation.

AB  - The effects of early (postnatal), long-term warm exposure on thermoregulatory system of rats were compared with those resulting from warm acclimation induced in adult animals. To obtain warm-reared (wr) rats pregnant females 7 days before term were permanently exposed to a constant ambient temperature of 35Â°C and their offsprings were housed under these conditions for at least 6 months. Wr rats differed from both control and warm acclimated (wa) animals morphologically as well as functionally. They were leaner and lighter but their tails and feet grew relatively bigger. Moreover, warm rearing led to a marked and highly significant elevation in mass of salivary gland (the main source of water for evaporative cooling). Core temperature in wr rats was regulated at a significantly higher level during the day and at night. Moreover, hyperthermia reduced the exercise performance less in wr than in wa rats. In conclusion, early exposure to high environmental temperature modifies the development of temperature regulation in a way different from that occurring during thermal acclimation in the adult. Changes occurring in wr rats might mimick genetical adaptations of a population to variety of thermal environments.

AB  - Objective. To map the conformity between 24âhour and conventional blood pressure (BP) monitoring (24BPM, CBPM) in pregnancy. Study design. Prospective comparative. Material and methods. A standardized single BP measurement and parallel 24BPM and CBPM were carried out in 99 women (125 recordings) hospitalized for hypertension. Results. Except for BP oscillation amplitude, corresponding variables correlated significantly between the methods. The mean systolic BP (SBP) was significantly higher with 24BPM compared with both CBPM (3.1 mmHg) and with the single BP measurement (4.6 mmHg). The mean diastolic BP (DBP) was significantly lower with 24BPM compared with CBPM (2.4 mmHg) and with the single measurement (2.7 mmHg). If a cutâoff at 140/90 mmHg had been used for the diagnosis of hypertension and with 24BPM as the golden standard, a false positive/negative diagnosis would have resulted in 35%/20% of cases with the single BP measurement, and in 24%/17% with CBPM. Conclusions. 24BPM and CBPM gave significantly correlated but different values of the BP. The differences were small in terms of absolute mm Hg values, but resulted in a high rate of false positive and false negative diagnoses of hypertension. 24BPM cannot substitute the traditional methods for BP monitoring in pregnancy unless a new definition of hypertension is established. 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted

AB  - Fetal maturation and the timing of parturition in both sheep and primates are thought to be controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis but little is known about the endocrinology of the equine fetus. We investigated the ontogeny of plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol and corticosteroid binding capacity in the late-gestation fetal horse. We also wished to determine whether there is ultradian rhythmic release of ACTH and cortisol in fetal horses and we compared fetuses to maternal and non-pregnant adult horses. Six fetuses, 278-304 days gestation (term ~335), were catheterized and sampled daily until delivery. Mean (Â± S.E.M.) ACTH concentrations increased significantly from 159 Â± 21 to 246 Â± 42 pg/ml over the last 2 days before parturition. Fetal cortisol increased significantly from 3.1 Â± 1.0 to 13.4 Â± 3.7 ng/ml (mean Â± S.E.M.) over the last 9 days before delivery. The slope of regressions for ACTH and cortisol concentrations with respect to time were positive in an subjects and statistically significant in 3 of 6 for ACTH and 5 of 6 for cortisol. Fetal corticosteroid binding capacity declined from 49.5 Â± 20.5 to 16.1 Â± 2.2 ng/ml (mean Â± S.E.M.) over the last 10 days before parturition. However, the greatest changes in ACTH, cortisol and corticosteroid binding capacity occurred very late in gestation, during the last 48 to 72 h before parturition. Significant peaks and nadirs in plasma ACTH concentration were detected in an 20 experiments and in plasma cortisol concentration in 17 of 20 experiments using Cluster analysis. We found statistically significant periods of oscillation between 11 and 64 min in plasma ACTH (19 of 20 experiments) and cortisol (15 of 20 experiments) using power spectral density analysis. Statistically significant periods between 11 and 17 min were detected in 11 of 20 experiments for ACTH and in 8 of 20 for cortisol. We conclude that: 1) at the end of gestation, equine fetal plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations increase while corticosteroid binding capacity decreases suggesting that there is a disproportionately large increase in unbound cortisol at this time; 2) the secretion of ACTH and cortisol is rhythmic in both fetal and adult horses; 3) most animals exhibit a period of oscillation between 11 and 17 min; and 4) there is no apparent developmental change from late gestation to adulthood in the ultradian oscillator influencing ACTH and cortisol secretion in this species.

AB  - Valproic acid (VPA) is an anticonvulsant drug known to cause spina bifida in humans. Administration of the vitamin, folic acid has been reported to decrease the frequency of VPAâinduced exencephaly in mice treated with the drug in vivo. A protective effect by folinic acid has not been observed in vitro. The purpose of this investigation was to reexamine the ability of folinic acid to decrease the incidence of VPAâinduced neural tube defects in vivo. We also examined the effect of increased intake of folic acid on zinc levels in various maternal and embryonic tissues. Folinic acid, whether administered by intraperitoneal injection or in osmotic miniâpumps, did not decrease the number of mouse fetuses with VPAâinduced exencephaly. Dietary supplementation with 10â20 times the daily required intake of folic acid in rodents also failed to decrease the embryotoxicity of VPA. Such dietary supplementation had no effect on zinc levels in maternal liver, brain, or kidney, nor in embryonic tissues. These results indicate that folic acid is not able to reverse the embryotoxicity induced by the anticonvulsant, that there is no apparent effect of high dietary folate intake on maternal or embryonic zinc levels and suggest that folate is probably not involved in the mechanism of VPAâinduced embryotoxicity.

AB  - The objective of the study was to describe the 24h blood pressure (BP) pattern in pregnant women with a reversed circadian BP rhythm. The 24h BP monitorings (24BPM) were performed in 73 pregnant women hospitalised for hypertension. Daytime (6.00 am to 10.00 pm) and night-time (10.00 pm to 6.00 am) BP variables were calculated. A reversed circadian BP rhythm was defined as a day/night mean BP ratio <1.0. Fourteen women had a reversed circadian BP rhythm. Their diurnal mean BP was equal to women with a normal rhythm, but their nocturnal mean BP was significantly higher and their BP oscillation amplitudes tended to be lower. The day/night mean SBP and DBP ratios correlated significantly, with the DBP ratios slightly higher than corresponding SBP ratios. At repeated 24BPM (n = 14), the day/night ratio did not change but a reversed rhythm occurred during anti-hypertensive medication in one case, and a reversed rhythm switched spontaneously to normal in one case. The diurnal BP pattern did not differ between women with a reversed and a normal circadian BP rhythm. Women with a reversed rhythm had a higher nocturnal BP, but this was part of the definition. The BP variations were generally smaller in the group with a reversed rhythm, although the variations were still large. The definition with a day/night ratio cut-off at 1.0 was rather a convenient mathematical choice than a biologically determined limit. The day/night BP ratio remained unchanged at repeated measurements, but a reversed rhythm was not a constant phenomenon in occasional cases. Women with a reversed circadian BP rhythm were therefore not a well-defined group and, with exception for a tendency to smaller BP fluctuations, no specific behavioural BP pattern could be described. Until the normal circadian BP rhythm in normal pregnancy has been described, there is no possibility to identify women with an abnormal circadian BP rhythm. Ideally, any definition of an abnormal rhythm should be related to the clinical relevance.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of surgical disconnection of the fetal hypothalamus and pituitary (HPD) on generation of the daily rhythm in fetal plasma melatonin and PRL concentrations under long and short photoperiods. Fetal HPD or a sham operation was carried out at around 110 days gestation. Ewes carrying either HPD fetal sheep (n = 10) or intact fetal sheep (n = 12) were exposed to a long light (LL; 16 h of light and 8 h of darkness) or a short light (SL; 8 h of light and 16 h of darkness) regimen for the remainder of gestation. All ewes were subjected to a 24-h blood-sampling experiment (13 samples collected between 0900â0900 h the following day) between 135â140 days gestation, and fetal and maternal plasma melatonin and PRL concentrations were measured using specific RIAs. The hormonal data were analyzed using multifactorial analysis of variance and cosinor analysis. There was an increase in maternal melatonin concentrations during the dark phase in each lighting regimen in ewes carrying HPD or intact fetal sheep. In the SL regimen, there was also a significant increase in fetal melatonin concentrations during the dark phase in the HPD and intact groups. Under LL conditions, however, fetal melatonin concentrations were only consistently increased during the dark phase in the intact, not the HPD, group. The 24-h mean fetal plasma concentrations of PRL were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in both intact and HPD fetuses in the LL (intact, 111.0 Â± 22.0 pg/ml; HPD, 37.6 Â± 7.3 pg/ml) than in the SL regimen (intact, 37.8 Â± 18.4 pg/ml; HPD, 6.7 Â± 4.3 pg/ml). There was also a significant interaction (P < 0.001) between the effects of fetal surgical treatment and time of day on fetal PRL concentrations. In the intact group, fetal PRL concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) at 1300 and 1700 h than between 0300â0700 h in both lighting conditions. Cosinor analysis also identified a significant rhythm in 8 of the 12 fetal PRL profiles in the intact group. In contrast, in the HPD group, there was no significant effect of time of day on fetal PRL in either the LL or SL regimen, and cosinor analysis only identified a significant rhythm in 2 of the 10 fetal PRL profiles in this group. We have, therefore, demonstrated that in the fetal sheep, HPD resulted in abolition of the diurnal melatonin rhythm under LL conditions and in the loss of the diurnal PRL rhythm under LL and SL conditions. These results provide direct evidence for a fetal hypothalamic role in generation of the diurnal rhythms in melatonin and PRL before birth in the sheep. Â© 1995 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that glucose abnormality, as shown by glucose tolerance test (GTT) periodicity, is not affected by different glucose loads, allowing for the identification of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) under varying glucose challenges. Methods: Eighty subjects were tested by multiple GTTs 1 week apart. Each woman served as her own control, undergoing a standard 3-hour, 100-g GTT; then, half of the subject group randomly underwent a 50-g and the other half a 75-g, 2-hour GTT. Subjects were classified using National Diabetes Data Group thresholds for the 100-g GTT. Those with two or more abnormal values were classified as gestational diabetic (GDM group); the rest of the women were considered to be nondiabetic. The projected time for the GTT to revert to fasting value, GTT periodicity, was then determined for each glucose load in the GDM and nondiabetic groups. Results: All glucose values for the nondiabetic group were significantly lower at 1 and 2 hours than those for the GDM group, regardless of the glucose load (P < .04). There was a statistically significant difference within the GDM and nondiabetic groups between glucose values of the 100- and 50-g GTTs at 1 hour (P < .02) and between all loads at 2 hours (P < .04). The GTT periodicity for the 3-hour, 100-g test was significantly longer for patients with GDM, as shown previously (5.6 Â± 1.9 versus 3.2 Â± 1.7 hours, P < .0001). In addition, similar values were found for nondiabetic and GDM subjects for the 75-g (5.1 Â± 2 versus 3.6 Â± 1.8 hours, P < .04), but not the 50-g load (2.2 Â± .6 versus 1.34 Â± .8 hours, P < .01). Conclusion: Glucose tolerance test periodicity will identify subjects with GDM regardless of GTT load because the physiologic disturbance of glucose level measured by this time period remains comparably longer than in normal subjects. We speculate that the relatively shorter cycle of the 50-g load may reflect an insufficient challenge to pancreatic function. Â© 1995 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Background: Changes in asthma activity, in part related to the female hormonal profile, have been observed during pre-menstrual periods and during pregnancy. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is an accepted routine treatment for post-menopausal women. The effect of ERT on disease activity in post-menopausal asthmatic women has not been investigated in the past and is the subject of the present study. Methods: Fifteen post-menopausal women with mild to moderate asthma completed two 30-day periods in which they measured peak expiratory flow (PEF) at home and filled in a daily diary of asthma-related symptoms. The first monitoring period was pre-ERT and the second was during ERT. In addition spirometry was performed on each woman three times, twice pre-ERT and once during ERT. Results: The average daily PEF decreased from 241 (57.9, S.D.) l/min pre-ERT to 226.7 (62.7) l/min during ERT (P < 0.004). Significant differences between the two study periods were also found in morning and evening PEF values. Diurnal variation, measured as the difference between morning and evening PEF values, decreased significantly from 22.3 (26.7) l/min pre-ERT to 17.5 (26.8) l/min during ERT (P < 0.007). The average daily consumption of bronchodilator inhalers increased significantly from 3.7 puffs/day pre-ERT to 4.3 puffs/day during ERT (P < 0.006). Although the differences in spirometry between the two periods did not reach statistical significance, a trend towards a worsening of the obstructive disorder during ERT was observed. However, the general feeling of well-being of the asthmatics did not change during the two periods. Conclusions: During ERT a sub-clinical worsening of disease activity was found in post-menopausal women with mild to moderate asthma. We also detected a decrease in diurnal variation. Our findings should be substantiated by additional studies. Â© 1995.

AB  - The effects of early handling on physiological and hormonal responses of rats exposed to ethanol prenatally were studied. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats from prenatal ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), and ad lib-fed control (C) prenatal treatment groups were either handled (H) or nonhandled (NH) during the preweaning period and tested in adulthood. Early handling eliminated the deficit in preweaning weight gain observed in E compared to PF and C offspring. In adulthood, early handling eliminated the increased hypothermia observed in E and PF compared to C males following an ethanol challenge (2.0 g/kg, IP). In addition, H males displayed marginally less hypothermia overall than NH males. In contrast, handling accelerated the return to preinjection temperature in PF and C females but had no effect on E females. There were no significant differences among E, PF, and C rats in corticosterone (CORT) responses to ethanol challenge (1.5 g/kg, IP), but both males (marginally) and females in the H condition displayed higher CORT levels overall than NH rats. Early handling also eliminated the increased peak CORT response to restraint stress in E compared to C females, but did not affect the more prolonged elevation of CORT in E compared to PF and C females. There were no differences among E., PF, and C females in hippocampal type I and type II glucocorticoid receptor density or affinity. However, binding affinity of type II receptors was slightly but significantly increased in H compared to NH females. Together, these data indicate that early handling may modulate or attenuate some, but not all, of the adverse effects of fetal ethanol exposure on offspring growth and physiological responsiveness.

AB  - Little is known about the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental hemodynamics during pregnancy. Experiments were therefore carried out on six chronically instrumented pregnant ewes (125-133 days of gestation) to investigate the influence of sleep on systemic and uteroplacental hemodynamics. Because nonlabor myometrial activity influences uteroplacental hemodynamics, we made measurements during quiet wakefulness, quiet sleep, and active sleep in the presence and absence of myometrial activity. Cardiac output, heart rate, and systemic arterial pressure were decreased in active sleep compared with quiet wakefulness; these variables were not significantly altered by myometrial activity. The interaction between sleep and myometrial activity was such that the lowest values of uteroplacental blood flow, as estimated from middle uterine artery blood flow to the pregnant uterine horn and, hence, uteroplacental oxygen delivery occurred during active sleep in the presence of myometrial activity (i.e., decreased ~19% compared with quiet wakefulness and the absence of myometrial activity). Further investigation is required to determine the possible fetal consequences of a reduced uteroplacental perfusion in the presence of myometrial activity during sleep.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between fetal behavior and maternal anxiety during pregnancy. The study population consisted of 18 uncomplicated human pregnancies at 38 to 40 weeks gestation. Maternal anxiety was assessed one time using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. After an overnight fast, each mother was given a standard meal on arrival to the fetal testing unit. Each fetus was examined for 4 hours using heart rate monitoring and real-time sonography. Fetal behavioral states were assigned based on heart rate pattern and the presence or absence of eye and gross body movements. We found that, compared with fetuses of mothers with low trait anxiety scores, fetuses of mothers with relatively high trait anxiety scores spent significantly more time in quiet sleep and exhibited less gross body movement when in active sleep. The results of this pilot study raise the possibility that maternal anxiety during pregnancy may have a significant effect on fetal behavior. Â© 1995 by Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Theophylline has been widely used as a bronchodilatory drug for the treatment of neonatal apnoea in premature newborns and patients with obstructive airways disease. The development of analytical equipment and procedures to determine the systemic concentration of theophylline renders it possible to improve the effectiveness of theophylline therapy and reduce the incidence of toxic and adverse effects. Since the beginning of the 1970s, endogenous and exogenous factors (e.g. age, blood pH, concomitant diseases and drug therapy, meal preparation procedures, nutritional habits, pregnancy, gender, smoking and, to a lesser extent, biorhythms), influencing nearly all parameters of theophylline pharmacokinetics have been described. Drug absorption depends on galenic formulation, drug delivery, nutritional habits and the chemical derivatives used. The mean plasma protein binding rates depend on the method of plasma protein determination: acidic blood pH values and advanced age may result in reduced plasma proteins. The volume of distribution depends primarily on age; it is 2-fold greater in newborns than in adults. Furthermore, changes in blood pH values, the plasma protein content and the administration of concomitant drugs may vary this parameter. Biotransformation is the most clinically important pharmacokinetic parameter. Hepatic metabolism accounts for 90% of the metabolism of theophylline. Essentially, 2 microsomal isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system appear to be responsible for the N-methylation and 8-hydroxylation of the drug. Age and concomitant disease are the major endogenous effectors influencing biotransformation of theophylline, whereas biorhythms, gender and pregnancy are of lesser importance. Exogenous factors, such as concomitantly administered drugs, smoking and nutritional factors, affect biotransformation by inducing or inhibiting the metabolising enzymes. Because of intra- and interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, which may be increased by the presence of endogenous and/or exogenous effectors, it is necessary to supervise theophylline therapy by therapeutic drug monitoring if target concentrations are to be achieved.

AB  - This study explored mothersâ representations of infant sleep before the birth of their infants. 120 primiparas women were interviewed about their sources of information about infant sleep, whether infant sleep could or should be induced and how this might be done and about why infants wake. Most pregnant women believed that sleep is a spontaneous phenomenon, nevertheless they foresaw using sleep-inducing techniques. Caressing was preferred as a sleep-inducing technique, followed by rocking, talking and singing. Awakenings were mostly ascribed to malaise and hunger; sufficient sleep was rarely cited. The wide range of sleep-inducing techniques expectant mothers are willing to use, together with the contradictory belief about sleep spontaneity suggests that they do not have a consistent concept of infant sleep.

AB  - The issue of the relationship between sleep and development could be posed in the following terms: (1) does sleep have a function for development? and (2) which is the specificity of sleep function during development? Is it possible to assess critical ages of emergence and decline of specific sleep functions? The results of recent investigations related to the so-called ontogenetic hypothesis for the function of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep will be reviewed; suggestions are put forward concerning the possible role of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Because of the difficulties to provoke long-lasting sleep deprivation in humans during development, two different approaches were used. The results of one set of analyses concerned the secretion of growth hormone during sleep under normal and pathological conditions and the relationship between sleep organization and nutritional supply utilisation in infants and children. The second approach aimed at investigating the long-term development of children suffering from sleep abnormalities at earlier ages. Furthermore, the role of dreaming during development will be discussed. The data summarized here only partly support the function of sleep during development; we would like to underscore the difficulty to dissociate the function of sleep from that of waking. Â© 1995.

AB  - This correlational study was conducted to examine the relationship between maternal sleep during the nights prior to the onset of labor and labor outcomes of length, type of delivery, and maternal perceptions of labor. Subjects (N = 99) were drawn from childbirth education classes at a women's hospital in the southeastern United States. Subjects completed the Visual Analog Sleep Scale each morning, beginning two weeks prior to their due dates. Following delivery, subjects completed the Perception of Labor and Delivery Scale, and researchers gathered data about their labors. These women reported poor sleep effectiveness coupled with high sleep disturbance; however, there were no significant correlations between sleep quality and length of labor or maternal perceptions of labor for either the night, or the week, prior to the onset of labor. This finding leads us to question the view that disturbed prenatal sleep will interfere with the progress of labor and lead to more cesarean sections. Â© 1995, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior studies have found an increased incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes of pregnancies in asthmatic mothers, but these studies have been poorly controlled for asthma therapy and other confounding factors. The purpose of this study was to assess perinatal outcomes in actively managed pregnant asthmatic women as compared with matched nonasthmatic controls. Using an inception cohort design, we studied a volunteer sample of 486 pregnant (< 28 wk) women with documented asthma and 486 pregnant nonasthmatic controls with normal pulmonary function. Cases and controls were matched for age, smoking status, parity, and year of delivery. Asthma was managed with step therapy to prevent acute asthmatic episodes and asthma symptoms that interfered with sleep or normal activity. Chronic hypertension was significantly more common (p = 0.007) in asthmatic subjects (3.7%) than in matched controls (1.0%). However, no significant differences in incidences of preeclampsia, perinatal mortality, preterm births, low-birth-weight infants, intrauterine growth retardation, or congenital malformations were observed in the pregnancies of the asthmatic women as compared with the matched controls. Trends were observed toward relationships between more severe asthma requiring emergency therapy or corticosteroids and increased incidences of preeclampsia and low-birth-weight infants, but these associations were not statistically significant. These data suggest that the overall perinatal prognosis for women with actively managed asthma during pregnancy is comparable to that for the nonasthmatic population.

AB  - The rate of fetal urine production and the incidence of fetal micturition was compared in periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Sonography and fetal heart rate monitoring were concomitantly performed on 12 normal term pregnancies. Fetal bladder volumes were serially calculated, and the rate of urine production and micturition were compared between the periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal micturition occurred almost exclusively during periods of fetal awakeness (p = 0.001). There were no demonstrable differences in the rates of urine production during periods of fetal sleep and awakeness. Fetal micturition is behavioral-state dependent. Nevertheless, the fetal behavioral state is not a necessary consideration when applying urine production measurements as a test of fetal well-being.

AB  - Sleep disorders in children are increasingly common in pediatric practice. Their prevalence among the pediatric population may reach 30%. Sleep disorders include: learned nocturnal feeding, learned nocturnal crying, resistance to sleeping, and sharing parents' bed. These disorders are caused by errors in learning sleeping habits. The parents' behavior in putting the child to sleep are associated by the child with sleep. Sleep problems may eventually lead to poor daytime performance by the child and family disturbances (sometimes including rejection of the child). Sedative treatment addresses only the symptom (insomnia), not the cause; when discontinued, the child's behavior remains the same. The only effective long-term therapeutic mechanism is re-education of sleeping habits.

AB  - The frequency and duration of gastroâoesophageal reflux were examined in 40 preterm infants and compared with a previously published healthy cohort of 74 term infants. Selection required that the infants were born between 24 and 32 weeks' gestation, had a normal head ultrasound and were studied at term postâmenstrual age. Multiâchannel pen recordings of sleep state, movement, breathing and acid reflux were made. In term and preterm infants the frequency and duration of reflux were greatest in active sleep, rare in quiet sleep and significantly less in preterm than term infants in wakefulness and active sleep (p<0.05). The fewer and shorter episodes in preterm infants could not be explained by sleep state, movement, gestational or postnatal age, days intubated, days on oxygen or the lowest pH of reflux episodes.

AB  - Well defined periods of active (AS) and quiet sleep (QS) are detected as early as 27 weeks gestational age (w GA). Beyond 35 w GA, the amount of indeterminate sleep is reduced to < 10% and, up to the normal term, sleep is marked by the prevalence of AS. AS differs from QS by faster respiratory and heart rates, more central respiratory pauses, lower amplitude of high frequency heart rate variability (parasympathetico-dependent) and higher amplitude of low frequency heart rate variability (sympathetico-dependent). In artificially ventilated infants, breathing is more dependent on the ventilator in QS than in AS. When they reach term, compared with normal full-term newborns, infants with intra-uterine growth retardation or prematurity do not show significant differences of sleep structure, but present in both AS and QS, faster heart and respiratory rates, more respiratory pauses and less heart rate variability; however, sleep-states-related cardiorespiratory modulations appear similar.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that sleep disruptions would be evident in 3-year-old children with a history of prenatal marijuana exposure. Design: A prospective study using stratified random sampling beginning in the fourth month of pregnancy. Marijuana and other substance use were assessed by interviews at multiple time points. Offspring were followed up through age 3 years with multidomain assessments at fixed time points, including electroencephalographic sleep studies in the newborn period and at age 3 years. Setting: Primary care, prenatal clinic at a university hospital. Subjects: The sample included 18 children with prenatal marijuana exposure (mean [Â±SD] age, 39.0Â±4.4 months) and 20 control children (mean [Â±SD] age, 39.7Â±4.4 months). The two groups were similar in relationship to maternal age, race, income, education, or maternal use of alcohol, nicotine, and other substances in the first trimester. Main Outcome Measure: Sleep variables from polysomnographic recordings at age 3 years. Results: Children with prenatal marijuana exposure showed more nocturnal arousals (mean [Â±SD], 8.2Â±5.3 vs 3.2Â±4.6; P <.003), more awake time after sleep onset (mean [Â±SD], 27.4Â±20.0 vs 13.7Â±12.4 min; P<.03),and lower sleep efficiency (mean [Â±SD], 91.0Â±3.8 vs 94.4Â±2.1; P<.03) than did control children. Conclusion: Prenatal marijuana exposure was associated with disturbed nocturnal sleep at age 3 years. Â© 1995, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

This hypothesis, although not exclusive, differs (a) from the theory of Roffwarg et al. that REM sleep substitutes for 'wakefulness' during the period (early life) in which wakefulness is limited, (b) from the theory of Crick and Mitchson, i.e., the 'unlearning' hypothesis of REM sleep, (c) from the theory of Jouvet, i.e., that REM sleep is a time for genetic read-out and (d) from the theory of Freud, i.e., that dreams fulfil our wishes (in other words, activation of neuronal systems that were disproportionally activated during wakefulness).

AB  - Repeated alteration in episodes of quiet sleep and active sleep is a basic feature of behavioral state organization in human fetuses. When compared to normal fetuses, at-risk fetuses generally exhibit extended periods of no coincidence (PsNC), that is, associations between state variables that cannot be classified as a sleep state. The purpose of this study was to determine if fetuses with extended PsNC differ in other state measures from fetuses with short PsNC. Fetal heart rate and fetal eye and gross body movements were collected simultaneously on 85 normal human fetuses between 37 and 41 weeks gestation for a total of 9, 135 minutes (mean 108.8 Â± 12.7 minutes, range 85-130 minutes). We found that as percent PsNC increased, the frequency (r = 0.464, p &lt; 0.0001) of state changes increased and the time spent in active sleep (r = 0.456, p &lt; 0.0001) and the number of fetuses entering an awake state (x2 = 4.26, p &lt; 0.039) decreased. In contrast, percent PsNC was independent of the length of time spent in quiet sleep (r = 0.070, p &gt; 0.05). We interpret these findings as an indication that extended PsNC may be the result of disruption of homeostatic control mechanisms during active sleep.

AB  - This study assessed effects of prolonged prenatal cocaine exposure on respiratory pattern and sleep-wake states in a postnatal porcine model. Yucatan miniature sows received 2 mg/kg cocaine intravenously four times daily during 0.66-1.0 gestation. At birth, cocaine-exposed litters were fostered to unexposed paired sows and their litters. Chronically instrumented piglets were studied at 3-9 (young) and 21-31 days (older). Sleep-wake states were determined from electrocorticogram, eye movements, submental electromyogram, and behavior, and respiratory patterns were determined from diaphragmatic and posterior cricoarytenoid electromyograms (EMGdi and EMGpca, respectively). Under baseline conditions, prenatal cocaine 1) increased the number of apneas expressed by silence of EMGdi or EMGpca and prolonged the duration of EMGpca-related apneas at both ages; 2) increased the number of periodic breathing episodes at both ages; 3) increased percent time of active sleep and decreased that of wakefulness at both ages; and 4) increased time in quiet sleep in the older animals, producing in them a sleep-wake distribution similar to that of the young neonates. Whereas the findings in the youngest piglets may have been influenced by persistent systemic cocaine, these in the older preexposed piglets, devoid of systemic cocaine, imply that chronic prenatal cocaine retards the postnatal maturation of state and respiratory pattern.

AB  - Objective. To assess the physical and neurodevelopmental status of children born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) as well as the family condition. Design. Follow-up study including physical and developmental examination in available families, and/or interviews of parents/pediatricians/teachers/social workers. Setting. The Port-Royal neonatal intensive care unit and follow-up clinic. Subjects. From 1.1.1987 to 31.12.1992, in 32 single, 71 twin, 28 triple, and one quadruple pregnancies resulting from IVF (total 132), one or more neonates were admitted to the Port-Royal NICU. The outcome is presented for the 99 families followed longer than two years (199 neonates, 166/199 born prematurely). Main outcome measures. Neurological sequelae (minor, moderate, major), developmental quotients, school level, behavioral disturbances, family conditions. Results. From 21 singletons (2 deaths, 1 lost), 18 survivors were followed: 17 were normal above 2 years (10 above 3 years went to school), 1 had a severe cerebral palsy with low IQ. From 57 twin pregnancies (7 fetal and 9 neonatal deaths), the 98 survivors were followed: 78 were normal above 2 years (65 above 3 years went to school), 20 had some neuro-developmental deficits (of 14 above 3 years, 12 went to school); 25 families had had or still had problems (deaths and/or anomalies (9 cases) and/or sequelae); 3 mothers were single parents (2 divorces and one split). From 20 triple pregnancies (1 fetal and 3 neonatal deaths), 54 out of 56 survivors were normal above 2 years (33 above 3 years went to school); 3 siblings (1 deaf and 1 with cataract) were put in foster care after severe maternal beating; 2 mothers were single parents (one divorce and one split); 4 mothers had repeated breakdowns; one father tried suicide. From one quadruple pregnancy (one fetal and one neonatal deaths), the 2 survivors were normal above 3 years and went to school. Most sequelae involved very low birthweight babies, in association with a number of sleep and behavioural disturbances. From 98 mothers, 16 had 18 spontaneous pregnancies (11 full-term newborns, 5 miscarriages, 1 extra-uterine pregnancy, 1 abortion) and 3 mothers had another IVF pregnancy (a few others had IVF failures). Conclusions. The data indicate a high rate of sequelae and deaths in the group of twin births, in contrast to a low rate of sequelae or deaths in the group of triplets in which pregnancies were carefully prolonged; however, families with triplets are highly dissatisfied in the 3 first years after birth, mainly from fatigue. We advocate more restrictive indications of IVF, a thorough evaluation of parents to be, more information of 'sterile' couples about the risks of multiples pregnancies, more preventive hospitalization and education of mothers for twin pregnancies, and more social help in the first 3 years of triplets.

AB  - Objective: To identify the effectiveness of âfacilitated tucking,â a nonpharmacologic nursing intervention, as a comfort measure in modulating preterm neonates' physiologic and behavioral responses to minor pain. Design: Prospective, repeated measure, random sequencing, and experimental. Setting: Level III neonatal intensiveâcare unit of a tertiary care university pediatric hospital. Participants: Thirty preterm neonates, 25â35 weeks gestation. Interventions: Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and sleep state were recorded 12 minutes before, during, and 15 minutes after two heelsticks, one with and one without facilitated tucking. Hypothesis: Premature neonates will have less variation in heart rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, shorter crying and sleep disruption times, and less fluctuation in sleep states in response to the painful stimulus of a heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. Results: Neonates demonstrated a lower mean heart rate 6â10 minutes postâstick (p < 0.04), shorter mean crying time (p < 0.001), shorter mean sleep disruption time (p < 0.001), and fewer sleepâstate changes (p = 0.003) after heelstick with facilitated tucking than without. Conclusion: Facilitated tucking is an effective comfort measure in attenuating premature neonates' psychologic and behavioral responses to minor pain. Copyright Â© 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Maternal cigarette smoking has a high correlation with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a condition in which cardiorespiratory failure occurs during an hypoxic episode, as in sleep apnea. Pregnant rats were given nicotine infusions of 2 or 6 mg/kg/day throughout gestation, regimens that produce plasma nicotine levels spanning the range in smokers. The day after birth, animals in the high dose group displayed excessive mortality during hypoxic challenge. These animals were found to be deficient in an essential response component, namely adrenomedullary catecholamine release that is required to maintain neonatal cardiac rhythm during hypoxia; the defect was in adrenal cell function rather than in altered innervation or nicotinic receptor desensitization. We also examined brainstem and forebrain noradrenergic mechanisms that are involved in neonatal respiratory control. The nicotine group showed suppressed spontaneous neuronal activity, but were hyperresponsive to hypoxia. As these projections are inhibitory for respiration, the nicotine-induced sensitization would be expected to contribute to respiratory arrest during hypoxia. Prenatal nicotine exposure may thus provide a useful animal model with which to study the physiological mechanisms that underlie Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, while at the same time providing a biological explanation for the association of the syndrome with smoking.

AB  - The separate and combined effects of prenatal cocaine exposure and malnutrition on mother-pup interactions in rats were assessed daily from postnatal day 2 to day 21. Sprague-Dawley dams were fed a diet of low protein content (6% casein), an isocaloric diet of adequate protein content (25% casein, control), or a laboratory chow diet prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. Within each diet group, rats received either cocaine injections (30 mg/kg IP two times per week prior to mating and then 30 mg/kg SC daily from days 3 to 18 of pregnancy) or saline injections. Litters were fostered on the day of birth to control mothers (i.e., nondrug-exposed dams fed the control or chow diet). Foster mothers fed the 25% casein diet showed increased contact with cocaine-exposed pups compared with nondrug-exposed pups in the second postnatal week but lower levels as the pups approached weaning. Passive nursing was increased in dams caring for prenatally malnourished, cocaineexposed pups compared with those caring for similar pups with no drug exposure. Chow-fed mothers did not differ in their behavior towards pups with or without prenatal cocaine treatment. Prenatal cocaine and malnutrition independently compromised birth weight and various reflexive milestones but the attainment of physical milestones was affected only by prenatal cocaine. There were no additive effects of the two prenatal insults on any measure of mother-pup interaction or pup development. Â© 1995.

AB  - Wistar rats were exposed to dichlorvos [CAS number 62737]. Doses were 1/25; 1/50; 1/75; and 1/100 LD50, that is 3.88; 1.94; 1.46; and 0.97 mg kg-1 DDVP, respectively, throughout gestation (GD1-birth) and during suckling via oral dosing to the dams, and then via the same doses by gavage for the rest of their lives. The offspring were tested in an open field (OF), a multiple T-maze, and in a ânovelty-induced- groomingâ test to assess behavioural competence as adults. Dose-related increases in running time and incorrect choices in the maze were observed during the first 2 weeks of a 3-week study at 9-11 weeks of age. Horizontal activity was increased, vertical activity decreased, and defecation decreased in the OF at 9-12 weeks of age; these changes were again dose-related. Sleep was also affected at 12 weeks of age. AChE activity in the brain and in blood at sacrifice was roughly 40% to 65% of control, again reflect ing the doses administered. The significantly changed behavioural profile of DDVP treated rats may serve as a useful biomarker to judge functional damage of CNS prop erties. Â© 1995, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Obstruction of the upper airway could be an initiating factor in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Responses to upper airway obstruction include augmentation of respiratory efforts, active dilation of the upper airway and electrocortical arousal. Vulnerable individuals may fail to mount these responses effectively. 2. Respiratory and arousal responses to obstruction of the upper airway have been investigated in newborn lambs. In conscious lambs, nasal obstruction causes a profound augmentation of inspiratory efforts, mild asphyxiation and eventual formation of an oral airway. The ability to establish an oral airway involves both chemoreception and mechanoreception and improves with age. 3. In sleeping lambs, obstruction of tidal airflow leads to progressive hypoxaemia, augmentation of inspiratory efforts, bradycardia and arousal. Arousal occurs earlier and with less hypoxaemia and bradycardia in nonâREM sleep than in REM sleep. Arousal occurs after inspiratory efforts have increased to the same extent during both sleep states, suggesting that mechanoreception, or a sense of inspiratory effort, is important in initiating arousal. 4. Obstruction of nasal tubes tends to cause arousal from sleep earlier, and with less hypoxaemia and less augmentation of inspiratory effort, than when a more compliant face mask is obstructed. This supports the suggestion that mechanoreception, which may be involved in the perception of inspiratory effort, is a determinant of arousal. 5. With increasing postnatal age, lambs become less arousâable in response to airflow obstruction when in REM sleep. This suggests that lambs may become progressively more vulnerable to the effects of airway obstruction during the immediate newborn period. 6. The ability to respond to upper airway obstruction is well developed at birth in normal lambs. Responses are affected by sleepâwake states, mode of airflow obstruction and postnatal age. Future studies will determine whether prenatal compromises, such as those thought to have influenced neural development in some SIDS victims, affect the ability of the neonate to respond adequately to upper airway obstruction.

AB  - A mailed questionnaire survey was conducted on a population of 123 mothers of twins and 96 mothers of triplets to study problems in the families and maternal fatigue symptoms. The following results were obtained. 1) The prevalence rate of handicap was 9.7 per 100 for triplets, and 4.9 per 100 for twins. The risk of handicap in triplet pregnancy was approximately 25%, and in twin pregnancy was approximately 10%. Therefore 1 in 4 mothers with triplets and 1 in 10 mothers with twins had one and more handicapped children. 2) Mothers with triplets aged 0-11 months reported significantly poorer sleep quality than mothers with triplets aged one year or more with shorter sleeping time, greater frequency of awakening during the night, and more complaints of inadequate sleep. Mothers with twins aged 0-11 months showed a greater tendency for poor sleep quality than mothers with twins aged one year or more. 3) Approximately 70% of mothers with twins and triplets aged up to two reported lack of time to care for the other children. When the age of twin was 3 or more, lack of time to take care of other children was reported by only 13.3% of mothers, while it was 41.7% for mothers with triplets. 4) Mothers of twins and triplets who did not receive assistance from others for childcare reported severe physical fatigue, compared to mothers who received assistance from others. Mothers of twins and triplets aged 3 or more showed a tendency of less physical fatigue, compared to mothers of twins and triplets aged up to two.

AB  - Background: A growing number of residents are having babies during residency training. While many businesses are working to improve maternity conditions and benefits for their employees, residency programs are often not prepared to accommodate pregnant residents. This study was conducted to examine the maternity leave experiences of women who delivered infants during their family practice residency training. Methods: Program directors from each of the 394 family practice residency programs listed in the 1993 Directory of Family Practice Residency Programs were asked to distribute surveys to female residents who gave birth during their residency training and had returned to work by the time of the study. Results: Of 199 known eligible residents, 171 (86%) completed surveys; these women represented 127 programs located in 36 states and Puerto Rico. Only 56.8% of women were aware of their program having a written maternity leave policy. The average length of maternity leave was 8 weeks; 76% had leaves of 10 weeks or less. For many, the maternity leave was derived from more than one source, including vacation, sick time, or a mother-child elective. Nearly all (88.3%) the women breast-fed, and the mean duration of breast-feeding was more than 19 weeks. In general, participants believed that having a baby during residency was somewhat difficult. Problems frequently encountered by women after their return to work included sleep deprivation and tiredness, difficulty arranging for child care, guilt about child care, and breast-feeding. Factors that detracted most from the childbirth experience were too little sleep, problems arranging for child care, and lack of support from the partner, residency faculty, and other residents. Conclusions: Having a baby during residency is somewhat difficult for the average female resident. Factors that may ease this difficulty include getting adequate sleep and receiving support from one's partner, faculty, and other residents.

AB  - During rapid-eye-movement sleep, when we dream, the brain is thought to be processing stored memory. The memory of a newborn infant is dominated by its fetal experience, and the infant is likely to dream about its life in the womb. Research with lucid (or conscious) dreaming has shown that dream images are supported by the corresponding body actions, using those muscles which remain active during rapid-eye-movement sleep. We suggest that sudden infant death syndrome or cot death may be a result of an infant dreaming about its life (or memory) as a fetus. In the course of that dream, since a fetus does not breathe (in the usual sense) the infant may cease to breathe and may die. This simple hypothesis is consistent with all of the known facts about sudden infant death syndrome (pathological and epidemiological), such as the age at death curve (the observed exponential decay and possibly the peak at 2-3 months), the higher risk with the prone sleeping position (but not excluding the supine position), and the observed climatic variation (seasonal and regional) in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome. Many of these well-established facts have no other known explanation and other theories can generally only account for a few of the known facts about sudden infant death syndrome. Our hypothesis is also supported by recent findings that, as a group, sudden infant death syndrome infants have a higher proportion of rapid-eye-movement sleep, and also that they have an average higher heart rate (corresponding to possible fetal dreams) but only during rapid-eye-movement sleep. The infant dreaming hypothesis also offers an explanation of why all of the chemoreflexes, and other protective mechanisms, that would normally awake the infant, may fail simultaneously. On the basis of our theory, we make suggestions as to how the infant dreaming hypothesis can be tested further and how the risk of sudden infant death syndrome may be reduced. Â© 1993.

AB  - There is considerable evidence that the childbearing years represent a time when women are highly vulnerable to developing mood disorders. Prospective, cross-sectional, and retrospective studies have demonstrated that more than 10% of new adult mothers will experience a major depressive episode during the first postpartum year. Changes in the health care delivery system will result in increased pressure on the obstetrician/gynecologist to identify and treat women with postpartum-onset depression. Despite shortcomings in the available literature, prospective studies have identified risk factors for developing postpartum depression. Furthermore, the clear overlap between the normal sequelae of childbirth and the symptoms of major depression, including alterations in sleep, energy, libido, appetite, and body weight, underscores the need to develop guidelines for early identification. We furnish a brief overview of postpartum mood disorders with a primary focus on the antenatal and postnatal risk factors for developing postpartum depression. Based on the extant literature and our clinical experience, a set of recommendations for early identification and treatment is provided. Â© 1995, All rights reserved.

AB  - Acetylcholine has been implicated in brainstem mechanisms of cardiac and ventilatory control, arousal, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and cranial nerve motor activity. Virtually nothing is known about the developmental profiles of cholinergic perikarya, fibers, terminals, and/or receptors in the brainstems of human fetuses and infants. This study provides baseline information about the quantitative distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in fetal and infant brainstems. Brainstem sections were analyzed from 6 fetuses (median age: 21. 5 postconceptional weeks), 4 premature infants (median age: 26 postconceptional weeks), and 11 infants (median age: 53 postconceptional weeks). One child and three adult brainstems were examined as indices of maturity for comparison. The postmortem interval in all cases was less than or equal to 24 hours (median: 10 hours). Muscarinic receptors were localized by autoradiographic methods with the radiolabeled antagonist [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H] QNB). Computerâbased methods permitted quantitation of [3H]QNB binding in specific nuclei and threeâdimensional reconstructions of binding patterns. By midgestation, muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding is already present and regionally distributed, with the highest binding levels in the interpeduncular nucleus, inferior colliculus, griseum pontis, nucleus of the solitary tract, motor cranial nerve nuclei, and reticular formation. During the last half of gestation, [3H]QNB binding decreases in most, but not all, of the nuclei sampled. The most substantial decline occurs in the reticular formation of the medulla and pons, a change that is not fully explained by progressive myelination and lipid quenching. Binding levels remain essentially constant in the inferior olive and griseum pontis. Around the time of birth or shortly thereafter, the relative distribution of binding becomes similar to that in the adult, with the highest levels in the interpeduncular nucleus and griseum pontis, although binding levels are higher overall in the infant. In the rostral pontine reticular formation, paramedian bands of high muscarinic binding are present which do not correspond to a cytoarchitectonically, defined nucleus. By analogy to animal studies, these bands may comprise a major cholinoreceptive region of the human rostral pontine reticular formation involved in REM sleep. In the human interpeduncular nucleus in all age periods examined, muscarinic binding localizes to the lateral portions bilaterally, indicative of a heterogeneous chemoarchitecture. Muscarinic binding is high in the arcuate nucleus, a component of the putative respiratory chemosensitive fields along the ventral surface of the infant medulla. This observation is consistent with the known effects of muscarinic agents on chemosensitivity and ventilatory responses applied to the ventral medullary surface in animal models. The nonuniform distribution of muscarinic binding in the caudorostral plane in individual brainstem nuclei, as illustrated by threeâdimensional reconstructions, underscores the need for rigorous sampling at precisely matched levels in quantitative studies. This study provides basic information toward understanding the neurochemical basis of brainstem disorders involving dysfunction of autonomic and ventilatory control, arousal, and REM sleep in preterm and fullâterm newborns and infants and for developing cholinergic drugs for such disorders in the pediatric population.

AB  - The long-term developmental outcome of a large cohort of children suffering from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was studied in an interdisciplinary project. Assessments using structured psychiatric interviews and intelligence tests took place during preschool age, early school age, and late school age period. There was an excess of psychopathology with a wide variety of psychiatric syndromes in this cohort. Hyperkinetic disorders, emotional disorders, sleep disorders, and abnormal habits and stereotypies persisted over time. Interview findings were largely cross-validated by parents' and teacher questionnaire findings. Only one third of the patients showed normal intellectual functioning at first examination. Intelligence test findings displayed high stability at follow-up. There was no significant correlation between the amount of morphological damage and intelligence. The persisting severe developmental disorders resulting from maternal alcoholism during pregnancy are also reflected in the poor school careers. Environmental factors and education do not appear to be strong compensating factors.

AB  - Pharmacological studies using a canine model of narcolepsy have demonstrated that adrenergic rather than serotonergic or dopaminergic uptake inhibition is the primary mode of action of antidepressants on cataplexy, a pathological manifestation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep atonia that occurs in narcolepsy. This result is in line with the known involvement of adrenergic systems in the regulation of REM sleep. However, the lack of anticataplectic effects of selective serotonergic compounds was puzzling as serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nuclei are known to decrease activity during the REM sleep in a manner similar to the adrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus. To further explore the role of serotonergic systems, we tested the effect on canine cataplexy of six 5-HT(1A) agonists and five 5- HT(1A) antagonists. Results indicate that 5-HT(1A) agonists significantly suppress cataplexy in correlation with their in vitro affinities to the canine central 5-HT(1A) receptors. Anticataplectic effects were, however, accompanied by various behavioral changes, such as flattened body posture, increased panting and agitation. In contrast, the selective 5-HT(1A) antagonists did not aggravate cataplexy, although a 5-HT(1A) antagonist was able to block the anticataplectic effect of a 5-HT(1A) agonist. These results suggest that the anticataplectic effects of 5-HT(1A) agonists are truly mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation. It is, however, likely that anticataplectic effects occur due to the behavioral side effects rather than the direct involvement of this receptor subtype in the regulation of cataplexy. Further studies are therefore necessary to address the question of whether these 5-HT(1A) agonists hold promise in the pharmacological treatment of human cataplexy.

AB  - Longitudinal cardiac data from the end of the fetal period to 21 months of age were examined for change and stability over age and relations to the temperamental characteristics of high and low reactivity at 4 months of age and fear to the unfamiliar in the second year. Heart period and power in the cardiac spectra changed dramatically over the first 2 years, and individual differences were not preserved until 9â14 months of age. Sleep heart period at 2 weeks of age and low frequency power at 2 months of age were better predictors of the temperamental categories than later measures of the same variables, suggesting that cardiac function early in life may be an especially sensitive index of temperamental qualities.

AB  - The adjunctive use of GnRHa in ovulation induction protocols has become one of the staples of IVF treatment available. In the United States, the majority of programs now use leuprolide acetate in either a downregulation or short regimen as an adjunct to ovarian hyperstimulation with gonadotropins. The use of GnRHa in ovulation induction protocols for IVF yields lower cycle cancellation rates, higher serum estradiol levels, more oocytes retrieved and a higher pregnancy rate. Although the use of these regimens in IVF programs has become almost universal, the ideal regimen has yet to be determined. It is likely that no single stimulation protocol will ultimately prove ideal to all programs and to all patients.

AB  - Objective. To determine whether there is a demonstrable abnormality in control of breathing in infants of substance-abusing mothers during the first few days of life. Methods. We enrolled 12 drug-free control infants and 12 infants of substance abusing mothers (ISAMs). These infants experienced otherwise uncomplicated term pregnancies and deliveries. The infants were assigned to a group based on the results of maternal histories and maternal and infant urine toxicology screens. Studies were performed during quiet sleep during the first few days of life. We measured heart rate, oxygen saturations via a pulse oximeter, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET-CO2) level, respiratory rate, tidal volume, and airflow. The chemoreceptor response was assessed by measuring minute ventilation and the ET-CO2 level after 5 minutes of breathing either room air or 4% carbon dioxide. Results. The gestational ages by obstetrical dating and examination of the infants were not different, although birth weights and birth lengths were lower in the group of ISAMs. Other demographic data were not different, and there were no differences in the infants' median ages at the time of study or in maternal use of tobacco and alcohol. The two groups had comparable baseline (room air) ET-CO2 levels, respiratory rates, tidal volumes, and minute ventilation. When compared with the group of ISAMs, the drug-free group had markedly increased tidal volume and minute ventilation on exposure to 4% carbon dioxide. These increases accounted for the difference in sensitivity to carbon dioxide, calculated as the change in minute ventilation per unit change in ET-CO2 (milliliters per kg/min per mm Hg). The sensitivity to carbon dioxide of control infants was 48.66 Â± 7.14 (mean Â± SE), whereas that of ISAMs was 16.28 Â± 3.14. Conclusions. These data suggest that ISAMs are relatively insensitive to challenge by carbon dioxide during the first few days of life. We speculate that this reflects an impairment of the chemoreceptor response.

AB  - The metabolic and behavioral effects of 40-45% hemorrhage (at ~1%/min) were studied in nine fetal lambs in utero (130-135 days of gestation) until 2 days posthemorrhage. Umbilical blood flow (QÌ(um)) fell from 192 Â± 14 to 100 Â± 9 ml Â· min-1 Â· kg-1 at the end of blood loss, and on the day of hemorrhage it was linearly related to blood volume. However, on the posthemorrhage days, QÌ(um) was restored even though blood volume was still reduced. Fetal O2 delivery (DO2) fell with the decrease in QÌ(um) and later due to anemia (decrease in hematocrit from 33.4 Â± 1.2 to 23.6 Â± 1.2%), from 946 Â± 81 to 494 Â± 47 Î¼mol Â· min-1 Â· kg-1, but the decrease was lessened because of a rise in umbilical venous PO2 (31.7 Â± 2.6 to 45.9 Â± 2.8 mmHg). Fetal O2 consumption was reduced during and for 2 h after hemorrhage (262 Â± 17 to 190 Â± 16 Î¼mol Â· min-1 Â· kg-1), and this was associated with modest lactic acidemia (1.25 Â± 0.11 to 2.91 Â± 0.43 mM). There was also a temporary reduction in fetal breathing activity, low voltage electrocortical state, and rapid eye movements, but this was not associated with hypoxemia. It is concluded that reductions in fetal DO2 achieved via fetal blood loss are better tolerated than during hypoxemia and that the associated depression in fetal biophysical activities involves mechanisms other than systemic hypoxia.

AB  - Objective - To investigate, in a population based national study, the association between sleeping position of infants and the occurrence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Design - A retrospective survey and registry based ecological study. A questionnaire based surveillance of sleeping position was obtained in a random sample (n = 34 799) and surveillance of SIDS was based on all infants born in Norway 1967-91, surviving the perinatal period. Variables studied from the questionnaire were usual sleeping position (placed), breast feeding at 3 months, and maternal smoking in pregnancy, and from the Medical Birth Registry maternal age, birth order, and birth weight. Results - Proportion of infants sleeping prone increased from 1970 (7.4%) to 1989 (49.1%) and dropped in 1990 (26.8%) and 1991 (28.3%). Occurrence of SIDS increased from 1970 (1.1/1000) to 1989 (2.0) before dropping in 1990 and 1991. Implication and relevance of results - A cause effect relationship between prone sleeping and SIDS as suggested in previous studies is supported by the present, and so far only, national study of infants' sleeping positiori.

AB  - To establish normal values for flash visual evoked potentials WEN in the preterm period, we analyzed 356 records from 63 neurologically normal infants (26-35 weeks gestation) followed longitudinally. Using both sleep and drowsy state recording within the same session and a mean of 5.7 weekly recording sessions per infant, we hypothesized that the prominent negative wave (N1) consisted of 2 negative components, Nla (early) and N1b (late). This hypothesis could explain the previously reported variability in VEP indices. With a precise definition of the Nla peak, we were able to establish reference ranges for Nla peak latencies at various postmenstrual ages (PMA) which, unlike those previously reported, are narrow enough to be clinically useful. From a cross-sectional analysis we found that the Nla peak latency decreased with maturation at about 4.6 msec/week between 30 and 40 weeks PMA (P > 0.001). We also analyzed the N1 wave form and demonstrated its developmental maturation during this period. There were significant decreases in the amplitudes of both the Nla and N1b peaks with maturation (P > 0.001), but the decrease of the Nla amplitude was steeper than that of N1b The N1 wave form changed from a wave in which the early peak (Nla) was higher than the late peak (Nlb) into the reverse with N1b higher than Nla. This wave change may be related to developmental processes in the visual system. Longitudinal follow-up revealed that extra-uterine life may accelerate the maturation of the N1 wave form but has no effect on the decrease of the absolute values of peak latencies. Â© 1995.

AB  - Measures of autonomic nervous system functioning have received considerable attention because of the recognition that differences in sympathetic-parasympathetic balance may account for differences in neurobehavioral development. The purpose of this study was to determine if human fetuses could be categorized as either sympathetic-dominated or parasympathetic-dominated based on an analysis of the resting heart rate variability power distribution. The study population consisted of 17 normal human fetuses in quiet sleep between 36 and 40 weeks gestation. The fetal electrocardiogram was captured transabdominally in 3-min blocks at a rate of 833 Hz and fetal R-waves were extracted from the raw data using adaptive signal processing techniques. The fetal R-wave interbeat intervals (IBls) were converted to equally spaced, time-based data, and linear detrending was accomplished by subtracting the mean heart period from each weighted IBI. Total power (TP, 0.0-2.5 Hz) was divided into respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, 0.4-1.0 Hz) and low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.2) regions. Cluster analysis divided fetuses into two groups: one group (N = 9) had a large RSA component (>20% of TP) and a small LF/RSA ratio (<1.5), indicating relatively high parasympathetic tone; and the other group (N = 8) had a small RSA component (<20% of TP) and a large LF/RSA ratio (>1.5), indicating relatively high sympathetic tone. With increasing TP, fetuses classified as sympathetic-dominated exhibited a greater increase in LF power and less of an increase in RSA power than did fetuses classified as parasympathetic-dominated. The finding that fetuses can be classified according to the degree of sympathetic-parasympathetic balance may have important implications regarding the appearance of certain behavioral tendencies early in life.

AB  - This prospective, randomised, double-blind study compared PCA fentanyl with PCA morphine for post-Caesarean section analgesia. Following a standardised general anaesthetic, 37 women were allocated to receive either fentanyl (n = 18) or morphine (n = 19). The PCA was commenced after the women had been made comfortable in the postanaesthetic recovery room with the appropriate opioid solution (mean dose required = fentanyl 375 Î¼g or morphine 16 mg). Initial PCA settings were bolus 1 ml (fentanyl 25 Î¼g or morphine 1 mg), lockout time ten minutes, and no background infusion. Both analgesic solutions provided effective analgesia for a mean of 37 hr with high levels of patient satisfaction, and there were no differences in VAS scores for pain and patient satisfaction, or for side effects (nausea, itch, and sleepiness) between fentanyl or morphine. However, more patients in the fentanyl group required supplementary boluses or alterations to the PCA settings (13/18 vs 4/19: P = 0.005), and one patient was removed from the study due to inadequate analgesia. We conclude that fentanyl is not recommended for routine PCA use following Caesarean section. Â© 1995 Canadian Anesthesiologists.

AB  - The aim of this quasiâexperimental study was to examine the effects of maternal pethidine during labour on the developing breast feeding behaviour in infants in the first 2 h after birth compared with infants not exposed to pethidine. Fortyâfour healthy infants were observed immediately after birth. They were placed skinâtoâskin on their mothers' chests. The development of mouth and sucking movements as well as rooting behaviour and state of sleep/wakefulness were noted. The observer was blind as to the pain relief the mother had received during labour. Of the 44 mothers 18 had received pethidine. The main findings were that infants exposed to pethidine had delayed and depressed sucking and rooting behaviour. In addition, a smaller proportion of infants exposed to pethidine started to suckle the breast. Rooting movements which are expected to be vigorous at 30 min after birth were affected both by administration of pethidine and a longer second stage of labour. It is suggested that the differences found in sucking behaviour may be a central effect of pethidine. Depression of rooting movements in the pethidine group may be caused by exhaustion due to a longer second stage of labour and administration of pethidine. It is recommended that pethidineâexposed motherâinfant couples stay together after birth long enough to enable the infant to make the choice to attach or not to attach to the nipple without the forceful helping hand of the health staff.

AB  - Several pharmacologic agents provide antihistamine effects by acting at the H1 histamina receptor site. The classic agents are relatively nonselective, resulting in a wide range of effects, both therapeutic and undesirable. The newer agents preferentially block peripheral H1 receptor sites and, consequently, have fewer side effects, including sedation. Antihistamines are useful in the treatment of allergic conditions, Parkinson's disease. Insomnia and some forms of nausea, and provide symptomatic relief of cough and other conditions associated with respiratory tract infections. Certain agents may play a role in the treatment of asthma and anorexia. Selection of a specific agent should he based on cost end the minimization of side effects. The classic antihistamines provide an inexpensive and highly effective means of treating histamine-mediated symptoms. The bothersome central nervous system side effects can be alleviated by taking the drugs at bedtime; their prolonged tissue half-life allows dosing once or twice a day for 24-hour clinical relief. The newer, more expensive nonsedating antihistamines are acceptable alternatives for patients who are incapable of tolerating the effects of classic agents.

AB  - Electroretinograms (ERGs) and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to flash stimulation were recorded from 51 infants (gestational age 26 to 42 weeks; postâconceptional age (PCA) 31 to 47 weeks) to give crossâsectional data on the maturation of these responses. Sequential recordings were taken from a separate group of 24 preterm infants (gestational age 28 to 33 weeks) to give longitudinal data, (here was a significant decrease in ERG aâwave latency and increase in aâb amplitude with increasing PCA in both groups. For the VEPs there was a significant decrease in latency of the early negative component (N1) and the major positive component (P2). Comparison between recordings made on preterm infants with those from term infants at an equivalent PCA suggested faster maturation of VEPs in the extraâuterine environment, but no difference in maturation of the ERG. Maturation ties Ã©lectrorÃ©linograinmes et potentiels Ã©voquÃ©s chez les nourrissons prÃ©maturÃ©s Les Ã©lectrorÃ©tingrammes (ERGs) et les potentiels Ã©volquÃ©s visuels (VEPs) en rÃ©ponse Ã  une stimulation par Ã©clair ont Ã©tÃ© enregistrÃ©s chez 51 nourissons (Ã¢ge de gestation de 26 Ã  42 semaines; Ã¢ge postâconceptionnel (PCA) de 31 Ã  47 semaines) pour obtenir des donnÃ©es en sections croisÃ©es sur la maturation de ces rÃ©ponses.

AB  - This review, based on the fourth International Consensus Conference on Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring by noninvasive intermittent techniques is widely used despite artifacts due to cuff size, movement, body position, short-term blood pressure variability, and interference with sleep. The performance of the currently available monitors under truly ambulatory conditions and during exercise remains a matter of debate, as are the procedures required to validate portable monitors under these circumstances. There is general agreement that whenever a monitor is to be used in special populations, such as a older subjects or pregnant women, or in special conditions, such as exercise, a specific demonstration of its accuracy in these defined subgroups or conditions is warranted. Whether the auscultatory or oscillometric method is preferred remains controversial because each technique has specific advantages and disadvantages and because both can provide accurate results. Most experts in the field strongly believe that manufacturers should disclose the algorithms of their devices and that they should specify all changes made to the hardware and software of a previously validated monitor. Finally, the development of the volume-clamp method, which makes continuous noninvasive registration of blood pressure at the finger possible in both stationary and ambulatory conditions, opens new perspectives in research, in particular in relation to short-term blood pressure variability.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effect of a combination of vital substances with standardized ginseng extract G115 on quality of life (QoL) in healthy subjects. Study Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 12 weeks duration. Subjects: Healthy, employed volunteers of both sexes older than 25 years. Exclusion criteria: Systolic blood pressure > 200 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure â¥ 100 mm Hg, sensitivity to ginseng extracts, alcohol and drug abuse, pregnancy, lactation, inability or unwillingness to cooperate, concomitant medication (except short-term medication. e.g. against symptoms like gastro-intestinal discomfort or headache). Intervention: 1 capsule of the G115 combination (n=205) or placebo (n=185) twice daily for a period of 12 weeks. Outcome Measures: QoL was evaluated in 2 standard, self-administered question-naires, the Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) index and the Sleep Dysfunction scale. In addition to these, a list of 36 bipolar adjectives in visual analogue scales (VAS) was used to quantify changes in other behavioral aspects. Results: 185 subjects taking placebo and 205 taking the combination of active sub-stances completed the study. Both the combination and the placebo group improved their general well-being, but the improvement from baseline was more pronounced in those subjects taking the combination of active substances. According to the VAS scores, subjects receiving the combination improved significantly more in alertness (p=0.05), relaxation (p=0.02), appetite (p=0.04) and overall score (p=0.03). Among the subjects with the 20% lowest scores at baseline (they were considered as a subgroup), the combination improved both alertness (p=0.03) and depressed mood (p=0.05). Conclusions: Treatment with a combination of vital substances including stand-ardized ginseng extract G115 may be useful to improve QoL in healthy subjects. Â© 1995 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - We previously reported no differences in estimates of gestational maturity between a cumulative score based on sonography/obstetrical measurements and an EEG interpretation for healthy preterm neonates. For the present study, a rank order among 5 fetal sonographic measurements was used to estimate gestational age: head circumference, transcerebellar diameter, biparietal diameter, femur length, and abdominal circumference were compared with an electroencephalographic estimate and an arithmetic estimate of maturity (i.e., the mother's last menstrual period). A fetal sonographic study for each of 13 premature neonates (i.e., born at &lt; 32 weeks estimated gestational age) was followed after birth by a neonatal EEG recording. EEG and sonographic estimates of maturity were assigned without knowledge of other clinical data. The mother's last menstrual period was obtained from the medical record. Principal component analysis determined that 86% of the variance was evenly distributed over the 5 sonographic measurements. Using a regression procedure, 61 % of the variance (adjusted r2 = 0.61) was explained by EEG when compared with fetal sonographic estimates. Only 19% (adjusted r2 = 0.19) of the variance was explained by the estimate based on the mother's last menstrual period. Optimal subset selection determined that the rank order for prediction of gestational maturity among the fetal sonographic measurements was as follows: (1) head circumference; (2) transcerebellar diameter; (3) biparietal diameter; (4) femur length; (5) abdominal circumference. Cranial measurements on fetal sonography (i.e., head circumference, transcerebellar diameter, biparietal diameter) compared more closely with EEG estimates than non-cranial measurements (i.e., femur length and abdominal circumference). In conclusion, neonatal EEG estimates of gestational maturity compared more closely with sonographic measurements than estimates based on the time of the last menstrual period. These findings will be useful in situations when dates of conception are unknown or inaccurate, or when intrauterine growth restriction causes discrepancies in growth rates between cranial and non-cranial fetal measurements on sonography.

AB  - Synopsis Since the earlier review in Drugs substantial additional data have accumulated regarding the antihypertensive efficacy of isradipine in various clinical situations, as well as data on its clinical effects in atherosclerosis. Recent therapeutic trials confirm that the efficacy of isradipine in the treatment of patients with mainly mild to moderate hypertension, when administered orally as a conventional or modified release preparation, is similar to that of titrated dosages of amlodipine, felodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, captopril, methyldopa, metoprolol, prazosin and hydrochlorothiazide. A further decrease in blood pressure can be expected when isradipine is combined with another antihypertensive drug in patients who have not responded adequately to monotherapy. Initial studies have shown that intravenous isradipine is effective in controlling hypertension following coronary artery bypass graft surgery and that it appears useful in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and hypertensive crisis, and in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, when administered orally or intravenously. A large study, the Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), was designed to compare the efficacy of isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of carotid artery wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasound, as a surrogate for early atherosclerosis. Results indicated that wall thickness increased significantly less with isradipine than hydrochlorothiazide after 6 months of therapy. Thereafter the rate of progression remained parallel for the remainder of the 3-year trial. The confirmation of its antihypertensive efficacy, along with its favourable haemodynamic profile and reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy, minimal effect on glucose and lipid metabolism, preservation of quality of life and good tolerability, makes isradipine a suitable drug for the treatment of most patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Pharmacodynamic Properties Isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that has a high affinity for voltage-operated calcium channels (slow channel or L-channel), also has minimal depressant activity on sinoatrial node automaticity and can be regarded as electrophysiologically neutral on the human cardiac conduction system. It is free of significant negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects in humans with normal sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal function. In common with other calcium antagonists, isradipine is an effective coronary vasodilator, demonstrating selectivity for vascular smooth muscle over cardiac tissue. Recent studies have confirmed that generally, single doses of orally or intravenously administered isradipine produce selective arterial vasodilatation as evidenced by reductions in blood pressure and systemic resistance in the absence of changes in cardiac filling pressures. Afterload reduction was accompanied by increases in cardiac output and stroke volume. The effects of acute administration of isradipine on heart rate depended on the rate of administration, dosage and disease state, but heart rate is little affected during long term oral administration of conventional or sustained release oral (SRO) formulations. That isradipine has less negative inotropic effect than nifedipine has been confirmed in recent studies. In patients with essential hypertension, single oral doses of isradipine produce a dose-related decrease in supine, sitting and standing blood pressures, with maximal effects occurring 1 to 3 hours after ingestion. Intravenous infusion of isradipine 0.01 mg/kg reduced blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, whilst increasing heart rate and cardiac index. However, unlike sodium nitroprusside, isradipine was not associated with pulmonary vasodilation or reflex tachycardia. Orally and intravenously administered isradipine effectively decreased elevated blood pressure in pregnant patients without altering blood flow in the uterine or umbilical arteries, or uteroplacental perfusion. Maternal and fetal heart rate increased transiently following intravenous administration and there was a moderate mean reduction in uterine activity, although the effect on uterine activity varied between patients. Oral treatment with isradipine increased renal plasma flow, decreased renal vascular resistance, increased glomerular filtration rate and produced a sustained natriuretic effect. While urinary indices of markers of hypertensive nephropathy were decreased, effects varied between the small numbers of patients studied, with improvement in some and deterioration in others. Treatment with isradipine generally had little effect on glucose or lipid metabolism, although in one study long term administration was associated with some impairment of glucose metabolism. Structural changes that occurred in the endothelium of the femoral artery in spontaneously hypertensive rats and entry of radiolabelled low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in cholesterol-fed rabbits were attenuated by treatment with isradipine at dosages within the usual clinical range. In ex vivo studies, isradipine significantly decreased platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine (adrenaline), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) or adenosine diphosphate, blocked the amplifying effect of LDL cholesterol on platelet aggregation induced by serotonin and decreased serum levels of thromboxane B2. Isradipine decreased left ventricular mass index and thickness of the intraventricular septal and posterior walls, an effect shared by equiantihypertensive dosages of enalapril or lisinopril but not atenolol. Pharmacokinetic Properties The estimated systemic availability of isradipine is about 17% and is not substantially influenced by food; but in common with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, isradipine is subject to considerable first-pass hepatic metabolism, which may result in marked interindividual differences in bioavailability. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) at steady-state was similar after oral administration of the same dose of SRO and conventional formulations. Following repeated administration of either formulation to pregnant women, the fetal to maternal plasma concentration ratio varied between 0.25 and 0.85. Isradipine is rapidly and extensively biotransformed in the liver via deesterification and aromatisation of the dihydropyridine moiety to metabolites which do not appear to contribute to the cardiovascular effects of the drug. In elderly volunteers, mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), elimination half-life, AUC and systemic availability of isradipine were significantly higher than in young study participants. AUC and Cmax values are also elevated in patients with impaired liver function, particularly in those with cirrhosis in whom dosage adjustment may be necessary. In patients with hypertension, maximum decreases in blood pressure coincide with isradipine Cmax values. Therapeutic Efficacy Therapeutic trials published since the previous review in Drugs have confirmed that the efficacy of isradipine 2.5 to 5mg daily in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension is similar to that of titrated dosages of amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipine, and captopril, and that isradipine is at least as effective as hydrochlorothiazide. In small studies, isradipine was more effective than methyldopa or prazosin. The decrease in average 24-hour blood pressure achieved with once daily administration of the SRO formulation was similar to that obtained with the same daily dose of the conventional formulation administered in two divided doses. In comparisons with other drugs, SRO isradipine 5mg once daily was of similar efficacy to sustained release nitrendipine 20mg, enalapril 10 to 20mg, or spirapril 6mg daily. In patients with a DBPâ¥90mm Hg after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with isradipine 5mg daily alone, the addition of metoprolol 200 to 400 mg/day, bopindolol 1mg/day, captopril 25 to 50 mg/day, enalapril 10 or 20 mg/day, metolazone 1.25 or 2.5 mg/day or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/day further decreased blood pressure. Such combined regimens were more effective in decreasing SBP than doubling the dosage of isradipine. Quality-of-life studies indicated that effective antihypertensive therapy with isradipine alone, or combined with captopril or hydrochlorothiazide, had minimal effect on the quality of life of middle-aged men or elderly women with hypertension. Noncomparative studies conducted by general practitioners in large numbers of patients reported that conventional isradipine 1.25 to 2.5mg twice daily, and in a few patients 5mg twice daily, decreased DBP to â¤90mm Hg in up to 86% of patients treated for a period of 4 to 12 weeks. The level of blood pressure achieved after 3 months of treatment was maintained for 1 or 2 years with minimal dosage adjustment. Hypertension that develops following coronary artery bypass graft surgery is controlled in order to reduce the risk of early postoperative complications. Intravenously administered isradipine and sodium nitroprusside similarly reduced mean arterial pressure to between 80 and 90mm Hg within 25 or 30 minutes of starting the infusion. Less additional antihypertensive medication was required within the first 2.5 hours in patients treated with isradipine and fewer patients in this group experienced hypotension. Initial studies with intravenously administered isradipine have shown it to be of potential value in the treatment of intraoperative hypertension and hypertensive crisis. Either oral or intravenous isradipine controlled hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Intravenous treatment with isradipine before and immediately after first kidney transplant, followed by 5 mg daily orally, improved graft function and reduced serum creatinine levels and blood pressure 21 days after surgery compared with placebo in patients receiving cyclosporin as a part of their immunosuppressive regimen. Neither isradipine nor metoprolol significantly lowered blood pressure when administered orally to patients with sleep apnoea. However, whereas metoprolol increased the number of episodes of obstructive periodic breathing, their frequency decreased during treatment with isradipine. The Multicentre Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS) was designed to assess the efficacy of isradipine compared with that of hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the rate of progression of atherosclerotic plaques in patients with hypertension. Results revealed that during the first 6 months of the trial the progression of carotid artery wall thickness was significantly less in patients treated with isradipine than in those who received hydrochlorothiazide. However, progression of mean maximal intimal-medial thickness was parallel in both treatment groups for the remaining 2.5 years of the trial. Tolerability The majority of adverse events reported during treatment of hypertension with isradipine are related to the vasodilatory action of the drug and include headache, flushing, peripheral oedema, dizziness and palpitations/tachycardia. These adverse events were usually of mild to moderate severity and, with the exception of flushing (2 to 3% of patients) and oedema (about 2%), were more frequent at the end of the placebo run-in period than at the end of treatment with isradipine. Isradipine caused ankle oedema less frequently than amlodipine or felodipine and tended to cause fewer adverse events than equivalent antihypertensive dosages of nifedipine. Dosage and Administration The recommended oral dosage of isradipine in the treatment of essential hypertension is 2.5mg twice daily administered 12-hourly as a conventional formulation, or a single daily 5mg dose of a slow release preparation. After 4 weeks, another antihypertensive drug from a different class may be added, or the dosage of isradipine increased, in patients with insufficient response. Â© 1995, Adis International Limited.
