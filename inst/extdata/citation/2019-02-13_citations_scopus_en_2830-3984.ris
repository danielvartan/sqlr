AB  - The effects of nonnutritive sucking on transcutaneous oxygen tension, heart rate, and respiratory rate were studied sequentially in 14 sleeping preterm infants breathing room air. Transcutaneous oxygen tension increased during nonnutritive sucking in infants between 32 and 35 weeks postconceptional age, but not in those between 36 and 39 weeks. This response was not associated with a change in respiratory rate or sleep state, although heart rate tended to increase. These data offer further support for the beneficial effects of nonnutritive sucking in preterm infants.

AB  - Various biological organs such as uterine and gut smooth muscles, exhibit oscillatory electrical activities that appear to propagate and cause propulsion of a bolus along the lumen of the organ. The rat uterus, during the later stage of gestation and until delivery, shows spike bursts that are phase locked in the longitudinal axis of the organ to adjacent bursts. The temporal characteristics of bursts, such as duration and period of quiescence, change during gestation. In addition, the spike bursts also appear to be coupled. This paper reports studies of quantification of these spike-to-spike couplings.

AB  - Reduction of cortical inhibition has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the transition from episodic fetal to continuous postnatal breathing. Twelve fetal lambs were chronically decorticated at 112-115 days gestation. Lateral rectus, neck, and diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG), electrocorticogram (ECoG), and tracheal and arterial blood pressure were monitored after allowing 3 days for recovery. The fetal lambs were studied for 4-28 days in 2- to 4-h sessions/day. There were no episodes of low-voltage high-frequency ECoG activity. The mean duration (±SD) of rapid eye movements (REM) measured by lateral rectus EMG [11 ± 7.9 min and periods of tonic activity or silence [non-REM (NREM)], 14 ± 7.4 min] in decorticated fetuses were not statistically different from REM (12 ± 5.1 min) and NREM (15 ± 6.8 min) sleep periods in intact fetuses. After decortication, the percentage of time (±SD) occupied by different states were phasic diaphragmatic EMG activity 36 ± 7.8%, tonic diaphragmatic EMG 21 ± 8.6%, and diaphragmatic silence 43 ± 14.2%. Phasic diaphragmatic EMG activity occurred together with REM, the latter being present 45 ± 3.7% of the time. Despite decortication, between 115 and 125 days gestation ECoG changed from a trace alternans to a high-voltage low-frequency pattern. We conclude that the cerebral cortex is not responsible for apnea during fetal life. In addition, these data suggest that the cerebral cortex may normally be the source of ECoG synchrony.

AB  - Circadian rhythms and hormonal interactions among the maternal, fetal, and amniotic fluid compartments were studied in long-term catheterized rhesus macaque monkeys between days 127 and 138 of gestation (term = 167 days). Blood samples were collected at 3-hour intervals for 48 hours and analyzed by radioimmunoassay for estrone, estradiol, cortisol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and prolactin. Distinct circadian rhythms were present for cortisol and progesterone in the maternal circulation and for progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in the fetal circulation (p < 0.05). Although maternal and fetal estrogen levels were higher in am samples than in pm samples, a statistically significant circadian rhythm was not present (p > 0.10). Fetal levels of progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and maternal levels of progesterone were highest between 9:00 pm and 3:00 am and lowest between 9:00 am and 3:00 pm. Maternal levels of cortisol were highest between 6:00 am and 9:00 am and lowest between 6:00 pm and 12 midnight. The circadian patterns of maternal cortisol and progesterone were inversely related to each other (r = -0.68; p < 0.01). Amniotic fluid cortisol levels were highest between 9:00 am and 12 noon and lowest between 6:00 pm and 3:00 am (p < 0.10). With the possible exception of cortisol, amniotic fluid steroid hormones did not demonstrate distinct diurnal fluctuations, nor did they correlate with steroid changes in maternal or fetal blood. Because the rhesus placenta is permeable to glucocorticoids it is likely that transplacental passage of maternal cortisol influences the activity of the fetal pituitary and adrenal so that the circadian rhythm in the fetal axis is 180 degrees out of phase with that of the maternal axis. The circadian rhythms in fetal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and progesterone in late gestation parallel the biorhythm in uterine contraction frequency and amplitude, with peaks during periods of darkness between 9:00 pm and 3:00 am. © 1984.

AB  - Fetal breathing movements in sheep are stimulated by infusions of a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, meclofenamate; they are inhibited by prostaglandin E2. Recent studies suggest that these effects are mediated through changes in fetal plasma glucose concentrations. We infused into chronic fetal sheep preparations (1) glucose, (2) meclofenamate, and (3) prostaglandin E2, followed by prostaglandin E2 and glucose together. Infusions of glucose alone did not affect fetal breathing movements despite a significant twofold increase in glucose concentrations. During meclofenamate infusions, fetal breathing movements increased from 34.9% to 80.6% (p &lt; 0.005); glucose concentrations did not change. During prostaglandin E2 infusions, fetal breathing movements decreased from 36.5% to 4.1% (p &lt; 0.005) without any change in glucose concentrations; the addition of glucose did not alter the effects of prostaglandin E2 on fetal breathing movements. We conclude that fetal infusions of glucose in sheep do not affect fetal breathing movements and the effects on these breathing movements produced by meclofenamate and prostaglandin E2 are independent of the changes in plasma glucose concentrations. © 1984.

AB  - The diurnal rhythm organization of drinking behavior was determined prior to and after suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) lesions. Five weeks after SCN lesions which produced total loss of the diurnal rhythm, the anterior hypothalamus including the SCN of fetal rats was transplanted into the floor of the 3rd ventricle of the lesioned rats. Eight weeks after the graft, rats recovered their rhythm. The results show that grafts allow animals to recover lost functional properties due to lesions, and further support the notion that the SCN is a pacemaker for certain behaviors. © 1984.

AB  - Dr. Frederick Zuspan, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics/Gynecology at the Ohio State University College of Medicine, participated in an informal medical exchange to Zaire. He was located at the Tchi Kagi Hospital, a regional bush hospital near the capital of Kananga. While the hospital is considered one of Zaire's most modern, it would compare with an understaffed and poorly-equipped US hospital of 80 or 90 years ago. Despite the chronic understaffing and primitive medical equipment, results of medical intervention are good. The incidence of postoperative infection is surprisingly low, and Dr. Zuspan emphasized the excellence of the missionary doctors, as well as the general hardiness of the population. He noted a high incidence of tetanus, especially among babies. In the cities, pregnant women are given 2 doses of tetanus toxoid as prophylaxis, and the midwives are encouraged to cut the umbilical cord long and to refrain from the custom of packing the cord with manure or dirt. The latter practice greatly increases the risk of neonatal tetanus. Cervical cancer is common, as are gonorrhea and pelvic inflammatory disease. The high incidence of infertility seen is thought to be associated with gonorrhea and PID. Cancers of the breast, colon, and endometrium are rare. Toxemia of pregnancy is also rare, a surprising finding, since the maternal diet is often protein deficient. It is speculated that the custom of long naps in midday may increase uterine blood flow, preventing toxemia.

AB  - The β-endorphin, met5-enkephalin-arg6-phe7 (MEAP) and met5-enkephalin (ME) changes related to age and diurnal rhythms were studied in various regions of rat brain and in the pituitary by specific radioimmunoassays. The contents of MEAP, met5-enkephalin and β-endorphin were higher in the pituitary of old rats (18 months old) than that of young rats (23 days old) while the content of these opioid peptides was higher in the hyphotalamus of young rats than in that of old rats. β-endorphin was also higher in the striatum of 23 days old rats, but no age-associated changes were observed in the hippocampus, brain stem or cortex. In the diurnal rhythm study, it was found that in the hypothalamus and striatum of the adult rat (2-3 months old), both MEAP and ME contents were higher at mid-dark than at mid-light and that in the intermediate posterior lobe of the pituitary, the ME content was also higher at mid-dark. © 1984.

AB  - The effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemic stress on the concentrations of immunoreactive β-endorphin (ir β-EP) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was examined in conscious non-pregnant ewes in which the cisterna magna and a jugular vein had been previously catheterized. In control experiments, no significant changes were observed in plasma cortisol or ir β-EP and CSF ir β-EP concentrations. During hypoglycemia induced by intravenous injection of 20 units of insulin, plasma cortisol concentrations rose significantly, reaching a peak 1.5 h after injection. The changes in plasma ir β-EP concentration were significantly different between hypoglycemic and normoglycemic sheep (analysis of variance, P = 0.0089). Following insulin injection, mean plasma ir β-EP rose by 100% within 0.75 h, continued to rise six-fold over initial concentrations by 2.25 h, and remained elevated for 3.75 h. The CSF ir β-EP concentrations following insulin injection were not significantly different from those observed in controls. These results suggest that if β-endorphin mediates hypoglycemic stress-induced analgesia, its actions may be peripheral, not central. © 1984.

AB  - Changes in EEG and susceptability to electrically induced seizures were examined in the ferret with lissencephaly produced by exposure to a single injection of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM Ac) given to the pregnant jill on gestation day 32. Ten lissencephalic and 11 normal ferrets were chronically implanted with 14 cortical stainless steel electrodes. EEG records were sampled from various stages of the sleep/awake cycle. Six of each group were subjected to electrical stimulation for seizure threshold. Although the number of stimulations and the current intensity required to produce epileptiform afterdischarges (AD) and seizures were not different between the two groups, the lissencephalic ferrets had significantly longer AD and seizures, and a greater number of generalized seizures, indicating an enhanced seizure susceptibility. The EEG of the lissencephalic ferrets was characterized by increased slow wave activity within the low theta band range, extreme spindle activity, focal or multifocal slow and sharp waves, spikes, or spike and slow wave complexes. The differences in the EEG were more pronounced during drowsiness and sleep stages. The brains of all of the treated animals were lissencephalic and hydrocephalic, and weighed significantly less than those of the normals. The cerebral cortex was thin and flattened, with the parieto-occipital region most severely affected. Heterotopic foci were found in the cerebellum as well as in the cerebral cortex. Abnormalities in the configuration of the cerebellar folia were also seen. Comparison between the electrophysiological and neuropathological data suggests that the extent of the extreme spindle activity, and longer AD and seizure duration depended on the degree of cerebellar dysplasia, whereas the EEG focal abnormalities were related to lesions in the cerebral hemispheres. © 1984.

AB  - Swallowing was recorded electromyographically in unanaesthetized fetal sheep in utero during the last third of gestation. In control fetuses bouts of swallowing were, on average, 2·0 min in duration and occurred at intervals of 2·31 h. Swallowing bouts were associated with a low‐voltage electrocorticogram, eye movements and, in 82% of instances, with phasic activity in the dorsal neck muscles. These data indicate that fetuses are not in quiet (non‐rapid eye movement; n.r.e.m.) sleep when swallowing and also suggest that they are not in r.e.m. sleep as conventionally defined; we consider that fetuses may be in a state of heightened activity resembling wakefulness. Swallowing bouts were always accompanied by fetal breathing movements. When a swallow coincided with an inspiratory effort the diaphragm was briefly inhibited. Evidence was obtained that bouts of fetal ingestive activity were not dependent upon outpourings of fluid from the lungs and were not significantly influenced by volume information from the gastric compartments. © 1984 The Physiological Society

AB  - The pattern of 24-hour secretion of prolactin was evaluated in three normal pregnant subjects at the tenth, twenty-fourth, and thirty-sixth gestational week. A similar study was performed in three hyperprolactinemic subjects throughout the course of their gestations. The findings confirm the progressive rise in serum concentrations of prolactin throughout pregnancy in normal subjects, with a tendency to blunting of the ratio of the nighttime mean to the daytime mean ( Xs Xa) as pregnancy progresses. One hyperprolactinemic subject (nontumoral) followed this pattern but demonstrated blunting initially and throughout pregnancy. The other two hyperprolactinemic subjects (one tumoral and one nontumoral) demonstrated an unexpected response in that they remained unresponsive to the increasing concentrations of estradiol throughout pregnancy. © 1984.

AB  - The dependency of the human milk lipids triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (Chol), phospholipids (PL), and the fatty acid composition of both TG and PL on the stage of lactation, the day time, the course of one nursing, and on the mother's diet was shown by analyzing more than 350 milk samples. In progressing lactation (day 1-36) TG increased from 1.9 to 3.9 g/100 ml. Chol decreased from 35 to 20 mg/100 ml, while PL remained with 40 mg/100 ml rather constant. The resulting decrease in the PL/TG- and Chol/TG-ratios indicates an increasing size of fat globules. During one nursing, TG and Chol increased four-fold and PL doubled. During the day lipids (TG, Chol, PL) of the milks of German mothers reached their peak values in the afternoon, whereas the ones of milks obtained from English mothers were found in the late evening. With 3 mothers (n=3) carbohydrate-rich diets (65 cal%) led to an increase of the milk fat content. In contrast high fat diets (50 cal%) resulted in milks with low fat contents (2.6/4.1 g/100 ml). Chol (20.8/37.5 mg/100 ml) and PL (26.4/ 45.3 mg/100 ml) showed the same dependency. The fatty acid composition changed mainly dependent on the duration of the lactation and the mother's diet, but not during one single nursing and during the day. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher in early than in mature milks. The P/S-ratio of TG was found to remain constant in progressing lactation (0.32), whereas the one of PL increased from 0.6 to 0.71. Dependent on the regimen of the mother the P/S-ratios (n=3) were found to be 0.27 (high carbohydrate diet) and 0.46 (high fat/high linoleic acid diet). © 1984 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag.

AB  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) is influenced by the central nervous system, cardiac automatism, biochemical factors, etc. Changes in FHR were correlated with the anatomic defect in autopsy material from 20 anencephalic infants, and, on this basis, the following hypotheses were formed, subject to later experimental proof. (1) The FHR baseline level is controlled by the medulla oblongata and vagus nerve. (2) The biphasic sleep-awake pattern is controlled by the cerebral cortex. (3) The midbrain is involved in the occurrence of acceleration. (4) A relative high level of short-term variability is shown when small lesions of the lesser central nervous system are present, but we cannot conclude that the cortex is critical for short-term variability. On the other hand, long-term variability seems to be correlated to the presence of the medulla oblongata and midbrain, and might be amplified by the cerebral cortex. (5) U-shaped decelerations are connected with the medulla oblongata, but V-shaped decelerations depend on intracardiac reflexes and myocardial stretch. © 1984.

AB  - A capillary gas-chromatographic method with nitrogen-phosphorus detection is used here to simultaneously determine 1,3-diaminopropane, putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, spermine, isoputreanine , putreanine , and N-(3-aminopropyl)-N'-(2-carboxyethyl)-1,4- diaminobutane in urine. After acid hydrolysis the compounds are isolated by adsorption onto silica gel and converted into their methyl-heptafluorobutyryl derivatives. We give quality-control data and age-dependent values for urinary excretion of these analytes by 76 apparently healthy controls. Circadian rhythmicity in the excretion of spermidine and (especially) isoputreanine was established and is discussed in the light of its implications for monitoring therapy of cancer. Investigation of menstrual-cycle-dependent diurnal variation in one normal woman showed no distinct, consistent fluctuations. We applied the method to monitor (by use of 24-h urine specimens) an uncomplicated, normally progressing pregnancy, a patient with metastatic melanoma being treated with cytostatic drugs, and (in more detail) the treatment of a patient with high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

AB  - To examine the utility of nocturnal urine collections in the estimation of dietary sodium intake in children, 29 families who agreed to lower their dietary sodium intake to < 65 mEq/d were studied. A total of 58 adults and 95 children collected urine specimens weekly or biweekly before and after being instructed in a dietary sodium restriction regimen. Urine collections were fractionated into a diurnal and nocturnal portion. Sodium was measured directly, and estimated by measuring chloride excretion with a chloride titrator stick. Nocturnal chloride and 24-hour sodium excretion were highly correlated in adults (r = .75), and slightly less so (r = .56) in children. The slopes of the relationships were not different. Discriminant analysis showed that two or more chloride estimates permitted classification of both adults and children into the low sodium intake category with 100% accuracy, and into the normal sodium intake category with 75% accuracy. It was concluded that nocturnal chloride estimates are as useful in estimating compliance to a reduced sodium intake in children as in adults.

AB  - General pharmacological activities of 450191-S were studied in various species of animals and compared with those of reference benzodiazepines (BDZ). 450191-S at doses of 10 mg/kg slightly decreased (—;5°C) the rectal temperature of rabbits. 450191-S decreased respiratory and heart rates in anesthetized cats, but the effects were less than those of diazepam or triazolam. 450191-S increased respiratory and heart rates in conscious dogs, but had no effect on the blood pressure, electrocardiogram and autonomic nervous system in cats and dogs. The drug displayed a slight spasmolytic activity in the small intestine of guinea pig s and a slight inhibitory effect on isolated non-pregnant and pregnant uteri of rats. These effects were less than those of diazepam or nitrazepam. Below doses of 25 mg/kg, 450191-S did not affect urinary volume and electrolyte excretions in rats. It also decreased brain norepinephrine (NE) turnover rates in rats, but decreased NE and dopamine turnover rates in mice. These effects of 450191-S were less than those of nitrazepam. 450191-S was found to be minimally irritating to the ocular mucosa in rabbits and did not irritate the stomach and small intestine in rats. These effects were also compared with those of active metabolites of 450191-S, M-l, M-2, M-A, M-3 and M-4, and the superiority of the mother compound over its metabolites was clarified. © 1984, The Japanese Pharmacological Society.

AB  - The present study was made to investigate the developmental toxicity of ethanol administered to rat pups via dams for 18 days (day 3-21 after parturition) from the relatively early postnatal stage in terms of changes in the threshold for pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions, the sleeping time with barbital, preference for morphine or ethanol and tolerance to phenobarbital. The threshold of pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in ethanol-experienced offspring were similar to that in the naive group. The sleeping time with barbital in ethanol-experienced offspring were prolonged in comparison with that in the naive offspring. Pups whose dams were treated with ethanol showed high preference for ethanol. The inhibition of rotarod performance in ethanol-experienced offspring were attenuated, namely, the development of tolerance to phenobarbital in ethanol-experienced offspring were accelated. The present results suggest that the inhibition of functional development in the central nervous system may have occurred in the ethanol-experienced offspring. © 1984, The Japanese Pharmacological Society.

AB  - Recent investigations of caffeine abuse have questioned the indiscriminant use of this commonly accepted drug. In some individuals, chronic excessive caffeine consumption leads to the development of caffeinism, a syndrome which includes increased anxiety, depression, frequency of psychophysiological disorders, and possibly degraded performance. This paper reviews research demonstrating the abuse potential of caffeine. Special attention has been given those factors which mediate the wide individual differences in consumption patterns, susceptibility to abuse, and the varied psychological and physiological responses to this drug. While the development of caffeine abuse is probably best viewed as an idiosyncratic process, general guidelines for the recognition of potential abuse, and caffeinism proper, are offered. © 1984 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB  - Experiments were performed to determine whether both prolactin (PRL) surges are required to maintain pseudopregnancy (PSP) in the rat. Vaginal cycles were followed and animals that exhibited 2-3 normal cycles were cervically stimulated electromechanically to induce PSP. In one set of experiments the afternoon PRL surge was blocked by i.p. injection of 100 μg of 2Br-α-ergocryptine (CB-154) at 1200 and 1600h while the nocturnal surge was blocked by injecting 100 μg of CB-154 at 2400 and 0400h immediately after cervical stimulation. Pseudopregnancy was maintained only in those animals receiving CB-154 injections in the afternoon. In another series of experiments the initial CB-154 injection, given to block either surge, was delayed for one day. Once again only the nocturnal surge was capable of maitaining PSP in all animals. For those animals who had an initial nocturnal surge but all subsequent nocturnal surges were blocked, the afternoon surge was able to support PSP in only 50% of the animals. In those animals whose afternoon PRL surge was blocked, the duration of the nocturnal surge was extended so that it provided 85% of the total PRL produced by control PSP animals. In those animals whose nocturnal surge was blocked, the duration of the afternoon surge was also extended, however, in this case the extended surge only accounted for 58% of the total PRL produced by control PSP animals. The results indicated that when the diurnal PRL surge was blocked the nocturnal surge was extended so that the amount of PRL released was nearly equivalent to the amount released by both surges, however, when the nocturnal surge was blocked the extension of the diurnal surge did not provide adequate PRL to maintain PSP in all animals. © 1991.

AB  - The influence of maternal circadian rhythms on fetal circadian oscillations during pregnancy was examined. Circadian rhythms of spontaneous locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone level in pregnant rats were eliminated by bilateral lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) at different stages of gestation and the postnatal manifestation of the circadian corticosterone rhythm was examined in individual pups. Effective lesions of SCN at day 3 of gestation resulted in an abortion in all rats examined. Rats whose SCN were lesioned at day 10 or 17 of gestation maintained their pregnancies. At term, pups were removed by Cesarean operation and immediately blinded by bilateral ocular enucleation; they were reared by unoperated foster mother afterwards. All pups from SCN lesioned mothers showed a clear free running circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone levels after the 4th week of postnatal life. Furthermore, the circadian rhythm that developed in pups from SCN-lesioned mother at day 10 of gestation (G10 pups) was always phasedelayed about 4 h as compared with that in pups from mothers whose SCN were lesioned at day 17 of gestation (G17 pups) and in pups from sham-operated mothers (S pups). It is concluded that the circadian hormone rhythmicity develops in normal fashion postnatally when the maternal SCN are effectively lesioned after day 10 of gestation. The phaseangle difference in the circadian rhythm between G10 pups and G17 or S pups suggests that fetal circadian oscillation is entrainable at least after day 10 of gestation. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Circadian rhythms have been identified in a variety of maternal and fetal biophysical and endocrinologic parameters. The authors have undertaken a 24-hour study to identify the normal variation in fetal bladder volumes in the healthy, term human fetus. A significant decrease in fetal bladder volumes occurred between 2400 hours and 0600 hours when compared with other times of the day. It is suggested that this fall in fetal bladder volumes may be related to fetal cardiovascular or adrenal gland function. © 1984 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - In order to determine the normal periprandial blood glucose values during gravidity, we studied 17 normal pregnant women, near term of gestation, in their homes using test strips and reflectometers. Results show an initial fasting level not higher than 80 mg/dl and not lower than 45 mg/dl. In all cases but one blood glucose levels were lower than 120 mg/dl, irrespective of when the measurements were taken. Insulin determinations permitted us to recognize low and high responders, although no differences could be found between them.

AB  - We examined the entraining effect of the maternal circadian system on the fetal circadian oscillation during pregnancy. The circadian rhythm of locomotor activity and plasma corticosterone of pregnant rats was abolished by bilateral ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei at day 10 of gestation. At term, pups were removed by Cesarean section and were blinded immediately. To avoid possible rhythmic influences of a nursing mother on the pups’ circadian rhythms, alternating nursing was imposed on blinded infants. Thus, pups were exchanged every 12 h between two foster mothers, one entrained to a light-dark cycle and the other to dark-light, so that one group of pups were always nursed in the light period and the other in the dark. Both groups of pups showed free-running circadian hormone rhythms with similar phase angles. However, the circadian rhythm of these pups was always phase delayed by about 8 h to that of blinded control pups which were born to unoperated mothers. Furthermore, blinded pups born to and nursed by a suprachiasmatic nuclei lesioned mother developed a circadian hormone rhythm which was phase delayed by 4 h to that of the control. It is concluded that the circadian oscillation underlying the rhythm of corticosterone release in rats has entrained to the maternal circadian system during fetal life. It is further suggested that the entrainment starts before day 10 of gestation. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The critical period for the entrainment of circadian rhythm in blinded pups by a foster mother with a rhythm inverted to that of the natural mother was determined by a convenient method for the analysis of the circadian rhythm of drinking behavior. The pups, optically enucleated on day 1, were transferred to the foster mother at various ages, measured in days from birth, and raised until weaning. When the pups were transferred before 4 days of age, the drinking rhythm of the adopted pups was in phase with that of the blinded natural pups born of and raised by the foster mother. On the other hand, when the mother was exchanged after 10 days of age, the rhythm of the adopted pups was out of phase with that of the natural pups of the foster mother. Pups exchanged on 5 or 7 days of age showed inconsistent phase of rhythm, either being entrained by the foster or the natural mothers, or affected by both mothers. These results indicate that blinded pups must be adopted by the foster mothers earlier than day 4 for the foster mothers to fully entrain the circadian rhythm of blinded pups. © 1984.

AB  - Pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in 10-day-old rat pups was used to examine several aspects of the developing circadian timing system. When born and reared under constant darkness, 10-day-old animals manifested a clear daily rhythm of NAT activity whose phase was in time with the estimated circadian time of the mother (set by the lighting cycle during pregnancy). When pups were reared in constant darkness from birth by a foster mother whose circadian time was 180° (12 h) out of phase with that of the natural mother, the resulting population profiles of NAT activity were arrhythmic. Analysis of the individual litter profiles from this experiment showed a variable postnatal influence of the maternal circadian system on the timing of the developing circadian system. Neither cross-fostering per se nor social interactions among litter mates contributed significantly to the apparent maternal influence. The magnitude of the postnatal maternal influence was not the same throughout development, but was most apparent during the first 5 days of life. Neonatal blinding (within 24 h of birth) did not appreciably alter the maternal influence. Extraretinal photore-ception does not contribute to entrainment of the circadian clock during postnatal development, and retina-mediated photic entrainmerit is present by 10 days of age. The results indicate that pineal NAT activity monitored in 10-day-old rats provides a useful paradigm for studying the developing circadian system. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Three experiments were conducted to determine whether housing in tether stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens imposes a stress upon gilts and sows. Changes in serum cortisol concentrations were used as the indicator for stress. In the first experiment, gilts were placed in tether stalls and individual pens to determine cortisol concentrations after tethering and to see if this response was different from gilts that were previously tethered for two weeks. In the second experiment, gilts were tethered in order to determine if penning in tether stalls altered the circadian rhythm of cortisol. In the third experiment, breeding sows were placed in tether stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens to determine if a ten-hour profile of cortisol concentrations were altered and if such housing affected a sow's response to transfer to farrowing crates. The results indicate that the initial response to tethering varied among gilts and sows and this variation appeared to be due to previous penning and human handling experiences. When tethering was stressful, acclimation required up to four days. However, once acclimated, tethering resulted in higher morning concentrations which may be associated with the greater activity that occurs at this time. Housing in tether stalls, gestation stalls or individual pens was not a stress for breeding sows and did not alter sows' responses to transfer into the farrowing crate.

AB  - Abstract. Intra‐uterine fetal movements indicate the wellbeing of the fetus and can be used in the detection of chronic fetal asphyxia. The daily variations in fetal activity follow an irregular pattern, though showing a peak of activity in the evening. The pattern of nocturnal activity is not known. In this study, fetal movements were monitored by maternal subjective recordings in 116 women with a normal pregnancy. In gestational weeks 31‐40, fetal movements were recorded intermittently for at least 3 hours, both in the daytime and at night. In the daytime, fetal activity was moderate. A maximum occurred in the evening between 9 and 10 p.m. At night there was a period of minimum activity between 1 and 5 a.m. A minor peak in fetal activity was seen between 7 and 8 a.m. The frequency of fetal movements followed a pattern of a circadian rhythm, which was influenced by exogenous factors. 1984 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - We have quantified the human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and human chorionic somatomammotropin (HCS) serum levels in normal pregnant women at 1-h intervals during 24 h, through radioimmunoassay procedures. The HCG levels were higher during the first trimester, although no circadian variations were detected. Some variations exceeded by ten fold: these variations decreased with advanced periods of gestation. No diurnal fluctuations in serum HCS were apparent; in a case nearly at term, there was an increase from 05:00 h to 09:00 h simulating a circadian pattern, although it was not statistically significant. These data indicate that the placental protein secretion is autonomous and that HCG levels of fluctuation during early stages of pregnancy might be regulated by factors other than the trophoblast. © 1984.

AB  - Abstract. Maternal counting of fetal movements is increasingly used as a clinical method for assessment of fetal health. The present study established normal limits for two methods of subjective fetal movement recording. Four hundred‐and‐seventeen randomly selected women with low‐risk pregnancies recorded the time necessary for 10 fetal movements every morning and also the number of fetal movements during 15 min every evening. The study was carried out between gestational week 34 and parturition. Two hundred‐and‐twenty‐two consecutive women answered a questionnaire after the end of the study. 70% of the women counted fetal movements every day; 66.5% preferred the evening to the morning recording. In a strictly selected normal group (n = 129), no significant change was found in the number of fetal movements or in the time for 10 fetal movements with advancing gestation or approaching parturition. The results of the evening sessions were not influenced by maternal parity, fetal weight, or fetal sex. The great interin‐dividual variation in the results does not allow the application of general normal limits. A method for establishing individual normal low limits for each pregnancy was designed. 1984 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - RU 486 is a synthetic steroid hormone antagonist which acts at the receptor level. It has both intrinsic antiprogesterone and antiglucocorticosteroid properties in animals. We investigated the antiglucocorticosteroid activity in humans by evaluating the pituitary-adrenal response to RU 486 in men and in pregnant and nonpregnant women. In nonpregnant women, RU 486 (~1 mg/kg of body weight per day) produced an interruption of the luteal phase without affecting the pituitary-adrenal axis, thereby indicating a more potent antiprogesterone than antiglucocorticosteroid effect. In the course of pregnancy interruption by RU 486 (~4 mg/kg per day), there was a significant increase in plasma corticotropin, β-lipotropin, and cortisol concentrations. In normal men, RU 486 administration led to a dose-dependent stimulation of plasma corticotropin, β-endorphin, and cortisol. This disinhibition of the pituitary-adrenal axis was only observed during the morning hours of the circadian rhythm. When administered concomitantly with 1 mg of dexamethasone at midnight, 6 mg of RU 486 per kg completely suppressed the dexamethasone inhibitory effect on the pituitary-adrenal axis. These results indicate that RU 486 is an antiglucocorticosteroid that disrupts the negative pituitary feedback of both the morning cortisol rise and administered dexamethasone. Furthermore, they demonstrate the possibility of optimizing the antiprogestational effect of the compound and its potential use for human fertility control by modifying the dose and the time of administration of the drug and thereby minimizing the antiglucocorticosteroid effect.

AB  - The opioid peptide endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins - found in brain, pituitary, and gut - are neurohormones involved in the regulation of a number of seemingly diverse biologic activities, including respiration, mood, pain perception, blood pressure, body temperature, and certain visceral responses. When viewed in integrated fashion, however, the spectrum of activities induced by the administration of both the exogenous opiates (e.g. morphine) and the endogenous opioids resembles a natural physiologic state: the sleep state. We propose that the opioid peptides in conjunction with the peptide neurohormone vasopressin are involved in the induction and maintenance of the sleep state. We also propose that the function of sleep is to protect an animal during periods when it is at a selective disadvantage, and we provide evidence to support and integrate both concepts. © 1984.

AB  - Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP)-like material was detected in human breast milk of two women by RIA with a recovery of about 90%. The high concentration of DSIPlike immunoreactivity (DSIP-LI) in colostrum (30 ng/ml) decreased to about 10 ng/ml in milk. The concentration continued to decrease over the next 2 months in one woman. In the same woman, a significant circadian rhythm of the amount of breast milk DSIP was found with the peak in the afternoon and the trough in the morning. A significant effect of the sampling procedure was detected in the other woman examined; lower amounts of DSIP-LI were found when the milk was collected before and higher concentrations after nursing. Gel chromatography revealed that most of the immunoreactive DSIP-LI in milk and colostrum occurred in a form larger than the nonapeptide. The presence of DSIP itself, however, was demonstrated by high pressure liquid chromatography, which also showed additional peptides reacting with the antibody. Digestion of the large immunoreactive DSIP-LI by trypsin produced a peak on Sephadex G-10 that coeluted with DSIP. This peak contained three immunoreactive fractions with retention times on high pressure liquid chromatography similar to DSIP, phosphorylated DSIP, and N-tyrosine-DSIP. Plasma samples taken during pregnancy were assayed for DSIP but no difference from normal values was found. Slightly higher amounts were found in placenta than in blood, which might be due to interfering substances. No Tyr-MIF-1 or corticotropin-releasing hormone was detected by RIA in human breast milk. Peptides and proteins of milk can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of babies, but it is not known if the DSIP-LI in human milk is involved in the induction of a sleep-wake cycle in neonates. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Summary. Saliva unconjugated, plasma unconjugated and plasma total oestriol (E3) levels were measured longitudinally, by radioimmunoassay, in 25 normal women from 13 weeks gestation until delivery. The increase in salivary unconjugated oestriol closely paralleled that of plasma unconjugated oestriol and to a lesser extent that of plasma total oestriol. In each patient the percentage value of salivary E3/plasma unconjugated E3 X 100 was virtually constant throughout pregnancy but this percentage varied from one patient to another (mean 14.4%). The overall correlation coefficient (r) for salivary and plasma unconjugated E3 was 0.90. The variability in salivary levels in samples collected at daily, hourly, 15 min and 5 min intervals (12.7, 13.4, 10.1 and 9.3%) was similar to that previously described for plasma unconjugated E3. There was no distinct pattern in diurnal variation. It seems probable that measurement of salivary E3 could adequately replace that of plasma unconjugated E3 in the assessment of fetoplacental function. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Some of the biochemical changes which occur at the menopause can be attributed to an increased rate of loss of bone but others cannot be explained in this way. Data, collected through literature search, are presented which suggest that the rise in plasma phosphate concentration at the menopause is not due primarily to increased breakdown of bone but rather to the following sequence of events: progesterone deficiency → respiratory hypoventilation → mild respiratory acidosis and hypoxia → compensatory metabolic alkalosis → altered carbohydrate metabolism → rise in plasma phosphate concentration. Increases in the concentration of many plasma constituents occur at the menopause, which appear to be due to fluid loss and haemoconcentration. A possible cause of these changes is a reduced secretion of vasopressin by the pituitary gland as a result of oestrogen deficiency. Increases in the fasting urinary excretion of phosphate, sodium and magnesium also occur at the menopause. These changes cannot be attributed to increased bone loss but could be due to the effects of oestrogen deficiency on circadian rhythms in the hypothalamus. © 1984.

AB  - The effect of phenobarbital (PB) on serum hormones in late pregnancy was investigated. 18 pregnant women were studied before and after 2 weeks of PB treatment (100 mg per os, daily at 8 p.m.) by measuring serum estradiol, estriol, progesterone, testosterone, prolactin and cortisol concentrations. 7 pregnant women without PB therapy served as controls. Estradiol levels in the morning decreased, whereas those of estriol increased both in the morning and evening during PB treatment. The estriol/estradiol ratio increased in women on PB. PB affected the diurnal variation of hormones; the decrease in estradiol concentration between 8.a.m. and 8 p.m. was eliminated and the decrease in estriol concentration became more clear. PB did not significantly affect the serum levels of the other hormones investigated. As an enzyme-inducer PB may affect the fate of sex hormones.

AB  - Continuous recording of body postures (standing or lying) using photocells connected to an event recorder was carried out on 125 pregnant sows tethered either by a thoracic girth or by a neck harness in six different farms, at different times of the year. Standing activity occupied an average of 250 min per day. This position occurred mainly during daytime, with amount of standing during the night (10 p.m. to 6 p.m.) averaging less than 2% of the total time. This mean value was found in 4 farms out of 6. However, on one farm, standing postures lasted 390 min and this hyperactivity was associated with stereotypes. In another farm, time spent standing did not exceed 180 min. In all cases, multiparous sows spent about 60% more time standing than first or second litter sows. Time spent standing was dependent on other animal characteristics such as physical condition and foot condition, and also on environmental factors. Activity rhythms were synchronized by food distribution. These results are discussed together with the potential of using motor activity to characterize adaptability of sows to tethering.

AB  - The development of a homologous radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of serum hamster prolactin (PRL) has facilitated our studies on monitoring the secretion patterns of this hormone during different states of reproduction. Four salient findings emerge from the present studies. First, rapid cardiac puncture without anesthesia does not affect serum PRL levels during selected times in the estrous cycle or during pregnancy. Second, serum PRL levels during the estrous cycle describe a daily rhythm of PRL release with maximum serum concentrations each day occurring in the afternoon and the highest of these occurring on proestrus (day 4 of cycle). Third, PRL release during pregnancy is characterized by a single surge each day; although the time of maximum PRL release varies, levels increase during the hours of darkness and decline to basal during the light. Fourth, the amount of PRL released during pregnancy diminishes with time; on day 15 the total amount of PRL in the serum is less than 10% of that measured on day 5.

AB  - The urinary excretion of 6β-hydroxycortisol (6β-OHF), free cortisol, and estriol was studied at 4-hourly intervals in 9 subjects between the 36th and 38th week of pregnancy. The ratio of 6β-OHF to creatinine showed a significant diurnal rhythm with a 40% fall from a peak at 06.00-10.00 h to a trough at 22.00-02.00 h. There was a significant positive correlation between the excretion of 6β-OHF and free cortisol. Estrogen excretion showed no diurnal variation. No increase was observed in the 6β-OHF:creatinine ratio in early morning urine samples from 5 subjects followed daily prior to the onset of spontaneous labour at term. Normal nonpregnant females were also found to excrete significant quantities of 6β-OHF. These findings suggest that the clinical significance of 6β-OHF levels measured in a single void sample of urine has to be reassessed in the face of such a marked diurnal variation. © 1984 S.

AB  - As compared to control subjects, patients with duodenal ulcer show decreased levels of serum G and increased levels of serum Group I pepsinogen (PGI). On the other hand, pregnant women in their third trimester show an increased level of serum G and decreased levels of serum PGI. Gastrin stimulates gastric secretion and has a trophic effect on the parietal cells. Concentrations of PGI in serum reflect the capacity of pepsin-secreting cells which are, in turn, closely related to the parietal cell mass. Pepsinogen/G ratio (PGI/G) could represent the effective acid-peptic secretory capacity. This study suggests that for screening and clinical purposes PGI/G ratio provides a good potentially discriminatory marker of gastric secreting capacity reliably correlating and improving the diagnostic significance of single G and/or PGI serum levels.

AB  - The daily hormonal fluctuations that occur simultaneously in the fetus, mother, and amniotic fluid during late gestation and before preterm parturition were studied in long term catheterized rhesus macaques. Blood and amniotic fluid samples were collected twice daily and analyzed by RIA for estrone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), progesterone, cortisol, andprostaglandin F2α metabolite (PGFM). Vaginal delivery in monkeys with live fetuses was preceded by rising concentrations of DHEAS infetal, but not maternal, blood. Parallel increases in fetal plasma estrone, maternal plasma estrone and estradiol, and amniotic fluid estrone preceded the rise in amniotic fluid PGFM (P &lt; .005, by analysis of variance). Cortisol levels remained stable in maternal blood and amniotic fluid, but increased before delivery in fetal blood. Nocturnal progesterone peaks in both fetal and maternal blood increased progressively in magnitude in fetuses before parturition. Rising concentrations of fetal DHEAS, estrone, and progesterone indicated an increase in adrenal activity before parturition in the rhesus fetus. PG production, reflected in amniotic fluid PGFMconcentrations, was temporally related to increasing amniotic fluid concentrations of estrone. Although progesterone withdrawal may occur at a local tissue level, parturition occurred without an apparent decrease in circulating maternal, circulating fetal, or amniotic fluid progesterone concentrations. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The effects of neonatal cortisol acetate administration on diurnal changes in serum corticosterone, progesterone and LH and on the response to pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) were examined in immature female rats. Neonatal cortisol treatment (250 μg/rat) abolished the diurnal rhythm of serum progesterone in rats at 27-29 days of age, and lowered overall the serum progesterone response to PMSG. Neonatal cortisol also reduced the number of animals ovulating on day 28 after PMSG injection 48 h earlier. This dosage of cortisol did not alter the diurnal rhythm of serum corticosterone in these animals. Serum LH concentrations in control rats at 27-29 days of age did not differ between 09.00 and 18.00 h, and prior treatment with cortisol acetate did not significantly influence serum concentrations of this hormone. Our data suggested that ovarian production of progesterone contributes significantly to diurnal fluctuations of this steroid in the circulation of immature rats. Perinatal exposure to cortisol acetate abolishes the diurnal rhythm of serum progesterone and impairs the ovarian response of the immature female rat to PMSG. The mechanism(s) by which cortisol acetate alters these processes remains to be determined.

The diurnal variation in amylase activity and the variation during a feeding were studied in two mothers. There is a high amylase activity in preterm colostrum, which slowly decreases during the first 2 months. The individual variation in amylase activity is considerable. There is no difference in amylase activity in preterm and term human milk. The isoamylase of pre-term milk is of the salivary type, just as in term milk. There is no great variation in amylase activity during a feeding or from one feeding to another. © 1984 Raven Press, New York.

AB  - During 6 mo two active testosterone-treated females fitted with chin-ball markers and paint were used to ascertain the time of onset of estrus in 56 cows of three genetic lines and at various stages of lactation. The two treated females were rotated every 24 h, and two colors of paint were used, one color for night, 1800 to 0600 h, and the other for day, 0600 to 1800 h. The incidence of behavioral signs of estrus, standing, mounting activity, and mucus discharge, also was recorded. More cows (65%) came into estrus during the night, and only 78% of the total marked cows, assumed to be in estrus, were observed standing by the herdsman, indicating that 22% of the cows would not have been observed in estrus by early morning and late afternoon observation by the herdsman. Similarly, of the marked cows a mucus discharge was observed for 60% and mounting activity by 62%. Neither parity nor days postpartum affected either time of onset of estrus or other overt signs of estrus. Differences among the genetic lines for standing and mounting activity were unexplained. © 1984, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rectal temperature and plasma prolactin level were measured hourly in "creole goats" during 27 consecutive hours in March, July and November. Simultaneously, air, "black-globe" temperature and relative humidity were measured at the height of the animals. Rectal temperature and plasma prolactin level varied according to hour and season and were always higher during the day than during the night. Plasma prolactin level increased dramatically for 3 h after dusk only in March. Rectal temperature showed a significantly higher correlation with air temperature than with "black-globe" temperature. On the contrary, plasma prolactin level was more significantly correlated with "black-globe" temperature than with air temperature. When all seasons and hours were pooled, "black-globe" temperature showed a threshold (32-34 degrees C), beyond which prolactin reached values higher than 100 ng/ml. Rectal temperature was always significantly correlated with plasma prolactin level. Plasma prolactin level as an index of thermal stress and the role of prolactin in thermoregulation have been discussed.

AB  - In this contribution the regulation of the synthesis of the macronutrients (lactose, lipid, protein) of rat milk are briefly reviewed. Lactose synthesis and lipid synthesis in mammary gland have glucose as the common precursor, and the rates of both processes show diurnal changes that correlate with the variations in food intake. Short-term (6-h) removal of food results in large decreases in the rates of synthesis of lactose and lipid, despite any change in plasma glucose or insulin. Similarly, an intragastric load of fat rapidly decreases de novo lipogenesis in the mammary gland. The existence of a factor in the circulation that signals the dietary intake of carbohydrate is postulated. This putative factor may originate from the intestine. Synthesis of protein appears less sensitive to dietary intake and is regulated mainly by prolactin.

AB  - Vaginal temperature patterns were obtained from 15 Holstein cows through radiotelemetry. Animals were divided into three groups with five animals per group: 1) cows in early lactation, less than 100 days postpartum, 2) cows in late lactation, greater than 240 days postpartum, and 3) dry cows. Animal temperatures, dry bulb, wet bulb, and black globe temperatures were monitored every 15 min for 17 days. Analysis of variance showed no significant difference for daily mean vaginal temperature between lactation groups. However, on hotter days, lactating cows had higher temperatures than dry cows. Daily mean vaginal temperatures of cows in early lactation were correlated with daily mean dry bulb temperature, black globe temperature, and relative humidity. Comparison of group temperature patterns isolated differences to specific times of day. In groups with early and late lactations, temperatures were lower in either group after milking. Vaginal temperatures were higher in lactating cows than in dry cows through most of the day. Results were 1) diurnal temperature patterns differ among groups; 2) lactating cows are sensitive to environmental changes; and 3) animal management can affect patterns of animal temperature. © 1984, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - Dairy Herd Improvement Association sample-day data were analyzed 1) to explain variation of month-to-month differences of single milking yields and fat percents and 2) to develop adjustment factors for estimating daily yield and fat tests from a single milking. Prior to analyses, single sample data were adjusted for month-to-month differences determined from standard two sample data. Guernsey and Holstein data involving 1,632 and 16,784 cows were available in the single sample files. Analyses were separate for Guernseys and Holsteins and for yield and test. Regression equations involving from 13 to 16 independent variables accounted for proportions of variance of the dependent variable ranging from .31 to .48 for the four combinations of breed and trait. Regression equations for adjustment of Dairy Herd Improvement Association single sample data were developed. Each equation included only two independent variables for adjustment purposes. Those equations developed from Holstein data have been implemented by the Pennsylvania Dairy Herd Improvement Association to adjust single sample data for all breeds. © 1984, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - Abstract. Pregnancy‐specific β1‐glycoprotein (SP1) levels in uncomplicated single pregnancies were measured by radio‐immunoassay from the time of ovulation until the 8th week of pregnancy in 129 blood samples from 78 women. SP1 was detectable in all samples examined from 34 days after the last menstrual period (LMP), and thereafter the SP1 level increased rapidly with time and 38 to 40 days after LMP the geometric mean SP1 concentration was 90 μg/l. From pregnancy weeks 8 to 41, SP1 levels were measured by nephelo‐metry in 1 255 blood samples from 1 255 women. A 95% reference range was established using logarithmic transformation. There was a steady increase in the SP1 concentration until the last month of pregnancy, in which a tendency to level off was seen, the geometric mean levels ranging from 149 to 170 mg/1. The day‐to‐day variation was studied during 5 consecutive days in 10 women. No significant variation was found. The diurnal variation was studied in blood samples taken every 4th hour during a 24‐hour period form 10 women. A significant decrease was found at midnight and at 4 a.m. The elimination rate of SP1 from serum was studied in 10 women following labor. Elimination was non‐linear and the time taken for SP1 to decrease to 50% ranged from 24 to 50 hours. No correlation was found between the concentration of SP1 and parity, maternal age, or the sex of the infant. The SP1 concentration was significantly lower in heavier women (&gt; 70 kg) than in lighter women (≤ 70 kg). In some weeks of late pregnancy the SP1 level showed a correlation to placen‐tal weight and birth weight of the infant. 1984 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - Quantitation of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 (2,3-dinor-TxB2) was performed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Under normal conditions the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 was relatively constant in the same individual from day to day but during a 24-hour period a somewhat higher excretion rate was found during the first few hours after awakening. A pronounced reduction of the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 was found after oral administration of 500 mg of aspirin or 50 mg of indomethacin, while 500 mg of paracetamol did not affect the urinary excretion. Increased excretion of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 was found in normal pregnancies and in diseases such as diabetes mellitus and homocysteinuria in comparison to the urnary excretion in normal healthy subjects. We also report one case, where the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 was increased for a short period following the first symptoms of a infarction and those data indicate that thromboxane A2 (TxA2 may be of pathophysiological importance in human myocardial infarction. The results strongly indicate that measurements of the urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-TxB2 should be meaningful as a tool for investigation of the involvement of thromboxane in various pathophysiological processes in vivo in man. © 1984.

AB  - We developed a specific RIA for a somatomedin (Sm)-binding protein, with an approximate mol wt of 35–40,000, purified from midgestational human amniotic fluid (AF) and termed AF-binding protein (AFBP). After Sephadex G-200 chromatography AFBP-RIA activity was found in fractions of fetal and cord serum only at a kav corresponding to a mol wt of ± 40,000. Whole serum or plasma dilutions in a range of 1:20 to 1:600 showed parallelism with the standard curve. Sm-binding activity in fetal serum was found solely at a mol wt of 30–40,000; in cord serum additionally at a mol wt range of 150–200,000. AFBP serum or plasma concentrations determined by RIA were influenced by several factors: AFBP values in eight adults were highest in the morning (mean ± SEM, 0.7 ± 0.1 μgeq/ml) and lowest at night (0.3 ± 0.1). AFBP values in pre-and postnatal serum showed a gradual decline with increasing age: fetal serum: mean ± SEM, 36.7 ± 15.7 (n = 17); adults: 0.6 ± 0.07 μgeq/ml (n = 19). In serum from GH-deficient children AFBP concentrations were significantly higher than in an age-matched control group (P &lt; 0.05). Elevated values also were found in serum of children with end-stage renal failure and in serum of pregnant women at 36 weeks of gestation. AFBP was found in urine of preterm infants (mean ± SEM, 0.04 ± 0.005 μgeq/ml; n = 31). AFBP immunoreactivity was demonstrable in serum of three orangoutan mothers and their three children and in medium of a hepatoma cell line (PLC/PRF/5) but not in bovine, porcine, rabbit, or rat serum or in medium of cell cultures of (pre-)term placentae. We conclude that AFBP immunoreactivity is present in pre-and postnatal serum and has striking similarity to an unsaturated serum Sm-binding protein with a mol wt of ±40,000. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The amount of prolactin has been determined in serial blood samples taken over 24 h from 20 pre‐ and 9 post‐menopausal women volunteers. All women had a large increase in prolactin at night (24.00 h‐03.00 h). A much smaller rise in prolactin occurred in the evening (18.00 h‐20.00 h) which was just significantly different (p < 0.05) from levels found in the afternoon. Prolactin concentrations at any given time in the 29 women were linearly correlated with corresponding levels in either of the adjacent time intervals. This correlation was highly significant (p < 0.001) throughout 24 h, implying that a woman with a relatively high (or low) blood prolactin in the afternoon would have a similarly high (or low) concentration in the evening or at night. Premenopausal women had higher amounts of prolactin than postmenopausal volunteers throughout the day. Parity was found to be inversely related to prolactin levels in pre‐ and postmenopausal women; this effect was especially marked in the night peak of prolactin. In postmenopausal women an average of 33 years had elapsed since the birth of the last child, which implies that childbirth has a life‐long effect on reducing prolactin levels. Thus the protective effect of early childbearing and multiparity against developing breast cancer could be at least partly explained by these effects on serum prolactin levels.

AB  - Total plasma cortisol measurements may be misleading when there are variations in the plasma cortisol‐binding protein capacity resulting from drugs, pregnancy or congenital alterations in cortisol‐binding globulin (CBG). Salivary cortisol levels, which represent the free component of plasma cortisol, are less affected by alterations in protein binding and have been used in the investigation of hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal disorders. This study compares these two indices of adrenal function in conditions of true hypercortisolism and spurious hypercortisolism (resulting from oral contraceptive medication or pregnancy). The circadian variation of cortisol in plasma and saliva was studied in six patients with unequivocal hypercortisolism and compared with normal volunteers. In the normal group, plasma and salivary cortisol levels taken at 0900 h were significantly higher than those taken at 2400 h. Patients with Cushing's syndrome failed to show a significant difference between plasma and salivary cortisol levels collected at 0900 and 2400 h. Five patients with pituitary‐dependent Cushing's disease, one patient with an adrenal carcinoma causing Cushing's syndrome and seven normal subjects each received a dexamethasone suppression test using a continuous infusion of dexamethasone sodium phosphate at a rate of 1 mg/h. There was no significant difference in the half‐life disappearance rate of endogenous cortisol in either plasma or saliva comparing grouped data from patients with pituitary‐dependent Cushing's disease with that of normal subjects. Failure of suppression of both plasma and salivary cortisol levels was observed in the one patient with adrenal carcinoma during dexamethasone infusion. The correlation between plasma and salivary cortisol measurements during the dexamethasone infusion was r=0·989 (P < 0·001) for normals and r= 0·982 (P < 0·001) for Cushing's patients. Measurements of plasma and salivary cortisol were compared in pregnancy and during low dose oestrogen therapy; both these conditions are known to be associated with elevated cortisol binding globulin concentrations. A significant difference was demonstrated between the 0900 h plasma cortisol levels of normal subjects and those both in the third trimester of pregnancy of the oestrogen containing contraceptive pill. No difference was observed in the 0900 h salivary cortisol between control and pregnant or oestrogen treated groups. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The circulating concentration of placental protein 12 was measured by radioimmunoassay in 109 pregnant women. The effect on the serum PP12 level of temperature, repeat freezing and thawing, and day-to-day and diurnal variation were assessed and the post partum changes of levels were studied. On average, PP12 levels in plasma are about one-half of those in serum in the same individual. PP12 immunoreactivity is destroyed by heating but not by repeated freezing and thawing. Changes in serum PP12 levels at various times of day showed a significant and consistent diurnal variation (F=7.21; d.f. 24; 96; P<0.001). The peak mean (±s.e.m.) value at 0800 h (80.8±8.7 ng/ml) was 41 per cent higher than the 24-h mean (P<0.05), and the nadir concentration at 1400 h (40.4±5.4 ng/ml) was 29 per cent lower than the 24-h mean (P<0.025). There is also considerable day-to-day variation (up to 72 per cent) in serum PP12 levels. If serum samples are taken at 0700 h, there is a slight negative correlation between PP12 concentration and placental weight (P<0.05), but not between PP12 level and birthweight of the child. In term pregnancy, the levels taken at 0700 h are higher (163.7±12.4 ng/ml) than at 0900 to 1300 h (115.7±11.4 ng/ml, P<0.001). The PP12 level is not affected by labour. Post partum, the levels rise during the first hour and then decline between one and three hours at a rate corresponding to a half-life of 4 h 40 min (median). The non-pregnant PP12 level is sometimes reached by as early as three hours after delivery, but in many cases there is a secondary rise thereafter. This rise is not correlated to suckling. Our results show that the type of blood sampling as well as its exact timing are critical determinants in the clinical evaluation of maternal serum PP12 levels. The pattern of diurnal variation of serum PP12 level resembles that of plasma prolactin and cortisol, and indicates a possible relationship to hormonal influence. © 1984, W. B. Saunders Company Ltd..

AB  - Milk yield and composition were measured in 74 Holstein cows and first-calf heifers in two experiments comparing varying lengths of photoperiod. High pressure sodium vapor lamps provided light intensity at cow eye level of 254 ± 26 1x during the day and 132 ± 9 1x at night in a free stall barn open on two sides. The first experiment compared continuous light with 18 h light for 16 wk during the winter in animals previously exposed to continuous light. Photoperiod had no effect on milk yield or basal concentration of serum prolactin in either age group. Peak concentration of prolactin after injection of thyrotropin releasing hormone was not affected by photoperiod in heifers but was higher in cows exposed to 18 h light. The second experiment compared natural photoperiod (9 to 12 h light) with 18 h light for 9 wk during the winter in animals previously exposed to a natural photoperiod. Photoperiod had no effect on 4% fat-corrected milk in heifers whereas there was a significant interaction of photoperiod by week for 4% fat-corrected milk in cows. Basal concentration of serum prolactin was lower in cows than in heifers although there were no differences due to age or photoperiod after injection of thyrotropin releasing hormone. We conclude that multipara Holstein cows produce about 7% more 4% fat-corrected milk during winter months when exposed to 18 h light providing they were previously in a natural photoperiod environment. For reasons not understood, 18 h light failed to enhance milk yield of cows previously in a continuous light environment. Milk yield and composition in heifers wer e not affected by 18 h or continuous light. © 1984, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dependence of periovulatory gonadotropin secretion on LHRH was assessed with the use of a potent LHRH antagonist [ALHRH; (Nac-L-Ala1, p-Cl-D-Phe2, D-Trp3, 6) LHRH]. Blood samples were collected hourly from 14.00 h proestrus (P) through 09.00 h estrus (E) from intact cycling female rats. ALH RH was administered at 09.00 or 13.00 h P before the proestrous increases in gonadotropins had commenced or at 23.00 h P after the LH and primary FSH surges had occurred but preceding the secondary FSH surge. Antagonist given at 09.00 or 13.00 h P completely blocked the LH release with levels remaining undetectable in most animals (< 30 ng/ml) throughout the sampling period. However, administration of antagonist at these times failed to block completely the primary FSH surge although peak values were reduced when compared with controls, which displayed normal gonadotropin surges. In addition, ALHRH administered at 23.00 h failed to alter the magnitude or other characteristics of the secondary FSH surge when compared with controls. The present study demonstrates that the estrous surge of FSH in the rat is independent of acute hypothalamic release of LHRH. Furthermore, although the proestrous release of FSH is to a large extent LHRH dependent, our data suggest that some other mechanism may also contribute to this primary FSH surge. © 1984 S.

AB  - Thermistors were implanted in the right front quarter of udder and peritoneal cavity of six lactating Holstein cows to investigate whether udder temperature is regulated independently of deep body temperature. Sequential measurements of udder, body, chamber, and outdoor temperatures were every 1.4 min (1024 readings/probe per 24 h) by digital computer. Cows were housed (except for short exercise periods) in a chamber at 16.7 ± .3°C, lights on 0730 to 1630 and 2100 to 0200 h. Temperature was monitored continuously for 5 days in three cows in early lactation and in three cows in late lactation. Udder temperature was closely correlated with body temperature (body and udder temperatures were 38.8 ± .1°C). Five of six cows showed two patterns of temperature variation: a 24-h pattern with two troughs each day – minimum at 0930 to 1100 h, increase 1.0°C by 1200 to 1300 h, decline 1°C from 2000 to 2200 h, second minimum by 2100 to 2200 h, and constant elevation from 2300 to 0800 h (peak to trough, 1.23 ± .09°C); and superimposed upon the 24-h rhythm was an ultradian rhythm with an approximate 90 min period (peak to trough, .5 ± .03°C). Rhythmicity of udder and body temperatures should be considered in research on the chronobiology of milk secretion and mastitis. © 1984, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - During a systematic study of women with idiopathic galactorrhea, we observed several patients with normal random serum prolactin (PRL) levels and normal menses, but abnormal sellar tomograms characteristic of a pituitary adenoma. To test the hypothesis that these women might have intermittent PRL hypersecretion, we studied PRL secretion by sampling blood every half hour for 24 h in 10 patients and for 17.5 h in another, and compared the findings to those of a group of 5 normal women. The mean 24-h PRL of the 10 patients (16.8 ± 7.8 ng/ml; mean ± SD) was not significantly different from that of the normal women (13.6 ± 3.2 ng/ml), and each patient showed a normal sleep-associated PRL increment. Three individuals exhibited an abnormally elevated 24-h PRL (> 20 ng/ml). Increased PRL secretion occurred primarily at night or in the afternoon. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) administration caused normal or exaggerated PRL responses in all patients tested. High resolution CT scanning of two of the hypersecre-tors suggested a microadenoma in one case. In another case whose PRL was normal over 17.5 h, transsphenoidal surgery, carried out because of the tomographic findings and the symptom of headaches, demonstrated a 5-mm chromophobe adenoma that did not contain PRL by immuno-histochemistry. Postoperatively the galactorrhea persisted. We conclude that most women with galactorrhea, normal PRL., normal menses, and abnormal tomograms have normal PRL secretion. However, a minority of patients with this syndrome do demonstrate intermittent PRL hypersecretion. The etiology of intermittent PRL hypersecretion and its relevance to galactorrhea have not been determined. Furthermore the clinical and pathological significance of the “abnormal” tomograms and their relevance to PRL secretion and galactorrhea are not clear. © 1984, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine plasma progesterone (P4) changes around the time of the onset of the LH surge in women superovulated with clomiphene citrate and human Menopausal Gonadotrophin for in uitro fertilization (IVF). It was considered that changes in P4 levels which should be closely associated with the onset of the LH surge may be an accurate indicator for the time of oocyte recovery for IVF and that premature P4 secretion may prevent the establishment of pregnancy after embryo replacement. The plasma P4 concentrations determined at 0800, 1400, and 2100 h during the period 36 h before to 16 h after the onset of the LH surge in 72 women showed a significant diurnal variation with the nadir at 0800 h. The onset of the LH surge was detected in 51%, 32%, and 17% of patients at 0800, 1400, and 2100 h, respectively. The first significant increase in mean P4 concentrations was coincident with the onset of the LH surge at 1400 and 2100 h but because of the diurnal nadir of P4 at 0800 h, the increase in mean P4 levels was delayed until 1400 h when the LH surge began at 0800 h. Elevation of P4 concentrations from 2 to 8 nmol/liter in individual patients at 1400 and 2100 h before the onset of the LH surge did not prevent the establishment of pregnancy after embryo transfer. P4 concentrations before and after the onset of the LH surge were higher with increasing numbers of mature follicles. We conclude that changes in plasma P4 concentrations may be used to determine the time of ovulation or oocyte recovery for IVF because of their close association with the timing of the onset of the LH surge. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Two μg of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was infused into a lateral ventricle of the brain of female rats at 09.00 or 13.00 h on the different days of the oestrous cycle and the effect on luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin (Prl) release was determined. At 09.00 h PGE2 caused a pronounced release of LH in pro-oestrous, oestrous and metoestrous rats whereas the LH response in dioestrous rats was moderate. The secretion of Prl was only stimulated in rats from the pro-oestrous phase. When infused at 13.00 h PGE2 had a marked stimulatory effect on the release of LH in all groups of rats. The response was almost the same in oestrous, metoestrous and dioestrous rats but pro-oestrous rats a 2-fold higher LH response was observed. On each day of the oestrous cycle it was found that the LH-releasing activity of PGE2 was greater at 13.00 h than at 09.00 h. Thus, the overall greatest responsiveness of LH to PGE2 was noted at 13.00 h on pro-oestrous i.e. at a time which was prior to the onset of the spontaneous LH surge. At 13.00 h - as at 09.00 h - PGE2 was only capable of stimulating Prl release in pro-oestrous rats. Resembling the LH response it was found that PGE2-induced Prl release was greater at 13.00 h than at 09.00 h. In adult male rats the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on LH and Prl release was independent of the time of administration. It is concluded that the neuroendocrine elements of the hypothalamo-pituitary unit in mature female rats exhibit cyclic as well as diurnal alterations in the responsiveness to PGE2.

AB  - The intestinal absorption of calcium involves an active transport against an electrochemical gradient, a saturable and a nonsaturable transfer following the gradient. The active and the saturable components are transcellular, the nonsaturable component is partly paracellular. Calcium transfer through the intestinal cell includes three steps: 1) the 'down-hill' crossing of the brush-border implies binding to specific sites, carrier-mediated transport using channels or carrier proteins specific to Ca and dependent upon phosphorylation of alakline phosphatases; the phospholipid composition of the brush-border also plays a role; 2) the intracellular transfer is characterized by an uptake by such organelles as mitochondria, lysosomes and Golgi vesicles and by a transfer on a specific calcium-binding protein; 3) the 'up-hill' transfer across the baso-lateral membrane requires energy and energy is mediated by an ATP-activated Ca2+ pump and a Na+/Ca2+ antiport. 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, a steroid hormone synthetized from vitamin D3, is the major direct regulator of Ca absorption: in the vitamin D-deprived animal, it increases the selective permeability for Ca of the brush-border, induces the synthesis of proteins after genomic transcription, activates the Ca-ATPases, and acts as a trophic hormone. The other hormones principally act by modulation of the renal biosynthesis of 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. The efficiency of Ca absorption depends on the site: duodenum &gt; jejunum &gt; caecum &gt; ileum. Dietary constituents such as carbohydrates and amino acids increase Ca absorption whereas phytic acid and excess of phosphorus decrease it. They act by modifying Ca bioavailability and perhaps brush-border permeability. Adaptation to increased demand occurs during growth, pregnancy and lactation in normal states but disappears during vitamin D deficiency. In man, lowered efficiency with increasing age is often aggravated by a low calcium diet.

AB  - Cyclic release of gonadotropin (GTH) begins on day 16 or 17 of age, about 2 weeks before ovulatory estrous cycles are initiated in female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). The daily cycles of LH and FSH are characterized by surges that peak at about 1700 h. The timing of this daily surge is similar to that observed in adult photoperiod-induced anovulatory or lactating females and to that of ovulatory females on the afternoon of proestrus. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if initiation of cyclic GTH release during the prepubertal period results in significant changes in ovarian function. A second objective was to examine the similarity between cyclic secretion of GTH in the prepubertal animal and that in the short day anovulatory adult. Groups of prepubertal females were killed throughout a 24-h period on days 13-14, 19-20, and 27-28, i.e. both before and after the expected onset of cyclic GTH release. LH did not vary significantly on days 13-14, but thereafter showed a significant rhythm, with a maximum at 1700 h. Levels of progesterone (P) were low and nonvarying on days 13-14, but a significant rhythm was measured in samples collected on days 27-28. When samples were collected from photoperiodinduced anovulatory adults, the rhythm of circulating LH and P was similar to that in the late prepubertal female. Ovariectomy of 22-day-old females resulted in low and tonic levels of P when the animals were killed 3 days later at 1400, 1700, and 2000 h, showing that the cyclical rhythm of P measured in these samples results from ovarian, not adrenal, secretion. The response of the daily cycle of LH to phenobarbital (PB) blockade in prepubertal females was identical to that in the adult: the LH surge did not occur on the afternoon of PB injection, but reappeared 24 h later at the expected time. The late afternoon surge of P was also blocked by PB administration. These results show 1) that the initiation of cyclic GTH secretion by the prepubertal female hamster influences ovarian maturation as reflected by changes in the levels and patterns of secretion of P; 2) that the rhythms of LH, FSH, and P secretion in the prepubertal female are similar to those in the photoperiodinduced anovulatory adult; and 3) that the response of the prepubertal female to barbiturate blockade is identical to that of the adult. Thus, the initiation of cyclic GTH secretion at the midpoint of the prepubertal period represents the final maturation of neuronal oscillator systems that will function in the adult. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - We studied the occurrence of ≥ 2 sec. respiratory pauses (RP) in very low risk, normal prematurely born infants (≤ 36 wks. of gestation), recorded when they reached 37-40 wks. conceptional age and compared the results with those of fullterm (37-41 wks. of gestation) newborns. The influence of gestational age at birth (GA), postnatal age, sleep states, twin birth and gross body movements was tested. We recorded 2434 central RP and only one 4 sec. duration obstructive RP. We never observed RP > 15 sec. 10-15 sec. RP were rare, noted only in 37-38 wks. GA newborns. We found some differences between prematures reaching normal term on the one hand and full-term newborns on the other: a) RP frequency and periodic breathing were higher in prematurely born infants; b) between-sleep state differences leveled out in prematures reaching normal term (they had more numerous RP in all sleep states), while the prevalence of RP in active sleep compared to quiet sleep was constant in full-term newborns. There were no significant differences between prematurely born twins and singletons. When they reached normal term, infants born before 35 wks. of gestation had more RP, compared to infants born at 35-36 wks. of gestation. About 12% of RP occurred after gross body movements.

AB  - We wished to investigate mechanisms by which non-labour contractions of the uterus influence fetal sleep states and respiratory activity during late pregnancy. The relationship between the dimensions of the fetal chest and uterine contractions was examined in 5 pregnant sheep. The dorso-ventral dimension at the level of the xiphisternum (3 fetuses) decreased, on average by 4.4-9.4% while increases of 16.6-18.7% were seen in the transverse dimension (4 fetuses). Blood flow in a middle uterine artery was monitored using a Doppler technique in 5 pregnant sheep. Non-labour uterine contractions were accompanied by mean reductions of 6.5-12.7% in blood flow. Postural adjustments by the ewe also influenced uterine blood flow. A mean increase in blood flow of 5.9-12.0% followed a change from standing to lying; standing caused a mean reduction of 5.9-11.8%. We conclude that the influence of uterine contractions on the fetus is likely to be complex, involving distortion of the body and alterations in utero-placental haemodynamics.

AB  - We studied locally anesthetized lamb fetuses (140-144 days' gestation) in utero on the day of surgical preparation (the acute preparation) to correlate sleep/wake (S/W) states with fetal breathing movements (FBM) activated by CO2 with and without endorphin displacement by naloxone. We placed electrodes for definition of S/W states, a carotoid arterial catheter for injections and measurements of pressure, pHa, PaCO2 and PaCO2, and intratracheal and intraesophageal catheters for measurement of FBM and esophageal motility. We recorded the onset, pattern and cessation of breathing and estimated fetal respiratory responsitivity to CO2 rebreathing by the ewe using our fetal CO2 test (Moss, I.R. and Scarpelli, E.M., 1979, J. Appl. Physiol. 47: 527-531). Activation of breathing by CO2 either accompanied or followed wakefulness (W)/ FBM and W were sustained throughout CO2 stimulation. Cessation of breathing after the CO2 test was temporally associated with the resumption of sleep. When the test was started in active sleep (AS) and W, breathing threshold to CO2 was lower than when it was started in quiet sleep (QS). Naloxone treatment (1) resulted in activation of FBM in association with W, (2) lowered CO2 threshold as compared to that of CO2 entered in QS without naloxone, and (3) caused greater FBM responses to CO2 than without naloxone. These results extend previous reports from our laboratory in that they demonstrate the importance of W to normal respiratory responsivity to CO2 in the acute fetal preparation and the possible role of endorphins in respiratory control. © 1983.

AB  - The authors report on results of examinations of 18 women between the 38th and 42nd weeks of pregnancy in respect of the observation of foetal sleep/waking cycles. The following parameters were noted simultaneously, i.e. with time synchronicity: foetal heart rate, foetal eye movements, foetal thorax movements, and movements of the body and extremities. On the basis of the criteria published by Prechtl (1974) and by Nijhuis et al. (1982) it is possible to define with relative accuracy foetal sleep/waking cycles just before the term of birth; 4 independent researchers achieved agreement in the allocation of the various cycles in 86% of the cases investigated by them. In view of the fact that monitoring is complicated and exacting, recording cannot be continuous all the time and certain dropout periods must be taken into account. This applies, for example, to the foetal heart rate, foetal eye movements and movements of the thorax. The average dropout time during recording of foetal heart rate is 16%, during recording of foetal eye movements 22%, and of foetal thorax movements 3%. 11% of the recordings could not be evaluated because of poor recording quality and faulty monitoring. In the study under reference the shortest period of a cycle was three minutes, whereas the longest phase recorded so far was 39 minutes. In 55% of all monitored pregnancies between the 38th and 42nd weeks of pregnancy the foetus was awake, whereas in 45% the foetus was found to be asleep.

AB  - PRL release, milk ejection, and electroencephalographic states of sleep were monitored in conscious, lactating Holtzman rats. Plasma PRL levels were low in rats separated from their litters, but they increased when pups were returned to the cage, attached to the nipples of the mother, and suckled. The pups emitted ultrasonic vocalizations upon their return to the cage and before their attachment to the nipples. Exposure of mothers to the vocalizations of pups, whereas nipple attachment was prevented, failed to increase PRL release. In confirmation of previous work, milk ejection did not occur until the suckled mother exhibited electroencephalographic signs of sleep, and milk ejection could be inhibited if sleep was prevented. In contrast, sleep was not a prerequisite for PRL release and sleep deprivation of suckled mothers could not inhibit release of PRL. In summary, suckling-induced release of PRL was followed by an increased incidence of sleep and then by milk ejection. It is hypothesized that the rise in plasma PRL induces the sleep necessary for the reflex release of oxytocin required for milk ejection. © 1984 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Recording the fetal cardiac rhythm (FCR) is currently the technique most widely used to assess the well being of the fetus. In view of the importance of the decisions taken on the modifications of the FCR, the authors have recorded and analysed over 24 consecutive hours 10 resting women manifesting a strictly normal pregnancy. They observed no modification in the basal cardiac frequency, very few declarations and above all, never any signs of a flat or sinusoidal rhythm. Flattening of the FCR is invariably pathological. It must not be interpreted as "fetal sleep" period, but it should intensify the surveillance. © 1984.

AB  - Prospective data on 86 pregnant women were analysed to investigate the relationship between the pregnancy symptoms of nausea and vomiting and various demographic, social and psychological factors. In contrast to previous research findings no significant differences were discovered along demographic or social dimensions between women reporting no nausea, mild nausea and severe nausea during the first trimester of pregnancy. Not surprisingly, those women experiencing severe nausea reported significantly more sleep disturbances, fatigue and irritability. Women having both nausea and vomiting during the first trimester, reported significantly more unplanned, undesired pregnancies and negative relationships with their own mothers, than first trimester groups experiencing nausea only or no symptoms. Finally, those with continuing nausea and vomiting in the third trimester, when compared with those having no symptoms, tended to have reported significantly more psychological/psychiatric problems in the first trimester and were significantly more negative in their assessment of their own maternal relationship. 1984 The British Psychological Society

AB  - The experiments were designed to examine (1) the effects of acute hypoxia and (2) the influence of sleep states on the electrical activity of the cerebellum in the fetus. Five fetal sheep were instrumented between 106 and 133 days of gestation and survived in utero until term (140-146 days). Insulated stainless electrodes (75 μm diam.) were introduced into the cerebellar cortex and cemented in place. Electrodes were also implanted into 4 fetuses to monitor the electrocorticogram, rapid eye movements and the EMG of the dorsal neck (nuchal) muscles. Recordings of cerebellar activity were made for 252 h in 4 fetuses. The recordings were derived from many units (probably Purkinje cells) with a high level of basal discharge. The mean firing frequency was related to fetal sleep state. The highest frequencies coincided with episodes of rapid eye movements with low-voltage electrocortical activity and the lowest occurred during high-voltage electrocortical activity when rapid eye movements are absent. Acute hypoxaemia (fetal paO2 6-10 mm Hg for up to 30 min) abolished rapid eye movements and caused a marked reduction in cerebellar activity. High-voltage electrocortical activity and nuchal EMG activity were maintained indicating that the effects of hypoxia on the cerebellum were not due simply to a general CNS depression. Cerebellar neural activity returned to normal at the termination of the hypoxic stimuli demonstrating that fetal Purkinje cells can withstand short episodes of severe hypoxia. © 1984.

AB  - EEG sleep recordings and two provocative neuroendocrinological tests (the DST and the GH stimulation test after desipramine) were investigated in two depressed pubertal monozygotic twin boys with Major Depressive Disorder and compared with results from one normal pubertal control boy and an adolescent girl suffering from major depression. REM latency was reduced in the adolescent depressed girl but not in the pubertal depressed twin children when compared to the normal control. Sleep continuity and sleep architecture were, however, disturbed in pubertal and adolescent depression as a function of severity of the depressive state. The results of the DST showed abnormal cortisol values in the most severely depressed twin and in the depressed adolescent. GH secretion after DMI showed a clear GH response in the less depressed twin and in the normal subject while in the depressed adolescent, the GH response was blunted. The findings suggest that REM latency disturbances in our depressed patients do not appear before adolescence, while neuroendocrine dysfunction can already be present in pubertal depression. © 1984 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

AB  - The mechanism and site of action of endomethacin-induced fetal breathing (FB) was investigated in 26 chronically prepared fetal lambs. Indomethacin, which preferentially blocks prostaglandin production, was infused into the fetal circulation in two stages, 60 mg in 10 min and 60 mg over 7 h. Indomethacin stimulated sleep-state independent FB that was greatly reduced or abolished by infusions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Infusions of nordihydroguaiaretic acid, which preferentially blocks the synthesis of leukotrienes, had no consistent effect on either fetal sleep or breathing activity when administered alone or after indomethacin. This suggests that the characteristic FB induced by indomethacin is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (PGE2) and not due to an overproduction of leukotrienes. The indomethacin effect on FB was observed in all fetuses tested including those deprived of peripheral chemoreceptor function, vagotomy, decortication, or spinal cord section at the T1 level. Complete constriction of the ductus arteriosus for many hours had no effect on FB. We conclude that inhibition of PGE2 synthesis stimulates FB by a central mechanism other than the cortex.

AB  - Adult rats whose dopamine receptor number was reduced via prenatal haloperidol exposure were less resistant than controls to pentobarbital narcosis. This altered resistance was functional (CNS) and not metabolic, as shown by pentobarbital brain levels. These results are consistent with our previous experiments, indicating that changes in the number of dopamine receptors may underlie relative susceptibility to barbiturates. © 1984.

AB  - Newborn infants of mothers who drink heavily (>2 oz alcohol per day) during pregnancy have been shown to have hypersynchrony of the EEG. The possibility that hypersynchrony is related to acute alcohol withdrawal was tested. Eleven preterm infants of mothers who drank heavily ('alcoholic') were studied at a postnatal age of 4 to 6 weeks using power spectral analysis of EEG signals. This group was compared with a control group with similar racial and socioeconomic status. In addition, a group of ten 'healthy' preterm infants was compared with a carefully matched control group. Total power of the EEG during quiet, indeterminate and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was 162%, 183%, and 188%, respectively, in the infants whose mothers were alcoholic when compared with their control infants or with the healthy preterm infants and their control infants. It is concluded that ingestion of alcohol during pregnancy may result in potentially serious prolonged effects on brain function of the offspring, even in the absence of dysmorphology.

AB  - The effects of captopril (intravenous loading dose of 20 mg, 1 h later followed by 10 mg infused during the next h) on arterial blood pressure and plasma renin activity were followed in 4 goats during the last months of pregnancy, during lactation and during anestrus. Experiments were made both when the animals were sodium‐repleted and sodium‐deficient. Furosemide and dietary restriction were used to deprive the animals of sodium. In sodium‐replete animals, captopril caused a more pronounced fall in mean arterial blood pressure and a larger increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) when the animals were pregnant than when they were lactating or in anestrus. During sodiumdeficient conditions the response was similar as during sodium repletion in pregnant goats. In anestral goats, PRA rose in response to captopril, but the blood pressure fall was similar as when the goats were sodium‐replete. In lactating sodium‐deficient goats, captopril caused a marked fall in mean arterial blood pressure concomitant with a 2–3 times higher rise in PRA than during corresponding sodium‐repletion experiments. The respiratory rate was elevated in pregnant animals and increased further during captopril. The plasma vasopressin concentration did not change during captopril‐induced hypotension. If the blood pressure fell ≥10 mmHg the animals became very quiet and occasionally they fell asleep. All goats delivered healthy kids. The fact that the blood pressure fall was marked and consistent in all animals during pregnancy, but less and more variable during anestrus indicates that the activity of the renin‐angiotensin system is of greater importance for blood pressure maintenance during pregnancy than during anestrus. The exaggerated effects in lactating sodium‐deficient animals were probably due to a more efficient salt depletion, these animals losing extra salt via the milk. © 1984 Scandinavian Physiological Society

EEG and EP findings were consistent with those from other groups of patients with schizophrenia and showed great similarity within the quadruplets. CT scans revealed uniformly small lateral ventricles. PET scans replicated earlier findings of relatively low glucose use in the frontal lobes but did not show strong familial concordance. © 1984.

AB  - Using only skin surface blood gas measurements, we calculated the ventilatory response to inhaled carbon dioxide from changes in skin surface Pco2 (Psco2). This new method is based on the fact that if CO2 elimination is nearly constant, the change in alveolar ventilation from one steady state level to another is inversely proportional to the change in Psco2. From this we derived a ventilatory ratio (VR) for 0%, 2%, and 4% CO2 breathing. A ventilatory response slope is then calculated from the three VR values, and is similar to a standard CO2 response slope. We serially studied 20 infants (28 to 40 weeks gestation) 2 to 9 weeks of age. Ten infants had serious apnea, ten did not. The infants breathed each test gas for 8 to 10 minutes during quiet sleep with skin surface electrodes attached. Infants with apnea were studied before and after apneic spells resolved. We found that apneic infants had a significantly reduced VR slope compared with that in the nonapneic infants, regardless of age. When apnea disappeared, the ventilatory ratio slope always increased into the range measured in nonapneic infants. In nonapneic infants the ventilatory ratio slope significantly increased with postnatal age. We conclude that infants with serious apnea have a reduced ventilatory response to CO2 and that the resolution of apnea is associated with the development of a normal CO2 response. © 1984 The C. V.

AB  - Research strategies for determining genetic vulnerability markers in affective illness are delineated. Using these strategies, recent developments in the biology of manic-depressive illness are discussed, including results from association and linkage studies, pharmacologic challenge protocols, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data. Several lines of evidence suggest that one genetically determined vulnerability to affective disorder may be a cholinergic supersensitivity, possibly mediated through increased numbers of cholinergic receptors. © 1984.

AB  - During the last few years, special attention has turned to the recording of human fetal dynamic phenomena. These are movements of the whole body as well as breathing, cardiac and ocular movements. All of them can be observed and recorded simultaneously through real-time echography and Doppler systems. The analysis of the recording may be considered separately as well as simultaneously and are one of the grounds for fetal physiology studies. What is known about fetal dynamics and physiopathology is summarized. Fetal biorhythms were discovered and described in that manner. Progressive integration in behavioural patterns was observed suggesting that movements are under a general and central control early in fetal life. Particular attention is given to personal work on fetal eye movement. Based on eye movements patterns, the fetal behaviour patterns might be compared to the three sleep stages (paradoxal-quiet-transitional) as described in the full-term and premature newborns. Some contradictions have been noticed in the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the fetal activities considerred separately. They might only be apparent in the light of these integrated patterns. © 1984.

AB  - Both human and animal studies relating to the combined effects of alcohol and benzodiazepine (BZD) are reviewed. Although the combination of alcohol and BZD is sometimes associated with drug-induced deaths, drug overdoses and traffic accidents or fatalities, epidemiological information is lacking on the true extent of the combined abuse and on the patterns and prevalence of use of these two drugs. Since BZD are widely used for the short- and long-term treatment of alcoholics, these patients are deemed more at risk of developing BZD or alcohol/BZD dependence than the general population. There is a dire need for large-scale controlled studies concerning the efficacy of BZD in the long-term treatment of alcoholics. Compared to men, women are at a higher risk as far as the potential for BZD addiction is concerned, since they tend to use BZD more often. Epidemiologic studies on the patterns of use of BZD, alcohol or alcohol/BZD in pregnant women are called for. Animal models are also needed to ascertain whether prenatal exposure to both alcohol and BZD can impart long-lasting behavioral changes in the progeny. It is possible that BZD can exacerbate the damaging prenatal effects of alcohol. © 1984.

AB  - The cerebral function monitor (CFM) is a monitoring device which records integrated encephalograms (EEGs) on slow‐running paper, allowing continuous observations of cerebral activity for prolonged periods. The CFM was assessed in 49 normal neonates of different gestational ages and was found to reflect EEG activity accurately. Gestatibnal age and sleep‐wake states could be differentiated and normal patterns were defined. The establishment of normal patterns will allow further assessment of the CFM as a screening tool for the neonate at risk for cerebral hypoxic ischemic injury.

El MFC fue evaluado en 49 recih nacidos normales de diferentes edades gestacionales y se halló que reflejaba con precisión la actividad EEG. La edad gestacional y los estados de sueño‐vigilia podian ser diferenciados y se definieron esquemas normales. El establecimiento de esquemas normales permitira la evaluación futura del MFC como una herramienta de screening para el neonato con riesgo a consecuencia de una agresión cerebral hipóxica isquémica.

AB  - A 5-year-old boy with nemaline myopathy was reported. He was admitted to our hospital because of severe respiratory and cardiac failure. He became unable to be weaned from a respirator. He was born after 42 weeks gestation, weighed 3,400 g and was mildly asphyxiated. His parents were unrelated and there was no family history of neuromuscular disorders. Since birth he was hypotonic and developmental milestones were delayed. He walked at 1 year. He got up with Gowers’ maneuver. Five months before admission, he entered a kindergarten where he had to practice marching every day. Five days prior to admission, his face became pale. On the day before admission, marked edema of the eyelids and the legs appeared. Next morning he became lethargic with generalized cyanosis and respiratory difficulty, and was referred to our hospital. Physical examination revealed a moderate and slender boy with higharched palate and mild scoliosis. The lungs were clear but galloping rhythms were audible. Liver and spleen were not palpable and tendon jerks were negative. The chest x-ray film showed cardiomegaly (CTR 63%) and EKG showed RVH. PaCO2 was 83 Torr, ESR was 0.5 mm/hr but serum levels of GOT, GPT, LDH, AL-P and CPK were normal. The movement of diaphragm was markedly diminished at x-ray examination. The rectus femoris muscle was biopsied and a moderate variation in muscle fiber size was observed on HE staining. Modified Gomori-Trichrome staining showed many muscle fibers containing nemaline rods. Type 1 fibers were markedly small in caliber on NADH staining and routine ATPase reaction. Serum carnitine level was normal. He had been hospitalized for 18 months because he required mechanical ventilation during sleep. © 1984, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. All rights reserved.

AB  - The behavior of 120 full term and 160 preterm newborn twins was assessed in several key areas: Irritability, soothability, reactivity, reinforcement value, and activity level. Infants were assessed during various situations so that aggregate, or summary, scores representing each behavioral area could be obtained. Evaluations were made during a feeding period, an active sleep period, an awake alert period during which orienting and interactional behaviors were observed, a quiet period during which reactivity to stress was observed, and any fussy periods during which irritability and soothability were assessed. Significant within-twin-pair concordance of behavior was obtained for each of the areas of behavior, suggesting the influence of constitutional variables on neonatal behavior. Analysis of these data by sex resulted in significant within-pair concordance of behavior for same-sex but not for opposite-sex twins. The actual ratings on these behaviors differentiated between full term and preterm infants. Increased behavior deviance was observed with increasing prematurity in the areas of soothability and activity level. The results are discussed in terms of increased risk factors for preterm twins.

AB  - Advances have recently been made in understanding the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. To correlate the new knowledge of theophylline pharmacokinetics with the drug's current status in therapy, we have critically reviewed the relevant investigations of the last 5 years. We consider data on its presumed mechanisms of action, factors affecting its clearance, its use in pregnancy, treatment of overdoses, and important drug interactions. Theophylline clearance is decreased by concomitant use of erythromycin, cimetidine, high-dose allopurinol, oral contraceptives, and caffeine. Clearance is increased by concomitant use of phenobarbital and phenytoin. Newly discovered actions of theophylline include dose-dependent improvement of diaphragmatic contractility, augmentation of ventilatory response to hypoxia, and sleep distubances (especially with high-dose treatments). Points clinically relevant to the daily use of theophylline derivatives and the importance of sustained-release preparations are discussed. Theophylline continues to play a major role in therapy for reactive airways disease.

AB  - A comparative clinical study was undertaken by the Sichuan Cooperative Research Group for Microencapsulated Contraceptives to assess the efficacy of intramuscular microencapsulated egestrol compound as a long-acting contraceptive and to find the optimal dosage as regards efficacy, side effects and menstrual irregularities. Eight hundred twenty eight women were divided into four groups and injected monthly with four different dosage combinations that consisted of megestrol acetate and estradiol valerate. In all, 5298 dosage cycles were observed. The investigation indicated that microencapsulation effectively prolonged contraceptive effect of the short-acting agents, reduced the required dosage and lowered the incidence of side effects. A combination of 15 mg megestrol acetate and 5 mg estradiol valerate, as compared to the other three regimens, was found to be clinically most acceptable because of the lower incidence of menstrual irregularities. © 1984.

AB  - Previous research indicates that many primate species are more likely to give birth at night than during the day. This study attempted to determine whether temporal patterns of birth are discernible in a number of non-primate mammals. In addition, it sought to relate time of birth to the sleep/wake cycle and to the level of predation on the species. Data were collected and analyzed on birth hours in 26 mammalian species from two Chicago area zoos . Although temporal patterns of parturition were discernible for many species, the hypothesis that most birth would occur during the restive phase was not supported. However, a significant positive correlation between level of predation and the likelihood that birth would occur during the restive phase was found (n = 0.40). These findings are discussed in terms of predator/prey interaction and the protection (or lack of protection) that restive birthing might afford the mother and offspring at this vulnerable time.

AB  - The present prospective study examined, one year after delivery, the possible effects of early extra contact during the first hour following delivery. An extra skin-to-skin contact and suckling contact was allowed 22 primiparous mothers and their infants (P+ group). One control group of 20 primiparous mothers and their infants were given routine care immediately after birth (P group). During observation of a physical examination of the infant, ‘extra contact mothers’ held and touched their infants more frequently and more often talked positively to their infants than did mothers given routine care. ‘Extra contact mothers’ had returned to their professional employment outside the home to a lesser extent than had routine care mothers. A greater proportion of ‘extra contact’ infants slept in a room of their own. In the P+ group, mothers who had returned to gainful employment were also able to have their babies sleep in a room of their own—no such correspondence was found in the P group. The Gesell Developmental Schedules revealed that, in four parts out of five, infants with extra contact immediately after birth, were ahead of those in the control group. On the other hand, the Vineland Social Maturity Scale and the Cesarec Marke Personality Scheme did not reveal any major differences between the two groups. Mothers with early extra skin-to-skin contact and suckling contact breast-fed their infants on an average for 2 1/2 months longer than did routine care mothers. No other differences in feeding habits were found. The influence of extra contact was more pronounced in boy–mother than in girl–mother pairs. © 1984, Associations of Public Health in the Nordic Countries Regions. All rights reserved.

AB  - Suspicion of alcohol's teratogenic potential stretches back many centuries, but it is only recently that solid support for this possibility has been produced. There is now little doubt that alcohol can produce developmental defects, but there are many questions that still remain to be answered concerning the impact of alcohol on the conceptus. One major question that remains to be resolved is why only a small percentage of alcoholic women give birth to children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), whereas other alcoholic women who drink the same amount do not. Another important issue concerns the way in which alcohol produces its effects. Although one of the most likely ways in which alcohol's teratogenic actions are mediated appears to be via hypoxia, other mechanisms such as direct toxicity of alcohol or acetaldehyde may be involved. FAS refers to a pattern of defects in children born to alcoholic women. For a diagnosis of FAS to be made, the patient must have three main characteristics: (1) pre- and postnatal growth retardation (≥ 2 S.D. for length and weight), (2) facial anomalies, and (3) central nervous system dysfunction [1]. Pre- and postnatal growth retardation are the most reliable consequences of fetal alcohol exposure. In many cases, patients with the syndrome weigh less than 2500 g at birth and most do not exhibit postnatal 'catch-up growth' [2]. Among the distinctive facial anomalies seen in conjunction with the syndrome are absent-to-indistinct philtrum, epicanthic folds, thin upper lip and short upturned nose. Joint, limb and cardiac anomalies are also often present. Central nervous system dysfunction includes mental retardation, the most serious consequence of in utero alcohol exposure, hyperactivity, sleep disorders and miscellaneous behavioral difficulties. If only one or two of these broad characteristics are present and the mother is suspected of drinking during pregnancy, then a diagnosis of 'possible fetal alcohol syndrome,' or 'partial fetal alcohol syndrome,' or 'fetal alcohol effects,' or 'alcohol-related birth defects' may be made [1]. However, without evidence of maternal drinking during pregnancy, this diagnosis is very tentative, since many of these effects are also observed in conjunction with many other congenital disorders. On the basis of considerable evidence, it appears that prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a broader spectrum of effects ranging from spontaneous abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome at one end, and barely preceptible fetal alcohol effects at the other. This wide variability may be due to differences in exposure e.g., number of drinks consumed per drinking period, time of exposure during pregnancy, genetic sensitivity, nutritional status and possible interaction with other drugs. This review presents a broad overview of this topic. © 1984.

AB  - Breathing movements in the sheep fetus have been observed from a gestational age of about 40 days. From 95 to 115 days fetal breathing movements are almost continuous, interrupted by apnoea rarely exceeding 2 min. From 115 days until term (about 147 days) breathing and movements of the trunk and limbs are episodic. Breathing normally occurs only during rapid‐eye‐movement sleep as identified by low‐voltage cortical electrical activity. Active movements of the neck muscles occur predominantly in high‐voltage electrocortical activity. Hypercapnia or acid cerebrospinal fluid perfusion cause an increase in the regularity and depth of breathing when present, and recruit intercostal and laryngeal abductor activity. Isocapnic hypoxia, however, in contrast to the hyperventilation seen postnatally, causes arrest of fetal breathing movements. This effect is due to a central inhibition. Section of the brain stem, from the caudal hypothalamus rostrally, causes dissociation of fetal breathing movements and electrocortical activity into independent rhythms. Section of the brain stem caudally, in the upper pons or at the inferior colliculus, also causes a dissociation of electrocortical activity from breathing movements, which become almost continuous. Isocapnic hypoxia causes an increase in the rate and depth of breathing movements. It is concluded that the arrest of breathing in intact fetal lambs is not due to a direct effect on the respiratory centre in the medulla. The lumbar polysynaptic flexor reflex response becomes episodic after 115 days gestation but, in contrast to fetal breathing movements, is enhanced during high‐voltage electrocortical activity. Isocapnic hypoxia arrests movements of the fetal limbs and trunk and inhibits the lumbar flexor reflex. This inhibition of the reflex is prevented by section of the spinal cord at T12, but persists after section of the brain stem in the upper pons. It is attributed to an action on the medulla, independent of the systemic arterial chemoreceptors. Small doses of pentobarbitone (5 mg/kg) cause arrest of fetal breathing movements by a suprapontine mechanism, abolished by brain stem transection, and inhibition of the lumbar flexor reflex by an action on the spinal cord, persisting after transection at T12. Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthetase (indomethacin, meclofenamate or aspirin) induce continuous fetal breathing movements, while prostaglandin E2 arrests fetal breathing. The site of action is on the medulla, as shown by section of the brain stem and of afferents from the systemic arterial chemoreceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) © 1984 The Physiological Society

AB  - Women at work throughout Britain, all members ofthe National Survey of Health and Development, were asked whether they were under nervous strain in their work. Data are presented for 826 women at work at age 26 years and 734 women at work at age 32 years. Two in every five women working full-time reported that they were under strain, this proportion being very similar to that for men in full-time work at the same age. Women in part-time work were much less likely to report strain. Strain at work was found to relate both to the level of work (jobs in higher social- group categories having a higher report of strain) and to the level of supervisory responsibility. Women reporting strain were also more likely to report problems with their sleep, frequent headaches, pain in the pit of the stomach and trouble with their back, but such reports seem more closely related to a prior susceptibility to anxiety than to the demands of the present job. It is concluded that, with the possible exception of pregnant women, it may not be helpful to consider women as a group of workers with particular problems in withstanding stress at work. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Pinazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, differs from other drugs of its class by the presence of an unsaturated bond, the propargyl group, at the N-1 position. Its toxicity is less than that of diazepam. In animals, pinazepam controls anxiety and aggressiveness. This effect seems to be associated with a particularly low hypnotic effect and with a limited impairment of motor coordination. Pinazepam shows less cortical activity at the anxiolytic level than does diazepam on EEG. The drug's mechanism of action primarily involves modification in the region of the limbic system. Extensive pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated rapid gastrointestinal absorption of pinazepam. The metabolic pathway is N-1 dealkylation and C-3 hyroxylation. In dogs, pinazepam reaches the steady state in one day and its main metabolite, depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam) in six days, thus achieving a much higher blood concentration than the parent drug. In rabbits, a first-pass effect is evident. Both compounds are converted to oxazepam, which is pharmacologically inactive and is eliminated in the urine. Pinazepam and depropargylpinazepam cross the placenta and appear in human milk. In dogs, accumulation could not be demonstrated at the end of treatment with 10 mg of pinazepam for 20 days. All the findings in animals were confirmed in humans. In clinical trials with open or controlled design, pinazepam, compared with diazepam, showed a significant and purely anxiolytic action in patients suffering from anxiety with or without somatic manifestations, particularly in gastrointestinal disorders. Even though it is not a specific hypnotic drug, it seems to help patients in whom the physiological course of the sleep is disturbed. The standard dosage is 10 mg daily, divided in two doses. Pinazepam is well tolerated in humans. About 5% of patients experience mild sedation. Other side effects are infrequent and minor. In the studies there was no evidence of impairment of motor coordination or of intellectual performance. There were no reports of a rebound phenomenon or drug dependence. These findings indicate that pinazepam is a pure anxiolytic agent devoid of hypnotic effect or motor disorders, characteristics that make it a useful drug for daytime use.

AB  - Brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) has recently been used to evaluate brain stem function of the infant. During the newborn period, however, a considerably large variability has been found in both the latency of wave V and the I-V interpeak latency (IPL). Therefore, a more precise evaluation may be necessary to establish the methodology of measuring brain stem function of newborns by BAER. A total of 71 BAERs was elicited in 36 normal and 14 high risk neonates during the neonatal period. Normal neonates were uneventfully born between 38-41 weeks of gestational age (mean 39.2 wks), and weighed 2,526—3,720 g (mean 3,091 g). High risk neonates born under anoxic stress during labor, were between 38-41 weeks of gestational age at birth (mean 39.6 wks), and weighed 2,750—4,714 g (mean 3,449 g). Binaural stimulation of 90 dBHL at 5 times a second was used to elicit BAERs from neonates in natural sleep in incubators or cribs. In normal neonates during 24 hours after birth, both the latency of wave V and the I-V interpeak latency (central conduction time) were significantly prolonged (P<0.01). In many high risk neonates during 24 hours after birth, each wave of BAER can hardly be elicited. Both the latency of wave V and the I-V interpeak latency (central conduction time), when detected, were within those of normal neonates. In high risk neonates, the “perinatal loads”, especially fetal distress,could not be determined as a cause of abnormal BAERs. On evaluation of brain stem function of the newborn by BAER, the decrease in the latency or the interpeak latency through normal course should be distinguished from abnormal change. © 1984, The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

AB  - General pharmacological properties of DL-8280 were studied in various animals by using standard tests. 1. Central nervous system; DL-8280 at doses above 300 mg/kg, p.o. suppressed general behavior and spontaneous motor activity in mice. It also produced an EEG slowing in curarized cats at 3mg/kg, i.v. and more, a mild analgesia in mice at doses of 100 ∼ 1,000 mg/kg, p.o. as well as a prolongation of hexobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice and an antiinflammatory effect in rats at a dose of 1,000 mg/kg, p.o., DL-8280, however, had no effect on electro- and chemo-convulsions in mice, conditioned avoidance response in rats, body temperature in rabbits and spinal reflex in anesthetized cats. 2. Respiratory and cardiovascular system; The antibacterial drug showed no effect on systolic blood pressure and heart rate in conscious rats even at a dose as high as 1,000 mg/kg, p.o., However, in anesthetized dogs, it increased respiratory rate and decreased respiratory depth, blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular pressure and femoral arterial resistance without affecting cardiac contractility at doses of 10 mg/kg, i.v. and more. 3. Autonomic nervous system; DL-8280 was without effect on pupillary size in rabbits but at 10∼30 mg/kg, i.v. inhibited both norepinephrine-induced pressor and acetylcholine-induced depressor responses in anesthetized dogs. It exerted no ganglion-blocking effect in anesthetized cats. 4. Smooth muscles; DL-8280 had little effect on the contractile response of the isolated guinea-pig ileum to various spasmogens, while it slightly enhanced norepinephrine-induced contraction of the guinea-pig vas deferens and spontaneous motility of the isolated nonpregnant rat uterus only at a concentration of 10-3 g/ml. The drug failed to affect the spontaneous motility of the isolated pregnant rat uterus at concentrations up to 10∼4 g/ml, gastrointestinal propulsion in mice and gastric mucosa in rats at 1,000 mg/kg, p.o., However, it inhibited gastrointestinal motility in anesthetized dogs at 3 mg/kg, i.v. and more. Gastric emptying rate and gastric secretion in rats were inhibited at doses of 300 mg/kg, p.o. and 300 mg/kg, i.p., respectively. 5. Miscellaneous; DL-8280 at a dose of 30mg/kg, i.v. slightly enhanced twitch response of the anterior tibial muscle in anesthetized rabbits. It decreased urine volume and excretion of urinary electrolytes in rats at doses above 300 mg/kg, p.o., No local anesthetic effect was observed in the guinea-pig cornea after topical application of DL-8280 (1.0%). Since these pharmacological effects of DL-8280 were observed at dose much greater than those in clinical use (approximately 4 mg/kg, p.o.), it is likely that this drug may be relatively free of undesirable effects in clinical practice. © 1984, Japanese Society of Chemotherapy.

AB  - Synopsis: Alprazolam1 is a triazolobenzodiazepine which is related to diazepam and other 1,4-benzodiazepines, and has a similar pharmacological profile. Relative to the newer benzodiazepines, alprazolam has an intermediate half-life of 10 to 12 hours in healthy young subjects. In placebo-controlled and double-blind comparative trials in patients with anxiety, alprazolam was of comparable efficacy to diazepam and generally caused a lower incidence of drowsiness. Alprazolam has antidepressant activity and has been shown to be similar in efficacy to imipramine in the treatment of unipolar depression. Thus, alprazolam may be particularly useful in patients with mixed anxiety/depression. However, its general acceptance as an antidepressant awaits further studies. Pharmacodynamic Studies: The pharmacological profile of alprazolam is similar to that of other benzodiazepines in that it has antianxiety, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant activity. However, there is some evidence in animals and in sleep studies that alprazolam also possesses moderate antidepressant activity and this has been confirmed in therapeutic trials in humans (see below). On a weight basis, alprazolam is a more potent anticonvulsant (strychnine and electroshock tests) and antiaggression agent than diazepam or clonazepam and a more potent muscle relaxant (inclined screen test) than diazepam. Pharmacokinetic Studies: Following single-dose oral administration of alprazolam 0.5 to 3mg, plasma concentrations of 7 to 40 ng/ml are attained in 1 to 2 hours. Volume of distribution and elimination half-life, which in healthy subjects are about 73L and 10 to 12 hours, respectively, are greater in obese patients, but to a lesser extent than with diazepam. Alprazolam is extensively metabolised, with an active metabolite (α-hydroxyalprazolam) accounting for about 17% of the ingested dose. However, plasma concentrations of this metabolite are too low to be of clinical significance. 20% of a dose is excreted unchanged and 80% recovered in the urine within 72 hours of administration. Therapeutic Trials: Open and controlled trials in patients with anxiety disorders reveal that alprazolam is an effective anxiolytic at doses of 0.25 to 3.0mg daily. In comparative, non-placebo controlled trials, alprazolam was at least as effective as diazepam, chlordiazepoxide or lorazepam, and in some of the placebo-controlled trials, more effective than diazepam. Although the overall incidence of side effects with alprazolam has been similar to that with the other benzodiazepines, some studies reported a lower frequency of drowsiness with alprazolam. Alprazolam has also been compared with imipramine in the management of depressed patients. Promising results from preliminary studies have been confirmed in a large multicentre trial which compared alprazolam, imipramine and placebo in patients with unipolar depression. Alprazolam was similar in efficacy to imipramine in relieving symptoms of depression and more effective than imipramine in relieving somatic symptoms. Alprazolam showed an earlier onset of effect in some assessment criteria. In these studies alprazolam dosage was 2 to 4mg daily, but optimum dosages in depressive illness have yet to be clearly defined. Placebo-controlled trials indicate that alprazolam causes few anticholinergic side effects. Alprazolam may be of use in the treatment of agoraphobia and panic attacks, but definition of its place in managing these disorders and in the treatment of depressive illness awaits further study in well designed trials. Side Effects: Clinical studies have shown that alprazolam has a side effect profile similar to that of other benzodiazepines, although drowsiness and lightheadedness occur less frequently than with diazepam. Experience with overdosage is limited but serious adverse events have not been reported to date. Side effects may be accentuated in the elderly or debilitated patient. As other benzodiazepines are known to reach the placenta and be excreted in breast milk, alprazolam should also be avoided in pregnancy, and in nursing mothers until full human distribution data are available. Dosage: Dosage should be individualised, starting at 0.25mg to 0.5mg thrice daily. In the elderly the starting dose is 0.25mg twice daily. The dose is titrated upwards according to the needs of the patient to the recommended maximum of 4 mg/day in divided doses. Initial doses may be given at bedtime to minimise daytime lethargy. Abrupt withdrawal after longer term administration should be avoided. © 1984, ADIS Press Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measurements were made of intakes of drinking water and food dry matter of 27 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows over a two-year period. Average daily intake (kg/cow) of drinking water and dry matter were 75.4 and 16.9 respectively for animals producing 13.7 kg milk/day in an environment with a mean air temperature and a relative humidity of 26.2°C and 75.7% respectively. Intake of water per kg dry matter consumed after subtracting water in milk was 5.8 kg. Milk yield was positively related to measures of water intake. Concentrate dry matter intakes above 3 and 5 kg depressed forage and total dry matter intakes respectively. It was concluded that under similar conditions supplying of 3 kg/cow/day of concentrate dry matter would maximise forage intake though not necessarily milk production; also the daily drinking water requirements can be estimated from the equation Y (kg drinking water)=59.2+1.18 X (X=kg milk yield) R2=0.098. © 1982 Longman Group Limited.

AB  - RU 486 is a synthetic 19 norsteroid with a great affinity for progesterone and glucocorticosteroid receptors. The antiprogesterone activity of RU 486 permits interruption of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and of early pregnancy, while the antiglucocorticosteroid activity interrupts the feedback mechanisms of cortisol at the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. 11 women aged 18-34 years who were 6-8 weeks pregnant were given daily doses of 200 mg of sensation of lipothymia. Blood pressure and laboratory test results remained normal. The daily increase of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and progesterone was stopped by the antiprogesterone. It has been demonstrated in vitro that RU 486 inhibits secretion of beta HCG by cells of trophoblastic origin. 2 weeks after expulsion of the products of conception, the blood levels of beta HCG, progesterone, and estradiol had returned to nonpregnant values and ovarian activity was normal in women not using oral contraceptives. The reason for failure of expulsion in 2 cases was not known. RU 486 was also used to interrupt the luteal phase of normal menstrual cycles in 3 young women. 50 mg/day of RU 486 starting on the 22nd day was sufficient to induce bleeding within 48 hours. Studies using RU 486 50 mg/day beginning on the 10th cycle day indicate that progesterone plays a central and follicular role during the preovulatory period. The antiglucocorticosteroid activity of RU 486 was observed in pregnant women who received the abortifacient dose of 200 mg/day. The 8 a.m. plasma level of ACTH and beta-LPH cortisol remained elevated for thee 4 days of treatment. Nonpregnant women receiving 50 mg of RU 486 for 4 days beginning on the 22nd cycle day had no change in the level of hypophyseal-adrenal hormones.dd Tests in young male volunteers showed that RU 486 amplified circadian rhythms of the hypophysealadrenal axis, affecting specifically the morning hormonal levels without influencing afternoon levels. A test in which RU 486 was used to antagonize the inhibition producedd by dexamethasone during a test of suppression of the hypophyseal-adrenal axis confirmed that the antiglucocorticosteroid effect of RU 486 is produced at the level of the glucocorticosteroid receptors. The antiglucocorticosteroid effect is independent of the antiprogesterone effect. RU 486 may be utilizable in fertility control, to control undesirable effects of steroids in cases of hypercorticism, and perhaps eventually to test the hypophyseal-adrenal axis.

AB  - To assess the influence of gestational age (GA) and sleep on respiratory pauses (RP), apnea index (AI) and periodic breathing (PB), we made polygraphic recordings on 40 normal newborns with GA of 31-41 weeks. Only 2 out of a total of 2,406 RP were obstructive. We never recorded > 15-second duration central RP. 10-15 s RP were rare, 2% of the total number observed in newborns with a GA of 31-38 weeks. Selective flattening of thoracic respiratory movements (while abdominal and nasal respirations persisted) were observed in all age-groups. In all GA groups, RP frequency, AI and percent of PB were significantly higher in active sleep, compared to quiet sleep. In indeterminate sleep, values were intermediate. RP frequency and AI were high in newborns with GA of up to 38 weeks; they decreased significantly only at GA of 39-41 weeks; i.e. according to RP criteria, newborns with a GA of 37-38 weeks were similar to prematures, but not to 39- to 41-week GA newborns. There were no significant differences between twins and singletons. We did not find significant correlations between RP incidence on one hand and respiratory rate or out-of-phase occurrence of thoracic and abdominal respiratory movements in the other. 17% of RP occurred after gross body movements.

AB  - According to recent investigations more than half of all growth disorders are due to growth hormone (GH) deficiency. I. The cause of the classic hypothalamo-pituitary dwarfism is; 1. perinatally acquired lesions of the hypothalamus; 2. suprasellar tumours; 3. brain malformations; 4. hereditary disturbances of GH-synthesis. -II. Constitutional delay of growth and adolescent development is clinically characterised by harmonious delay of growth, skeletal development and sexual maturation. The typical aspect of the pituitary dwarf is missing. Whereas provocation tests for GH do not show reliable deviations, assessment of the spontaneous GH secretion during sleep usually demonstrates a significant GH-deficit. III. Impairments of GH synthesis with production of a hormone which reacts in the RIA but exhibits reduced biological effectivity causes the same clinical picture as constitutional delay. The disorders I-III can successfully be treated by GH-IV. Familial short stature is based on the summation of hereditary anlages of the parents. In principle, it is no endocrine disorder. However, the combination with disorders II and III occurs frequently ('Small/Delay' acc. to Tanner). -V. Intrauterine growth retardation is caused by maternal, placental or fetal factors. With most of the 'small for dates' growth prognosis is good. However, if teratogenic agents, particularly alcohol is involved, and if the damage occurs in the first months of gestation, the prognosis is unfavorable. -VI. A great number of genetic disorders is connected with pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation, combined with typical malformations. Apart from few exceptions these syndroms are rare. Endocrine deviations are missing. -The therapeutic possibilities of GH and anabolics are thoroughly discussed.

AB  - From a teleologic perspective, the function of the mother in the postpartum period is to provide her newborn infant with sufficient nutrients for growth and development. Neuroendocrine mechanisms during the puerperium appear to be coordinated to aid in the achievement of that goal. The postpartum period is characterized by stimulation of lactation and suppression of ovulation. During pregnancy a number of hormonal changes prepare the breasts for lactation following delivery. The process of lactation is functionally related to the suppression of ovulation. These two physiologic changes observed in the puerperium are considered in detail in this review.

AB  - A survey involving 261 cases of tubal sterilization has been carried out in Geneva maternity wards. The answers obtained have been recorded on cards and processed by computer. Two double-entry tables permit one to correlate the problems observed with certain elements of the patients' previous history. This method designed to be objective does not always confirm the findings yielded by previous surveys.
239 women, who constituted 61% of the 389 undergoing sterilization operations in a Geneva maternity hospital in 1977, were interviewed by telephone 18 months-2 years later to assess the occurrence of psychosexual side effects. 20% reported gaining more than 3 kg; 10% experienced psychological trouble manifested in irritability, depression, or sleep disorders; 15% reported a persistent desire for a child or pregnancy; 1/3 reported an improved sexual adjustment; 10% reported a deterioration; and 7% reported experiencing pain during intercourse. 20% were under 30 years old at the time of the operation but they did not experience a higher rate of side effects than the older women. Women without any children, women from lower socioeconomic levels, and immigrant women expressed higher degrees of regret. Women exposed to religious opposition to sterilization, all of whom were practicing Catholics, were more likely to experience psychosexual side effects. Negative repercussions were also more common when the decision was made on medical grounds rather than as a personal choice by the woman, and when the procedure immediately followed abortion or childbirth. 16% felt that they had received insufficient medical information prior to the procedure. The experience of regret at not having another child and desire for another pregnancy were less when women who had themselves undergone the operation were involved in counseling.

AB  - Amiodarone is an effective agent for treating troublesome supraventricular and some serious ventricular arrhythmias. It is particularly effective for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, supraventricular arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and in the suppression of ventricular arrhythmias complicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Its place in the treatment of arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction is still uncertain but it was effective in several American series of patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. With the increased use of amiodarone side effects are being reported increasingly often, particularly in the United States and Britain, and both the place of the drug and measures to prevent these unwanted effects need reassessment. Evidence is growing of the value of assays of plasma concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone. At present there is a rough 'therapeutic range' of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/l, which corresponds in most patients with efficacy in the absence of any substantial side effects. Plasma drug concentrations may also help identify patients with decreased bioavailability who have low plasma concentrations and may require an increased dose. The ratio of amiodarone to the desethyl metabolite may help to identify those patients who are not complying with treatment. Plasma concentrations are, however, most useful in determining the minimum effective maintenance dose when coupled with the information from clinical evaluation or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring or both. The drug may be being given for a serious or life threatening arrhythmia but that should not blind the physician to the fact that higher doses that are warranted carry an increased morbidity.

AB  - The exposure in humans to ethanol or barbiturates during prenatal or neonatal development is common. There are indications that the magnitude of the resulting symptoms may be genetically determined. In the present article, an animal model was established for the study of the genetic determination of the neurosensitivity to ethanol and barbiturates administered during prenatal and/or neonatal development. Inbred C57BL/1- (C57) and DBA/1 (DBA) mice were employed in the ethanol studies and these strains and the outbred HS/Ibg (HS) were used in the barbiturate studies. Early ethanol administration induced a long lasting increase in the susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in both strains but to a greater degree in C57. Neuropharmacological studies implicated the serotonergic but not the noradrenergic system as mediating the early ethanol induced changes in audiogenic seizures. Open field activity was decreased but only in C57. Male agonistic behaviour and predatory behaviour were greatly reduced by early ethanol administration but mainly in DBA. Long term induction of the activity of the hepatic enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase and microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, occured in both strains after early exposure to ethanol. After early exposure to phenobarbital HS mice had long lasting increases in the susceptibility to audiogenic seizures and in the hippocampus related behaviours, spontaneous alternation, and eight arm maze performance. The hepatic microsomal drug oxidizing systems was induced in adult HS mice with early phenobarbital (PhB) exposure. Early PhB exposure also caused long term decreased sensitivity to ethanol narcosis and an accelerated aquisition of barbiturate tolerance, possibly mediated via a change in the sensitivity of the post synaptic dopamine receptors. Changes in the PhB treated offspring also included a reduction in the levels of thyroid hormone. Early exposure to PhB resulted in a long term deficit in the area of brain layers, number of neurons, dendritic spines and the ultrastructure. Strain comparison suggested that DBA was less neurosensitive to early PhB administration than both HS and C57. It was concluded that genotype-environment interaction exists in the effect of drugs on the developing CNS.

AB  - Maternal glucose variability was studied in 154 pregnant diabetic patients hospitalized during the last month of their pregnancies. By means of several statistical analyses of the coefficient of variation for within-day plasma glucose variability, we found as follows. (1) There was a significant association between maternal glucose variability and neonatal outcome. (2) Patients with greater glucose variability had more episodes of hyperglycemia, but not hypoglycemia. (3) There was no correlation between maternal glucose variability and the birth weight of the infant. We are proposing the use of an index for glucose variability to monitor glucose control in pregnancy and predict neonatal outcome. Although absence of glucose variability will not ensure prevention of neonatal complications, there is a clear association between greater glucose variability and neonatal complications. © 1983.

AB  - A complex investigation of the brain functions of patients with the idiopathic persisting lactorrhea-amenorrhea syndrome (PLAS) revealed a series of nonspecific changes. Insufficiency of the activating systems was shown according to the EEG data. Anxious depression was also seen. The examination of the vegetative nervous system during relaxation and exercises is indicative of insufficient activity of its symptomatic region. Thereafter, specific neurosecretory deficit in the tuberous infundibular system and disorder of the brain activity, probably resultant of dopamine deficiency are seen in patients with PLAS.

AB  - In order to investigate cytoplasmic free cortisol (F) concentrations, F levels in human red blood cells (RBC-F) were determined. Mean basal levels of plasma unbound free F and RBC-F in 10 normal healthy subjects were 16.6 and 14.8 ng/ml, respectively. RBC-F in the normal subjects showed well-defined diurnal rhythm, suppressibility by dexamethasone, and responsiveness to ACTH stimulation similar to plasma free F. There was an excellent linear relationship between RBC-F and corresponding plasma free F concentrations; RBC-F (ng/ml) = 1.25 × plasma free F (ng/ml) -3.4, r = 0.94, n = 90. Mean basal RBC-F concentration in nine pregnant women was 13.9 ng/ml. In three patients with Cushing's syndrome and six patients with adrenal insufficiency, RBC-F showed parallel changes to plasma free F, which were apparently different from those in normal subjects, patients with simple obesity, and a patient with Cushing's disease in complete remission. These results indicated that RBC-F ran nearly parallel to plasma free F under various conditions. © 1983.

AB  - Entry of delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) into the circulation from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was studied in unweaned rat pups. The pups were fed an analog of DSIP (N-Tyr-DSIP) or 125I-N-Tyr-DSIP and blood samples collected. Significant increases in plasma DSIP-like immunoreactivity occurred after the feeding of 100 ωg/animal of N-Tyr-DSIP but not after vehicle (normal saline) or 1 ωg/animal. Column chromatography showed this immunoreactivity to coelute with intact DSIP and des-Trp1- DSIP. A small but statistically significant increase of immunoreactivity occurred in the plasma of pups whose nursing mothers were injected with N-Tyr-DSIP but not in those whose mothers were injected with saline. Radioactivity appeared in both the brain and blood of 1-2 and 10 day old rat pups fed 125I-N-Tyr-DSIP. Although only a small amount of the radioactivity in plasma co-eluted with intact 1251I-N-Tyr-DSIP on column chromatography, almost all of the radioactivity in brain did, suggesting that the radioactivity in the brain represented crossing of the blood-brain-barrier by the peptide and not just contamination by blood. The results cannot be explained by either regurgitation of intestinal contents, or by stimulation of endogenous peptide. They show that a DSIP peptide administered orally can be absorbed through the GI tract into the systemic circulation. © 1983.

AB  - We investigated whether serum growth hormone (GH) concentration changes in association with the rise in serum prolactin (PRL) concentration known to occur during the early morning hours in the pregnant rat. Animals were kept in a room with the lights on from 0500 to 1900 hours (hr) daily and decapitated for the collection of trunk blood at 2200 or 2400 hr on Day 6 of pregnancy or at 0200, 0400, 0800 or 1000 hr on Day 6 of pregnancy. Serum GH concentration rose more than 4-fold from low levels at 2200 and 2400 hr to higher levels at 0400 and 0800 hr and then declined by 1000 hr. Serum prolactin (PRL) concentration followed a similar pattern except that it returned to low levels earlier, by 0800 hr. Serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations showed no significant changes. Serum GH levels at 0800 hr in pregnant rats were higher than those observed in cyclic rats (13 time periods sampled). The results demonstrate that serum GH concentration is elevated during a circumscribed period in the 6- to 7-day pregnant rat. The time of onset of the rise is similar to that for serum PRL but the elevation in GH levels persists longer than that for PRL. © 1983.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to investigate changes in β-endorphin content in the hypothalamus during different stages of the estrous cycle. Groups of 9 to 10 Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed every two hours on proestrus from 8.00 to 18.00 h and groups of 7 to 8 rats were sacrificed on diestrus at 8.00, 12.00, 14.00 and 18.00 h. Preoptic suprachiasmatic region, posterior hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus and median eminence were dissected and assayed for β-endorphin. A significant increase in β-endorphin content was detected in the arcuate nucleus during proestrus (9.00 h: 1.76 ± .31; 14.00 h: 4.10 ± .85 μg/g tissue wet weight). Levels did not change during diestrus (1.18 ± .06 μg/g). The increase caused significant differences in β-endorphin values between both days at 12.00, 14.00 and 18.00 h, while the concentrations at 8.00 h were similar. The opposite pattern was observed in the median eminence with significantly higher proestrous β-endorphin levels at 8.00 h (11.24 ± 3.1 vs 3.52 ± .64 μg/g) and nonsignificant differences for the rest of the day. No significant change in β-endorphin concentration was seen in the preoptic suprachiasmatic region over the day of proestrus (1.35 ± .09 μg/g). Diestrous β-endorphin concentrations in this region were higher during the morning (2.60 ± .65 μg/g) and lower at 18.00 h (0.94 ± .12 μg/g) when compared to proestrous values. This pattern was caused by a 50% increase in β-endorphin during the afternoon of diestrus. No changes were observed in the posterior hypothalamus on either day with comparable levels of β-endorphin except at 18.00 h, when values were significantly higher on proestrus (1.66 ± .30 vs 0.83 ± .06 μg/g). © 1983.

AB  - During a 24 h period lactating rats were decapitated at 2 h intervals and the trunk blood and pituitaries were collected. Suckling activity was registered at the time of sacrifice. Plasma prolactin (PRL), LH and hypophyseal (HYP) PRL levels were measured by RIA. The trough of the plasma PRL curve was at 09.30 h and was followed by about 4.5-fold elevation by 13.30 (the lights were on from 03.30 to 17.30). The plasma PRL levels showed 2.5-fold decrease by 19.30 h. The HYP PRL concentration exhibited 3.5-fold elevation from 01.30 to 05.30 h. After this peak concentration, the HYP PRL showed a 4-fold decrease at 11.30 h. A statistically non-significant rhythm was found in the plasma LH levels. Our data suggest that there are circadian rhythms in the plasma and HYP PRL levels of lactating rats in the early lactation period. The two rhythms are in an 8 h phase shift. Neither these rhythms nor the LH levels depended on the actual suckling activity of freely behaving lactating rats.

AB  - The effects of cooling have been studied in chronically instrumented unanaesthetized fetal lambs of 106‐132 days gestation. Cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors by means of a coil placed around the fetus in the amniotic cavity induced continuous breathing which was associated with high‐voltage electrocortical activity throughout the cooling period. Direct internal cooling by means of an intragastric cooling coil did not alter fetal breathing or sleep‐state patterns. Shivering occurred in response to both external and internal cooling, and this response was present as early as 106 days gestation, well before the appearance of high‐voltage sleep. In older fetuses there was evidence of a reduction in thermoregulatory responses during low‐voltage electrocortical activity, but not of the complete suspension of thermoregulation characteristic of low‐voltage (r.e.m.) sleep seen in mature animals. It is concluded that deep regular breathing associated with high‐voltage electrocortical activity can be induced by cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors, but not by a reduction in core temperature alone. Furthermore, fetal responses to cooling are present as early as 106 days gestation. © 1983 The Physiological Society

AB  - Non-obese women in the second half of pregnancy were randomised into a control group receiving standard dietary advice and a group advised to make high fibre whole-food substitutions in their diets at every opportunity. Glucose and insulin profiles were performed over 24-h periods at 29 and 35 weeks gestation when the diets were equivalent in available carbohydrate, protein and fat, but the control group ingested 12.4 g dietary fibre/24 h and the high fibre group 51.4g/24h. Glucose homeostasis was similar in both groups but there was a significant attenuation of post-prandial insulin secretion in the high fibre group. It is suggested that the characteristic post-prandial peaks of plasma insulin observed in Western pregnant women are an unphysiological response to dietary fibre depletion. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The effectiveness of levamisole in the immunomodulatory treatment of chronic hepatitis was assessed in a multicentric double blind trial. Twenty patients received in the first week 50 mg, in the second 100 mg and thereafter 150 mg, levamisole on two days every week for 6 months, 20 others received a placebo. Five patients dropped out (non-compliance 1, pregnancy 1, adverse effects 3). The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical, biochemical immunological and histological data. After 6 months 26 subjects allowed us to take a control liver biopsy. The results showed that the rate of improved, unchanged and impaired cases was not significantly different in the levamisole and placebo groups. No correlation was found between etiology, activity or histological type of chronic hepatitis, skin test reactivity (DNCB, PPD, Streptokinase) and therapeutic effect, respectively. Clinical improvement was not associated with the elimination of HB(s) antigen. In general levamisole was well tolerated, but we saw one case of severe agranulocytosis.

AB  - The concentration of adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in the hypothalamus was measured in the morning (10.00 h) and in the afternoon (16.00 h) during the 4-day estrous cycle of the female rat. The values were found to rise from the lowest levels on the afternoon of diestrus 1 to the highest levels on the morning of proestrus to decline thereafter. A second less marked peak was seen on the morning of diestrus 1. In rats treated with diethyldithiocarbamate to block norepinephrine (NE) synthesis, the concentration of the nucleotide decreased and remained at steady levels indicating that cyclic variations of cAMP in the hypothalamus are related to the endogenous release of NE. Blocking α-adrenergic receptors with phenoxybenzamine or β-adrenergic receptors with propranolol also resulted in a drop of the concentration of cAMP in the hypothalamus. The effect of phenoxybenzamine was almost constant during the different days of the cycle whereas that of propranolol varied showing maximal effects on diestrus 2 and proestrus and minimal on estrus and diestrus 1. These results suggests that the response of endogenously released NE in the hypothalamus mediated through β-adrenergic receptors undergo variations during the estrous cycle, whereas those mediated through α-adrenergic receptors remain at constant levels. © 1983.

AB  - Uterine electromyographic activity in the pregnant rhesus monkey showed two types of episodic electrical events, defined on the basis of duration of the episodes. One of these (designated type I in this report) was characterized by frequent bursts of electrical activity that lasted from 0.5 to 1.2 minutes (mean duration, 0.64 ± 0.007 [SE] minutes) and occurred at frequencies of 10 to 45 per hour. The other type of electromyographic activity observed (type II) consisted of fragmented series of discharges that lasted 2 to 15 minutes (mean duration, 5.45 ± 0.12 [SE] minutes) and occurred at frequencies of 0 to 6 per hour. The frequency of type I electromyographic events showed a circadian pattern of low amplitude with a maximum at night in animals with minimal uterine manipulation (electrodes only). This daily pattern was amplified during the 8 to 10 days that preceded delivery. Hysterotomy and fetal catheterization induced a circadian increase in the frequency of type I electromyographic events akin to that observed during the predelivery period. Fetal death abolished the high-amplitude circadian variation of type I electromyographic events both postoperatively and in the predelivery period. These data indicate that the fetus plays a role in the regulation of uterine type I electromyographic activity in the rhesus monkey. © 1983.

AB  - No 5-methoxytryptophol (ML) could be detected in sheep plasma using a specific, sensitive radioimmunoassay developed for the purpose. Blood samples were collected from sheep during darkness and daylight and during various stages of the estrous cycle, but in no sample was the ML content above the detection limit of the method. Addition of lmM pargyline and neostigmine to blood immediately after collection to block metabolism did not result in a detectable ML concentration. The failure to detect ML was not due to degredation since added ML was not degraded by blood enzymes even after 16 hours incubation at 37°C. Injection of 100ug and lmg ML sc in sheep resulted in a rapid rise of ML to 95-130pg/ml and 560-1000pg/ml respectively and disappearing with a half life of approximately 15-20 minutes. Sheep pineal glands collected during the light phase contained ML (51 ± 5pg/mg tissue. X ± SE, n=7) which represents less than 6% of the melatonin content. It is concluded that if ML is present in sheep blood it is present at very low levels. It is thus unlikely to be a major circulating pineal hormone in this species, however, its role within the CNS as a local hormone cannot be excluded. © 1983.

AB  - Additional tryptophan during pregnancy reduces embryo and neonate survival in the golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus. Relatively small doses of exogenous serotonin have been reported to cause abortions in several vertebrate species (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Smaller doses reduce litter sizes, increase still births and neonate abnormalities, and otherwise influence pregnancy adversely. These effects are produced by serotonin throughout pregnancy, beginning at implantation (6). The availability of tryptophan is probably the most important rate limiting factor in serotonin synthesis (7). Inasmuch as tryptophan is an essential amino acid and is not synthesized by the body, the diet is the sole source; studies have shown that increases (8) or decreases (9) in dietary tryptophan lead to concomitant changes in serotonin content. Because tryptophan is employed in humans to promote sleep (10, 11, 12) and to decrease appetite (13) we felt it might be important to test whether increased amounts of diet tryptophan can adversely influence pregnancy. © 1983.

AB  - 1. HPL patients characteristically show depressed basal levels of STH. 2. Patients with HPL and radiologically confirmed pituitary adenoma show an altered response of the somatotropic structures to glucose challenge and marked circadian variations in the STH circadian pattern. 3. In patients without a radiological sign of pituitary adenoma STH levels are depressed but the circadian rhythm resembles the normal pattern; the STH fails to show a response to a glucose load and in GTT the STH concentration plot is flattened. 4. The severity of somatotropic functional alteration in HPL is not as important as the nature of the pathologic substrate which underlies the disease. 5. Studies on the circadian STH pattern and its fluctuations in GTT may provide objective criteria in the diagnosis of pituitary microadenoma. © 1983 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - The effect of shaking the fetus through the maternal abdomen during episodes of low (nonreactive) fetal heart rate variation was studied in 10 healthy nulliparous women near term. Heart rate monitoring from an abdominal electrocardiogram was combined with real-time scanning for body movements and fetal breathing. In each fetus two episodes of low variation were examined, one during which external stimulation was performed and one as a control without stimulation. There were no differences between the groups, with or without stimulation, in the duration of the nonreactive trace or heart rate variation or in the incidence of breathing or body movements. Therefore, shaking the fetus during a nonreactive heart rate episode has no useful purpose. The results are comprehensible in the light of fetal and neonatal behavioral states. © 1983.

AB  - The effect of pregnancy on the circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol and urinary free corticoids was examined in a sequential study during the second and third trimester and 6 to 12 weeks post partum. Hourly blood samples from six subjects and 8-hour urine collections from eight subjects were obtained around the clock. While the circadian rhythm was maintained during gestation, plasma cortisol levels (24-hour mean, nadir, peak, and nadir-peak excursion) increased. The relative excursion of plasma cortisol (expressed as the percentage of deviation from the 24-hour mean) exhibited remarkable blunting compared with postpartum values. This pregnancy-associated blunting of plasma cortisol excursion was indicated by a significant reduction in the: (1) mean peak and nadir excursion, (2) integrated area between the percent deviation curve and the 24-hour mean, and (3) mean slope of the major incremental and decremental segments of the percent deviation curve. The circadian rhythm and diurnal excursion of plasma cortisol were reflected in urinary free corticoid values. Mean 24-hour urinary free corticoid concentrations increased 180% during gestation over nonpregnant levels. Nadir concentrations of urinary free corticoids in pregnancy exceeded peak nonpregnant levels. The gestational rise of metabolically active free cortisol and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and the pregnancy-associated blunting of the excursion of plasma cortisol may be explained by an autonomous source of ACTH during gestation. © 1983.

AB  - Five monkeys with amniotic pressure catheters were placed in restraining chairs on days 127 to 131 of gestation (term = 167 days) for examination of circadian patterns in uterine activity. Uterine activity (total area under the contraction curve) was recorded continuously for 3- to 9-day intervals while the animals were exposed to a 16-hour:8-hour light:dark photoperiod. A ratio of hourly contraction area to mean hourly contraction area was established for each individual, and a circadian pattern was observed, with the occurrence of peak uterine activity between 2200 and 0200 hours (analysis of variance, P < 0.01). An unrestrained animal equipped with a telemetry device and monitored for 23 days demonstrated a similar pattern. Four other catheterized, chair-restrained, pregnant monkeys were used to examine the effects of dexamethasone on uterine activity rhythms. After a 48-hour control period, dexamethasone (0.1 mg/hr) was infused via a maternal venous catheter for 48 hours. Fetal and maternal estrone and estradiol levels and total uterine activity were significantly reduced during dexamethasone infusion (P < 0.05). In the 48 hours after dexamethasone infusion, mean uterine activity returned to preinfusion levels but the nocturnal peak remained ablated. Therefore, dexamethasone, alters the magnitude, as well as the circadian pattern, of uterine activity in association with reduced estrogen biosynthesis by the fetoplacental unit. Since the effect on uterine activity is biphasic, dexamethasone probably acts by more than one mechanism. © 1983.

AB  - By using a specific homologous double-antibody RIA, physiological and pharmacological variation in prolactin plasma levels were studied in the rabbit. The study of plasma levels during 24 h period demonstrated the presence of a rhythmic secretion of prolactin with higher values between 15.00 and 19.00 h. Prolactin plasma levels were low in neonatal rabbits and increased gradually with the age of the animals. In adult rabbits a significant higher prolactin plasma concentration was found in female animals. Blood levels fluctuate during the first half of pregnancy but the mean levels were higher than those found during the second half of gestation. A remarkable increase of plasma levels was observed 24 h before parturition and during lactation. Plasma prolactin concentrations increased after injection of both chlorpromazine and sulpiride. The hyperprolactinaemic effect of sulpiride was abolished by bromocriptine. © 1983.

AB  - Deoxyglucose labeled with carbon-14 was used in studying the utilization of glucose in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of fetal rats. The results showed that an entrainable circadian clock is present in the suprachiasmatic nuclei during fetal development and that the maternal circadian system coordinates the phase of the fetal clock to environmental lighting conditions.

AB  - Two clinically healthy pregnant women were studied in a single 24-h span during the third trimester. Blood drawn every 20 min was assayed for cortisol (F), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), estriol (E3), and prolactin (PRL). Blood drawn hourly was assayed for progesterone (P), human placental lactogen (HPL) and 15alpha-hydroxyestriol (E4). Breast temperature (BT) was continuously monitored. Single cosinor analysis demonstrated statistically significant circadian rhythms for plasma concentrations of F, DHEA-S, and BT for both subjects, and of E3 for one subject. Statistically significant circadian rhythms in plasma concentrations of P, HPL, E4 or PRL could not be demonstrated in our third trimester subjects. However, analysis of data from subjects sampled at earlier gestational ages revealed highly significant PRL circadian rhythms. These results suggest that plasma concentrations of PRL show a progressive decrease in circadian amplitude despite a progressive increase in mesor with advancing gestational age. Frequent sampling and cosinor data analysis permit identification of circadian rhythms in BT. The use of BT as a potential marker for rhythms in plasma concentration of certain hormones awaits further scrutiny. The demonstration of several circadian endocrine rhythms in individual subjects in the third trimester of human pregnancy facilitates the usefulness of such marker rhythms.

AB  - In previous reports (J. Physiol. 325, 493, 507, 521, 1982) we have suggested a prenatal onset of the circadian oscillation in rats. This was based mainly on the findings obtained in pups which were reared by an alternating nursing. In the present study we have applied this technique to experiments which were designed to determine the stage of gestation in the original mother that decided the phase angle of pup's hormone rhythm which was to develop later in the postnatal life. In this experiment we observed, though preliminarily, that reversal of the light-dark cycle of the pregnant mother at day 10 of pregnancy resulted in an effective reversal of pup's hormone rhythm, whereas the reversal at day 17 of pregnancy failed to affect it. From these results it is surmised that the original mother primarily determined the phase angle of the circadian oscillation in the fetus prior to the 17th day of gestation. © 1983.

AB  - Summary. Serial serum levels of α‐fetoprotein (AFP) were examined over a 24‐h period in six subjects. A short‐term variation was demonstrated which was significantly greater than that due to the assay alone, but which showed no particular pattern. These findings may explain why an‘abnormal’AFP level frequently reverts to a‘normal’level on second sampling. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The evolution of sleep patterns during the diurnal period was studied in C57BL and BALBc mice from 3 to 14 weeks of age. Quantitative analysis of the hypnograms reveals that the main sleep changes occur between weeks 3 and 4 in the two strains. This period is characterized by a decrease of the percentage of paradoxical sleep in BALBc strain, due to a simultaneous drop in the mean number and duration of the episodes. During this time C57BL strain exhibits an increase in the percentage of slow wave sleep, resulting from a rise in the mean number of episodes. At the same time the percentage of awake state decreases in C57BL mice. In the adults these changes result in differences between the strains in sleep pattern that are characterized by a higher percentage of paradoxical and slow wave sleep in C57BL than in BALBc mice. As regards the results obtained, the maturation of sleep mechanisms and particularly of the paradoxical sleep seems to be different in C57BL and in BALBc mice. © 1983.

AB  - Cows from three different herds were used to investigate the relationship between plasma D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate, serum free fatty acid and blood glucose concentrations and the amount of fat present in the liver in the week after calving. The study was particularly concerned with the diagnostic value of D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate estimations. These estimations did not make a significant contribution to diagnosis of fatty liver nor did they reflect accurately the nutritional status of the cows.

AB  - Female rats exposed to low intensities (0.1-1.5 lx) of continuous light (LL), displayed regular estrous cycles and free-running circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. In most rats, as the intensity of LL was increased to >2.0 lx, components within the active portion (α) of the locomotor rhythm remained synchronized as the periodicity of the rhythm lengthened. However, in a few rats α split into two components; one of which free-ran with a period shorter than 24 h, while the other free-ran with a period longer than 24 h. As soon as the two components became maximally separated they spontaneously rejoined. In most rats, estrous cycles ceased shortly after the intensity of LL was increased to >2.0 lx even though the locomotor activity rhythm retained its unsplit free-running nature. These observations suggest that the multiple oscillators that control the rhythms of locomotor activity and the estrous cycle are normally coupled to one another. In certain intensities of LL, these oscillators uncouple and free-run with different periodicities, a condition which causes estrous cycles to cease and sometimes produces a split locomotor activity rhythm.

AB  - Melatonin is believed to be synthesized in the pineal gland from serotonin by a two-step pathway. AT-Acetyltransferase (NAT) catalyzes the acetylation of serotonin (5HT) by acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) to form N-acetylserotonin (NAS); hydroxyindole-Omethyltransferase (HIOMT) catalyzes the methylation of NAS by S-adenyosyl methionine (SAM) to make melatonin (MEL, MT). The activities of the enzymes are easily measured with radiochemical assays (1-3). Serotonin is found in pinealocytes (70%) and in the sympathetic nerve terminals (30%) in the pineal gland. It is thought that pinealocytes take up tryptophan from the blood but that the presence of serotonin in the nerve terminals represents uptake by the terminals (4). Tryptophan-5-hydroxylase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase convert the tryptophan to serotonin (4). There are several aspects of pineal metabolism which make it unique. First, the pineal gland appears to be the principal source of rhythmically produced melatonin and the pineal gland was the tissue in which the indole hormone, melatonin, was discovered (5). © 1983 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - We have examined whether there are changes in the day-night variation in plasma cortisol in normal women during the third trimester of pregnancy. Maximum cortisol values at 07.30-10.30 h were similar at 30-31, 34-35 and 38-39 weeks of pregnancy. The daily increment in plasma cortisol (fold change) was greater, and the trough values lower at 30-31 than at 38-39 weeks. The time taken for plasma cortisol to fall to 50% of the morning maximum values was longer at 38-39 weeks than at 30-31 weeks of pregnancy. These changes in cortisol rhythms may have implications with respect to alterations in circadian patterns of maternal steroid concentrations as well as fetal biophysical functions.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Actograph measurements of the spontaneous flight activity of isolated female Glossina morsitans morsitans Westw. were made through their first two pregnancy cycles in constant conditions under LD 12:12. Activity fell from a mean of c. 20 units/day to near zero during the 24 h preceding the day on which larvipositionoccurred. Activity on the day of larviposition rose significantly, to c. 35 units/day, then fell back to the baseline 20 units on subsequent days. The circadian pattern of activity was changed markedly by larviposition: 48 h before it, activity in the morning peak of the usual V‐shaped diel pattern was twice normal; over 70% of the flies then fed, and the evening arm of their V disappeared; 24 h before larviposition, most flies were totally inactive, the few that did fly performing only 1 or 2 units/day, and only in the first and last hours of the photophase; on the day of larviposition, the morning peak of the V was reduced by c. 70%, and activity peaked instead during the post‐noon 2–3 h, before and during the act of parturition. Almost all larvipositions occurred between noon and lights‐out. It is suggested that the c. 48 h of pre‐larviposition quiescence may play a role in the fact that pregnant G. morsitans females often survive non‐residual aerosol insecticide campaigns.

AB  - To determine the relation of diurnal changes in plasma progesterone to those in cortisol and estriol we measured the concentrations of progesterone, cortisol and estriol in samples of plasma taken at 30- to 60-min intervals throughout 24 h from women at 30–31, 34–35, and 38–39 weeks of gestation. Plasma progesterone showed a significant diurnal rhythm at 30–31 and at 34–35 weeks of pregnancy, with troughs at 04.30–10.00 h. Major peaks occurred between 15.30 and 02.30 h. There was no diurnal rhythm in progesterone at 38–39 weeks. Plasma progesterone showed a significant negative correlation with plasma cortisol at 30–31 and 34–35 but not at 38–39 weeks. Plasma progesterone showed a significant positive correlation with estriol at 34–35 and at 38–39 weeks. We suggest that daily fluctuations in plasma progesterone may be related to the concentration of plasma cortisol, either directly by competition for binding sites on transcortin, or indirectly after modulation of fetal pituitary-adrenal function by maternally derived glucocorticoid. © 1983 S.

AB  - Physiological factors that affect the fate of drugs in the body and thereby have effects on their pharmacology and toxicology involve the systems that control absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. The main factors are disease, genetics, and age. Nutritional status, sex, hormonal status (e.g., the effects of pregnancy), and circadian rhythm have important influences. Maternal toxicity will affect the fetus. The absorption and excretion of drugs are frequently reduced by diseases. Excretion is reduced by impaired renal function, often found in the elderly, which may increase the toxic response. Distribution is affected by body weight and build, for example, the proportion of fat. The disposition of many drugs has been shown to be significantly influenced by circadian rhythms such that therapeutic doses may exhibit toxicity if administered at an inappropriate time of day. Metabolism is modified by environmental influences including previous food and drug experience, and various factors such as age, sex, and disease. Intersubject variations in drug disposition can be very great with possibly severe consequences for the individual; in this regard, knowledge of genetic polymorphism in drug metabolizing enzymes is rapidly increasing. The toxicology of a drug may be profoundly affected by a particular disease state, for example, the administration of a drug that might be a tumor promoter when a cancerous or precancerous condition exists. These effects are illustrated with examples from the literature and recent studies undertaken in the Bureau of Drug Research. © 1983.

AB  - Among 8739 deliveries premature rupture of the membranes was noticed in 1.792 cases. The premature rupture of the membranes occurred mostly during the night. During the 8 hours of the night from 2200-0600 hours the membranes ruptured more frequently than during the 16 hours of the day. One would expect that the forewaters break more readily during the daytime because of the upright position, the orthostatic pressure and some shock phenomena. The observed lower incidence of premature rupture of the membranes during the day is explained by protective mechanism which occur like a valve in the upright position.

AB  - It is possible to estimate the daily rate of oestriol production by the fetoplacental unit by radio-immunoassay of the concentrations of unconjugated and total oestriol in the serum. The usefulness of these two parameters was compared by comparing variations from day to day in the same individuals and between them and other individuals, as well as over 24 hours. We think the best choice of test for biochemical monitoring of at-risk pregnancies is the estimation of unconjugated oestriol because there is a lower day to day variation in the same individual as well as throughout the 24 hours.

AB  - The effect of maternal oral food intake and the daytime rhythm of fetal activity was investigated in six healthy women at 8:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. by means of dynamic ultrasound. No significant change was found in the number of fetal movements (FM) from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., although the maternal plasma glucose levels showed a significant increase from 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. and a significant decrease from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. (p<0.05), analysis of variance). In another group of 12 healthy pregnant women at 32 weeks gestation, no increase in FM was seen after the maternal oral intake of water or water plus triglycerides. It is concluded that fetal activity is influenced more by the fetal well-being and maturity than by the maternal metabolic state.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor is a polypeptide that stimulates proliferation and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including the developing intestinal epithelium; it is the agent in human milk that induces mitosis in human fibroblast culture. We systematically evaluated the EGF content of milk from 20 women delivering prematurely and from 11 women delivering at term. In preterm mothers, the concentration of EGF was 70±5 ng/ml (mean±SEM), with no significant change during seven weeks of lactation. EGF concentration in milk of term mothers was 68±19 ng/ml (mean±SEM). No diurnal variation in the concentration was found. Total EGF content was closely correlated with the volume of milk expressed, suggesting a passive transport from the circulation. These observations confirm that a substantial amount of EGF is present in human milk and that EGF concentrations are not affected by duration of gestation, time of day, or duration of lactation. © 1983 The C.

AB  - The extent of variation in the serum myoglobin (Mb) levels of normal healthy females was investigated so that the value of Mb measurements for carrier detection could be properly assessed. Factors considered were sex, age, menstrual status, pregnancy, diurnal variation and daily activity. In each instance, Mb levels were compared with those for serum creatine kinase (CK). A significant difference (P < 0.001) was found between the Mb levels of men and women but no relationship could be found between several measurements of body build and the Mb or CK levels of either sex. An apparent correlation of Mb concentrations with age was found in control groups of both sexes up to 85 years of age, but this was not significant below 60 years of age. No differences in Mb levels were found among premenarchal, menstruating, postmenopausal or hysterectomised women and neither smoking nor the use of oral contraceptives seemed to affect Mb levels. Serum CK levels were very much higher in premenarchal (P < 0.001) and postmenarchal (P < 0.05) teenagers than in adult controls. No difference was found between the mean Mb levels of non-pregnant and pregnant (6-40 weeks) women. The mean value for CK activity was significantly lower than normal in the pregnant women (P < 0.001). A marked circadian rhythm of serum MB levels was found with samples taken at 5 p.m. being approximately 20% lower than those taken at 9 a.m. This unexpected decrease during the day persisted with 48 hours of bedrest suggesting that this rhythm is inherent and unrelated to muscular activity. © 1983.

AB  - The adaptive regulation of sugar and amino acid transport by vertebrate intestine constitutes a neglected area. We review the patterns, signals, and mechanisms involved in adaptation. Mechanisms include changes in mucosal mass, specific transport systems, and the sodium gradient. Signals include the transported solutes themselves, hormones, and pancreaticobiliary secretions. The pattern of adaptation is examined for effects of dietary solutes, starvation, hyperphagia, dietary bulk, diabetes, intestinal position, intestinal resection, time of day, season of the year, hibernation, gestation, lactation, and aging and for differences among species. These observed patterns are compared with the patterns predicted by a simple teleologically deduced hypothesis: increased metabolic requirements should be met by increased absorption achieved through increased mucosal mass, while nutritionally essential solutes and nonessential solutes used as calorie sources should, respectively, repress and induce their own transport. We conclude with a summary of major unsolved questions in this area.

AB  - Abstract. The incidence of birth has been determined for each hour of the day for all births in Norway in 1968–1977 of fetuses of 16 weeks of gestation or older, with resident mothers. The 24‐hour incidence variations of births (A) with spontaneous onset and parturition, (B) with spontaneous onset, but delivery intervention, (C) with induced onset, but spontaneous birth, and (D) with induced onset and delivery intervention, are all different. It is shown that the curve for the hourly incidence of birth category A coincides very well with previous results of other workers. When multiple births are excluded and category A is split into first and later births in Northern and Southern Norway, dissimilarities arise between the respective 24‐hour incidence curves. The results indicate that the 24‐hour birth incidence variation has an underlying endogenous, circadian rhythmicity ‐possibly synchronized by the sun. The 24‐hour rhythmicities of birth categories B, C and D seem to be purely exogenous ‐ reflecting the working activity rhythms of hospital obstetricians and midwives. 1983 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - Measures were taken on 187 pregnancies of 104 pig‐tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) to document the normative course of parturition and to identify factors correlated with high risk for poor pregnancy outcomes. Analyses involved weekly physical examinations and diurnal sleep‐wake‐fulness patterns during trimester three; behavior during labor and delivery; and newborn sex, Apgar ratings, birthweight, and reflexes. Onset of labor was estimated at three–four hours before delivery, the time when circadian activity level first deviated from its predelivery pattern. Active labor averaged 92 minutes, and was characterized by increased uterine contractions and manipulation of the vaginal area. The modal delivery time was 2200 hr through 2400 hr. Most infants emerged from the vulva in a cranial‐anterior‐anterior presentation, with only a brief pause between head expulsion and complete emergence. Females with histories of poor pregnancy outcomes were more likely to deliver after midnight and showed less labor‐unique behavior than females with good outcome histories. Infants of high‐risk females that were delivered after midnight had lower Apgar scores and more bruising than infants of low‐risk females delevered before of after midnight, suggesting that high‐risk females may have more difficult deliveries. Overall, the results show that simple direct observations of parturition can yield important quantitative normative information that is correlated with reproductive risk factors.

AB  - Diurnal patterns of blood pressure and pressor hormones after 26 weeks gestation were compared in 10 normotensive women, 13 subjects with uncomplicated hypertension, and 8 with biochemical evidence of pre-eclampsia. 4 of the pre-eclamptics showed nocturnal hypertension. Levels of plasma renin activity fell progressively from 9 a.m. to midnight in all three groups, and were significantly lower in pre-eclampsia. Plasma angiotensin II levels fell during the day in normotensives and uncomplicated hypertensives, whereas pre-eclamptics showed loss of this pattern and significantly lower levels than the other groups. Free plasma norepinephrine levels fell during the day and to a similar extent in all three groups. A diurnal pattern for free plasma norepinephrine levels, with lower levels at midnight than during the day, was seen in normotensives and uncomplicated hypertensives but not in pre-eclamptics. Plasma norepinephrine sulphate levels rose from 9.00 a.m. to midnight in normotensives and uncomplicated hypertensives. This pattern was reversed in pre-eclamptics, including 3 of the 4 subjects with nocturnal hypertension. Plasma epinephrine sulphate levels rose progressively through the day, with no significant differences between groups. Failure of plasma angiotensin II or epinephrine levels to fall at night in pre-eclampsia may contribute to nocturnal hypertension in subjects with increased vascular reactivity. Suppression of plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels suggests that perhaps as yet unidentified pressor mechanisms are involved in pre-eclampsia. The "GLIM" System. 3.

AB  - Two experiments were carried out to analyse FSH secretion in the ewe. The first was a long-term study during which four ewes under controlled photoperiods were checked for plasma concentrations of FSH twice daily for a period of 16 months. They were successively anestrous, cycling, gestating and lactating. The results suggested that an endogenous secretion rhythm of FSH persisted throughout each of the physiological states of the ewes. The periodic cycles of FSH production lasted about 5 days during anestrus and gestation but extended to about 6 days during estrus. One of the three waves of secretion we noted during one cycle was represented by the two periovulatory surges, the first coincident with the LH peak, the second occuring 30-40 h later. Plasma levels of FSH were similar during estrous cycles and anestrus, whereas the FSH secretion decreased gradually throughoug gestation. During lactation, large differences were observed among animals before the recovery of cyclic ovarian activity. The second experiment consisted of frequent blood sampling (every ten minutes) of eight ewes for 6 hours during anestrus. FSH was secreted differently compared to LH. No pulsatile production of FSH was demonstrated and no increase in FSH levels was seen at the time of the episodic LH surge. © 1983.

AB  - To examine the relationship between the sleep rhythm and the gonadal feedback system in the guinea pig, the effects of estrous cycle, gonadal steroids and brain deafferentations on the sleep rhythm were studied and the following results were obtained; 1) the guinea pigs did not show an apparent circadian rhythmicity in the sleep-wakefulness cycle but showed an ultradian rhythm, whereas, the activity rhythm was circadian, 2) the rhythm in paradoxical sleep(PS) showed changes associated with the estrous cycle which were characterized by a decrease and rebound-like increase in PS amounts on the day of proestrus, 3) the horizontal deafferentation above the medial preoptic area at the level of the anterior commissure (MPO roof cut) did not disrupt the estrous cycle dependent changes in the PS rhythm, but the prechiasmatic deafferentation of the medial basal hypothalamus (PCD) and the large complete deafferentation of the medial basal hypothalamus (CDL) disrupted them, 4) ovariectomy (OVX) did not result in any changes in sleep and activity rhythms, 5) an administration of estradiol benzoate (E2) to OVX guinea pig caused a decrease in the amount of PS and an administration of progesterone (P) 48h after E2 caused a more pronounced decrease and rebound-like increase in the amount of PS, 6) the MPO roof cut did not affect the steroidal modification of the PS rhythm and the PCD disrupted it, while the CDL-animal also showed a E2-induced PS decrease. From these results, it appears that the guinea pig may be a circadian animal, but this may not be seen in the sleep-wakefulness cycle, and the estrous cycle dependent changes in the PS rhythm may be the reflection of steroidal modification of the sleep rhythm and the site of action may be the inside of the medial preoptic anterior hypothalamic structures, but this area may also be affected by the output from the medial basal hypothalamus. © 1983, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - We have studied the activity of the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal (HPG) axis in the male ovine fetus and newborn lamb. Circulating levels of gonadotropins, prolactin, cortisol (F), testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and Δ4androstenedione (Δ4A) were measured in fetal plasma in the third trimester of gestation and the testicular response to hCG was studied in ovine fetuses at 95-141 days. Ultradian variations of LH, FSH and testosterone and the testicular response to hCG also were assessed from 1 to 28 days postnatally. The data indicate that (1) fetal plasma LH, FSH, Δ4A and T levels are low from 95 days of gestation to term, while F levels increase in the last 10 days. Postnatally, F decreases rapidly. Spontaneous T peaks may occur as early as 36 hr of life. (2) Spontaneous LH and concomitant or subsequent T secretory peaks are observed by 3 days of age. (3) hCG can induce an increase in T production by interstitial cells in vitro and can increase the T testicular content and its release in the plasma from 95 days of intrauterine life. Desensitization to hCG also can be observed throughout the last trimester of gestation. We conclude that the HPG axis of the male lamb is active by 36-72 hr of postnatal life and that the steroidogenic capacity of the ovine testis is developed several weeks prenatally. Consequently, the relative quiescence of the axis prenatally and in the first 24 hr of life seems to result from relatively low LH secretion and release, related to an undefined endogenous control, together with decreased Leydig cell sensitivity and relatively low enzyme activity limiting T release. © 1983.

AB  - ABSTRACT. In constant light or constant darkness, Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood were found to exhibit no obvious rhythms of parturition, but in LD 12:12 most larvae were deposited during the photophase. When a divided photoperiod chamber was used to expose the female's head to LD 12:12 and the abdomen (containing the larvae in utero) to constant light, parturition coincided with the photophase of the female's head. But, if the abdomen was exposed to LD 12:12 and the female's head received constant light or was painted with black enamel, parturition coincided with the photophase of the larva. When the female's head and abdomen both received LD 12:12 but 11 h out of phase with each other, parturition was equally frequent in each 12h fraction. The results thus suggest that both the mother and larva are capable of entraining the rhythm, and that in a normal pregnancy both participate in establishing the rhythm.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Reported contents of fluoride (F) in human milk vary considerably. The aim of this study was to determine the F content in human milk under different levels of F intake using a silicon‐facilitated microdiffusion technique, which had a good accuracy and precision. The mean F concentration of colostrum from mothers in a 1.0 ppm and a 0.2 ppm F area was 0.36±0.02 μmol/I (± SEM) and 0.28±0.02 μmol/I, respectively. The mean F concentration of mature milk from a 1.0 ppm F area was 0.37±0.04 μmol/I. Within the 1.0 ppm F area, the intra‐ and interindividual differences in F concentration were very small. No statistically significant difference in milk F concentration between the two areas was found. Consequently, breastfed infants living in a 1 ppm or a 0.2 ppm F area will have an approximately equal F intake of 5‐10 μg per day, in spite of great differences in F intake among the nursing mothers.

AB  - Although the presence of fetal breathing movements (FBMs) has been suspected for almost a century, the major advances in the field were made during the last decade. Experimental animal techniques of detection include instrumentation of fetuses with electronic recording equipment. Human studies use more indirect, although no less accurate, A-mode or real-time B-scan ultrasonography in the recording of FBMs. The fetus does not make breathing movements continuously; however, there are periods of FBMs interspersed with periods of apnea. Inherent to FBMs is a diurnal variation. Hypoxia and hypoglycemia diminish FBMs, while hypercarbia and hyperglycemia have the opposite effect. Caffeine, barbiturates, and general anesthetics modify FBMs by their influence on the CNS. Preliminary studies have shown the presence of FBMs to indicate a state of fetal wellbeing. Possibly, in the future, testing for FBMs may become a useful clinical tool in the identification of the fetus at risk. © 1983, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - It has been hypothesized that it is rat placental lactogen (rPL) which causes PRL surges to terminate at midpregnancy. Using a hormonally induced model of delayed implantation, the temporal relationship between the secretion of rPL and the nocturnal PRL surges was followed. Implantation was prevented by removing the ovaries, the source of estrogen, on day 3 of pregnancy. Blastocysts were maintained free-floating in the uterine lumen by sc injection of 4 mg progesterone in oil daily for 0, 5, 7, or 9 days. Implantation was induced and the subsequent pregnancy was maintained with 1 μg estrone plus 4 mg progesterone daily. Nocturnal PRL surges (0500 h) were followed for 10 days after the first estrone injection. Control animals last exhibited PRL surges on day 10. Animals with 5, 7, or 9 days of implantation delay had their last PRL surge on days 15, 17, and 18, respectively. Levels of rPL in control animals, as measured by Nb2 lymphoma cell bioassay, were low on day 6, slightly higher on day 10, and significantly elevated on day 12. Delaying implantation delayed the increase in rPL secretion in the experimental groups. This proportionately prolonged the number of days the PRL surges were present. These data suggest that the termination of the nocturnal PRL surges requires the secretion of rPL by the developing conceptus. © 1983 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - During early pregnancy in the rat, the secretion of prolactin exhibits daily surges which appear to be related temporally to changes in the activity of tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons. The present study was undertaken to determine: (1) the temporal relationships between the cessation of the prolactin surges at midpregnancy and the termination of the semicircadian pattern of TIDA neuronal activity, and (2) if the uterine-placental unit is required for the cessation of these patterns. TIDA neuronal activity was estimated from the rate of dopamine synthesis in the median eminence, which was measured in vivo by determining the rate of DOPA accumulation after the administration of an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Nocturnal surges of prolactin occurred on days 6-11 of pregnancy but not on days 12 and 13, while diurnal surges occurred on days 6-9. TIDA neurons exhibited a biphasic pattern of activity on days 8-10 of pregnancy with activity being significantly lower at 04.30 h than at 12.00 h. On days 11-13 of pregnancy, this pattern was lost and activity was constantly maintained at the higher values. Nocturnal surges of prolactin that normally cease after day 11 of pregnancy were still observed on days 12 and 13 if the pregnant rats were hysterectomized on day 6. Furthermore, the biphasic pattern of TIDA neuronal activity persisted until day 13 if pregnant rats were hysterectomized on day 6. The administration of bromocriptine, a dopaminergic agonist which in nonpregnant female rats reduces TIDA neuronal activity by virtue of its ability to reduce circulating concentrations of prolactin, reduced TIDA neuronal activity in 6-day pregnant animals, but was ineffective in 13-day pregnant rats. Bromocriptine was, however, able to reduce the activity of TIDA neurons on day 13 if the pregnant rats had been hysterectomized on day 6. These results suggest that at midpregnancy a uterine-placental factor takes over from prolactin in stimulating TIDA neurons; this factor appears to be responsible for terminating the semicircadian pattern of prolactin secretion. © 1983 S.

AB  - Continuous illumination (LL) beginning at 22 days of age caused precocious puberty followed by persistent estrus with anovulation in female offspring originating from mother rats exposed to a 14L:10D light-dark cycle prior to and during pregnancy. However, LL had no deleterious effect on reproductive cycles of offspring reared in LL and originating from mothers exposed to LL prior to and during pregnancy. These rats had a normal onset of puberty in LL, a normal 4-day estrous cycle, a periodic rise of plasma estrogen prior to the periodic appearance of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, and spontaneous ovulation in LL continued until at least 300 days of age. Also, the female offspring of these rats showed a similar resistance to the deleterious effects of LL on cyclic ovulation. These results support the following interpretation: 1) offspring from mother rats exposed to LL prior to and during pregnancy become insensitive to the deleterious effects of LL on cyclic ovulation, 2) neural elements controlling cyclic release of LH are not totally photoperiod (14L:10D)-dependent, and 3) in the absence of daily 14L:10D signals, an endogenous clock, possibly timed by daily laboratory signals (temperature, noise, taking of vaginal smears), may provide time cues for cyclic LH release.

AB  - Shedding of outer segment discs and their phagocytosis by retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) in the guinea pig starts to occur during in utero development. The number of phagosomes in the fetal RPE varies in a cyclical manner somewhat analogous to that observed in mature animals. The present study addresses the question of whether the cycles in fetus and mother are independent or linked. Pregnant guinea pigs were subjected to 10 days of alteration of their lighting schedules beginning on the 46th day of gestation. Dams and fetuses were sacrificed on day 56, and large phagosomes in the RPE of each were counted. A 10-hour phase advance was employed, ie, from 0800 (lights on):2000 (light off) in controls, to 2200 (on): 1000 (off) in experimental animals. Counts of large phagosomes in the posterior retina were compared in both control and experimental nulliparous, gravid, and fetal animals. A significant burst of shedding occurred within one hour after light onset in the experimental groups comprised of either nulliparous or pregnant animals. The latter also showed a smaller rise in phagosome numbers at the original time of onset of illumination. In contrast, no shift in the time of maximum shedding activity was observed in fetuses in the experimental regime. Their activity was similar to that present in the original 0800:2000 cycle. Whereas maternal RPE shedding cycles can be reentrained in a 10-day period, those in the 46- to 56-day fetal retina are refractory to significant change. Based on this finding, it is likely that the shedding cycles in the mother and fetus at this age are under independent control, and, therefore, that shedding in the fetus is not mediated by maternal borne factors.

AB  - The influence of maternal folate status and human milk folate content on infant folate status was studied in 11 lactating women taking folate supplements throughout pregnancy and lactation. Nursing mothers not taking folate supplements, as well as nonpregnant, non-lactating women, were also studied. Maternal and infant serum and red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations, as well as the "free" and total folate contents of human milk samples, were determined at 6 and 12 weeks post partum. Mothers taking folate supplements maintained blood folate concentrations higher than those of unsupplemented mothers and similar to or higher than those of normal adults. Infants of both supplemented and unsupple-mented mothers maintained similar blood folate levels. Positive correlations were found between maternal RBC folate concentrations and infant RBC folate concentrations at 6 weeks (r = 0.62) and 3 months (r = 0.74), but no relationship was found between maternal folate status and human milk folate activity. Human milk folate levels increased with the progression of lactation, were higher in the evening than earlier in the day, and were higher at the end of a feeding than at the beginning. These results indicate that human milk folate levels are maintained at the expense of maternal reserves and that folate supplementation during lactation may be of value for preservation of maternal reserves. © 1983 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - Pseudopregnancy (psp) can be induced by a single injection of progesterone in cyclic rats and the administration of antiprogesterone serum can block the establishment of psp in cervically stimulated rats. To further investigate neuroendocrine mechanisms for the initiation of either psp or prolactin (PRL) surges in connection with the neurotropic action of progesterone, cytosolic progestin receptors (PRc) were identified and measured in preoptic (POA) and basal hypothalmic (BH) areas. Chronological determinations of PRc concentrations in both areas revealed large fluctuations in the morning of the estrous day but not in the morning of the diestrous day. The differences between the maximal and the minimal PRc concentrations observed were more than 100-fold in POA and 3-fold in BH. Cervical stimulation applied in the afternoon of the proestrous day significantly altered the changing pattern of PRc concentrations in POA but not in BH. One of the two peaks of PRc concentrations in POA was magnified and advanced earlier to 0300 h, and then the 1st PRL surge peaking at 0700 h occurred. This PRL release seemed to stimulate progesterone secretion and an elevation of peripheral progesterone levels coincided with the 2nd peak of PRc concentrations in POA at 0900 h. This coincidence may be a prerequisite for the further continuation of PRL surges. These results strongly suggest that the spontaneous oscillation of the PRc concentration in hypothalamic neurons is involved in the regulation of PRL secretion and that cervical stimulation shifts the phase and changes the amplitude. © 1983, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - The role of the limbic forebrain structures in controlling twice daily surges of prolactin (PRL) induced by cervical stimulation was investigated after acute or chronic deafferentation of the limbic forebrain afferents to the hypothalamus in rats. The preoptic area-roof section (POA-RS), which interrupted the rostral limbic afferents at the dorsal level of the anterior commissure, induced pseudopregnancy (PSP) and initiated the same nocturnal PRL surges as those initiated by the cervical stimulation. Diurnal PRL surges, however, did not occur following this procedure. The nocturnal PRL surge by POA-RS also occurred in ovariectomized rats. Deafferentation between the diagonal band of Broca and the medial preoptic area (F2-cut) initiated PSP in 37 % of the rats and induced an apparent but small nocturnal PRL surge. The rats with POA-RS or F2-cut showed restoration of their regular estrous cyclicities. Cervical stimulation after POA-RS did not affect the initiation of nocturnal PRL surge induced by POA-RS alone. POA-RS after cervical stimulation also did not affect the initiation of nocturnal PRL surge induced by cervical stimulation, though a diurnal PRL surge was initiated in these rats. The cut made just before the diagonal band of Broca after cervical stimulation did not inhibit the occurrence of either surge. Nocturnal and diurnal PRL surges were manifested after cervical stimulation in the rats with chronic POA-RS or F2-cut and their vaginal cyclicities were resumed. These results suggest that the limbic forebrain structures are not indispensable for the initiation of nocturnal PRL surges induced by cervical stimulation but may modify the hypothalamic mechanism(s) initiating a nocturnal PRL surge through the rostral part of the hypothalamus. © 1983, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - Early milk samples from 102 American mothers were examined for Ca, P, and Mg contents in relation to stage of lactation, intake of prenatal mineral supplements, maternal age, parity, and previous history of lactation. A total of 415 samples were collected at three stages of lactation: Early transitional (4-7 days postpar¬tum); transitional (10-14 days postpartum); and mature (30-45 days postpartum). No diurnal variations in ele¬ment concentrations were observed in representative samples of late evening (PM) and early morning (AM) feedings collected during the transitional and mature stages. The mean concentrations for the major elements were highest in early transitional milk and in some cases decreased significantly (p < 0.05) as lactation progressed. Ca, P, and Mg contents (means ± SEM) were 26.3 ± 0.6, 14.6 ± 0.4, 5.3 ± 0.1 mg/100 g in early transitional milk and 26.2 ± 0.5, 13.3 ± 0.3, and 5.0 ± 0.1 in mature milk, respectively. Increasing uniformity in the elemental con-tent of milk was noted among the mothers as lactation became established. No significant relationship was found between intake of dietary supplements containing Ca and Mg and levels of these elements in milk. Also, no significant correlations were found between maternal age, parity, or previous history of lactation and the elemental content of milk. From these data, it was estimated that fully breast-fed infants would receive approximately 33, 18, and 6.5 mg/kg/day of Ca, P, and Mg, respectively, during the neonatal period. © 1983 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

AB  - In the rat, the corpus luteum is formed on the morning of estrus in response to the surge of luteinizing hormone released on the previous day, proestrus. However, unlike other mammals whose corpora lutea secrete increasing amounts of progesterone for several days (1), the newly formed corpora lutea of the rat secrete progesterone for only 2 days after formation (2, 3). In the absence of all other input, the corpora lutea subsequently fail and progesterone secretion wanes (3). It has long been appreciated that rodent corpora lutea could be maintained by either coital stimulation (4) or injection of pituitary extracts containing prolactin (PRL) activity (5, 6). An overwhelming literature now indicates that the mating stimulus induces the release of PRL which in turn “rescues” the corpora lutea of the cycle and prolongs the ability of these structures to secrete progesterone (3, 7–11). The mating stimulus or copulomimetic stimuli applied to the uterine cervix with a glass rod or appropriately constructed electrode (12) induce a unique pattern of prolactin secretion: PRL is released from the pituitary gland into the blood in the form of two large daily increases or “surges” at distinct hours of the day (13–15). © 1983 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Relaxin and progesterone are produced by the corpora lutea in the pregnant rat. Relaxin immunoactivity levels are elevated in peripheral sera during the last 12 days of pregnancy. In rats maintained under a conventional photoperiod of 14 h of light (0600–2000 h) and 10 h of darkness (2000–0600 h), there is an antepartum elevation in serum relaxin to maximal levels coincident with the rapid decline in serum progesterone to basal levels during the light phase of the photoperiod 1 day before birth. Therefore, we postulated that this maximal elevation in serum relaxin levels may be temporally associated with functional luteolysis and linked to the photoperiod. In the present study the photoperiod was advanced near midpregnancy in order to examine further the relationship of the antepartum elevation in serum relaxin levels with both functional luteolysis and the photoperiod. Three groups of rats were maintained under a conventional photoperiod of 14 h of light (0500-1900 h) and 10 h of darkness until days 7 and 8 of pregnancy when the photoperiod was advanced 8 h in group 2 (G2) and advanced 18 h in G3 relative to the conventional photoperiod that was maintained in Gl. Serum relaxin and progesterone levels were determined in blood samples obtained at 4-h intervals from 2000 h on day 19 of pregnancy until birth. The times of occurrence of birth, maximal relaxin levels, and decline of progesterone to basal levels in G2 and G3 were generally advanced 50–60% of the advancement of the photoperiod. There was a close temporal association between the attainment of maximal relaxin levels and basal progesterone levels; they both occurred during the light phase of the photoperiod, approximately 24 h before birth in all three groups. We conclude that the antepartum elevation of serum relaxin to maximal levels may be associated with functional luteolysis and that its time of occurrence is influenced by the photoperiod. This study also provides evidence that the antepartum elevation of relaxin levels consists of two phases which occur at a 24-h interval. It is proposed that these two phases in the elevation of relaxin levels may be indicative of an increasingly effective endogenous circadian luteolytic process whose time of occurrence is influenced by the light-dark schedule. © 1983 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The secretory profile of prolactin and oxytocin in response to suckling stimuli by litters was studied in unanesthetized and urethane-anesthetized lactating rats. Serum prolactin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Oxytocin released at milk-ejection reflex was monitored by the changes in the intramammary pressure and/or the characteristic pup's reaction associated with the milk ejection. Serum prolactin concentrations began to rise earlier than the first milk ejection in unanesthetized rats, but they were never elevated without the appearance of milk ejections in urethane-anesthetized rats. Pulsatile fluctuation in serum prolactin levels at 6-15 min intervals was observed in the nursing period when 10 pups were suckling continually. The intermittent milk-ejection reflex occurred not always but preponderantly (64-91%) when the serum prolactin levels were at the nadir of the fluctuation. Injection of an estimated dose of oxytocin released at each milk ejection (1 mU) did not change the serum prolactin levels. These results indicate that the mechanism for prolactin release may be more susceptible to the effects of anesthesia than that for oxytocin release in response to the suckling stimuli and that the release of both the hormones is pulsatile in nature and be influenced by a common biological clock during the nursing period. © 1983, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - The effect of pregnancy on seizure frequency was monitored prospectively in 136 pregnancies of 122 epileptic women. Pregnancy did not influence the seizure frequency in 68 pregnancies (50%). In 50 pregnancies (37%) the number of seizures increased during pregnancy or puerperium. The seizure frequency decreased in 18 pregnancies (13%). In 34 out of 50 pregnancies (68%) the increase was associated with non-compliance with the drug regimen or sleep deprivation. In seven out of 18 pregnancies (39%) improvement was related to correction of non-compliance or sleep deprivation during the pregestational nine months. Insufficiently low plasma concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were found in 47% of the women with uncontrolled epilepsy during pregnancy. The course of epilepsy during pregnancy is primarily influenced by non-compliance, sleep deprivation during pregnancy, and inadequate therapy before and during pregnancy. With good medical attention pregnancy itself seems to have only a minimal influence on the course of epilepsy.

AB  - Comparisons have been made between the effects of shortened daylength and melatonin treatment on plasma prolactin and melatonin levels in pinealectomised (Px) and sham-operated (Sh) ewes. Twenty-two anoestrous Merino crossbred ewes, maintained under normal grazing conditions, were assigned to four groups for a period of 9 weeks. Group 1 remained untreated (control), Group 2 was herded into a dark shed at 1600 h each day until dark (approx 4 h), ewes in Group 3 were injected with 100 μg melatonin s.c. at 1600 h each day and ewes in Group 4 were implanted with a melatonin capsule releasing 125-200 μg/day. Another group (Group 5) of 4 Px and 4 Sh ewes from the same flock was maintained in an animal house and subjected to shortened daylength (10. 5 h L : 13. 5 h D, lights off 1600 h). Three weeks after the treatments began, ewes in Groups 1-4 were exposed to a fertile ram and ewes in Group 5 to a vasectomised ram and the day of mating noted. No differences were evident between Groups 1-4 in the ewes' response to the ram, time taken to conceive, duration of gestation or number of lambs born. In untreated Px ewes no plasma melatonin (< 20 pg/ml) was found in either day or night samples, whereas intact animals showed the characteristic night-time rise. The silastic implants produced stable daytime blood levels of 90-120 pg/ml, whereas a single injection of 100 μg melatonin caused a transitory (2-3 h) rise. Shortened daylength (Group 2) or a single daily injection of melatonin (Group 3) lowered prolactin levels but only in ewes with an intact pineal gland, whereas melatonin implants (Group 4) caused a reduction in plasma prolactin in both Px and Sh sheep. The results indicate that light-induced alterations in prolactin production in sheep involve both the pineal gland and melatonin. Continuous melatonin release from implants caused changes in plasma prolactin levels similar to those seen following exposure to short days. © 1983.

AB  - These studies were performed to assess the concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS) in the rhesus monkey fetal circulation from midgestation through the neonatal period, to determine the relation between changes in fetal adrenal size and DHAS levels both during gestation and after surgical stress, and to explore possible relations between changes in the concentration of DHAS in the fetal circulation and the initiation of labor. When plasma DHAS was quantified in cord blood and in serial samples from chronically catheterized rhesus monkey fetuses, a significant increase in plasma DHAS concentration occurred after 150 days gestational age (404 ± 37 vs. 1093 ± 159 ng/ml), and an additional increase was found after 159 days (2246 ± 712 ng/ml). A diurnal change in fetal plasma DHAS occurred in chronically catheterized fetuses, with evening samples having higher values than morning samples. Further, there was an increase in plasma DHAS concentrations in the 4–5 days after fetal surgery. A significant increase in fetal plasma DHAS concentration occurred in the newborn rhesus monkey. Although plasma DHAS concentrations remained significantly higher than in the late gestation fetus, they decreased by approximately half within the first 2 weeks of life. A close correlation existed between fetal plasma DHAS and fetal adrenal weight in control fetuses delivered by hysterotomy and fetuses that were delivered 5 days after fetal surgery. Adrenal weights in the latter were significantly higher than those in comparably aged fetuses delivered by hysterotomy that had not undergone the stress of fetal surgery. The possible relationship between the increase in plasma DHAS and the initiation of labor was studied by monitoring the changes in daily morning DHAS concentrations in long term catheterized fetuses and comparing these values to the mean cross-sectional DHAS values corresponding to that gestational age. In all but one case, the values of DHAS, although they increased preceding delivery, were still within the range found in fetuses of the same gestational age that were not in labor. These data indicate that increases in DHAS are intimately related to parallel increases in fetal adrenal weight, that there are striking increases in DHAS levels near the end of gestation, that an increase in DHAS is a component of the fetal response to surgical stress, and that there is no immediately apparent, direct relationship between fetal DHAS and preterm delivery. © 1983 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Cortisol (F), Na, and K were measured in human milk samples taken every 4 h during 28 24-h cycles in 19 subjects. F in milk, measured by radioimmunoassay of unchromatographed extracts, demonstrated a circadian variation similar to that of plasma F and was dexamethasone-suppressible. Values ranged from 220 ± 41 (SE) ng/dl at 2300 h to 1,214 ± 210 at 0700 h. When milk extracts were chromatographed, a similar circadian variation was seen, and F ranged from 87 ± 27 (SE) ng/dl at 2300 h to 784 ± 164 at 700 h. The morning values of F exceeded previous estimates of corticosteroid binding capacity in milk, indicating the possibility of significant levels of unbound F. The subjects were divided into three groups according to time postpartum: I, 3.5-6 wk; II, 8-18 wk, and III, 20-32 wk. In milk, normalized values of F (unchromatographed) and electrolytes (x/x̄) were compared, with x the value at time t and x̄ the mean value for a 24-h cycle. A significant circadian variation was seen in milk for (x/x̄)(Na), (x/x̄)(K), (x/x̄)(Na/K), and (x/x̄)(F). Correlation of (x/x̄)(F) with (x/x̄)(Na) 4 h later was negative in all three groups (r = -0.36 to -0.56, P <0.10-0.001) as was (x/x̄)(F) vs. (x/x̄)(Na/K) (r = -0.33 to -0.61, P <0.10-0.001); (x/x̄)(F) vs. (x/x̄)(K) 4 h later was positive (r = 0.38 to 0.52, P <0.05-0.001). Dexamethasone administration caused a significant decrease in milk x̄(Na) and an increase x̄(K) in all five subjects (P <0.01). Thus, milk Na and K concentrations appeared regulated by adrenal corticosteroids.

AB  - The preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone reaches a maximum at 18.00 h on the day of pro-oestrus in female rats maintained with regular lighting from 06.00 to 20.00 h. This surge is initiated by a discharge of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone into hypophysial portal blood. In this study, drugs which affect catecholamine-mediated neurotransmission were administered on the day of prooestrus and the effects on serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone and on subsequent ovulation were observed. α-Methyl-p-tyrosine, diethyldithiocarbamate and SKF 64139 inhibit catecholamine synthesis at the level of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine β-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, respectively. Although α-methyl-p-tyrosine suppressed ovulation, it had a negligible effect on the incidence of the preovulatory surge. In contrast, the various treatments with diethyldithiocarbamate and SKF 64139 resulted in a minimal occurence of the 18.00 h surge; at relatively low doses, however, these drugs frequently elicited a surge at 22.00 or 24.00 h which invariably resulted in ovulation. The failure of the surge after diethyldithiocarbamate or SKF 64139 was not associated with a loss of pituitary sensitivity to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. In terms of the hypothalamic concentration of dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine at 18.00 h on pro-oestrus, the only common effect of diethyldithiocarbamate and SKF 64139, given in a dose which blocks the surge, was a severe depletion of adrenaline; α-methyl-p-tyrosine failed to produce this effect despite inducing a marked depression of dopamine and a moderate loss of noradrenaline. Neither the increase in hypothalamic dopamine after diethyldithiocarbamate, nor the α2 receptor blocking properties of SKF 64139 appear to be relevant in this context since injections of l-dopa or piperoxane, an α2 receptor antagonist, were without effect on the surge or ovulation. The failure of the surge after prazosin, an α1 receptor antagonist, indicates that the function of adrenaline may be mediated postsynaptically by α1 receptors. Clonidine, an α2 receptor agonist which reduces the turnover rate of hypothalamic adrenaline, had effects on the surge and ovulation which were comparable to those of diethyldithiocarbamate and SKF 64139, the relatively low doses causing some of the surges to occur at 24.00 instead of 18.00h and higher doses suppressing the surge at both times and thus preventing ovulation. The hypotensive effects of clonidine are unlikely to be of significance in this respect since mecamylamine, a ganglionic blocking hypotensive agent, did not disturb the surge or ovulation. Piperoxane, an α2 receptor antagonist which enhances the turnover rate of hypothalamic adrenaline, counteracted the effect of clonidine on the timing of the surge. The results of this study are consistent with a necessary role for adrenaline in the production of the spontaneous preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge. Evidence specifically implicating dopamine or noradrenaline in this process was not obtained. The results emphasize the importance of the sequential study of serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone and ovulation in individual animals and of recognizing the possibility of a delayed "midnight" surge. This study also indicates that tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition may fail to produce the functional deficits which follow the inhibition of enzymes involved in the subsequent biosynthetic pathway for adrenaline. © 1983.

AB  - An animal model was used to examine the effect of maternal alcohol administration on behaviors in the offspring which might predispose to alcoholism. Pregnant C3H mice were administered a liquid diet containing 28% ethanol-derived calories (EDC) from Gestation-Day 8 until parturition. Control animals were either pair-fed an isocaloric 0% EDC diet or received standard lab chow and water throughout pregnancy. Offspring were tested for sleep time following a challenge dose of 3.5 or 4.5 g/kg ethanol at 25 or 110 days of age or for consumption of 10% w/v ethanol in a two-bottle choice situation. The results demonstrated that prenatal exposure to alcohol did not affect alcohol-induced sleep time at either testing age or dose and that waking blood alcohol levels were similar across groups. Voluntary alcohol consumption, however, was higher in mice exposed to alcohol in utero during the initial week of testing but intake decreased to near control levels by the third week. Whether other alcohol-related behaviors are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure remains to be examined. © 1983.

AB  - The effects of methadone and morphine on fetal behavior were studied following their administration to either the mother (5ug/kg/min) or fetus (0.5ug/kg maternal wt./min) using the chronically-instrumented pregnant ewe model. Fourteen unanesthetized, unrestrained pregnant ewes between 130-141 days gestation (term 145 days) were studied 9-28 days following the surgical implantation of cannulae and electrodes to monitor fetal heart rate, blood pressure, breathing movements, eye movements, muscular and electrocortical activity. The three behavioral states of quiet sleep, rapid eye movement sleep and arousal could be distinguished using these parameters. Both drugs, by both routes, resulted in fetal arousal, largely at the expense of quiet sleep. While morphine and methadone were equipotent in suppressing quiet sleep following infusion to the fetus, methadone was three times more potent than morphine after maternal infusion. This potency difference is consistent with the results of prior pharmacokinetic studies demonstrating that fetal exposure to maternally administered methadone is approximately three times greater than that to maternally administered morphine. © 1983.

AB  - We recorded EEGs for 14 identical and 14 fraternal young adult twin pairs during one night of sleep in our laboratory. They were instructed to sleep as long as possible. The extended sleep of the identical and fraternal twins was correlated. The structural measures of sleep of the fraternal twins were not correlated. The onset latencies, awakening measures, stage changes, and rapid eye movement amounts were significantly correlated in the identical twins. The nature of the measures used supports an interpretation of hereditary aspects of sleep length and certain structural components of sleep. © 1983, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drugs reported to stimulate fetal breathing (FB) were injected into a femoral vein of near-term fetal lambs during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. The primary response to NaCN, 0.25-0.5 mg, a dose which did not flatten the electrocorticogram, was a brief burst of gasping in any sleep state. When injected during REM sleep, NaCN caused the cessation of spontaneous FB and the onset of gasping. Stimulation of FB was observed infrequently. Caffeine (10 mg) and doxapram (3 mg) frequently caused an immediate change in sleep state or arousal. The incidence of FB increased concomitantly with a change to REM sleep or wakefulness (W), but FB still ceased with the onset of NREM sleep. When administered during an episode of spontaneous FB during REM sleep, both caffeine and doxapram caused stimulation of the frequency and depth of breathing. Pilocarpine (4 mg) caused arousal and gasping followed by prolonged vigorous breathing that was dependent on intact carotid sinus nerves. Indomethacin (120 mg over several hours) did not affect sleep states but induced FB in both NREM and REM sleep. In summary, in the fetus the primary effect of NaCN is to suppress spontaneous FB and induce gasping and the effects of pilocarpine, caffeine, and doxapram are intimately related to sleep states or arousal. Indomethacin causes the conversion from episodic fetal to continuous postnatal-type breathing. These data indicate the importance of assessing fetal state of consciousness in interpreting the respiratory response to drugs.

AB  - One thousand consecutive postpartum patients were interviewed by questionnaire to establish the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnancy. Hand symptoms had been noted by 34%: 25% had had symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, 2% symptoms of ulnar nerve compression and 7% ill defined hand symptoms. Maternal and fetal age, parity and weight change did not correlate with the presence of symptoms. The rate of ring removal because of swelling was twice as great for the symptomatic women (73%) as for the asymptomatic women (36%), and the rates of pre-eclampsia, hypertension and edema were higher for the women with symptoms. Three quarters of the women had bilateral symptoms, and half of the multigravidas had had similar symptoms in previous pregnancies. Hand function and sleep were disturbed in 75% of the symptomatic women, yet only 46% of all those with symptoms mentioned their symptoms to their doctors; treatment was given to only 16% (35% of those who complained), and relief was obtained by only half of these.

AB  - In the foetus, as in the adult, the behavioural state of the central nervous system plays a very significant role in the modulation of respiratory activity. Breathing at birth represents the continuation of a process that commences early in life in utero and develops as gestation proceeds. The profile of classical afferent respiratory input to the foetus in utero is significantly different to that of the new born, with a reduction in total neural traffic and a smaller phasic variation. The foetus, however, phasically contracts its diaphragm which, as gestation proceeds, is patterned into distinct ‘on and off’ periods. Breathing of the foetus occurs during rapid eye movement sleep, analogous to that in the adult, and continues following somatic stimulation. This behavioural state is reduced during foetal hypoxia and foetal respiration is simultaneously depressed. At birth there is an increase in both somatosensory neural input and phasic variation and the new born breathes in all behavioural states, the stability of which varies cyclically with a period similar to that seen before birth. Whereas improved surgical and experimental techniques and non-invasive technology have enabled more complete description of the development of the respiratory system in utero, the transitional events of the processes which occur at birth happen very quickly and at present prevent a similar detailed description. © 1983 ASEG.

AB  - Breastfeeding reduces the interval between births by its effect on prolonging the period of postpartum anovulation and in some cases, reducing the likelihood of conception once ovulation has occurred. Extended durations of postpartum amenorrhea (18 months and longer) are observed among many women in developing countries, while shorter durations (6 months or less) are common among women in developed countries. This differential effect has been suggested to be related to maternal nutritional status, but numerous other factors also differ. This paper reviews the literature in this area, and suggests that most studies indicate a small and demographically insignificant effect of maternal nutritional status on the period of postpartum amenorrhea. Factors associated with suckling patterns appear to be more important in determining the length of postpartum infertility. Suckling frequency and intensity which affects the hormonal stimulus preventing ovulation appear to be affected by the type of and how supplemental feeding is given to the child (use of bottles), whether suckling is on demand or scheduled, the frequency of night-time feedings (influenced by whether or not the mother sleeps with the child), whether or not pacifiers are used, and the child's nutritional and health status. © 1983.

AB  - To assess the influence of sleep states, gestational age, and postnatal age on respiratory frequencies, we made polygraphic recordings on forty-eight 31-41 wk gestational age newborns (≤ 10 days of legal age) and on 16 prematurely born (≤ 36 wk of gestation) infants, after they reached the term of 37-40 wk conceptional age. Periods with and without ≥3-sec respiratory pauses were independently analyzed by 20-sec periods. States of sleep were defined according to REMs and EEC criteria. At all ages and in all sleep states, respiratory frequencies were slightly, but not significantly, lower in total tracing compared to no-pause tracing. Results of statistical comparison were identical when they were performed on both total and no-pause tracings. From 35 wk gestational age onward, respiratory frequency was higher in active (AS) REM sleep, compared to quiet (QS) NREM sleep (P < 0.01). In undefined sleep (IS), respiratory frequency was at an intermediate level (AS > IS > QS), significantly different from that of AS and QS. Respiratory frequency was similar in all 31-38 wk gestational age newborns. It became significantly higher in 39-41 wk gestational age newborns (P < 0.01). The frequency of the respiration was higher in prematurely born infants reaching 37-48 or 39-40 wk conceptional age, compared to that of newborns of the same gestational age. We did not find significant differences between genders in any age group studied. At all ages there was a high correlation among respiratory frequencies found in AS, QS, and IS and also among those frequencies found in successive sleep cycles for given individuals: Some normal infants breathed more rapidly and the others more slowly in all states studied. It appears that respiratory frequency is an individual characteristic, modulated by the sleep state, gestational age and postnatal age factors. The review of the literature suggests, that divergences among authors can be due to some methodological differences and partic-ularly to differences in scoring of sleep states. © 1983 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - A technique for chronic extracellular recording of neuronal activity in the medullary region of fetal sheep during different sleep states is described. Of 51 recorded neurones, 54% were associated with respiration, blood pressure changes, or muscle electromyograms, and 46% were nonspecific. During apnea (nonrapid-eye-movement sleep) both inspiratory and expiratory neurons had random intermittent activity. Thus apnea is not associated with tonic expiratory neuronal activity.

AB  - The human oculomotor system becomes active long before birth. At about 16 weeks (post-menstrual age) the first slow changes of eye position can be observed with the aid of real time ultrasonography. At 18-20 weeks more rapid eye movements are detectable. There is a gradual decline in the percentage of time spent in rapid and slow eye movements from 32-40 weeks. These eye movements are organized in episodes of activity, divided by episodes of quiescence which are at first unrelated to cyclical changes in other variables (such as breathing movements, body movements and fetal heart rate patterns). At about 36 weeks gestation, REM and non-REM episodes become linked with other changes and then represent behavioural states identical to those seen in the newborn infant. This organization of behavioral states in the fetus is identical with that found in preterm infants of comparable age. Opening of eyelids is difficult to see before birth but the existence of episodes of wakefulness seems most probable. Hence fetal eye movements will be in part related to wakefulness. In the newborn at term, the interval distributions of REMs during sleep and of scanning eye movements during wakefulness are statistically different. © 1983.

AB  - The early symptoms of brain dysfunction in infants born to heroin-addicted mothers were studied during the first month of life by a multimethod approach. Neurological examination and polygraphic EEG studies of sleep patterns were performed; concomitantly plasma levels of beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin were measured. Whenever possible, these parameters were correlated with each other and with the severity of the withdrawal syndrome. While the neurological examination of addicted newborns was almost negative, altered sleep cycles with a decrease in active sleep and an increase in quiet sleep were noted together with a marked increase in the plasma concentration of the endogenous opioid peptides. Furthermore, instead of reverting to the adult values (as for normal babies), the peptides remained at high levels up to the 40th day of life. © 1983 Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam.

AB  - The electrocorticograms (ECoGs) of the first generation (F1) hybrid mice of C57BL/6 × C3H irradiated at fetal or neonatal period were studied at 6-8 (young) and 24-26 (old) months of age. Two groups of mice were irradiated on the 17th day of gestation (17-DPC), another 2 groups on the day of birth (0-DPP), and third 2 groups on the 7th day after birth (7-DPP). All animals were irradiated with 300 R of X-rays to the whole body. The ECoGs were recorded from freely moving animals with permanently implanted electrodes fixed over the visual cortical surface. Recordings were continuous for 3 h, starting at 10:00 a.m. The ECoGs were divided into 3 patterns: wakefulness (W), slow wave sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS). Six parameters of the 3 patterns were compared for the 6 irradiated and 2 non-irradiated groups at the young and old age. Non-X-irradiated. There was no difference in the proportion of the total SWS time to the total recording time (TRT) between the young and old control groups. The mean SWS cycle time and the mean SWS length were significantly longer in the young group than in the old group. The ratio of the total PS time to the total sleep time (TST) for the old group was significantly high as compared with that for the young group. The old group had significantly shorter mean PS cycle time and mean PS length than did the young group. X-irradiated. The proportion of total SWS time to TRT was significantly less in the old 0-DPP group than in the comparably aged control group. Mean SWS cycle time, and mean SWS and PS length for the 17-DPC and 0-DPP groups at young age were intermediate between those of the control group at young age and the control group at old age. The ratio of total PS time to TST for the 17-DPC and 0-DPP groups at both ages was significantly less than that for the control groups at every age level. Mean PS length of the 0-DPP group at old age was significantly short as compared with that of the control group at the same age. The body weight and brain weight of these 4 irradiated groups except body weight of the old 17-DPC group were lower than those of their control groups. There were little or no changes in the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the ECoGs for the 7-DPP group at both ages. These results may suggest that the adult and aged mouse X-irradiated at fetal or neonatal period show the ECoG pattern which occurs at a later age in their control groups, namely, an acceleration in the aging of the ECoG pattern. © 1983.

AB  - To test the efficacy of temporally patterned kinesthetic and auditory stimulation for promoting development of infants born prior to term, 88 preterm infants, below 35 weeks gestation, were assigned to 1 of 4 experimental or control groups. Control subjects received regular hospital care; fixed interval subjects received 15 min of rocking/heartbeat stimulation each hour; self-activating subjects received 15 min rocking/heartbeat when inactive for 90 sec, but only for 1 stimulation period per hour. Assessments included measures of neurological functioning, sleep-wake activity, mother-infant interaction, and mental and motor development at 8 and 24 months. All experimental infants, compared to controls, showed decreased rates of activity while in the hospital, fewer abnormal reflexes, and better orienting responses. At 24 months, experimental infants scored significantly higher on the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales. Few differences were found in parent-infant interaction patterns. The results indicate that both temporal patterning and contingent responsiveness in the preterm infant's early environment contribute positively to some aspects of the development of such infants.

AB  - The effects of acute methadone exposure on fetal behavioral activity were investigated in 10 unanesthetized fetal lamb preparations. Fetal behavioral activity was interpreted indirectly from the electrocorticogram (ECoG), electromyogram, electrooculogram, blood pressure, heart rate (FHR), and breathing movements (FBMs) of the fetus. Methadone infusion to the mother (5 μg/kg/min) resulted in a suppression of all synchronized ECoG activity, and an increase in FBM, FHR, eye movements, nuchal tone, and body movements. Similar effects were observed when 10% of the dose was given directly to the fetus. These results demonstrate that methadone acts directly on the fetus to suppress both quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep and results in a 'hyperactive' state that has previously been shown to be associated with a 20% increase in fetal oxygen consumption.

AB  - Anthropometric data and computerized electroencephalogram analysis during quiet, indeterminate, and active sleep were obtained from infants and mothers of four groups: (1) heavy drinking mothers (> 2 ounces of alcohol per day); (2) nondrinking mothers; (3) smoking, nondrinking mothers; (4) nonsmoking, nondrinking mothers. Infants in groups 1 and 2 were matched as closely as possible for postconceptional age, sex, race, and socioeconomic status. Infants in groups 3 and 4 were matched similarly. Infants of alcoholic mothers had a significantly lower birth weight, length, and head circumference than those from the matched control group. Infants of smoking mothers had lower birth weights and lengths than infants of nonsmoking mothers, but head circumference was identical. Hypersynchrony of the electroencephalogram was seen only in 'alcoholic' infants, and power spectral density analysis revealed that the average integrated power was significantly increased in quiet, active, and indeterminate sleep. The greatest increase in electroencephalogram power (212%) was seen in active sleep, and this analysis clearly separated 15 of 17 alcohol-exposed infants from the control infants. These data suggest that alcohol has a specific toxic effect on the fetal brain that is not linked with smoking habits. The neonatal electroencephalogram is affected even in the absence of dysmorphology and thus may be the most sensitive indicator of alcohol toxicity.

AB  - In an earlier study, an inverse correlation between thiopental‐induced sleeping time and alcohol intake in the preceding week was demonstrated in women undergoing termination of pregnancy. In order to investigate the mechanism behind the apparent cross‐tolerance, the relationship between alcohol consumption in the week preceding thiopental/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia and wakening plasma thiopental concentration on one hand and sleeping time on the other was examined in 68 women scheduled for termination of pregnancy and in 37 women scheduled for diagnostic uterine dilatation and curettage. In terms of pure alcohol, the weekly intake (mean ± s.d.) was 1.17±2.07 ml kg‐1 in the former and 1.49± 1.70 ml kg‐1 in the latter group. A positive correlation between alcohol consumption and wakening plasma thiopental concentration was found in both groups, reaching statistical significance (P&lt; 0.05) in the group undergoing termination of pregnancy, but not in the other. The inverse correlation found earlier between alcohol intake and sleeping time was not reproduced significantly in any of the groups. The results indicate that moderate alcohol intake may induce cerebral tolerance to thiopental. © 1983 Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Fonden

AB  - CD-1 albino mice were given Portagen-10 percent ethanol (ETOH) or isocaloric Portagen-sucrose during pregnancy to determine if tolerance developed in utero and to describe the temporal pattern of its decline postnatally. ETOH mothers did not significantly increase their consumption of ETOH but gained in body weight during pregnancy, showed no signs in the open field of withdrawal from ETOH shortly after delivery and showed less pup-caring behavior than pair-fed controls (PFC). Among offspring 1, 3, 10, 25 and 60 days old, only 25-day old ETOH pups metabolized and cleared an anesthetic dose of ETOH more efficiently than PFC animals, suggesting the absence of Dispositional Tolerance in the other animals. PFC offspring 10 days old took significantly longer to lose the righting reflex than their ETOH counterparts following the anesthetic dose of ETOH, the difference being opposite that which would suggest the occurrence of Adaptive Tolerance. Data are discussed primarily in terms of decreases in dose of ETOH to which mothers and fetuses were exposed during pregnancy. © 1983.

AB  - Midazolam was given in a single 15-mg oral dose as a sedative the evening before elective cesarean section. Twelve hours later, levels of this new benzodiazepine were measureable in the fetomaternal entity in only one of 13 cases. After 15 mg midazolam orally or 0.05 mg/kg midazolam intramuscularly 15 to 60 min before elective cesarean section, there was evident transfer of drug into the placenta, but transfer took place more slowly than with diazepam. On the basis of kinetics derived from maternal serum concentrations after oral, intramuscular, or intravenous dosing, midazolam appears to have a rapid onset and short duration of action, which was also evident from subjective assessments by the patients. There was wide interindividual variation in the gastrointestinal absorption of midazolam in full-term pregnant women. Clinically, midazolam nevertheless seemed to be very useful for nocturnal sedation before elective cesarean section; it ensures a mean duration of sleep of about 6 hr and there are virtually no detectable levels of drug in the fetomaternal entity the next morning. © 1983.

AB  - Neuro-endocrine influences are evident in hibernating Ursus americanus such as hypothermia, bradycardia, anorexia, decreased metabolic rate, sleep position and prolonged sleeping period. Both a catabolic state (similar to anorexia nervosa and starvation) and an anabolic state (similar to pregnancy and growth) are present simultaneously. The bear balances these states perfectly so that it successfully hibernates for 7 months without food or water at a near normal body temperature with no toxic waste accumulation. To succeed, the bear recycles N from recently formed urea back into amino acids at a rate exceeding urea formation. This process appears to be a result of neuro-endocrine interaction with metabolic processes. This neuro-endocrine-metabolic state required for hibernation in the bear is operative weeks prior to actual denning.-from Authors

AB  - The role of hypnosis as a tool in the treatment of problems commonly encountered among medical and surgical patients is examined. Hypnosis is defined as a change in state of mind far more akin to intense concentration than sleep. Diagnostic implications of differences in hypnotic responsivity are explored, and scales suitable for use in the clinic are examined. Uses of hypnosis in treating anxiety, pain, childbirth, psychosomatic symptoms, seizure disorders, neuromuscular dysfunction, and habits are described and evaluated. The phenomenon of hypnosis is presented as a means of exploring the mind-body relationship in a controlled fashion, providing information of diagnostic importance while at the same time allowing hypnotizable patients to intensify their concentration and interpersonal receptivity in the service of a therapeutic goal. © 1983.

AB  - A number of syndromes have recently been described which are associated with undernutrition and altered reproductive function. The syndromes described in women which include anorexia nervosa, amenorrhea associated with weight loss, bulimia, amenorrhea which occurs after oral contraceptives, postpartum amenorrhea, and amenorrhea associated with exercise all have hormonal patterns suggestive of hypothalamic alterations. Although the mechanisms are unknown, these problems appear to involve abnormalities affecting the central regulatory mechanism responsible for gonadotropin secretion, particularly those regulating pulse frequency, pulse amplitude and sleep associated patterns. These syndromes represent excellent models for the study and understanding of these important hypothalamic mechanisms as well as models for the understanding of puberty and the maturation of the pubertal hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis. Effects of Undernutrition on ReproductiveFunction in the Human The reproductive system, particularly in women, is extremely sensitive to alterations in its environment. The importance of homeostasis is exemplified by the reports of altered cyclicity during conditions of crowding, starvation, weight change, travel, communal living, exercise, and severe stress of any kind (1, 2). © 1983 by The Endocrine Society © 1983 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In 12 chronically prepared fetal lambs between 126 and 136 days of gestation, 17 ventriculocisternal perfusions (123 μl/min) were performed. The concentration of bicarbonate ([HCO3 -1]) in the mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) perfusate was altered to manipulate the [HCO3 -1] in the cerebral ventricles. These perfusions did not systematically alter fetal arterial PCO2, PO2, pH, heart rate or mean blood pressure. Fetal breathing movements (FBM) were noted as rhythmic negative intrathoracic pressures with reference to amniotic fluid pressure. The incidence of FBM was determined and expressed as the percent of the 3 h observation period during which breathing movements were present. Perfusions with mock CSF having an approximately normal [HCO3 -1], resulted in cisternal [HCO3 -1] of 23.9 ± 0.8 (SEM) meq/L and an incidence of fetal breathing movements (FBM) of 22.1 ± 10.0%. Perfusions with an elevated [HCO3 -1] in the mock CSF increased the cisternal [HCO3 -1] to 30.7 ± 0.4 meq/L and lowered the incidence of FBM to 0.6 ± 0.2%. Perfusions with a lowered [HCO3 -1] mock CSF decreased the cisternal [HCO3 -1] to 17.3 ± 0.8 meq/L and increased the incidence of FBM to 45.7 ± 6.8%. These perfusions did not alter the relative incidence of low voltage (LV) versus high voltage (HV) electrocortical (ECOG) state. In 4 animals, low [HCO3 -1] perfusions induced FBM in the normally apneic HV ECOG state. We conclude that in the near-term fetal lamb, central chemoreceptors can modulate the incidence of rhythmic respiratory efforts, that tonic afferent stimuli arising from these receptors are critical for the generation of spontaneous FBMs and that central acidosis is capable of evoking FBMs in the normally apneic HV ECOG state. © 1983.

AB  - The monitoring of fetal motion in high-risk pregnancies has been shown to be worthwhile in predicting fetal distress and impending fetal death. The maternal recording of perceived fetal activity is an inexpensive surveillance technique which is most useful when there is chronic uteroplacental insufficiency or when a stillbirth may be expected. The presence of an active, vigorous fetus is reassuring, but documented fetal inactivity required a reassessment of the underlying antepartum complication and further fetal evaluation with real-time ultrasonography, fetal heart rate testing, and biochemical testing. Fetal distress from such acute changes as abruptio placentae or umbilical cord compression may not be predicted by monitoring fetal motion. Although not used for routine clinical investigation, electromechanical devices such as tocodynamometry have provided much insight into fetal behavioral patterns at many stages of pregnancy and in pregnancies with an antepartum complication. © 1982.

AB  - The switch from Hb F to A which occurs during ontogeny in primates is incomplete in the adult. In addition, Hb F may reappear during erythroid stress. Colonies derived in vitro from erythroid progenitors also produce both Hbs F and A. At each stage of normal ontogeny, the relation between the proportion of F synthesized in the colonies derived from progenitors in vitro and in the reticulocytes or erythroblasts (precursors) which developed in vivo is not immediately apparent. There are several possible models to explain the phenomenon of the ontogenic switch. A cellular model is presented.

AB  - During the past decade there has been ample documentation of the proposition that the pineal gland mediates photoperiodic influences upon reproductive behavior of hamsters. It is commonly hypothesized that the pineal gland expresses its activity by transformation of photoperiodic information into an hormonal output, that hormone being melatonin. If this hypothesis is correct, there must be some essential diffrence in melatonin's output when hamsters are exposed to different photoperiodic environments. The experiments summarized in this communication analyze pineal melatonin contents in Syrian hamsters maintained in a variety of photoperiodic conditions during different physiological states. The results demonstrate that adult hamsters have a daily surge in pineal melatonin content throughout their lifetime when exposed to simulated annual photoperiodic cycles. There is some fluctuation in the amount of pineal melatonin produced during different physiological states and photoperiodic environments, but these fluctuations seem small when compared to those normally found for other regulatory hormones. When hamsters are exposed to different photoperiodic regimens, the daily melatonin surge maintains a relatively constant phase relationship with respect to the onset of daily activity. There is a concomitant change in its phase relationship with respect to light-dark transitions. © 1982 Swets & Zeitlinger B. V.

AB  - Two trials were conducted to (1) determine the degree of control of ovulation achieved by treating mares in late winter with progesterone and oestradiol-17 beta combined after prior exposure to an artificially increased photoperiod, and (2) to examine the effectiveness of such a procedure incorporated into equine breeding farm management systems. Following a 15-day treatment of 150 mg progesterone and 10 mg oestradiol-17 beta daily with 10 mg PGF-2 alpha on the last day of steroid treatment, 27 of 31 mares ovulated on Days 8-14 after the last injection in one trial. Conception rate for mares mated during that period was 77%, compared with 50% in untreated mares mated at first oestrus following the treatment period. In a second, larger field trial involving the same treatment for a 10-day period, 103 of 128 mares ovulated on Days 9-16 after the last injection and 62% of the mares mated on those days conceived. These results indicate that the combined steroid treatment provided reasonably precise and practical control of ovulation time in mares adequately stimulated by increased photoperiod without detrimental effect on fertility.

AB  - Thirteen 6-8 month-old fillies were assigned to 3 treatment groups: Group 1 had a 16-h fixed daily photoperiod (16L:8D, N = 4), Group 2 a daily photoperiod equivalent to ambient daylength (control, N = 5), and Group 3 a 9-h fixed daily photoperiod (9L:15D, N = 4). The light treatments extended from 17 December to 9 August. Hair shedding occurred first in Group 1 followed by Group 2, then Group 3. The proportions of fillies with 1 or more ovulations (puberty) by the end of the project were 2/4, 5/5, 2/4 in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The hypothesis that a fixed daily photoperiod which corresponded to maximum daylength at the summer solstice in temperate zones (16 h) would hasten puberty was not supported. Instead, the 16-h light treatment interfered with the attainment of puberty, as indicated by the reduced proportion of fillies ovulating, reduced numbers of ovulations, luteal bodies, and oestrous periods/filly, the extended intervals from the beginning of the project to the first ovulatory oestrus and the shorter period of oestrus. Hair coat changes were dissociated from changes in reproductive activity in Group 1. Puberty also appeared to be retarded in Group 3, but the results were less pronounced than those for Group 1.

AB  - In order to investigate the effects of obstructive sleep apneas upon transcutaneous PO 2 75 polysomnograms, recorded during night sessions in 25 control infants, 25 siblings, and 25 near miss for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) infants were studied. These observations were compared with the decreases in transcutaneous PO 2 measured during central sleep apneas in the same infants. During a total of 707.6 hours of sleep, 33 obstructive apneas and 1,650 central apneas were recorded. Obstructive apneas were seen in three controls infants (three epsisodes), one sibling (five episodes). The obstructive apneas tended to be short (less than 10 seconds). Comparatively, the central apneas were equally distributed in the three groups of infants, and only the near miss children presented apneas that lasted as long as 19 seconds. The decrease in transcutaneous PO 2 was proportional to the duration of both types of apnea, but for a given duration the decrease in transcutaneous PO 2 was significantly greater for the obstructive apneas than for the central apneas (with a mean difference of 7.59 ± 0.53% PO 2). It is concluded that the hypoxic effects of the obstructive apneas might have important clinical implications in infants, such as the near miss for SIDS.

AB  - Antepartum detection, classification, determination of severity, and ultimately treatment of the fetus at risk for death and damage in utero form the very basis of modern perinatal medicine. The availability of accurate methods for assessing the fetus in utero are now becoming available. In extrauterine medicine, assessment of risk is based in part on the patient's activities and response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. In extrauterine medicine, differentiation of normal sleep from coma is made by assessment of multiple biophysical variables and responses. It is most likely that the same principle will improve the quality of perinatal care.

AB  - Both clinical and animal studies indicate that prenatal exposure to opiate produces effects that occur in two phases. An acute phase consists of a neonatal abstinence syndrome characterized by increased CNS arousal. The major behavior symptoms seen in both humans and animals include hyperactivity, disturbed sleep and increased lability of state. This early phase can be quite prolonged, lasting from 12 weeks to 6 months in humans and 20-25 days in rats. Although confirming pharmacokinetic studies are needed, it is possible that these persistent symptoms result from the slow clearance of the drug from neonatal tissues. The second phase of the syndrome is less well-understood but the available clinical evidence suggests that exposure to heroin, particularly in a pattern of polydrug abuse, can result in impaired organizational and perceptual abilities, poor self-adjustment and in situations requiring motor inhibition, heightened activity. Studies of pre-school children exposed prenatally to methadone, show no effects on intellectual and cognitive functioning but do reveal heightened activity or energy level, impulsivity, and brief attention span and persistence. A finding of impaired motor inhibition while performing a task has been stressed by one worker as an area of particular vulnerability among these children. A strikingly similar effect, characterized as an impaired ability to modulate task-oriented motor activity, has been described for adult rats prenatally exposed to methadone.

AB  - β-endorphin (β-EP) concentrations in the plasma and the anterior and neuro-intermediate lobes of the pituitary (AP and NIL) were quantitated by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and gel filtration chromatography in female rats at 1000, 1400, and 1900 h on the day of proestrus and diestrus day-1. There were no significant changes in β-EP in the plasma, AP, or NIL on diestrus day-1. On proestrus, β-EP in the plasma and NIL, but not the AP, increased significantly from 1000 to 1400 h and returned to basal levels by 1900 h. The time course of this increase of β-EP in the NIL and plasma is consistent with the temporal sequence of the prolactin and gonadotropin surges on the afternoon of proestrus, suggesting that β-EP in the NIL may be involved in the regulation of these neuroendocrine events. © 1982.

AB  - Human milk sodium ([Na]) and potassium ([K]) concentrations were measured every 4 h for 24 h in 28 subjects 3.5 to 32 wk postpartum. A diurnal variation in milk Na was seen, which was reciprocal to K. Significant negative correlations between Na and K were seen in these periods: 3.5 to 6; 8 to 18, 20 to 32 wk postpartum (p<0.01 for each). The mean 24 h milk sodium concentrations (X̄(Na)) decreased between 3.5 and 18 wk postpartum (p<0.005 by paired t test). Changes in mean potassium (X̄(K)) were not statistically significant. Diet apparently does not affect milk Na. Administration of a low Na diet: 10.8±.9 (SD) mEq Na/day and 60 to 100 mEq K/day for 2 days did not change X̄(Na). But urinary Na decreased 7-fold as aldosterone increased 5-fold. No significant correlation was seen between 24 h Na excretion in urine and X̄(Na) in milk (n=51). A significant positive correlation was seen between urinary K and X̄(K) in milk (r=0.36), p<0.001).

AB  - Continuous measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR), gross fetal body movements, fetal breathing movements, and maternal heart rate (MHR) were made for 24-hour observation intervals in 11 pregnant women at 38 to 40 weeks. There was a significant positive correlation between each mother's daily mean MHR and her fetus' daily mean FHR. There was a trough in mean hourly FHR between 0200 and 0600 hours and a trough in mean hourly MHR between 2400 and 0700 hours. Mean hourly FHR both during and between times of gross fetal body movements was significantly correlated to mean hourly MHR. At term, the mean FHR is strongly influenced by the mean MHR and the presence or absence of gross fetal body movements. © 1982.

AB  - Spasticity, a common symptom of upper motor neuron lesions, may actually aid the patient and should be treated only if it interferes with function, comfort or nursing care. Stretching exercises and elimination of nociceptive stimuli are the first steps in management. If problems persist, medication should be considered. Tenotomies are useful. Motor-point blocks and peripheral nerve blocks are temporary aids, while neurectomies usually provide permanent relief. More drastic neurosurgical procedures are reserved for uncontrolled, incapacitating cases.

AB  - Reviews the literature on the infants of narcotic-addicted mothers in regard to psychological outcome and the medical consequences that contribute to that outcome. Consistent with the notion that these infants are at high risk, there is evidence for adverse outcome in that these infants demonstrate significant perinatal medical problems, impaired interactive and state control behavior and attachment behavior during early infancy, and cognitive and psychomotor deficits as measured on infant developmental scales. They also have an uneven developmental pattern with a nonsymptomatic period between 4 and 6 mo and a possible recurrence at 9-22 mo. Although long-term follow-up research has not offered consistent findings, studies have found that in later childhood these infants show increasingly frequent disturbances of activity levels, attention span, sleep patterns, and socialization. It is generally agreed that narcotic agents introduced in utero can have a deleterious effect on the development of infants.

AB  - The purpose of the following study was to assess the changes in the proestrous hormone profile in middle-aged cycling rats to better understand the inter-relationship and possible interaction of these hormones during the transition to estrous acyclicity. Median eminence LHRH concentrations and serum LH, FSH, estradiol and progesterone concentrations were measured in young (3-4 months old) and middle-aged (8-10 months old) proestrous rats at 0900, 1200, 1500 and 1800h. The data demonstrate that (1) baseline hormone concentrations prior to the surge at 0900h are the same in middle-aged and young rats; (2) the proestrous gonadotropin surge is temporally delayed in middle-aged rats; (3) this delay is preceded by lower median eminence LHRH concentrations and serum estradiol concentrations at 1200h; (4) serum progesterone concentrations are lower in middle-aged rats during the preovulatory gonadotropin surge (at 1500 and 1800h) probably as a consequence of the delayed LH surge. © 1982.

AB  - Recently, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been localized in nerve fibers in the human female genital tract. In the present investigation, the effect and concentration of VIP was studied in uterine tissue from pregnant and nonpregnant women, and the plasma concentration of VIP was measured in relationship to diurnal rhythm, intake of food, menstrual cycle, pregnancy, labor, age, and sexual arousal. In vitro VIP inhibited the contractions of the nonpregnant but not of the pregnant uterus. The median concentration of VIP in myometrium from pregnant women (<0.1 pmole/gm) was significantly lower than that in myometrium from nonpregnant women (1.6 pmoles/gm). The venous plasma concentrations of VIP during labor (10.5 to 13.0 pmoles/L) were significantly higher than those during pregnancy (2.0 to 5.0 pmoles/L) and the menstrual cycle (4.7 to 6.5 pmoles/L), and after delivery (3.2 to 7.0 pmoles/L). The median venous concentration of VIP increased significantly during sexual arousal, from 4.0 to 8.5 pmoles/L. The median arterial and venous concentrations in the umbilical cord (12.5 and 14.5 pmoles/L, respectively) were significantly higher than the concentration in maternal peripheral venous blood (5.2 pmoles/L). The plasma concentrations of VIP were not related to intake of food, diurnal rhythm, menstrual cycle, or age. The conclusion is that the function of VIP may be related to pregnancy, delivery, and sexual stimulation. © 1982.

AB  - Researchers conducted a survey study of 59,598 households in 3 major socioeconomic groups (urban slums, rural agricultural areas, and rural cattle and horse raising areas) in the Punjab province of Pakistan to estimate mortality from neonatal tetanus and to develop a strategy for its control. The investigators learned of 13,831 live births. 724 of these died in the 1st month of life with 432 (60%) dying from neonatal tetanus. Village untrained "dai" or trained midwives delivered all infants in all 3 areas. Often these deliverers placed cow dung on the stump of the severed umbilical cord and used a dirty cloth for cleaning the infant. In addition, the trained midwives would use unclean unsterilized tools to assist in delivery. In rural areas, animals sleep inside with the family and they are always with the family. Since Clostridium tetani is found in intestines of animals, especially horses, the neonatal tetanus rates as a percentage of all neonatal deaths for the rural agricultural and rural cattle and horse raising areas were higher (60% and 73%) than for the urban slums (45%). The village barber circumcises male infants on or before the 7th day of life. Since he stuffs the wound with ash or cow dung or rubs it with a dirty cloth, the chances of infecting the wound with C1. tetani increases. Therefore the total ratio of male deaths to female deaths was 1.61:1. Most males died during the last 3 weeks of the 1st month which can be attributed to circumcision. Overall most deaths occurred between 4-19 days. None of the mothers interviewed had been vaccinated with a tetanus toxoid during pregnancy which greatly contributed to the neonatal tetanus mortality rate.

AB  - 1. The phase angle of circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone in individual blind pups was followed in order to find out an effective zeitgeber(s) during the post‐natal development. 2. The retinal light pathway before the opening of eyes was not essential for the entrainment of pups' rhythm to the environmental light‐dark (LD) cycle. 3. In blinded pups whose eyes were enucleated on the day of birth, no evidence was obtained for effective extra‐retinal pathways for photic inputs. 4. Free‐running circadian hormone rhythm of blind pups was not entrained by 'social contact' with other sighted pups in the same cage. 5. Even when the duration of nursing was varied from 2 to 4 weeks, the phase angle of pups' rhythm at the fourth week was not affected. 6. In mother‐pups exchange experiments in which pups born from LD mother were reared by DL mother (LD‐DL pups) and conversely, pups from DL original mother were reared by LD foster mother (DL‐LD pups), about one half of the pups at the fourth post‐natal week of both groups exhibited phase angles belonging to their original mothers and the other half showed phase angles of their foster mothers. 7. It is suggested that blind pups may retain the phase angle of circadian rhythm of the original mother and the overt hormone rhythm may be modifiable by the foster mother during the early phase of post‐natal life. © 1982 The Physiological Society

AB  - 1. In order to clarify the manner in which maternal nursing modifies the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone in blind pups, specified schedules of maternal nursing were imposed on blind pups and the hormone rhythm was followed individually. 2. Two groups of blinded pups were continuously nursed, alternately by two mother rats having different circadian phases of lactating period. In both groups, phase angles of the original mother were predominantly reflected in the phase of the pups' hormone rhythm. 3. When the maternal nursing was limited only during the light period (L nursing), it caused no detectable effect on the pups' hormone rhythm. 4. In contrast, when the maternal nursing was limited only during the dark period (D nursing), approximately one half of the pups at the fourth post‐natal week showed a bimodal pattern of hormone rhythm. A second peak appearing 180 degrees out of phase to the first peak disappeared by the sixth or eight post‐natal week. 5. It is concluded that the circadian oscillation underlying the plasma corticosterone rhythm starts to function prenatally and the original mother (probably, a prenatal LD cycle) primarily determines the phase angle of the circadian oscillation in blind pups. The maternal nursing does not entrain the pups' circadian oscillation, but does modify transiently the overt hormone rhythm, probably through a discord between maternal nursing and pups' feeding phases. © 1982 The Physiological Society

AB  - In 10 healthy women near term, fetal heart rate, as monitored from an abdominal electrocardiogram, and its variation were analyzed over 24 hours. During the daytime, this was combined with real-time scanning for fetal breathing and movements. There was an episodic change in high and low pulse (R-R) interval variation with a mean cycle length of 92 minutes. The changes in cycle length were large; around midnight, episodes of high variation lasted up to 6 hours. Episodes of high variation coincided with greater fetal movement (measured only in daytime). Neither low nor high episodes were consistently related to fetal breathing. Both fetal heart rate and its variability showed a diurnal variation, by 11% and 50%, respectively; these were not statistically related. There was a particularly large change in pulse interval variation with peak values around midnight; concomitantly, there was a diurnal variation in the incidence of accelerations of defined size. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 1982.

AB  - Secretion of LH in response to an LRH infusion (104 ng/h during 21 h), secretion of progesterone (P) and 20 α-dihydroprogesterone (DHP), as well as the 24 h rhythm of prolactin (Prl) secretion were investigated in rats rendered persistently oestrous by exposure to constant light and in which subsequently pseudopregnancy (PSP) had been induced by cervical stimulation after induction of ovulation by hCG. Similar persistently oestrous rats, but otherwise untreated, served as controls. LHR was nfused through an intra-jugular cannula and blood samples for assay of LH were taken via an intracarotid cannula. LH responses were judged on the basis of the mean maximal height (MH; ng LH ml plasma) and the rate of decrease or half life (t 1/2 ) of the plasma LH concentrations after 2 h of LRH infusion. For assay of P and DHP blood samples were taken from the orbital plexus. In another series of animals blood, for assay of Prl, was sampled every 2 h for 24 h from a cannula with the tip in the right atrium. It was observed that in persistently oestrous rats LH-responses were high (MH = 3326 ± 305) and steep (t 1/2 = 65 ± 10 min). On the day after the night of ovulation (day 0 of PSP) and on days 1, 5 and 9 of PSP the responses were lower (MH between 1315 and 1041) and more blunted (t 1/2 varied between 236 and 142 min), whilst on day 12 of PSP they were again higher (MH = 4416 ± 575) and steeper (t 1/2 = 101 ± 12 min). P and DHP concentrations were low in persistently oestrous rats and high during days 5 and 8 of PSP. On day 12 of PSP P concentrations were low again, while the DHP concentrations had increased further. In persistently oestrous rats the plasma Prl levels were low with incidental elevations (up to 141 ng Prl/ml plasma). During days 8-9 of PSP Prl was secreted at irregular intervals (1 to 3 peaks/24 h) with peak levels of up to 400 ng Prl/ml plasma. On days 11-12 of PSP, Prl peaks were lacking almost completely: only a few minor elevations (up to 41 ng Prl/ml plasma) were measured. It is concluded that during days 0 to 10 of pseudopregnancy under constant light the endocrine state of the animals (in terms of LRH-responsiveness and P and DHP secretion) differs significantly from that during the previous and the following days. As similar changes are observed in PSP rats maintained under standard lighting conditions, it is apparent that the lighting conditions do not influence these changes. The pattern of Prl secretion during PSP, on the other hand is affected by the lighting conditions.

Ten women were between 18 and 25 weeks of pregnancy and 10 women were between 32 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. Blood for the hormone determinations was drawn at hourly intervals. A significant circadian progesterone rhythm was found with the nadir at 8.00 h and the peak around midnight. The progesterone rhythm showed a significant inverse relation to the cortisol rhythm (τ= -0.310). No difference was detected between the two groups for progesterone rhythm or its inverse relation to the cortisol rhythm.

AB  - Our investigations show that blindness, either natural or surgically induced results in a lack of fur priming and sexual development. Definite genetic color phase differences were observed in the sensitivities of the biological clocks for initiating fur priming, testicular development and time of breeding and whelping. Finely-bred dark mink molted and their pelts primed later in the fall than did either pastel or opaline mink. Testicular development was earlier and more extensive for the opaline, but was intermediate for the pastels and slower and least extensive for the finely-bred dark mink. The dark mink, however, bred earlier than did either the pastel and opaline strains. Hedlund (deaf, white) mink pelted about the same time as the pastels and opalines, but they bred and whelped later than the above three strains of mink. Plasma alpha-MSH levels were inversely related to testosterone levels and testicular development. It was high in all three strains (darks, pastels and opalines) during both the spring and autumnal molts, but was low during testicular development and breeding.

AB  - Pineal levels of melatonin exhibit a circadian rhythm in the rat. To determine if this rhythm varies during the estrous cycle, adult rats were sacrificed every 2 hr from 2000 hr (prior to lights off) until 0800 hr (2 hr after lights on) throughout each day of the 4-day estrous cycle. Pineal glands were assayed for melatonin by radioimmunoassay. A significant circadian rhythm in the pineal content of melatonin was evident each day of the cycle with peak levels exhibited during the dark phase. There were significant differences in titers of melatonin present at 0200, 0400, and 0600 hr between various stages of the cycle. In general, highest nighttime levels occurred during the evenings of metestrus and diestrus, with levels at a minimum on the evening of estrus. These data indicate that the circadian pineal melatonin rhythm is a function of estrous cycle stage in the rat, and, thus, important differences exist in the pineal biosynthetic dynamics of this species relative to those of seasonal breeders such as the hamster and sheep. Additionally, the results suggest that hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase, and not serotonin N-acetyltransferase, is the regulatory enzyme responsible for these estrous stage differences in pineal melatonin content. © 1982, SAGE Publications.

Nonpregnant controls were monitored over similar time periods. Pregnant animals produced more ultrasound than nonpregnant. The primary frequency component of the calls was 40 kHz. On the day of delivery, pregnant rats emitted significantly more ultrasound (15 to 60 kHz) than on the day preceding delivery. All rats produced some ultrasound which exhibited diurnal fluctuations. This ultrasound might be related to stress during labor or be a signal to conspecifics. © 1982 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The incidence and mortality from cutaneous melanoma have increased around the world in the past few decades. The exact cause of melanoma is unknown, but its epidemiological features strongly relate its occurrence to sun exposure. Evidence which supports the causal role of solar ultraviolet radiation is described, and factors which may also be important in the induction of melanoma are suggested.

Catecholamine sulphate levels were lowest at 0900 h. 3. In eight pre‐eclamptic hypertensives, plasma renin activity, and angiotensin II were suppressed. 4. Adrenaline sulphate levels were raised in hypertensives. 5. Four pre‐eclamptics with noctural hypertension had the highest blood pressures; their diurnal rhythm for noradrenaline sulphate was reversed but they showed no consistent pattern of pressor hormones. However failure of angiotensin II, adrenaline or noradrenaline to fall at night in subjects with increased vascular reactivity could contribute to their nocturnal hypertension.

AB  - Within 75 days of exposure to constant light (LL), the circadian activity rhythm of 21 of 32 hamsters had dissociated or 'split' into two distinct components. These components were labeled either evening (E) or morning (M) depending on whether they appeared to be derived from the E or M portion of the activity phase prior to the occurrence of 'splitting'. Both regular (i.e., 4-day) and irregular (i.e., non-4-day) cycles in lordosis behavior were observed in all of the animals with an intact activity rhythm and in 18 of the 21 animals with a split rhythm of activity. The onset of behavioral estrus always occurred near the time of the locomotor activity in animals with an intact activity rhythm. Among the females with a split activity rhythm, seven showed lordosis onsets only near the onset of the E component whereas five others began lordosis behavior only near the onset of the M component. Importantly, in five animals the onset of lordosis was associated on different days with either the E or M component. These results indicate that cycles in lordosis behavior persist even after the circadian rhythm of activity has dissociated into two components, and that at least one component of the estrous cycle, onset of lordosis behavior, can be coupled to either of two oscillators that underlie the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in hamsters.

AB  - The authors examined the effect of prednisolone-salium succinate administered on the 17th or 18th day of pregnancy on the adrenal function of newborn rats. They found that in doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg it does not affect physiological development or, respectively, the extent of the circadian rhythm or the stress response. However, the adrenal function of newborn animals was significantly inhibited by 30.0 mg/kg as regards its adaptability to extra-uterine life. The authors point out the importance of investigations to determine the adrenal function of newborns following steroid therapy to prevent RDS.

AB  - Mammary explants from virgin and pregnant Balb/c mice were incubated with 3H‐thymidine, and its incorporation into TCA‐precipitable material was determined. In addition, the labeling index of alveolar and ductal epithelial cells was determined by autoradiography. Incorporation of precursor into mammary tissue from pregnant animals was elevated above that of virgin animals on each day of pregnancy. During pregnancy, there were three periods of peak incorporation (on days 3, 7, and 11‐15). The labeling index of epithelial cells also increased during this period. Ductal cells had a peak labeling index on day 3 (3%), which dropped thereafter to comparatively low levels (3‐6%) for the rest of pregnancy. With the exception of days 1 and 3, the labeling index of ductal cells showed no difference between midnight and noon. Alveolar structures were first observed in histological preparations on day 5 of pregnancy. The labeling index of alveolar cells was higher than that of ductal cells during the rest of pregnancy, and on most days showed a diurnal fluctuation, being greater at midnight than at noon. The labeling index of alveolar cells had peak values at midnight on days 7 (23%) and 11‐13 (20%). This daily fluctuation in DNA synthesis by alveolar cells is a circadian rhythm; pregnant animals continued to show this rhythm after 13 days in constant darkness, and animals maintained on a reversed light schedule had a reversed rhythm. Mammary tissue shows a complex pattern of DNA synthesis during pregnancy, reflecting the different characteristics of ductal and alveolar epithelial cells.

AB  - A literature review reports the results of investigations about fetal intrauterine activity. Different methods of observation are demonstrated and discussed. The results indicate that real-time-ultrasound is an accurate method for observation of fetal movements. Different patterns are identified: Fetal body and extremity movements. Development of fetal activity in early pregnancy is looked at as a process of maturition associated with fetal cerebral function. After 12 weeks of pregnancy typical patterns are established and seen also in the following weeks. Different results are reported about frequency of fetal movements related to duration of pregnancy. A circadian rhythm seems to be associated with a peak in activity between 2100 and 0100 hours, although fetal activity is altered by a variety of drugs and external stimuli. The proportion of pathological foetal movements in early pregnancy seems higher in patients who aborted. There are findings in later pregnancy, which report good fetal outcome, if daily fetal movement recording is greater than 10 movements for 12 hours. Fetal breathing movements are recognized as being normally present, but episodic, shallow and variable in rate and regularity. There is a great variability in the percentage of time fetuses spend making breathing movements (mean 30-50% per hour; range 0-80%). Under physiological conditions there is a circadian rhythm concomitant with changes in fetal low-voltage electrocortical activity. The activation of fetal breathing occurs mainly during rapid-eye-movement-sleep, but the physiologic control of the activation has not been identified. Apnea, frequency, variability and amplitude of breathing, continuous breathing or gasping are described, but positive identification of abnormal pattern is not achieved. Several factors affecting fetal breathing movements have been described, their physiologic significance and control and their clinical relevance remain to be clearly elucidated. Total fetal activity. Fetal biophysical variables such as tone, breathing, body and extremity movements and heart rate reactivity are initiated and regulated by the fetal central nervous system, and as such, the presence of a given variable is indirect evidence of a functioning and intact central nervous system. These variable could be depressed by hypoxemia or other factors. Data in literature suggest that combined fetal biophysical testing is a more accurate method of antepartum fetal evaluation than any single method.

AB  - Neonatal corticoid treatment delays development of the circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone in rats. We therefore sought to determine whether fetal or neonatal exposure to ethanol, a substance which activates the hypothalamo - pituitary - adrenal axis, produces similar effects. Subjects were the offspring of dams fed a 5.0% w/v ethanol-containing liquid diet or pair-fed an isocaloric control diet during gestation weeks two and three or during postnatal week one. At birth (day 1), the fetal ethanol-exposed pups had significantly higher brain and plasma corticosterone levels than the pair-fed or normal controls; brain and body weights were unaffected. By day 3, brain and plasma corticosterone titers in the fetal ethanol-exposed pups declined to the levels of the pair-fed and normal controls, although brain weights were significantly reduced. Significantly higher p.m. than a.m. levels of plasma corticosterone first occurred on day 18 both in the fetal ethanol-exposed pups and in the pair-fed and normal controls. Thus, despite its causing elevated corticosterone levels at birth, fetal exposure to ethanol did not affect the onset of the pituitary - adrenal circadian rhythm. On the other hand, exposure to ethanol during the first neonatal week delayed the onset of the pituitary - adrenal rhythm from day 18 to day 21. However, even greater delays occurred in the neonatal pair-fed controls, suggesting that the delays following neonatal exposure were due to nutritional deficits rather than to alcohol per se. The developmental and long-term influences of elevated corticoid levels at birth in fetal ethanol-exposed rats on other aspects of pituitary - adrenal function remain to be determined. © 1982.

AB  - Physiological and behavioral reproductive changes in the female rat which occur under constant bright illumination (LL) are examined. The development of LL-induced persistent estrus (PE) is discussed first in relation to other conditions in which PE is displayed. Next, mechanisms are reviewed which may account for the LL-induced changes. These include: (1) role of the retina, the retinohypothalamic tract and the suprachiasmatic nucleus; (2) influence of adrenal, pineal and Harderian glands; and (3) disruptions in either the 4-day endocrine rhythms or circadian neural component of the estrous cycle. Additional topics which are examined include the ontogeny of age-induced PE and the effects of LL on hormone receptor binding, puberty, sexual receptivity and mating. © 1982.

AB  - A radioimmunological method for measuring saliva cortisol was worked out. It includes one extraction and one radiocompetitive reaction with an anticortisol 3-CMO:BSA immunoserum. Frequent values for saliva cortisol were determined in various physiological and pathological conditions and compared to plasma cortisol values. In adult men, the mean concentrations at 8 a.m. and midnight were respectively 14.50 ± 7.10 and 1.40 ± 1.21 nmol/I (x ± SD). In untreated women, plasma and saliva cortisol levels were not significantly different from those measured in women taking estroprogestative drugs or in pregnant women. Following stimulation by synthetic β1-24 ACTH (Synacthen®), the saliva cortisol determined 90 min after the 8 a.m. sampling rose by over 500% whereas plasma cortisol only rose by 120%. Similarly the drop in 8 a.m. cortisol, which followed midnight administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone was larger for saliva than for plasma cortisol. In patients with adrenal hyperactivity the circadian rhythm disappeared from saliva cortisol and patients with deficient adrenal activity displayed drastically reduced levels for saliva cortisol. Saliva cortisol seems thus to be more helpful to diagnosis than plasma cortisol. © 1982 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Summary. Serial plasma levels of human placental lactogen, human chorionic gonadotrophin, Schwangerschaftsprotein 1, and placental protein 5 (PP5) were examined over a 24‐h period in six subjects. All proteins showed random circadian variation, that of PP5 being considerably greater than the other three. There was no coherent pattern of fluctuation among the different proteins: the variation of each individual protein was completely independent of the others. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - A series of experiments in 2 strains of Wistar rats explored which aspects of maternal separation were responsible for the sleep disturbance of the young. Neither their own mother, after mammary duct ligation, nor constant intragastric infusion of nutrient during the day of separation were found to ameliorate significantly the changes in sleep‐wake state organization. However, a periodic nutrient delivery schedule and a formula closely resembling rat milk each ameliorated, and together entirely prevented, the sleep‐wake disturbance. Decreased ambient temperature during separation tended to exaggerate the disturbance and periodic tactile‐vestibular stimulation tended to reduce it. These findings suggest that the infant rat's normal sleep‐wake pattern is maintained by the thythmicity and composition of the milk delivered to it by its mother, although her warmth and behavioral interaction with it may play subsidiary roles. Separation produces its effects by removing these regulating features of the relationship. Copyright © 1982 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Studies in vitro suggest that pregnancy induced hypertension, or toxemia, is associated with decreased placental pros-taglandins E (PGE) levels. To validate this observation in vivo PGE were measured weekly in 24h urine collections, in a prospective cross-sectional study in 9 women from 7 to 40 weeks. In addition, urinary PGE levels were also measured in 28 hospitalized pregnant women with either chronic hypertension or toxemia. Prostaglandins E were measured by radioimmunoassay after organic extraction and silicic acid separation. Urinary PGE levels during pregnancy (normotensive and chronic hypertensive women) were significantly elevated than those of the non-pregnant state. Mean urinary PGE levels in toxemic patients were significantly decreased compared to those of normal pregnancy and patients with chronic hypertension but they were similar to the mean levels of the non-pregnant state. One fetal death attributed to aggravation of chronic hypertension and one eclampsia were associated with undetectable levels of maternal urinary PGE. In conclusion, normal pregnancy is associated with a significant increase of urinary PGE; chronic hypertension and occurence of toxemia are associated with significant diminution of urinary PGE excretion. © 1982 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Abstract. Measurement of the percentage incidence of fetal breathing and gross body movements as well as of maternal blood glucose concentration was carried out in 12 insulin‐dependent diabetic pregnant women and 12 normal controls between 33 and 37 weeks of gestation. The observation period was related to the three meal times. In diabetics no diurnal variation in pre‐prandial fetal breathing activity was observed whereas in normal controls fetal breathing incidence was significantly higher before evening dinner than before breakfast. Immediately following lunch and dinner, fetal breathing demonstrated a significantly lower incidence in diabetics than in normals. Since no significant difference in maternal blood glucose concentration was found between the two groups, it is suggested that other factors relative to carbohydrate metabolism may also be involved in the regulation of fetal breathing in diabetes. Fetal gross body activity in diabetics vs. normals did not differ essentially and demonstrated no correlation with the maternal blood glucose levels. 1982 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

During the course of pregnancy, a first period of hyperphagia was observed (days 2-12) irrespective of the composition of the diet. A second phase of hyperphagia occurred later (days 16-19) which was more marked with the better balanced diet (16% protein). During the first half of pregnancy, the increase in intake occurred principally at the beginning of the night (compensatory reaction). Later on, the stimulation extended to the last part of the night (anticipatory reaction). The nocturnal predominance of feeding activity was maintained in pregnant females in spite of their increased metabolic requirements. © 1982 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Parameters of cortisol metabolism were studied in pregnancy and early post partum and in non pregnant women. Total serum cortisol was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay and its unbound- and CBG-bound fractions by equilibrium dialysis at 37°C. CBG was measured directly, by an immunodiffusion method (true CBG) and indirectly, by the Scatchard analysis of its interaction with labelled cortisol (Pτ). During pregnancy the increases in true CBG and total cortisol concentrations were grossly parallel but the Pτ/true CBG ratio fell from almost 1 in non-pregnant and delivered women to 0.6 during the second half of pregnancy. At 6 p.m., unbound cortisol was significantly higher in outpatients during the 2d half of pregnancy than in non pregnant controls (0.017 vs 0.009 10-6 mol/l). In hospitalized resting patients, unbound cortisol concentrations were the same in pregnant and non pregnant women except for a significantly higher level of unbound cortisol at midnight during the second half of pregnancy. Circadian variations of cortisol secretion persisted throughout pregnancy. It is concluded that in pregnancy (1) hypothalamic control of maternal adrenal secretion still prevails, (2) the increase in total cortisol is essentially due to that of CBG, (3) the unbound cortisol is normal or, at times, slightly increased and (4) variations in the Pτ/true CBG ratios may be explained by the presence of steroids (progesterone and 17-OH-progesterone) with a high affinity for CBG. The physiological significance of the mild hypercortisolism of pregnancy is discussed. © 1982.

AB  - Photoreceptor cells in guinea pig retinas begin to shed their outer segments while developing in utero. To ascertain whether phagocytosis of outer segments in the fetus is a cyclical event like that of mature animals, large phagosomes in fetal retinal pigment epithelial cells were counted at representative times during a 24 hr period. These data were then compared with similar data obtained from the pregnant dams. Gravid animals and fetuses both showed a burst of shedding after the onset of illumination. Shedding was well initiated in the pregnant animals 30 min after the onset of illumination but was delayed for 2 to 3 hr in their fetuses. Thereafter the two patterns of phagocytosis showed substantial differences. Congruent cyclical patterns could be discerned, however, by graphing fetal counts with an advance of 10 hr on the time scale relative to that of the gravid animals. The results presented here represent the first indication of a cyclical pattern of phagocytosis in a population of fetuses during retinal development.

AB  - Lipid interference in the radioimmunoassay of steroids can cause an apparent variation in post-prandial serum concentrations of unconjugated estriol. The effects of increased concentrations of dextran-coated charcoal (15-60 g/l) in the radioimmunoassay of estriol standards with and without triglycerides were studied. All concentrations of dextran-coated charcoal used in this study eliminated the previously observed effects of estriol-lipid partitioning. When we used similar concentrations of dextran-coated charcoal, we found that serum cortisol levels in pregnant women declined significantly during the day (P < 0.001), but no significant variation in estriol concentrations was observed. These results indicate that the previously reported diurnal variation in serum unconjugated estriol concentrations attributed to steroid-lipid partitioning can be eliminated by increasing the concentration of dextran-coated charcoal in assays using this method of separation. © 1982.

AB  - Larval cultures of the flesh-fly Sarcophaga argyrostoma maintained in circadian 'resonance' experiments produced a high incidence of pupal diapause when the period of the light cycle was close to (T) 24, 48 or 72 hr, but a low incidence of diapause at T 36, 60 or 84 hr. Cultures pre-programmed for diapause by exposing pregnant females to long nights indicated the induction of non-diapause development at T 36, 60 and 84, whereas cultures pre-programmed for diapause-free development by exposing females to continuous light indicated the induction of diapause at T 24, 48 and 72. Raising the temperature reduced the heights of the diapause peaks whereas lowering the temperature raised them. With progeny from long-night-reared flies the lowest temperature tested (18°C) produced a result indistinguishable from an 'hour-glass' response, warning that 'negative' resonance experiments may merely indicate non-permissive conditions for demonstrating the involvement of circadian rhythmicity in insect photoperiodism. The results of the 'resonance' experiments and the effects of temperature are interpreted in terms of a multioscillator 'external coincidence-photoperiodic counter' model for the clock. © 1982.

AB  - Plasma LH, FSH, and prolactin were measured in middle-aged (7- to 9-month-old) breeder and young (3-4 month old) female rats on proestrus. Sixty-eight percent of the middle-aged rats exhibited regular 4-day estrous cycles; the remainder showed irregular cycles 4-7 days in length. All young rats exhibited at least two consecutive 4-day cycles prior to use. The right atria of all rats were cannulated under ether anesthesia between 0700 and 0800 hr (14:10 light-dark cycle, lights on at 0400 hr). Blood was drawn at 0900 hr and at hourly intervals from 1200 to 2200 hr; each rat was bled a maximum of nine times. Plasma LH and FSH rose significantly later and peak concentrations were significantly lower in middle-aged rats. Baseline prolactin concentrations at 0900 and 2000-2200 hr were significantly higher in middle-aged female rats. These data indicate that alterations in the proestrous gonadotropin and prolactin surges occur early during the aging process in the female rat. Such changes may be important in the age-related transition to estrous acyclicity. © 1982, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diurnal changes in percents of inorganic phosphorus in plasma were measured in three Holstein cows fitted with indwelling jugular catheters. Blood was sampled 34 times over 48 h. Changes of inorganic phosphorus of blood plasma appeared to be related to patterns of feed consumption. In a second experiment, effects of diet, season of calving, stage of lactation, lactation number, and milk yield on inorganic phosphorus of plasma and milk were measured with 40 Holstein cows. Dietary treatments were 1.0% calcium, .31% phosphorus; 1.0% and .54%; 1.8% and .30%; 1.7% and .54%. Blood and milk samples were taken at wk 6 postpartum and every 5th wk thereafter. Inorganic phosphorus in plasma and milk was higher for cows in first lactation than multiparous cows. Cows which calved in November to December had the highest inorganic phosphorus in plasma but the lowest in milk. Month of year affected inorganic phosphorus in milk but not in plasma. Inorganic phosphorus in plasma increased as milk yields decreased and as inorganic phosphorus in milk decreased. Dietary phosphorus affected inorganic phosphorus in plasma but not in milk. The correlation between inorganic phosphorus in milk and plasma was —.15. These data indicate the limitations of using inorganic phosphorus in plasma or milk as sole or primary means of determining nutritional phosphorus status of lactating cows. © 1982, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - Prolactin and growth hormone were measured in blood plasma at 30-min intervals for three consecutive 24-h periods in 6 cows during midlactation. Concentrations of prolactin in milk and yields of milk also were quantified. Prolactin in blood plasma appeared to have a 24-h rhythm as well as a 6-h rhythm by time series spectral analysis. Lowest prolactin occurred between 0600 and 0900 h each day, whereas maximums occurred between 1030 and 1600 h. Neither milk prolactin concentration nor yield of milk differed between milkings at 0530 and 1730 h. Concentration of prolactin in milk was not significantly correlated with prolactin concentration of plasma. However, prolactin of plasma averaged over the 12-h prior to milking was associated significantly with yield of milk and with total quantity of milk prolactin removed at that milking. © 1982, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - Changes in srum prolactin and luteinizing hormone concentrations and dopamine (DA) neuronal activity in selected brain regions were determined over a 24-hour period in pregnant, pseudopregnant, and diestrus rats. On day 6 of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy, blood samples were collected for analysis of prolactin and luteinizing hormone. On day 7 the DA neuronal activity was estimated by measuring the rate of accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in median eminence, corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and posterior pituitary after the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor. For animals in diestrus, DOPA accumulation was determined on the corresponding day of the cycle which followed the collection of blood samples. Two daily surges of prolactin were observed in pregnant and pseudopregnant but not in diestrus rats. Similarly, biphasic changes in the rate of DOPA accumulation were observed in the median eminence, but not in other brain regions, of pregnant and pseudopregnant rats, while there were no changes in diestrus rats. To further characterize the temporal relationship between tuberoinfundibular DA neurons and prolactin secretion during pregnancy, changes in serum prolactin concentrations, DOPA accumulation in the median eminence, and the concentration of DA in the anterior pituitary (another possible index of tuberoinfundibular DA neuronal activity) were examined throughout days 2, 6. and 13 of pregnancy. Over the 24-hour periods of days 2 and 6 of pregnancy there were two surges of serum prolactin concentrations and a biphasic variation in both the rate of DOPA accumulation in the median eminence and the concentration of DA in the anterior pituitary. By contrast, on day 13th serum prolactin concentrations did not change, and both indices of tuberoinfundibular DA neuronal activity remained constantly elevated throughout the 24-hour period. These results suggest that there may be a relationship between the surges of prolactin and tuberoinfundibular DA neuronal activity during pregnancy and pseudopregnancy: When prolactin secretion is increased, the tuberoinfundibular DA neuronal activity is low and vice versa. In addition, when the surges of prolactin secretion cease during midpregnancy and prolactin concentrations are decreased, the tuberoinfundibular DA nerve activity is continuously elevated. © 1982 S.

AB  - After stimulation of the uterine cervix of the rat, a nocturnal PRL surge that is responsible for pseudopregnancy is initiated and maintained daily. This study was designed to determine the midbrain pathways for the neural control of the initiation and maintenance of the nocturnal PRL surge in pseudopregnant rats. Cervical stimulation, applied in the evening of proestrus, initiated a nocturnal PRL surge in the early morning of estrus. Neural transections, when placed in the ventromedial or lateral part of the midbrain before cervical stimulation, completely suppressed the nocturnal surge, whereas sham transections or transections in the dorsal part of the midbrain did not eliminate the nocturnal surge. On the other hand, in rats that received sham transections in the evening on day 5 of pseudopregnancy previously induced by cervical stimulation, a nocturnal PRL surge was observed in the early morning on day 6. None of transections in the ventromedial, lateral, or dorsal part of the midbrain placed in the evening on day 5 of pseudopregnancy affected the nocturnal surge on day 6. These results suggest that the initiation of the nocturnal PRL surge by cervical stimulation requires the neural components that are contained in the ventromedial and lateral parts of the midbrain. In contrast, the maintenance of the nocturnal surge possibly occurs independent of neural afferents from the midbrain.

AB  - This study describes the influence of ovarian steroids and a putative PRL release inhibitory substance of uterine origin on the imprint provided by cervical stimulation (CS) for the maintenance of nocturnal and diurnal surges of PRL secretion. Toward the end of the pseudopregnancy (psp) resulting from a sterile mating or artificial stimulation of the uterine cervix, ovarian estradiol secretion is enhanced, and luteal progesterone (P) secretion wanes. This shifting ratio terminates the surges of PRL by day 13 of psp. Ovariectomy on day 8 of psp and simulation of this pattern of steroid secretion with sc Silastic implants also resulted in termination of surges by day 13. However, ovariectomy on days 2, 4, or 6, followed immediately by implantation of the inhibitory regimen of ovarian steroids, did not result in termination of the noctural surge by days 7, 9, or 11, respectively. The diurnal surge was absent in all cases. A third and fourth CS applied on days 7 and 8 of psp were not able to overcome the effects of the inhibitory steroid regimen begun on day 8. PRL surges induced in ovariectomized rats by one 30-sec CS persist for 6 days (suboptimal stimulation), while surges induced by two 30-sec CS persist for at least 10 days (optimal). However, implantation o P or hysterectomy permits suboptimally stimulated ovariectomized rats to secrete nocturnal surges through day 10. These data indicate that optimal CS programs the PRL-releasing apparatus to secrete surges for a preset interval, during which time the system remains unresponsive to physiological inhibitory and excitatory input. However, suboptimal CS can be reinforced by imposition of P or removal of PRL inhibitory activity of uterine origin.

AB  - The goals of this study were to examine the effects of 0, 50, and 100 rad of 60Co administered prenatally on postnatal development of neuromuscular coordination, visual discrimination learning, spontaneous light-dark stabilimeter activity, plasma cortisol, and somatometric growth rates of diurnal squirrel monkeys from birth to 90 days. In terms of accuracy, completeness, and time required for performance of reflexes and neuromuscular coordination, the performance of 50- and 100-rad offspring was less accurate and poorly coordinated and required more time for completion compared to that of controls. In visual orientation, discrimination, and reversal learning, the percentage correct responses of the 50- and 100-rad offspring were significantly lower than those of controls. Spontaneous light-dark stabilimeter activity of 50 and 100-rad offspring was significantly higher in the dark session than that of controls. Plasma cortisol was significantly higher in 100-rad infants than in controls. Comparisons of somatometric growth rates indicates that postnatal head circumference, crown-rump length, and to a lesser extent body weight increased at significantly slower rates in 50 and 100-rad offspring. These findings should provide essential information for formulating and carrying out multivariate behavioral, biochemical, and morphometric assessments of low-dose effects on the brain of primate offspring within demonstrable dose-response curves.

AB  - PRL and testosterone (T) levels were measured in mice mated during the postpartum estrus and permitted to nurse 10 pups. Various delays in implantation were induced by separating females from their pups either on day 0 (the day of vaginal plug detection) or on day 4, 6, or 8, which resulted in implantation on day 4, 6, 8, or 10, respectively. Trunk blood was collected after decapitation during the times diurnal PRL surges were expected to occur (3 days after implantation) or to have disappeared (5 days after implantation). When implantation occurred on day 4 (pups removed on day 0 of lactational pregnancy), the diurnal PRL surge was present on day 7 but absent on day 9 as predicted. When implantation was delayed, diurnal PRL surges were expressed on the third day after implantation but, without exception, had terminated by the fifth day after nidation. Regardless of the day of implantation (day 4, 6, 8, or 10 after mating), increased T secretion was always associated with the cessation of the diurnal PRL surge. A second experiment examined the effects of Silastic implants of T on PRL surges. Elevated blood T levels did not disrupt the biphasic pattern of PRL release unless a pharmacological dose of T was given. Thus, the simultaneous occurrence of increased T production and the disappearance of PRL surges is a reflection of the stage of placental-fetal maturation rather than a direct effect of T on PRL secretion. Association of elevated blood T levels with the degree of placental-fetal development suggests placental regulation of androgen production at midgestation. The disappearance of PRL surges on tjie same day T secretion increases supports the idea that product(s) of the conceptus simultaneously control pituitary and ovarian function during the period that pituitary stimulation of luteal activity is relinquished to the placenta. © 1982 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The effects of melatonin feeding on serum PRL and gonadotropin concentrations and on the reproductive activity of seasonally anestrous sheep were examined. Ten maiden Border Leicester X Merino ewes (18 months) were acclimatized to 16 h of light daily (from 0300–1900 h) for 4 weeks. Five of the animals were then fed pellets treated with melatonin (2 mg/ day); the remainder received untreated pellets daily at 1100 h for 103 days. Seventeen days after the commencement of treatment, serum PRL levels were found to be significantly lower between 1500–1900 h and 2400–0800 h (P < 0.05) in the melatonin- fed group compared to untreated animals. By day 31 and on all subsequent occasions tested up to day 99, serum PRL levels were lower (P < 0.01) in the melatonin-fed animals throughout the entire 8-h sampling period (0900–1700 h). The feeding of melatonin had no apparent effect on the baseline serum levels of either FSH or LH, the frequency and amplitude of the LH peaks, or the changes evoked in serum PRL after the administration of 10 g TRH. However, melatonin may have affected the hypothalamo-pituitary response to the positive feedback effect of estradiol. When tested after 52 days, the LH and FSH responses of the melatonin-treated animals to an injection of 12.5 g 17β-estradiol were significantly diminished (P < 0.05) compared with controls. After the administration of estradiol (day 53) and the introduction of a ram (day 71), the five melatonin- fed ewes commenced cyclic ovarian activity on days 65, 65, 73, 81, and 88, respectively, compared to days 78 and 97, after day 103, after day 103, and after day 103 in the five untreated control ewes, respectively. These results indicate that melatonin administered orally to seasonally anestrous sheep induced changes in circulating PRL and influenced the time of onset of the breeding season. © 1982 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - A series of experiments were designed to examine the effects of diet and photoperiod upon the onset of sexual maturity in the ewe. In Experiment I, March-born ewe lambs (n=77) were reared from 9 to 28 weeks of age on two levels of dietary energy and three photoperiods consisting of ambient light (May-November), artificial long (16L:8D) and artificial short (8L:16D) days. Ambient temperature was not controlled. At 22 weeks of age, some of the lambs (n=22) reared in artificial photoperiods were induced to ovulate with progesterone and pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Lambs originally given the low energy diet were switched to the high energy diet at 28 weeks of age. The onset of puberty was not influenced by photoperiods, but was affected by diet. By 28 weeks of age the number of lambs ovulating (24/26 vs. 9/29) and the body weight at first ovulation (43.7 ± 1.2 kg vs. 36.7 ± 1.4 kg) were greater (P<0.01) for lambs given the high energy diet. Following dietary switchover of lambs on the low energy diet, the percentage of lambs ovulating increased from 31% to 65% within 31 ± 10 days. Lambs ovulating after dietary switchover weighed 38.8 ± 2.0 kg, while lambs which remained nonpubertal weighed only 29.0 ± 1.5 kg (n=10) by the end of the study. A reduction in growth rate in lambs fed the low energy diet was associated with reduced (P<0.05) plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. Neither diet nor photoperiod altered the number of lambs (20/22) ovulating following PMSG treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate an effect of diet upon the attainment of puberty. The results suggest that the growth effect may be mediated via changes in LH secretion. Since first ovulation occurred rather synchronously in the fall, regardless of photoperiod control, other factors such as temperature or endogenous rhythms are implicated in timing sexual maturity.

AB  - In order to elucidate the role of hypothalamic amines in controlling the diurnal (D) and nocturnal (N) surges of prolactin (PRL) induced by cervical stimulation, chronological relationships between dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin concentrations in the hypothalamus and PRL concentrations in the anterior pituitary and plasma were studied in pseudopregnant (PSP) rats. In addition, the effects of diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DDC), an inhibitor of dopamine-β-hydroxylase, and DL-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, on two PRL surges were also investigated. Rats were made pseudopregnant by cervical stimulation performed at 10.00 hr on estrus (Day 0). The concentrations of NE, DA and serotonin in the hypothalamus and PRL in the anterior pituitary and plasma were determined every two hours between 15.00 hr on diestrus 1 and 13.00 hr on diestrus 2 of the estrous cycle and during the corresponding periods of PSP. D-and N-surges of PRL in the PSP rats were clearly observed at 19.00 hr on Day 1 and at 07.00 hr on Day 2 of PSP, respectively. During the diestrus 1 and 2 stages of the estrous cycle, PRL concentrations in the anterior pituitary were consistently low and unvarying. In contrast to this, a marked increase in the concentration of PRL in the anterior pituitary was observed during the corresponding period of PSP, just after the D- and N-surges of PRL. Hypothalamic NE concentrations increased during the D-surge of PRL in normal cyclic rats as well as in PSP rats, while in PSP rats, an additional increase in hypothalamic NE concentrations was observed during the initial stage of N-surge of PRL. Serotonin concentrations in the hypothalamus were significantly higher in PSP rats than in normal cyclic rats during the N-surge of PRL. DA concentrations in the hypothalamus significantly decreased during the D-surge of PRL in PSP rats, whereas those of PSP rats as well as normal cyclic rats markedly increased during the N-surge of PRL. These results suggest a possibility that these hypothalamic amines may have an important role on the occurrence of the D- and N-surges of PRL in PSP rats. DDC injected intraperitoneally (500mg/kg) at 12.00 or 21.00 hr on Day 1 of PSP produced a dramatic decrease in NE concentrations in the hypothalamus. Under these conditions, initiation of both D- and N-surges of PRL was significantly suppressed, whereas the magnitude and peak time of each surge were the same as those of normal PSP rats. PCPA injected intraperitoneally (250mg/kg) at 12.00 hr on estrus of PSP also produced a dramatic decrease in serotonin concentrations in the hypothalamus, but the N-surge of PRL was only partially suppressed. PRL concentrations in the anterior pituitary were normal in these DDC- or PCPA-treated animals during the time period observed. These results suggest that hypothalamic NE and serotonin are essential for the occurrence of D- and N-surges of PRL, but they have a facilitatory effect on hypothalamic neural mechanisms inducing PRL release in response to the cervical stimulation

AB  - The effect of sleep state on the respiratory response to hypercapnia was studied in 14 chronic fetal sheep, 125-140 days gestation. Fetal PaCO2 was raised by 11 to 34 Torr by gradually increasing the maternal FICO2 to 0.09. Fetal sleep state was monitored. Fetal breathing (FB) was analysed in terms of frequency (f), tracheal pressure (TP) and ventilation equivalent (VEq) = ΣTP/min. In 16 out of 17 experiments on apneic fetuses in NREM sleep, the fetuses switched to REM sleep and in 14 instances began to breathe with 21 2 min thereafter. The PaCO2 at which apneic fetuses started breathing was 54.8 ± 8.4 Torr (x ± SD). In 4 out of 10 trials on breathing fetuses in REM sleep the fetuses switched to NREM sleep and stopped breathing before removal of the CO2 stimulus. During REM sleep hypercapnia stimulated FB by an increase in TP and by a reduction in the number and duration of apneic pauses. It is concluded that in the fetal lamb CO2 stimulates breathing only during REM sleep and that this stimulus is superimposed on the basic mechanism that stimulates spontaneous FB during this sleep state. © 1982.

AB  - Cyclic patterns of active and quiet fetal activity were evaluated in 36 clinically normal gravidas between 27 and 42 weeks of gestation. All infants were subsequently delivered between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation, were clinically normal and of appropriate weight for gestational age. Active-quiet cycles occurred less frequently and were of longer duration with increasing gestational age. Regression analysis of the number of active-quiet cycles with gestational age yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.52 (p < 0.01). The similarity of fetal active-quiet cycles and active and quiet sleep cycles observed after birth is noted.

AB  - Sleep spindles, as defined in the international electroencephalography (EEG) glossary, are distinguished from spindle bursts seen in the EEGs of premature infants. Classical sleep spindles do not occur in prematures. They first appear clearly in the EEG during slow wave sleep from the 4th week postterm (44 weeks conceptional age) and are normally present in all infants' EEGs by 9 weeks postterm. During the first year of life they may be of high voltage relative to their appearance in older children and adults and are commonly characterized by variable degrees of interhemispheric asymmetry and asynchrony. Individual differences are great. Some features of clinical significance are discussed.

AB  - This paper calls attention to a relatively unnoticed problem, i.e., morbidity in neonates caused by treatment of pregnant women with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (Anafranil). The authors report 2 neonates born to mothers treated throughout pregnancy with clomipramine because of an endogenous depression (200 mg daily in case 1 and 100 mg daily in case 2). Both babies were delivered without complications at term after otherwise uneventful pregnancies. Respiratory acidosis, cyanosis, tachypnea and tremor appeared soon after birth. Phenobarbitone therapy proved efficient in controlling the neurologic symptoms and may have induced hepatic enzymes needed to metabolize clomipramine. Treatment with tricyclic antidepressants in late pregnancy appears to have a well defined ill effect on the neonate, and therefore should be avoided, if possible.

AB  - Alterations in thermoregulatory mechanisms related to sleep state may play an important role in the problems of homeostasis experienced by the premature infant. In the adult, homeothermic regulation of body temperature may be suspended during REM. We measured oxygen consumption (V02) in six premature infants 33-35 wk gestation both at thermoneutrality and during a mild thermal stress to determine whether thermoregulatory responses were intact during REM sleep. All infants were studied under radiant warmers. Skin temperature was allowed to fall 7-8 times during a 6-8 h study period while V02, VCO2, heart rate and TcPO2 were continuously recorded. Sleep state was scored using EEG, EOG, EMG and behavioral criteria. A total of 1,162 one- min epochs were scored. In all states including REM, VO2 was significantly higher during the cool periods. The mean increases: 21.5%, 23.3%, 11.1% and 5.3% for Awake, Indeterminate, REM and NREM respectively. When REM and NREM were compared at thermoneutrality, there was no difference in the V02 (8.80 ± 0.11 and 8.93 ± 0.15 cc/kg/min, mean ± S.E., for REM and NREM, respectively). We conclude that in contrast to the adult, active thermoregulation occurs in the premature infant during REM sleep. Speculation: In the adult, the reason for temporary poikilothermy during REM sleep is unknown. Some have considered this phenomenon a regression to a phylogenetically primitive condition which is necessary for normal hypothalamic function. Because the newborn period is characterized by profound ontogenic change, it is reasonable to speculate that the difference we observed between the premature and the adult is due to a developmental phenomenon. We further suggest that this developmental process may serve to protect the premature infant during REM sleep from extended periods of poikilothermy. © 1982 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - ABSTRACT. A description is first given of respiratory activity in the fetus and its control. Evidence suggests that when the fetus makes respiratory movements, it is in a state comparable to REM sleep in the newborn and adult and that in the alternating periods of apnoea, it is in quiet sleep. It does not appear that the respiratory movements are normally regulated by chemical or reflex, e. g. Hering Breuer, inputs though they are enhanced by CO2 and depressed by hypoxia. In the apnoeic periods, breathing movements are virtually impossible to elict by chemical or reflex means. Evidence from examination of peripheral inputs indicates that: the carotid body chemoreceptors are inhibited at receptor level, stimulation of the aortic chemoreceptors affects the circulation only and although pulmonary stretch receptors are active and are excited by inflation of the fetal lung, such inflation does not affect discharge in medullary respiratory units or phrenic nerve. Since there is no real evidence of immaturity of the respiratory system in late gestation and since chemical and most reflex inputs appear to provide an adequate stimulus, it is most probable that the periods of apnoea are caused by an inhibitory process, possibly of supra‐pontine origin which acts close to medullary respiratory units and effectively inhibits the operation of the automatic component. This inhibitory process may operate periodically; or continuously and be periodically overridden in REM sleep. After birth, breathing is normally continuous and sensitive to lung inflation, CO2 and after a variable delay, to hypoxia. This may be due to the lifting of the inhibitory process allowing activation of the automatic component. However, there is evidence that even in normal, full term infants, full maturation of the automatic component is not complete until about three months of age and in the meanwhile, breathing tends to be imperfectly regulated and subject to damped oscillations when disturbed.

The main symptoms are frequent vomiting or diarrhea, hyperpyrexia, moderate or severe irritability and tremors, inability to sleep between feedings, and clinically apparent convulsions. Physicians caring for such high-risk infants should recognize the potential seriousness of this problem.

AB  - Electrocorticographic activity (ECoG) was recorded from the frontal cortex of unanaesthetized, lactating rabbits, and analysed in relation to the suckling behaviour of the animals. Suckling lasted 2-5 minutes each day and was always associated with a desynchronized ECoG. Milk ejection was never seen during slow wave sleep. Mild sedation of the doe caused a dose-dependent block of milk yield but did not affect her willingness to suckle and the ECoG was desynchronized during nursing. In contrast to the rat, but similar to the pig, sleep is not a prerequisite for reflex milk ejection in the rabbit. Evidence presented implies that ECoG arousal may be important for this reflex in the rabbit. © 1982.

AB  - Respiratory studies were conducted on newborn puppies chronically exposed to α-l-acetylmethadol ·HCl (LAAM) during portions of gestation. Bitches received daily oral doses of LAAM from the second week through the sixth week of pregnancy (LAAM-6) or through the end of a 9-week prenancy (LAAM-9), but not after parturition. LAAM-9 pups displayed narcotic abstinence signs during the first week after birth, while LAAM-6 pups did not. LAAM-9 pups had increased tidal volume, respiratory frequency, alveolar ventilation and O2-consumption and decreased alveolar CO2-tension during the first week of life compared to placebo-treated controls. The LAAM-9 CO2-response curve was significantly displaced to the left of control. These data are consistent with relative hyperventilation during neonatal withdrawal from LAAM. LAAM-6 pups had decreased tidal volume and alveolar ventilation during 4 of the 6 weeks studied. These changes in ventilation were associated with a decrase in O2 consumption. By 6 weeks after birth CO2-responses curves of both LAAM-9 and LAAM-6 pups were shifted to the right of control. These changes in CO2-responsiveness suggest the possibility of prolonged disturbances of respiratory control which may continue beyond the sixth week of life. © 1982.

AB  - We studied the effects of prenatal treatment with phenytoin (PHT) on the functional development of the rat brain. Pregnant rats were injected with varying doses (10, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg) of PHT on days 1-21, 1-10, 14—21 or day 15 of pregnancy. There was no significant difference in the sleeping effect of pentobarbital, ataxic effect of diazepam, or seizure effect of pentetrazol between control-F1 and PHT-F1 rats. Prenatal treatment with PHT on days 1-21 of pregnancy induced a marked increase in the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in the male and female F1 rats when tested once a week, beginning on the 9th week and until the 13th week after birth. Hypersensitivity to haloperidol was induced to a greater extent in females. On the other hand, prenatal treatment with PHT on days 14-21 or on day 15 of pregnancy induced a decline in the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in both male and female F1 rats. There was no significant alteration in the growth of the PHT-F1 rats. However, their eye opening was accelerated. The present results suggest that prenatal exposure to phenytoin induces long-lasting alterations in the dopaminergic and/or other neurons related to the manifestation of cataleptic behavior in the rat brain. © 1982, The Japanese Pharmacological Society.

AB  - Summary. Fourier analysis was applied to episodes of high and low heart‐rate variation in the near‐term fetus. The spectral densities of the variations in pulse intervals from 1 to 7 cycles/min, were almost identical with those found by De Haan et al. (1977) in the newborn infant during both active and quiet sleep. A computer programme, designed to separate low and high heart‐rate variation episodes in the fetus, identified seven of the eight quiet sleep episodes in four infants. None of the other neonatal behavioural states had low heart‐rate variation. It was concluded that, with other published data, there is increasing, although indirect, evidence that low heart‐rate variation episodes indicate quiet sleep in the human fetus near term.

AB  - Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator in a number of vascular beds including the uterus. However, the role of prostacyclin in maintaining uterine blood flow during pregnancy is not well established. Recent reports have appeared suggesting that tranylcypromine can selectively inhibit prostacyclin synthesis. Thus, the present study was undertaken using an unanesthetized chronically catheterized pregnant sheep preparation to evaluate the effects of direct intra-arterial infusions of tranylcypromine on the uterine vasculature of late-term pregnant ewes. Infusions of 1, 3 and 10 mg/min of tranylcypromine led to dose-related reduction in uterine blood flow (16, 21 and 47 percent, respectively) and increased blood pressure (7, 10 and 23 percent, respectively). However, these alterations were not associated with reductions in the uterine production rates of the prostacyclin metabolite, 6-keto-PGF1α, as determined by unextracted plasma RIA. In addition, pre-treatment of animals with the α-adrenergic blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine, almost totally abolished uterine and systemic blood pressure responses to tranylcypromine. These data suggest that tranylcypromine either releases or elevates levels of an alpha adrenergic stimulant which constricts the uterine and systemic vasculature and does not alter prostacyclin levels at the dose tested. © 1982.

AB  - A cross‐sectional survey of female office workers in South Australia was initiated to compare the general health experiences of visual display unit (VDU) operators with those of other keyboard workers. Additionally, a matched casecontrol study, generated from the cross‐sectional survey, examined claims of a relationship between VDU exposure and spontaneous abortions. Although poor sleep and nervousness appeared to be significantly associated with the use of VDUs there appeared to be no relationship with nervousness after controlling for other measured risk factors such as age and employer. VDU use was the only statistically significant predictor variable for dizziness and poor sleep, although the statistical significance was marginal. Results of the case‐control analysis, provided little evidence that the operation of VDUs during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. 1982 Public Health Association of Australia

AB  - A non-stress test was applied to 186 women with high-risk pregnancy, and an oxytocin provocation test was added immediately. Increased frequency or acceleration of foetal heart rate accompanied by foetal movement was defined as 'reactive' and interpreted as good condition of the foetus. Absence of accelerations adequate in number and magnitude within 30 minutes from testing was considered as alarming. Such tests were defined 'non-reactive'. Such situations could be attributed to temporary hypoxia or sleep of the foetus. Both the number of positive oxytocin provocation tests and perinatal morbidity were higher with significance (p<0.001) in the 'non-reactive' group. One perinatal death occurred in that group. The non-stress test proved to be a non-invasive, harmless method and highly reliable for screening of women for high-risk pregnancy. It enabled better economy of cost and time and in the use of equipment.

AB  - Investigations were performed to explore changes in fetal toxicity induced by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in pregnant animals treated by various means for maternal alterations. The fetotoxicity induced by ASA (500 mg/kg s.c.) was higher in rats than in mice. In mice with low enzyme activity, those displaying a longer sleeping time in pentobarbital-induced sleep, the ASA-fetotoxicity was higher than that of mice with shorter sleeping time. In rats pretreated with phenobarbital (0.05%), Zn (10 mg/l) and Cu (10 mg/l) in tap water and cysteine (200 mg/kg s.c.), fetal toxicity of ASA was reduced, whereas it was enhanced in rats pretreated with SKF-525A (20 mg/kg s.c.) and α-naphthyl acetic acid (200 mg/kg p.o.) and in nephrectomized rats. The UDPGT activity in hepatic 9000xg supernate was higher in mice than in rats and the activity of mice was increased by phenobarbital and Cu. This study indicates that ASA-induced fetotoxicity can be positively modified by alterations in drug metabolizing activity.

AB  - The effect of in utero exposure to drugs of abuse on certain neurological and behavioral characteristics of the newborn was studied in 10 infants of drug-dependent mothers. Fourteen newborns of mothers not receiving drugs served as matched controls. Infants exposed to drugs of abuse during fetal life exhibited a high level of arousal and irritability, and extreme muscle tone fluctuations-i.e., a predominant hypertonicity (rigidity) alternating with short periods of a very low tone (flaccidity). These newborns were also highly active, tremulous, and motorically immature, and displayed near-constant crying and disturbed sleep patterns. However, their orientation to external stimuli and the findings on neurological examination were similar to those of control neonates. © 1982 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - The product of the permeability × vascular surface rate area (PA) of the blood-brain barrier to [14C]sucrose has been measured in rats raised on synthetic diets in which the saturated/unsaturated fat constitution was controlled at high or low levels. Gas-liquid chromatography demonstrated marked differences in brain fatty acid constitution between the dietary groups. No statistically significant difference was found between the permeability measurements in rats maintained on any of the synthetic diets. nor was there any difference from rats raised on a standard laboratory pellet food. The opportunity was taken to look at 3 other properties of brain that might be affected by lipid constitution. There was no change in the form of the membranous intracellular inclusions that can be induced by intracerebral injections of suramin, and Fink-Heimer staining of degenerating axons, which is inhibited by fat extraction, worked equally well on each diet group. The sleep time after an anaesthetic injection of alcohol was not significantly changed. © 1982.

AB  - The present study was made to investigate the developmental toxicity of ethanol and several sedative-hypnotics (barbital, diazepam, phenobarbital) administered to rat pups via dams for 18 days (day 3-21 after parturition) from the relatively early postnatal stage in terms of changes in the threshold for pentetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsion, tolerance to, and physical dependence on barbital (B). In the pups of all dosed groups, the convulsive threshold for PTZ is reduced significantly compared with that in the naive group. The sleeping time with B in phenobarbital-exposed offspring was also reduced significantly compared with that in the naive pups. No difference was however, noted in the B concentration of the brain or plasma upon awaking between these groups of pups, which proved that the phenobarbital -exposed pups had obviously acquired a functional tolerance to B. B-dependence formation and the ensuing weight loss and appearance of withdrawal signs, especially clonic-tonic convulsion, were made intense in the phenobarbital -experienced pups. From these results, it may be concluded that exposure to sedative-hypnotics from the early CNS developing stage makes a lowered state of convulsive threshold for PTZ, and therefore, tends to enhance B-withdrawal convulsion. These phenomena were discussed from the viewpoint of monoamine metabolism in the brain. © 1982, The Japanese Pharmacological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neonatal drug concentrations and neonate/mother concentration ratios are reported in 73 cases of elective Caesarean section and forceps deliveries where diazepam was used as an intravenous sleep-inducing agent. The various parameters were plotted against the injection-delivery interval and the correlation was tested using a non-parametric ranking method. The concentration of diazepam in mixed arteriovenous umbilical cord blood was negatively correlated with the injection-delivery interval in the range of 55 to 810 seconds. Statistically significant positive correlations (p < 0.001) were found between the injection-delivery interval and the neonatal concentrations at 2 and 24 hours. The corresponding neonate/ther concentration ratios varied considerably, and were not so strongly correlated to the duration of antenatal drug transfer. The results suggest that with a slowly eliminated agent like diazepam, the drug concentration in capillary blood obtained from the newborn a few hours after delivery gives a reasonably good indication of the fetal drug exposure. The transplacental passage of diazepam is rapid, with distribution equilibrium between mother and fetus being approached within 5 to 10 minutes after intravenous injection of the drug. © 1982, ADIS Press Australasia Pty Ltd..

AB  - Doxyiamine succinate, a drug used as a sleep-inducing agent, an antihistamine, and in a therapeutic formulation taken by pregnant women as an antinauseant, was scheduled for toxicological evaluation as part of a structure activity relationship study, with rats and mice, because a deficiency of such data exists with regard to many antihistamines. Analytical chemical procedures that ensure proper concentration, homogeneity, and stability of the drug in dosed feed, as well as the safety of personnel and the environment, were prerequisites for the toxicological tests. GC methods using a rubidium-sensitized nitrogen detector were developed for analysis of doxylamine succinate in animal feed, human urine, and wastewater at levels as low as 1 ppm, 100 ppb, and 100 ppb, respectively. Sample extracts were cleaned up by liquid-liquid partitioning, followed by additional cleanup on a column of silica gel. Data are presented concerning the stability of the drug in animal feed, extraction efficiencies, and the use of the silica gel cleanup column to separate the caffeine interference from doxylamine in extracts of human urine. Partition values and ancillary data concerning analysis of the drug in feed, by HPLC at levels as low as 10 ppm, are also reported. © 1982, Oxford University Press.

AB  - Running activity onset and estrous onset were recorded for hamsters exposed to progressively shorter daily light dark (T) cycles. The period of the estrous cycle was a quadruple multiple of the period of the activity rhythm during entrainment to T cycles of 23.5-21.5 hr. There was no evidence of desynchronization of the activity and estrous rhythms. The very short estrous periods shown during exposure to short T cycles indicate that an intrinsic 96-hr interval for ovarian follicular maturation does not determine the period of the estrous cycle. Dissociation of estrous and running activity onsets occurred for all hamsters: estrous onset generally preceded running activity onset for T≥23.0 hr; for shorter T cycles, estrous onset generally lagged behind running activity onset. Wheel-running activity was intermittently split into entrained and free-running components for one female: at T=22.0 hr, estrous onset was coupled first with one and then with the other of the split activity components. These findings suggest that two or more separate circadian oscillators may control timing of the activity and estrous rhythms.

This finding implies that the early menarche in blind girls and the accelerated vaginal opening of rats reared in constant darkness may be caused by free-running circadian rhythms that are greater than one cycle in 24 hours.

Prolactin circadian rhythm, performed on all patients, showed 4 hyper and 7 normoprolactinemic cases. The mammary condition was studied, before and after treatment, through clinical examination, mammary cytology and thermography. Hyperprolactinemic patients responded positively to the therapy, showing subjective, clinical and thermographic improvement. Conversely, normoprolactinemic patients, though showing a noteworthy improvement of symptomatology and galactorrhea, did not respond equally well from the objective and thermographic points of view.

AB  - A method based on the inhibition of hemagglutination for the determination of estriol-16-α-glucuronide is compared to the method of Kober and Ittrich. A sufficient degree of correlation (p <0.001) is found, when the daily estrogen production (Kober-Ittrich) in the last trimenon is compared to the estriol-concentration in the morning urine, analyzed by the hemagglutination method, which is suitable for the total estrogen determination too. Results below 23 μg estriol/ml morning urine are pathological. Advantages of this method result from the fact, that no special equipment is required to carry out this fast assay.

AB  - Prolactin levels were determined in samples of umbilical venous blood at vaginal delivery after 38-42 weeks of uncomplicated gestation. The mean level of prolactin for all samples was 328.4 ± 7.4 (SE) ng/ml. The levels did not vary significantly during these weeks of gestation, nor correlate with the duration of labour. The means of levels combined every 2 h varied significantly throughout the 24 h period with a maximum value of 460.3 ± 85.1 ng/ml at 2-4 a.m. and a maximum value of 241.4 ± 27.2 ng/ml at 6-8 a.m. and remained relatively constant between 2-4 and 10-12 p.m. These results suggest that a circadian periodicity may exist in the secretion of prolactin by the human foetus, and that this is not affected by labour and delivery.

AB  - The 4 day cycling Wistar strain rats were sacrificed by decapitation on the several conditions. By radioimmunoassay, hypothalamic luteinizing hormone (LH) were measured. From the present experiments, the following resulted were obtained. At 17:00 on proestrus, a peak in serum LH level was observed. At the same time, hypothalamic LH-RH content was decreased. After the administration of estradiol (E2) on diestrus I, hypothalamic LH-RH content gradually and reached the peak about one day later. Moreover, serum LH peak appeared on diestrus II. But the change ofE2 administration time didn't take part in the time of LH peak. When the group of the rats were administered progesterone at an appropriate time in addition to the E2 administration at 12:00 on diestrus I, serum LH peak on diestrus II was repressed through the changes of LH-RH.

AB  - The influence of FSH, LH, prolactin and estradiol - 17β on the growth of rat granulosa cells in tissue culture was investigated. Granulosa cells were isolated from large proestrus follicles, every second hour, beginning at 8 hr on the morning of proestrus, until 2 hrs, i.e., prior to ovulation. Cells were counted on the 2, 4 and 6th day of culture. The most intense growth in control cultures was observed when cells collected from morning follicles, and then at 20 to 24 hr, were cultured. LH stimulated growth only at 14 hr. Prolactin stimulated mitoses in cultures of cells collected at 20 and 22 hr. FSH stimulated cells collected at 11 and 16 hr, while estradiol exerted rather inhibitory action on cells collected at any time of the investigated period.

AB  - Embryonic diapause is a widespread phenomenon in mammals and may be controlled either by lactation or by seasonal environmental factors1. A few species, such as the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, use both mechanisms, depending on the time of year. On Kangaroo Island, South Australia (latitude 36° S), female tammars give birth to a single young in late January or early February2. Mating occurs on the day after birth and the resulting conceptus grows to a 100-cell blastocyst before entering a state of embryonic diapause. This arrest of embryonic growth is due to a suppression of the corpus luteum by prolactin induced by the young in the pouch sucking the teat (lactational diapause)3,4. If the young is removed from the teat between February and early June, the corpus luteum hypertrophies, the blastocyst resumes growth and birth occurs 27 days later5. In the second half of the year (June to December), diapause is not solely dependent on the sucking stimulus as it is maintained after weaning, which usually occurs in October, or following experimental removal of the pouch young. This is referred to as seasonal diapause5. Reactivation occurs on or about the summer solstice (22 December) and there is evidence that it is photoperiodically induced6 (Fig. 1). We report here that bilateral removal of the superior cervical ganglion in female tammars eliminates seasonal embryonic diapause, but has no effect on lactational diapause. This is the first evidence that the pineal gland may be involved in regulation of embryonic diapause in mammals. © 1981 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Responses to brief episodes of occlusion of the middle uterine artery were examined in six fetal sheep in utero between 122 and 140 days of gestation. Continuous recordings were made of fetal breathing movements, electro-cortical (ECoG) and electro-ocular (EOG) activity, arterial pressure and heart rate. Five minutes of unilateral or bilateral arterial occlusion caused fetal hypoxaemia while changes in mean arterial PCI2 and pH were not statistically significant. Occlusions usually led to a cessation of rapid eye movements (REM) and respiratory activity (86% of trials), to the appearance of high-voltage slow waves in the ECoG (84% of trials) and to a fall in heat rate of more than 10% (81% of trials). With the exception of the changes in heart rate, these responses resemble those which frequently occur during non-labour contractions of the uterus. We conclude that the cessation of fetal breathing movements and rapid eye movements and the onset of slow waves in the ECoG seen in association with uterine contractions may be due to the mild hypoxaemia which accompanies them.

AB  - A variety of radioimmunoassays specifically characterized for use with fetal and maternal ovine plasma have been used to measure steroid hormone concentrations in small plasma samples drawn simultaneously from mother and fetus. By repeated sampling from the same animal preparation the changes over time of plasma concentrations of cortisol, pregnenolone and its sulphate, and oestrone and oestrone sulphate have been systematically studied. In animals delivering spontaneously at term the fetal plasma cortisol concentration rises between 120 and 130 days gestation and plays an important part in the maturation of several vital physiological systems, including the fetal thyroid axis. In normal term deliveries and premature deliveries induced by synthetic adrenocorticotropin (ACTH(1-24), 1 microgram h-1), the concentration of oestrone sulphate in maternal plasma increases before the fetal plasma concentration. Fetal and maternal oestrogens are probably important in the control of the low-grade tonic myometrial activity that occurs throughout gestation, in the initiation of labour and in the control of uterine blood flow. Low-grade tonic myometrial activity affects fetal oxygenation, fetal breathing and the fetal sleep state and may constitute a pathway through which the mother influences fetal development, with important physiological and possibly pathological consequences.

AB  - In fetal lambs after 115 days gestation breathing movements become episodic in association with electrocortical differentiation into predominantly high voltage slow or low voltage rapid activity, the latter characteristic of rapid eye movement sleep. Section of the brainstem at or above the colliculi dissociates fetal breathing from electrocortical activity. It is included that breathing is inhibited, towards the end of gestation, by a supracollicular mechanism during high voltage activity. After brainstem transection at the colliculi hypoxia no longer causes an arrest of fetal breathing, which often becomes more vigorous. The arrest of breathing in normal fetuses subjected to mild hypoxia is also attributed to a supracollicular mechanism. The pattern of fetal skeletal movements and of the spinal segmental reflexes is related to electrocortical activity near term; both are suppressed by hypoxia. The hypothesis is discussed of a central control centre, excited directly or indirectly by hypoxia, which inhibits fetal movements including breathing. Its possible location is considered.

AB  - In a woman with anxiety neurosis having episodes of depressive decompensation who complained of insomnia, the nocturnal sleep was studied four times: before the first sleep she was given standard drugs (levomepromazine and amitriptyline), before the second, no treatment was given, before the third, only one of the drugs regularly taken by the patient (amitriptyline) was given and before the fourth, a placebo identical in appearance to levomepromazine. The EEG's were separated by three-day intervals during which the patient took her usual treatment (50 mg levomepromazine, 25 mg amitriptyline). The findings show that when the patient knew she had been given no drugs, sleep was severely impaired, whereas after placebo she slept almost as well as on drugs. The psychological and/or pharmacological action of the drugs used is discussed.

AB  - In a double-bind randomized study 150 outpatients receiving the same anesthetic for first trimester therapeutic abortions were equally divided into three groups: control; droperidol, 2.5 mg IM; or hydroxyzine, 10 mg IM. The injection was given immediately after thiamylal (Surital) induction of anesthesia, and the incidence of nausea, retching, or vomiting (NRV) was recorded at 15-minute intervals for 3 hours after surgery. NRV occurred in 56% of control patients, in 44% of patients given droperidol, and in 10% of patients given hydroxyzine. The patients receiving hydroxyzine and droperidol were more sedated and experienced a delay in return of hand-eye coordination as measured by the time for the Trieger motor test to reach preoperative levels. All patients equaled their preoperative performance during the 3rd hour after surgery and were discharged 4 hours following general anesthesia. We conclude that intramuscular hydroxyzine hydrochloride, 100 mg, is a significantly better antiemetic than intramuscular droperidol, 2.5 mg.

AB  - The introduction of Electric Response Audiometry which can be carried out irrespective of the age of the child tested has enabled a quantitative determination of the hearing threshold to be made in neonates, both full-term and premature. The early diagnosis of any hearing impairment is of great importance for a child's normal speech development. Especially very significant is the examination of children born premature and children known as dysmatured. The purpose of the tests made was to evaluate the cortical response in the newborn from the point of view of the early detectability of hearing impairment, taking into account the course of pregnancy, parturition and the state of the neonate at the time of birth according to Apgar's Scale. The studies were carried out on 195 neonates of whom 165 were born at full-term and 30 were premature, born between the 24th and 36th week of pregnancy, and their birth weight ranged from 600 to 2100 g. In the majority of cases these were children of mothers with case histories of obstetric complications with numerous previous miscarriages. The tests were carried out with the use of an ERA audiometer (Medelec) and an Anops-10 average computer. The children were tested during physiological sleep immediately after feeding, observation of ear-eyelid reaction to a pure tone of a frequency of 1000 Hz and of an intensity of 100 Hz preceded ERA testing. The basis for the evaluation of the organ of hearing was presence or absence of a freely evoked response, most usually in the form of a two-phase or three-phase deflection, to the acoustic stimuli of determined parameters applied. The latent time and amplitude of the individual components of the response evoked were analysed in the response obtained. Summing up the results obtained it may be said that: objective audiometric hearing tests in the newborn are of particular importance not only in the evaluation of hearing in children in whom there is a risk of hearing impairment, but also because valuable information on the process of maturation of the organ of hearing is obtained by tracing the form and distribution of the V-potential. This fact may give evidence that: the number of positive evoked responses changes with the frequency of the stimulus and the maturity of the neonate; in the full-term, group responses were most frequently obtained at 1000 Hz, but in the premature group at 500 Hz; in both groups of children tested, the smallest number of positive responses was observed at 2000 Hz; the latent time of consecutive-response deflections also alters with the frequency of the stimulus and the maturity of the neonate; in both groups of neonates tested the smallest values were found for 1000 Hz; the mean latent-time values are longer in premature than in full-term neonates, and the greatest differences were observed at a frequency of 2000 Hz; P2 for which the highest amplitudes were also obtained, was the response deflection most frequently observed both in the full-term and in the premature groups; the mean amplitude values are lower in premature babies, so that the differences are most distinct at the frequency of 2000 Hz.

AB  - The importance of 5-HT synaptic transmission for induced or cyclic activation of pituitary secretion now seems widely agreed upon. Raphe structures, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and, hypothetically, identified mesencephalic 5-HT containing neurons can be assumed to represent parts of the neuronal circuitry of a central clock which synchronizes neuroendocrine rhythms. Cyclic input from the pineal gland may also be involved, though the meaning of this has not yet been clearly established. The primary role of the transmitter may be to modulate transmission to neurosecretory neurons at the output of this clock. This modulation is not hormone-specific and affects, simultaneously, several endocrine functions. 5-HT has also been shown to facilitate the pituitary response to discrete neuroendocrine reflexes, such as the suckling-induced release of prolactin. 5-HT interactions with hormone control provide a good illustration of the neuromodulatory role of the amine.

AB  - Anatomical differences between infants and adults (e.g., fetal hemoglobin, central nervous system maturation) imply that with regard to control of breathing, the newborn infant cannot be considered simply a small adult. Resting breathing of the neonate may be regular or quiet variable. Although breathing patterns are different in rapid eye movement and quiet sleep states, it is not clear whether ventilation is different. Both resting ventilation and CO2 sensitivity increase with postnatal age. The ventilatory response to hypoxia in the neonate is unusual in that there is a transient increase in ventilation at the onset of hypoxia, but this response is not sustained in the steady state. The reasons for this difference from the adult response to hypoxia are uncertain. A possible association between abnormal control of respiration which might predispose to respiratory failure and the occurrence of apneas or periodic breathing has been sought in many studies, but results are inconclusive. It is speculated that respiratory responsiveness to transient changes in chemical stimuli might be important for the long-term well-being of the infant. Furthermore, it is suggested that modelling of respiratory behavior of the neonate may be quite useful because of ethical limits on the experimental protocols that are applicable to the human infant. © 1982 Pergamon Press Ltd.

AB  - The reactions of 14 young (one to three and one-half years) first born children to the routine two to six day separation associated with maternal childbirth were compared with 17 children permitted to visit their mothers in hospital for one hour per day. Behavior observations in the home one to two weeks after birth compared to those made two to four weeks before birth as well as maternal questionnaires revealed significant increases in tekmper tantrums, excessive activity and sleep problems in both groups. Children, however, who sisited were initially significantly more responsive to their mothers and new siblings. © 1981 Human Sciences Press.

AB  - Diurnal profiles have been constructed for glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides, cholesterol, and ten neutral amino acids in subjects with normal carbohydrate metabolism during late pregnancy and in age- and weight-matched nongravid women. Samples of blood were secured during a 24 hour period while the subjects were receiving a liquid formula diet (containing 2,110 kcal with 275 gm carbohydrate and 75 gm protein) in three equal feedings at 0800, 1300, and 1800 hours. Postprandial excursions for most nutrients, as well as plasma concentrations after overnight fast and before each meal, were significantly different in the pregnant subjects. The studies indicate that criteria of normalcy based on observations in nongravid women cannot be invoked to assess fuel homeostasis in late pregnancy, and that separate criteria are necessary to evaluate nutrient regulation at this time. © 1981.

AB  - The present investigation was designed to determine the chronic effects of neonatal monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration (4 g/kg s.c.) and the acute effects of MSG (1 g/kg i.p.) on episodic growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion and brain somatostatin (SRIF) in unanesthetized, chronically cannulated male rats. Adult rats showed the typical physical characteristics that result from neonatal MSG administration. Analysis of episodic GH secretion showed a significant reduction in: (1) the amplitude of GH secretory peaks; and (2) the mean 5.5-h plasma level of GH. Bursts of plasma PRL were inhibited by MSG, but the mean 5.5-h plasma levels were not affected. SRIF concentrations in the medial basal hypothalamus were reduced by 60% after neonatal MSG. Acute administration of MSG to adult rats caused an immediate, long-lasting suppression of rhythmic GH secretion and a rapid, transient release of PRL. These results suggest: (1) neonatally administered MSG causes a marked disturbance in episodic GH and PRL secretion in adult rats; (2) MSG induces a decrease in hypothalamic SRIF and possibly GH-releasing factor; and (3) the acute effects of MSG on GH and PRL may be due to the inhibition and/or excitation of a complex neuronal network involving monoaminergic and peptidergic systems. © 1981.

AB  - The role of forebrain serotonin in behavior-related energy output was assessed in two locomotor activity tests conducted 3 and 6 months after bilateral, intrahypothalamic microinfusion of the serotonin neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). The serotonin-depleted animals exhibited a long-lasting and stable increase in energy expenditure as locomotor activity. This increased activity was investigated at the behavioral level by relating the hyperactivity to estrous cycle, photoperiod and body weight. Although the serotonin depletion-induced hyperactivity occurred in all photoperiod and estrous cycle stages, its magnitude was disproportionately increased during light and estrus. This hyperactivity could not be related to decreases in body weight because the serotonin-depleted animals weighed significantly more than the control animals. These animals responded to the weight loss that normally accompanies wheel running by increasing their activity to the same proportion as the other groups. The neuroanatomical and neurochemical substrate of the increased locomotor activity was investigated with a regional neurochemical assay for serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. This assay revealed that the toxin had no effect on dopamine or norepinephrine in any structure analyzed; however, serotonin was depleted in the hippocampus, septum and, to a lesser degree, in the hypothalamus. Serotonin levels were negatively correlated with overall activity. The magnitude of the disproportionate increase in activity during light and estrus was negatively correlated with hippocampal serotonin level. These results indicate that forebrain depletions of serotonin differentially affect the control of activity exerted by the phases of the photoperiod and estrous cycle. However, the modulation of activity levels by decreases in body weight remains intact. © 1981.

AB  - Respiratory responses to hypercapnia were studied in seven chronic in utero fetal lambs between 105 and 138 days' gestation (16 expts). Fetal arterial CO 2 tension was raised (mean increase 9.9 Torr) by altering maternal inspired gas concentrations. Diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) was recorded as the index of respiratory activity. Electrocortical and electroocular activity (3 fetuses) were monitored in an attempt to define sleep state. Average respiratory rate increased (90%) and fetal apnea decreased (60%) during hypercapnia. Mean respiratory rate during 'on' periods (&gt;6 EMG bursts/min) increased significantly during hypercapnia throughout the gestational epoch studied. Mean duration of the inspiratory time (TI) showed no significant change. Variability in both rate and TI decreased in response to CO 2 at all gestations. Integrated EMG activity per burst divided by TI increased significantly at all gestations; however, no gestational increase in responsiveness to CO 2 was seen. Sleep states were not able to be consistently identified, and a quantifiable electrocortical response to CO 2 was not observed. These results indicate a relatively early functional maturation of fetal respiratory responses to CO 2.

AB  - Respiratory activity (diaphragmatic electromyogram) was recorded in six unanesthetized in utero fetal lambs, between 0.7 of gestation and term. Respiratory patterns generated by the fetus showed developmental changes that included 1) an emergence of a periodic modulation of respiratory rate producing alternating active and quiet phases (mean cycle length of 37 min between 130 and 140 days' gestation; 2) an increase in percentage apnea (expiratory time >10 s) from 20% at 110 days to 60% at 140 days; and 3) a linear decrease in the 2-h average respiratory rate, while mean rate during active phases showed no consistent gestational decline. Electrocortical and electroocular activity was monitored in three of six fetuses; however, discrete sleep state patterns could not be consistently identified. The results demonstrate a gestational change in the respiratory patterns of the developing fetus and suggest an orderly maturation of the mechanisms controlling respiratory neuronal output.

AB  - Dams from two inbred strains of mice (C57BR and BALB/c) were treated with caffeine in solution in their drinking water during gestation. Doses of caffeine used corresponded to about 60, 80 or 100 mg/kg/day; controls received tap water. The offspring (as adults) revealed a significantly increased sleep time following caffeine treatment, but primarily as slow wave sleep in the males of the BALB/c strain and paradoxical sleep in the females of the C57BR strain. BALB/c females and C57BR males were relatively unaffected. These results, and in particular the sex differences, are discussed in terms of a possible central site of action of caffeine. © 1981.

AB  - Electroencephalographic and electromyographic activities were recorded together with variations in intramammary pressure in unanaesthetized lactating sows during suckling. During each suckling period, milk ejection resulted in a sudden and brief rise in intramammary pressure. From the onset of suckling to the beginning of milk ejection, polygraphic recordings as well as observations of behaviour revealed that the sow was invariably in a state of arousal. This suggests that, unlike what has been proposed for the rat, sleep is not a necessary component of the milk ejection reflex in the pig. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Drug concentrations were measured in whole blood obtained from mother and child after induction of general anaesthesia with thiopental or diazepam and delivery by Caesarean section. In 27 cases given thiopental 3 mg/kg intravenously the 5-min child/mother concentration ratio rose with increasing injection-delivery (I-D) interval up to 8-10 min. The concentration in the newborn at 2 h showed a similar trend. In 30 cases given diazepam 0.3 mg/kg for sleep induction, there were some low values in cases delivered within 4 min after the injection. However, higher neonatal concentrations and child/mother ratios were observed when the operation lasted 4-5 min, and there was no further increase in cases with longer I-D intervals. There is evidence to suggest that net transfer to the fetus proceeds at a slower rate with thiopental than with diazepam. However, in the present series of low risk elective Caesarean sections, there was no appreciable difference between the induction agents with regard to their effect on the newborn infant. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We have used cell-type-specific markers to study the development of neurones and glial cells in dissociated cell cultures of 10-day embryonic rat brain. Tetanus-toxin-binding neurones and phagocytic macrophages with surface receptors for IgG were present from the beginning of such cultures. GFAP+ astrocytes developed after 5-6 days, ependymal cells with beating cilia after 7-8 days, and galactocerebroside+ oligodendrocytes after 13-14 days in culture. When cultures were prepared from 13-day embryonic brain, these glial cells developed 3 days earlier than they did in cultures of 10-day embryonic brain. When freshly isolated cell suspensions from brains of embryos at various ages were studied, we found that the development of specific neural cells in vivo precisely parallelled their development in vitro. Thus glial cells develop right on schedule in dissociated cell cultures suggesting that biological clocks are more important than positional information in gliogenesis after 10 days gestation. We demonstrate that rat neural antigen-2 (Ran-2) which is defined by a monoclonal antibody is expressed on astrocyte precursors. © 1981.

AB  - Seventy cases of sickle-cell disease were identified in the London Borough of Brent from records dating back to 1962. All but three were still alive and, with one exception, were recalled for confirmation of the diagnosis and to provide personal and family histories. The group consisted of 22 individuals with homozygous sickle-cell anaemia (Hb SS), 12 with sickle-cell/beta-thalassaemia double heterozygosity, 34 with sickle-cell/haemoglobin C disease (Hb SC), and two with the combination of haemoglobin S and hereditary persistence of fetal haemoglobin. They were predominantly of West Indian origin, more than half had been born in Britain, and most were aged under 25. The records for 304 patient admissions between 1962 and 1979 were analysed. There were 199 sickle-cell-disease-related admissions, 61 unrelated to sickle-cell disease, and 44 for pregnancy or its complications. Admissions per patient-year averaged less than one, except for children with Hb SS under the age of 5 years, who were admitted more frequently. The commonest reasons for admission were painful crises (74% of all admissions) and the “chest syndrome” (21%). There were four pneumococcal infections, all in children with Hb SS under the age of 8 years; all recovered. Three patients, aged 10, 15, and 50 years, died. The two children with Hb SS died in their sleep without gross evidence of sickling at necropsy. Multiple brain infarcts were found at necropsy in the 50-year-old woman with Hb SC who, having survived nine uneventful pregnancies, succumbed to an infection after cryosurgery to the cervix. Obstetric records were available for 18 term pregnancies in 11 women. Three antenatal sickling crises and three post-partum thromboembolic complications were encountered. There were no maternal or perinatal deaths. Fifteen asymptomatic individuals with sickle-cell disease were diagnosed as a result of routine screening procedures. There are likely to be many such individuals currently undiagnosed in the community. They urgently need identification because of their increased risks from pregnancy, surgery, and infection. © 1981, British Medical Journal Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to examine the effect of endogenous rhythms in fetal and/or maternal adrenal activity on diurnal changes in plasma estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and progesterone (P) in women at 34 to 35 weeks' gestation, we measured these steroids in a group of six women in whom the endogenous circadian rhythm in cortisol was absent or had been suppressed by treatment with exogenous synthetic glucocorticoids. All steroids were suppressed, and no diurnal rhythms in E1, E2, E3 or P were found. Suppression of cortisol and estrogens was greater after dexamethasone (Dx) than after a glucocorticoid-equivalent dosage of prednisone (Pd). Loss of the maternal estrogen rhythms seen in normal patients is consistent with the suggestion that such rhythms may be attributable to diurnal changes in maternal and/or fetal adrenal output of potential precursors. The differences in cortisol and estrogen concentrations after Dx and Pd may indicate dissociation of the glucocorticoid (hyperglycemia) and adrenocorticotropic hormone-suppressing activities of these compounds.

AB  - In the present study, it was indicated that the prolactin (PRL) surges spontaneously, occurring with circadian rhythms, the proestrous surge in cycling rats, the estrogen-induced surge in ovariectomized rats and the diurnal and nocturnal surges in pseudopregnant (PSP) rats, require the frontal afferents from the surge centers in the preoptic region to the MBH. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), one of the surge centers, is suggested to be involved in the control of the PRL surges as a biological clock having a function in the generation and entrainment of the rhythms. The neural impulses from the surge centers in the preoptic region might suppress the activity of PRL inhibiting factor-producing neurons in the MBH, especially arcuate dopaminergic neurons, or stimulate the activity of PRL releasing factor-producing neurons to induce the PRL surges. Furthermore, it was shown that the neural afferents, probably monoaminergic afferents, from the lower brain structures to the preoptic region are essential for the occurrence of the proestrous and estrogen-induced surge of PRL. It is unknown and crucial to determine whether an increase in transmission of the facilitatory impulses from the lower brain structures to the preoptic region occurs on the afternoon of proestrus or whether tonic discharges in it are enough to maintain the neural activity of circadian rhythms in the preoptic region. Recently, numerous investigations have provided evidence suggesting that various neuropeptides participate in the physiological control of PRL secretion, and that some of them are possibly involved as PRL releasing factor. The determination of the site of actions of these neuropeptides and ovarian steroids will contribute to the understanding of the neural control of PRL secretion.

AB  - We have investigated the variability of four honnonal Parameters used for the endocrine monitoring of the third trimester of pregnancy (E3, E4, HPL, SP1). We have observed no circadian rhythm of Estriol, Estetrol, HPL and SP1-The within-a-day and the day-to-day variations are much greater for E4 than for E3 and for HPL thanforSP1.The Standard deviations were great for the steroids, especially for E4 and much less for the protein hörmones, especially SP1. This implies that it is necessary to have serial assays of the steroids to have any confidence in the levels, while good monitoring could be guaranteed with a smaller number of assays for HPL and SP1. © 1981, Walter de Gruyter.

AB  - The concentration of progesterone has been measured in ten women at 34-35 weeks of gestation in blood samples taken at 30 or 60 min intervals during a 24 h study period. Plasma progesterone concentrations showed a distinct diurnal rhythm. Most values determined between 04.00 and 11.00 h were significantly lower than the peak concentrations measured between 13.00 and 01.00 h. The relation of these changes in plasma progesterone to those in plasma cortisol and oestrogens is discussed.

AB  - It is known that all forms of life possess biological rhythms. The structure of this biological daily periodicity is caused by endogenous and exogenous factors. The reasons of circadian periodicity are endogenous processes, which can be modified by exogenous factors. This review describes the daily fluctuations of concentrations or excretions of haematologic, clinical chemical and endocrinological parameters. In blood and serum the largest daily variations are found for the concentrations of haemoglobin, potassium, iron, cortisol, testosterone, somatotropin, prolactin, adrenaline and noradrenaline. In contrast to the serum concentrations of the electrolytes sodium, potassium, calcium and phosphate, their urinary excretions demonstrate pronounced daily rhythms with amplitudes being twice as high as the daily means. There is a remarkable phase shift of 180° between phosphate and the cations both in the serum concentrations and urinary excretions. A daily rhythm comparable to the urinary excretion of electrolytes, has been measured for the urinary excretion of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol. A constant, well defined timing of the sampling is important for those constituents with a marked daily variation. For numerous parameters very contradictory results have been reported in the literature concerning their daily variations, especially in cases of less pronounced rhythms. For some parameters the reasons for the differences in the observed daily variations are discussed.

AB  - Controversy regarding the presence of a circadian rhythm in unconjugated estriol in serum during pregnancy led us to study the possibility that the observed rhythms actually are the result of partitioning of estriol into serum lipids when these increase postprandially. Addition of triglycerides to purified estriol standards significantly decreased (p<0.001) apparent estriol as detected by radioimmunoassay after separation on dextran-coated charcoal and significantly increased (p<0.001) estriol as detected by radioimmunoassay after double-antibody separation. Compensation for individual nonspecific binding of standards nullified te effect of lipids only in systems involving dextran-coated charcoal separation, incubated for 1.0 h at 37°C followed by 1.0 h at 4°C. In contrast to other protocols, data obtained with this system revealed no significant circadian variation in serum estriol concentrations in normal pregnant women (CV, 4.3%). Evidently, reported variations in apparent serum estriol concentration are artifactual.

AB  - The circadian activity rhythms of adult female rats maintained under a light-dark cycle of 14 hr light, 10 hr dark (LD 14:10) or constant dim illumination (dim LL) were recorded during their 4 or 5 day estrous activity cycles and when they were pseudopregnant. In LD 14:10 both the phase angle difference (ψ), which defines the temporal relationship between the onsets of activity and darkness, and the period (τ) of locomotor activity differed significantly among the days of the 4 and 5 day estrous cycle. Activity-time (α) varied reliably only over the days of the 5 day estrous cycle. The period of the free-running activity rhythm in dim LL also differed significantly among the days of the estrous cycle. In both LD and dim LL the most positive ψ, shortest τ and longest α were observed on the day of estrus. Pseudopregnancy diminished the amplitude and altered the daily pattern of the estrous activity rhythm. We conclude that the periodicity of circadian activity systematically varies as a function of the stage of the estrous cycle and in a manner that cannot be solely explained by corresponding alterations in endogenous estrogen. © 1981.

AB  - To define how the periodicity of light regulates reproductive cyclicity in the rat, animals were exposed to slightly altered photoperiods in which the light/dark ratio was maintained as in the control (14L + 10D) environment. Exposure to a 22.5-h photoperiod (13.125L + 9.375D) for 10-80 days induced a significant prolongation of the first and all subsequent vaginal cycles by about 30 h. Ovulation in these animals was normal. By contrast, exposure to a 26-h photoperiod (15.167L + 10.833D) had no significant effect on vaginal cyclicity. A comparison of the data with theoretically generated results revealed that a significant prolongation of the estrous cycle under conditions of a shortened photoperiod cannot be accounted for by a simple entrainment of the estrous cycle to the timing of the new circadian rhythm. Rather, the evidence suggested that a photoperiod-entrained rhythm may interact with a second rhythm of different periodicity to alter the duration of the reproductive cycle as measured in this study.

AB  - Newborn male rats were treated SC with dexamethasone phosphate (100 μg) or dexamethasone acetate (100 μg) on postnatal day 1, dexamethasone phosphate (5.0 μg) on postnatal days 1, 2, and 3, or the corresponding drug vehicle. All animals were sacrificed 65—70 days later at previously determined daily trough and peak times of serum LH, TSH, and corticosterone: 0700 and 0100 h for LH, 0700 and 1300 h for TSH, and 0700 and 1900 h for corticosterone. None of the three dexamethasone treatment regimens affected the circadian variation of serum LH or corticosterone. Dexamethasone phosphate (100 μg) altered the normal circadian rhythm of serum TSH in the adult animals, but the other two dexamethasone treatments did not affect the TSH rhythm. Basal 0700 h serum levels of FSH, PRL, and GH were also measured in these animals; none of the dexamethasone treatments altered the levels of these hormones compared to levels in the vehicle-injected controls. © 1981 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The effect of sonicated suspensions of phosphatidylserine (PS), an acidic phospholipid, was investigated on prolactin secretion utilizing in vivo and in vitro approaches. Acute and chronic administration of PS reduced plasma prolactin levels during different phases of circadian rhythms. The phospholipid was able to inhibit the plasma prolactin surge, which occurs in cycling female rats on the afternoon of proestrus. The time course of PS on prolactin secretion was characterized by a short latency (15 min) and a long duration of action (6 h). In rats with hypothalamic deafferentation PS partially reduced the increase of circulating prolactin induced by pretreatment with α-methyltyrosine. An inhibition of prolactin release was observed if anterior pituitary glands were incubated in presence of PS. This effect was prevented by the addition of the dopamine antagonist sulpiride to the medium. In conclusion, PS decreases prolactin secretion both in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of the hormone secretion appears to be due to the action of PS at the level of the pituitary; however, a concomitant stimulatory action on the turnover of the tuberoinfundibular neurons cannot be ruled out. © 1981 S.

AB  - Pregnant mice were injected once with cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg) or Th-R (N-mustard, 2 mg/kg) at one of four different day-times (07.00, 13.00, 19.00, 01.00) on the 12th day of gestation. In a therapeutic dose both alkylating neoplastic agents induced teratogenic effects relative to the maternal circadian cycle. The highest incidence of malformations due to maternal treatment with cyclophosphamide was found to be associated with the dark to light transition (07.00), whereas the lowest occurred at 01.00. In contrast, the teratogenic action of Th-R was strongest at the onset of darkness (19.00) and lowest at 07.00. The mean embryotoxicity of both compounds was subjected to seasonal modifications, being highest during spring and summer and lowest during winter. - The observations indicate that for the evaluation of the teratogenic potentialities of drugs, rhythms cannot be neglected.

AB  - It has been suggested that the decrease in blood pressure during sleep is greater in patients with chronic hypertension than in preeclamptic patients. The DINAMAP (device for indirect noninvasive automatic mean arterial pressure) monitor was used to determine the mean arterial, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, at 15-minute intervals, for 24 hours. Three groups of 15 patients each were studied: Mildly preeclamptic, chronically hypertensive, and normotensive patients in the third trimester. In addition, 2 patients with severe preeclampsia were studied. The automatic readings were compared with auscultated blood pressures. There was short-term variation in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 20 to 40 and 15 to 30 mmHg, respectively, with consecutive 15-minute recordings. A decrease in blood pressure during sleep was seen in all groups, except in the 2 patients with severe preeclampsia. This fall varied between 5 and 20 mmHg systolic and 5 and 18 mmHg diastolic. The auscultated blood pressure differed from the automatic blood pressure by 5 to 40 mmHg systolic and 5 to 35 mmHg diastolic. In the clinical management of patients, these findings are significant, as they demonstrate short-term variation in blood pressure and differences in the auscultated versus automatic blood pressure readings. Also, changes in blood pressure occur during sleep; this may be important with regard to the timing and dose of medication given to pregnant patients with chronic hypertension or preeclampsia. © 1981, by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - A specific and sensitive, double antibody, solid phase radioimmunoassay was developed for measurement of placental protein 5 (PP5) in serum. A sensitivity limit of 0.8 μg/1 was achieved by pre‐incubation with antiserum and use of a small assay volume. Single serum samples from 244 retrospectively proven normal pregnancies were used to construct a normal range of PP5 concentrations. PP5 was detectable at week 7 and rose to reach a maximum mean value of 54 μg/1 at weeks 36–37. Diurnal variation of PP5 concentration was similar to that encountered from day to day, and slightly greater than variation due to the radioimmunoassay. The decline of serum PP5 concentration post partum was initially rapid (half‐life 5–14 minutes), but slowed after 0.5–1 hours; immunoreactive PP5 was still detectable seven days after delivery.

AB  - The analysis of progesterone in milk has been made possible by the advent of recent analytical methods (Gadsby et al. 1974; Heap et al. 1973). Using such methods, it has been shown that in cattle and buffalo milk, progesterone levels closely follow plasma progesterone levels (Batra et al. 1979; Dobson et al. 1975; Ginther et al. 1974) and that these latter are a useful indicator of the reproductive status of animals (Arora et al. 1979; Gupta & Pope, 1968; Stabenfeldt et al. 1969). Milk progesterone determination provides a convenient method for monitoring the reproductive status of farm animals and has been used extensively in the determination of pregnancy or non-pregnancy at an early stage (Heap et al. 1976; Hoffmann et al. 1974; Laing & Heap, 1971). The study of progesterone in buffalo milk has received little attention. In the present communication, an attempt was made to explore the possibilities of diurnal variations of progesterone in buffalo milk. © 1981, Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research.

AB  - The source of the markedly increased secretion of desoxycorticosterone (DOC) in pregnancy has not been precisely defined. Earlier studies indicated that elevated DOC does not arise from the maternal adrenal glands. The previously observed steep gradient between fetal and maternal DOC and DOC sulfate concentrations seemed to point to a fetal source. A recent study suggests that DOC may also be derived from extra-adrenal conversion of maternal progesterone. The present investigation documents a lack of synchrony between maternal diurnal plasma cortisol and DOC patterns. Not only were the previous observations of steep gradients of DOC and DOC sulfate between fetal and maternal circulations confirmed, but also the finding of extremely high urinary excretion of DOC sulfate indicated that the sulfurylated steroid passes across the placenta. A direct linear correlation was noticed between cortisol and DOC in amniotic fluid. These observations suggest that the increased DOC arises from within the fetoplacental unit but do not rule out a maternal source.

AB  - Pregnant Wistar rats were injected with hydroxyurea (HU) intraperitoneally (IP) at one of several 6‐hour intervals on days 9–10.75 to study the role of circadian growth variations in the teratologic response of the fetuses. Two stocks of rats were studied and the results in each compared. The fetal response to HU, as observed at day 21, was not detectably modified by circadian fetal growth variation. No correlations between hour of HU administration and fetal weight, placental weight, resorption, or total malformation rates were found. Cyclic variations in the incidence of hydronephrosis and left umbilical artery was observed, but it was not clear that these were related to maternal light:dark cycles. Differences of response between two stocks of rats included marked variation in the incidence and type of malformations and variations in the tuning of peak incidence for some but not all malformations.

AB  - The effect of extended infusions of highly purified porcine relaxin on uterine activity was tested in vivo in conscious unrestrained rats. Relaxin was found to inhibit oxytocin- and prostaglandin F2α-induced uterine contractions in estrogentreated ovariectomized ratsas well as spontaneous contractions in both estrogen-treated and steroid-untreated ovariectomized rats. The inhibition of both induced and spontaneous uterine contractions was more effective in the early phases of relaxin infusion than after prolonged exposure to the hormone. However, this desensitization was not complete, and the inhibition was effective even with extended (up to 72 h in the oxytocin experiments) infusion of relaxin. The results indicate that relaxin may be important in controlling uterine activity in the rat near the end of gestation, and that estrogen priming in ovariectomized rats is not necessary for relaxin to exert its biological effects.

AB  - Serum prolactin and LH levels were measured at several times during pseudo-pregnancy (PP) in the rat and compared to levels found in rats during diestrous Day 2. In the same rats, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) activity were measured in the median eminence area as indices of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal activity, respectively. Serum LH and median eminence DBH were unchanged throughout the experiment. Serum prolactin was elevated at 1800 hr on Days 4 and 8 of PP and at 0100 hr on Days 5 and 9 compared to unstimulated controls. During the intersurge time (2200 hr) prolactin levels were low but slightly higher than controls. Tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the median eminence was low during the diurnal and nocturnal prolactin surges compared to unstimulated controls. It is concluded that the acute increases in prolactin levels in the blood that occur twice daily during PP may be related to the decrease in activity in dopamine containing neurons that occurs at that time. © 1981, SAGE Publications.

AB  - Fetal breathing movements were measured in six women who had received exogenous glucocorticoids throughout pregnancy and in whom the endogenous circadian rhythm in cortisol was absent or had been suppressed. Studies were performed for 24-hour observation periods while women received prednisone and then one week later on the same women after equivalent doses of dexamethasone. Fetal breathing movements occurred 29.9% ± 1.9% of the time in the prednisone-treated group and this was not changed in the same fetuses after dexamethasone treatment. There was a significant increase in the percentage of time spent making breathing movements during the second and third hours following breakfast, lunch, and dinner (P<0.001). A fourth peak in fetal breathing activity occurred in the late evening and seemed to be related to the time of the evening glucocorticoid medication. These data were compatible with the hypothesis that maternal glucocorticoid concentrations may influence patterns of fetal breathing movements at 34 to 35 weeks' gestational age.

AB  - The temporal relationships of the proestrous LH surge and the circadian locomotor activity rhythm were compared in hamsters entrained to four different 24-hr light-dark (LD) cycles. Animals were housed in cages equipped with running wheels to obtain continuous activity records. Stable entrainment of locomotor activity was complete within 3 weeks of exposure to each photoperiod at which time hamsters were randomly assigned to hourly sample groups. Serum was obtained by cardiac puncture under light ether anesthesia on the day of proestrous and was assayed by RIA for LH. A computer-based least-squares sine wave-fitting technique determined a single objective phase reference point for the time of the hormone maximum. In each photoperiod, precise temporal relationships were maintained between the LH surge and activity onset, whereas the phase relationship between the LH surge and the LD cycle was more variable. These data indicate that the environmental LD cycle entrains the circadian timing system which, in turn, provides temporal information to the rhythms of proestrous gonadotropin and locomotor activity. © 1981.

AB  - Two, 3 or 4 Silastic capsules of progesterone were implanted sc for 24-35 days, removed for a 12-14 day interval and re-implanted into the same adult female rats from which they were taken. A control group received cholesterol capsules. For approximately 4-10 days, Silastic capsules of progesterone suppressed estrous activity cycles. Thereafter, amplitude of running increased progressively and definite periodicities re-emerged. Following a 12 day recovery period, the same capsules were re-implanted and activity was again suppressed. During the first implantation, the number of estrous cycles with greater than 4-day periods significantly increased. Progesterone was also found to delay the daily onset of activity in relation to the light/dark cycle (phase angle difference). Phase angle difference prior to the first implantation was negatively correlated with the rate of recovery. The data support the conclusion that progesterone affects parameters of estrous activity by antagonizing the actions of estrogen and suggest that animals may make internal adjustments to high titers of progesterone. © 1981.

AB  - (1) The estrous cycle in the rat may be used to study recurrent changes in motor behaviors and motivation which are strongly related to cyclic hormonal and CNS changes. (2) The peak in motivated behaviors occurs during a sharply defined period on the night between proestrus and estrus and is evident in facilitated wheel-running, lordosis, and intracranial self-stimulation. (3) Behaviors without a clearly motivated character do not show an estrous cyclicity. (4) The estrous cyclic variation in intracranial self-stimulation was observed at a specific locus - the pars campacta of the substantia nigra. (5) A neurochemical link between sexually motivated behavior, wheel running and intracranial self-stimulation is suggested. This link is in part dopaminergic but is probably also activated by many other systems. © 1981.

AB  - A quantitative ultrastructural morphometric study was performed on the prolactin (PRL) cells of lactating mice, at different times in a circadian period. The results showed significant time fluctuations in the percentages of cytoplasmic volume occupied by several organelles. The endoplasmic reticulum appeared more developed during the dark period, indicating a higher synthesis of secretory material in this phase. The Golgi complex, including an increased number of immature granules, was found remarkably enlarged during the light period. Moreover, the release of PRL would be increased during the dark phase, as judged by the diminution of the secretory granules and the higher degree of emiocytotic activity. The present morphometric approach in the detection of circadian variations of PRL secretion in lactating mice is emphasized.

AB  - The influence of daily mechanical expression of breast milk on nutritional composition was examined by comparing expressed milk from 12 mothers who delivered preterm with milk from two groups of mothers delivering at term: nine mothers who mechanically expressed all milk and five mothers who nursed their infants at the breast. Collections were obtained at four-hour intervals over a period of 24 hours so that variability of constituents in milk of different mothers, as well as variability in the same mother over a 24-hour period, could be assessed. Preterm milk contained significantly higher concentrations of protein, sodium, and chloride, and lower concentrations of lactose than the milk from either group of mothers delivering at term. The mean concentrations of protein, sodium, chloride, and potassium in early preterm milk were adequate to meet the estimated requirements for the preterm infant. However, there was large variability composition of milk among mothers and among samples from the same mother.

AB  - The diurnal patterns of food intake and plasma corticosterone levels were determined in lactating Wistar-Imamichi rats maintained in a light (14 L: 10 D, lights on 0500 hr) and temperature (24±2°C) controlled animal room. Lactating mothers with four or more than eight pups showed a characteristic diurnal pattern of food intake with high rates of intake around the time of lights off. The diurnal rhythmicity of food intake seemed to disappear in late lactation in mothers with more than eight pups. The plasma corticosterone concentration on day 9 of lactation displayed a diurnal rhythm with high values at 1700 hr and 2100 hr. The rhythmicity of the corticosterone levels was abolished on day 16 of lactation and a high level was maintained throughout a 24 hr period. Since the diurnal rhythm of the corticosterone level was shifted in animals fed during the restricted period (0900-1700 hr) from days 2 to 9 of lactation, the appearance of diurnal rhythm of corticoid secretion seemed to depend on the diurnal feeding rhythm in lactation as well as in the estrous cycle. © 1981.

AB  - N‐acetyltransferase activity in the pineal glands of immature rats (12‐14 days old) shows a spontaneous rise and fall when the glands are placed in organ culture. The peak of the 28‐fold change occurs 5–16 hr after the cultures are initiated. This observation can be interpreted in two ways: (1) the pup pineal gland is responding to norepinephrine released when nerve endings degenerate in culture, or (2) the pup pineal gland has an innate ability which is responsible. Whatever the mechanism, the phenomenon is associated with the development of pineal gland function since pineal glands of adult rats do not show a spontaneous rise and fall in identical experiments.

AB  - Female Long Evans rats were placed on either an iron deficient or a normal diet from 7 days before mating to weaning of offspring. From weaning at 25 days of age, offspring were given the same diet as their mothers, and sacrificed at 33, 45, 63 or 75 days of age for measures of brain and liver non-haem iron levels, and haemoglobin concentrations. Brain iron levels were severely depressed in iron deprived animals from 33 days of age with no signs of recovery by adulthood. Haemoglobin levels were also severely reduced at 33 days by iron deprivation. However, recovery was rapid from 63 days despite continued iron privation, although recovery was never complete. Iron deprived animals showed lower liver iron levels than normals at 45 days of age with no signs of recovery by adulthood. In normal animals, adult male liver iron levels were about 4 times lower than adult female levels, the difference appearing at 63 days and increasing with age. Bodyweight was significantly depressed appearing at 63 days and increasing with age under both dietary conditions. The results suggest that brain and body tissue iron may depend on supplies during gestation and suckling at the expense of haemoglobin and liver iron stores which depend on postweaning supplies. The profound sex difference in liver iron merits further investigation, and may depend on early sex differences in the rate of iron absorption. © 1981.

AB  - Serum samples for cortisol, estradiol-17β (E2), and progesterone analysis were obtained twice daily or more frequently to determine the onset of diurnal steroid patterns in the maternal circulation of pregnant rhesus monkeys. The expected a.m./p.m. fluctuations in serum cortisol (31.6/22.9 μg/dl) were evident from Day 25, whereas nocturnal elevations in progesterone (9.62 16.31 ng/ml) were demonstrable on Day 30, and diurnal increments in E2 (283/138 pg/ml), coincident with those of cortisol, appeared about Day 40. Microscopic examination of fetal adrenals from rhesus embryos (ages 30 to 50 days) indicated that the gland differentiates and undergoes extensive development when diurnal E2 release first appears. Administration of 1.0 mg of dexamethasone twice daily to pregnant animals on Days 124 to 130 was accompanied by 1) complete suppression of cortisol release, 2) loss of the diurnal E2 pattern, which was associated with a marked reduction in serum E2, and 3) eventual loss of the nocturnal elevation in serum progesterone without altering its basal levels. Simiar treatment earlier in gestation reduced serum levels of both cortisol and E2 without influencing the diurnal serum patterns of these hormones or progesterone. These results support the concept that maternal estrogen levels depend on a functional fetal adrenal and further suggest the hypothesis that the inverse patterns in serum cortisol and progesterone are related to altered binding of progesterone to serum proteins as adrenal activity varies throughout the day. Further evidence supporting the hypothesis of steroid-serum protein interaction was the appearance of nocturnal increments in serum progesterone in ovariectomized animals treated with Silastic capsules containing progesterone and the absence of such increments in similarly treated ovariectomized animals after pituitary stalk section to suppress circadian adrenal activity. It is now clear that diurnal rhythms in serum E2 and progesterone as well as cortisol are present during most of gestation in the rhesus macaque, but the physiological importance of such rhythms remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Although liquid diets containing ethanol have been widely used in rodent models of the fetal alcohol syndrome, the nutritional adequacy of these diets has not been verified for pregnant rats. Beginning on day 7 of gestation, maternal diet consumption and body weight were monitored in rats receiving Bio-Mix 711-PR with ethanol (B/A), pair-fed diet without ethanol (B/P), ad libitum liquid without ethanol and ad libitum solid diet. The B/P and B/A animals did not gain weight normally during pregnancy, reflecting a significant decrease in caloric and protein intake compared to ad libitum liquid diet without ethanol and ad libitum solid diet mothers. Offspring of B/A mothers were severely growth-stunted in body and brain weight at birth, but B/P pups were also stunted compared to ad libitum controls. Thus, it was concluded that Bio-Mix 711-PR did not provide sufficient nutrients to pregnant rats when intake of diet was reduced by ethanol. Therefore, the diet was reformulated to increase the protein content and caloric value. A comparison of the revised diet containing ethanol and pair-fed revised diet without ethanol with B/A,B/P and ad libitum solid diet animals was made. The maternal body weight gain and offspring body and brain weights of revised diet containing ethanol and pair-fed revised diet without ethanol mothers did not differ from controls. However, blood alcohol levels of mothers consuming the revised diet containing ethanol were significantly less than B/A rats despite equivalent ethanol intake. The results of this study indicate the importance of proper nutritional control in rodent models of the fetal alcohol syndrome. The revised diet will permit the investigation of prenatal ethanol exposure without the confounding variable of undernutrition.

AB  - Adenosine 3':5' monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine 3':5' monophosphate (cGMP) are known to participate in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation, the processes intimately associated with maturation of the neonate. We have therefore examined their content in the physiological nutrient of the mammalian neonate, the mother's milk. Widely fluctuating concentrations between 0.1 and 0.7, and between 0.01 and 0.15 nmol/ml, were found for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, respectively. Concentrations in human breast milk changed during the 5-to 15-min period of one nursing, during any 24-h period, and also during the total lactation period. Levels of cyclic GMP were generally less fluctuating and were lower during afternoon and evening; they were relatively high at the start of lactation and levelled off during the postpartum period. The ratio of the two cyclic nucleotides also fluctuated widely and was significantly different from the ratio determined on blood plasma collected at the same time. Oxytocin injection had no effect on cyclic AMP content of rat milk. The stomach content of the nucleotide in rat pups remained high for at least 1 h after suckling indicating that cyclic nucleotides remain available for intestinal absorption; whether they have any physiological function in the neonate will have to emerge from further studies.

AB  - Plasma concentrations of GH, insulin, glucose, and FFA were measured in high yielding dairy cows at periods of peak milk production and later during periods of increased feed intake. During each period, five cows were prepared with indwelling juHgular catheters, and blood was sampled at 10-min intervals for 24 h, followed by hourly sampling for an additional 24 h. During early lactation (30 days post partum), the plasma GH concentration was elevated (13.2 ng/ml) compared to that in later lactation (90 days post partum; 9.8 ng/ml). This increased GH status was due to a greater magnitude of individual secretory spikes (27.3 vs. 20.2 ng/ml) rather than a difference in the frequency of spikes or in baseline plasma levels of GH. As lactation progressed from 30-90 days post partum, milk yield decreased, feed intake increased, and overall plasma concentration of insulin increased (17.3 vs. 29.3 µU/ml), refkecting both an elevated magnitude of hormone secretory spikes (30.2 vs. 55.2 µU/ml) and an elevated baseline concentration (16.8 vs. 27.3 µU/ml). The short term repeatability of overall mean and total 24-h GH and insulin secretion in lactating cows was demonstrated as well as the uniqueness of individual cow GH secretory patterns. Significant differences were not found in either glucose or FFA concentrations between lactation periods. Increased GH and decreased insulin during early lactation are likely to promote the mobilization of adipose tissue stores needed to supplement dietary energy consumption. © 1981 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Male and female hamsters were maintained on a long photoperiod (14L: 10D) and were divided into the following groups: group 1, injected with vehicle at both 11.00 and 17.00 h; groups 2-5, injected with various doses of melatonin at 11.00 h (0, 100 μg, 500 μg, 1 mg) and 25 g of melatonin at 17.00 h. In males, a.m. vehicle p.m. melatonin treatment for 70 days led to atrophy of the testes and accessory sex organs and to a significant depression of both plasma LH and PRL titers. There was a graded inhibition of these actions of exogenous melatonin in animals receiving 100 μg, 500 μg or 1 mg a.m. injections of melatonin with 1 mg completely preventing the effects of p.m. melatonin. 80% of the female hamsters receiving daily p.m. injections of melatonin for 9 weeks became acyclic with significant decreases in uterine weight and increases in ovarian weight. All doses of melatonin given at 11.00 h suppressed the inhibitory actions of p.m. melatonin with the exception of vaginal cyclicity for which 500 μg or more was required to restore normal vaginal cyclicity in all animals. These results demonstrate that morning injections of melatonin can prevent the antigonadotropic effects of afternoon melatonin injections and provide support for the hypothesis that the paradoxical actions of melatonin may be related to the ability of the indole to regulate its own receptors. © 1981 S.

AB  - A model of a cell-labeling mechanism for the developmental tree of a multicellular organism is suggested. The cell-labeling information is assumed to originate because the DNA strands are complementary, rather than identical, so a pair of replicated DNA can carry different information content to newly created pairs of chromosomes. This mechanism can serve as an internal cellular clock and as one of the factors involved in the control of cell differentiation. Some possible structures were analyzed by means of the mathematical theory of reliability and compared with the results of Hayflick's experiments on limited cells' lifetime. The external destruction of the clock mechanism can remove limitations on cell's reproductions and is considered as a cause of carcinogenesis; the model exhibits cumulative and threshold effects. The cell-labeling mechanism of the model is able to provide sometimes equivalent labeling for the initial zygote division as a necessary condition for the appearance of monozygote twins; it is most likely that this may occur only for pairs of monozygote twins with the probability equal to an integer power of 1 2. © 1981.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the relationship between the behavioral and physiological changes occurring in the hamster over the course of lactation. Experimental (E) females were given litters of six 3-day-old pups on Day 13 of lactation and allowed to raise them. Control (C) females raised their own litters of six pups. Groups of E and C females were decapitated at 1000 and 1700 hr when their pups were either 8, 18, or 28 days old. Nursing was observed for 1 hr on the 3 days prior to autopsy. Nursing behavior disappeared by Day 28 in C females. E females exhibited nursing behavior at levels equal to those observed in C females until E pups were 28 days old and 38 days had elapsed since parturition. Despite the fact that E mothers continued to nurse pups on day 18 postpartum when pups were 8 days old, E pups showed lower growth rates than did C pups. Prolactin (PRL) levels remained elevated when E pups were 8 days old even though E pups did not grow normally. PRL levels decreased over time in both C and E females and reached baseline by Day 28 although nursing behavior was still elevated in E females. Thus, nursing behavior did not stimulate PRL release during late lactation. Estradiol (E2) levels in C females remained at baseline until Day 28 when levels increased. LH, FSH, and Progesterone (P) levels in C females showed a dramatic diurnal pattern which disappeared by Day 28, when levels dropped. Levels of E2, P, LH, and FSH in E females closely paralleled those of C females only when groups were compared with respect to pup age. Thus, behavioral weaning and the return to estrous cyclicity appear to be dependent upon the age of the pups rather than the time elapsed since parturition. However, milk production and PRL release appear to be more closely tied to the number of days postpartum and can be dissociated from the amount of nursing behavior observed. © 1981.

AB  - To determine if the temporal pattern of LHsecretion changes during the days preceding the first preovulatory surge of gonadotropins, peripubertal female rats (28-37 days of age) were bled through indwelling jugular cannulae every 15 min for 3 h either in the mornings (900-1200 h) or the afternoons (1400-1700 h). In all pubertal stages plasma LH levels fluctuated in a pulsatile manner. In late juvenile rats (anestrous phase of puberty), the magnitude of the pulses in the afternoon was greater than in the morning and a drop in afternoon LH baseline levels became apparent. This pattern became established after day 28 and persisted throughout the late juvenile period and the early proestrous phase of puberty, a stage in which uterine fluid appears for the first time. During the first proestrus (late proestrous phase of puberty), morning LH levels fluctuated in a manner similar to that seen in anestrous and early proestrous animals. In the afternoon a preovulatory surge occurred, with LH levels increasing 40 times over morning values. On the next day (first estrus) the pattern of morning LH release was similar to that of prepubertal rats, but in the afternoon the greater magnitude of the pulses that had characterized the preovulatory period was not apparent. The results confirm earlier findings that tonic LH release does not increase gradually during prepubertal days as the hypothesis of the “gonadostat resetting” would have predicted. In addition, they demonstrate that during the late juvenile period (days 28-30), the afternoon mode of LH release changes, with the LH pulses acquiring greater amplitude in the presence of lower baseline values. The acquisition of this pattern of release may reflect the activation of facilitatory neural mechanisms controlling LH release and may be related, at least in part, to the changing peripubertal steroid milieu. It is conceivable that, in addition to the facilitatory effects exerted by PRL and GH on the prepubertal ovary, these previously unnoticed, subtle changes in the mode of LH release may play a role in determining the activation of the ovary that precedes the first preovulatory surge of gonadotropins. © 1981 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Daily nocturnal (N) and diurnal (D) surges of PRL are characteristic of a pseudopregnancy (psp) induced by cervical stimulation (CS). These semicircadian surges persist for 13-14 days, after which time they cease, and psp ends. The purpose of this study was to describe the involvement of the ovarian steroids in the maintenance and termination of the N and D surges of PRL. CS of long term ovariectomized (OVX) rats resulted in N and D surges of PRL lasting 14 days. By day 16 after CS, neither surge of PRL was present. The sc placement of Silastic implants containing large quantities of progesterone in long term OVX-CS rats sustained and enhanced the N surge of PRL until at least day 16. The D surge was also sustained until day 16, but its magnitude was normal. Estradiol alone was capable of maintaining the D but not the N surge for this same time interval. However, pharmacological quantities of estradiol restricted the magnitude of the N surge generated in the progesterone-implanted animal. Since neither surge of PRL was present by day 14 after CS in intact rats, but at least the nocturnal surge was still present at this time in long term or acutely OVX rats, this implies an active role of ovarian steroids in the termination of PRL surges at the end of psp. At the end of psp, luteal progesterone secretion declines and follicular estradiol secretion increases. Varying sizes of Silastic implants containing progesterone or estrogen were placed into psp animals after acute ovariectomy on day 9 to approximate this ovarian steroid secretory pattern of intact psp rats. Only when the decrease in progesterone was coupled with a modest increase in estrogen was there a total cessation of the two daily surges of PRL in OVX-CS rats. The data suggest that the PRL surges end in the intact psp rat due to the waning response to CS as well as the shifting steroid ratio represented by the fall in progesterone in the presence of a small amount of estrogen. © 1981 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Specific areas of the preoptico-suprachiasmatictuberoinfundibular system (PSTS) were microdissected at various hours on proestrus and diestrous day 1 in rats. LHRH concentrations were measured by RIA to determine if the patterns of change observed in the median eminence (ME) were paralleled by similar LHRH patterns in the remainder of the PSTS. Another group of proestrous rats received phenobarbital to block preovulatory gonadotropin surges, and LHRH concentrations in the PSTS were measured throughout the afternoon hours. Plasma concentrations of LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone were determined in all animals. Rats were decapitated on proestrus and diestrous day 1 at 0900, 1200, 1500, and 1800 h. Proestrous animals that received phenobarbital at noon were sacrificed at 1500 and 1800 h. The following brain areas were microdissected: the suprachiasmatic preoptic nucleus, medial preoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic nucleus retrochiasmatic area, arcuate nucleus, and ME. On the day of proestrus, LHRH concentrations increased between 0900–1200 h (before the gonadotropin surge), decreased between 1200–1500 h (during the surge) and remained low at 1800 h in the medial preoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, retrochiasmatic area, and median eminence. A similar trend was observed in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and suprachiasmatic preoptic nucleus, but only the drop in the suprachiasmatic preoptic nucleus, between 1200–1500 h attained statistical significance. No such patterns of change were observed on diestrous day 1. Phenobarbital blocked the LH and FSH surges but failed to prevent the afternoon decline in LHRH between 1200-1500 h in any of the brain regions examined. The morning rise and afternoon fall in LHRH may represent an increase in the synthesis and storage of the hormone which is released during the afternoon hours. The PSTS appears to function as an integrated unit, the component parts of which may be involved in synthesis, transport, storage, and the ultimate release of LHRH on proestrus. © 1981 by The Endocrine Society.

Twenty-four polygraphic recordings were obtained in 16 pregnant women at 32 and 36 weeks' gestation. FHR parameters were not predictably influenced by maternal sleep states. Cyclic changes in FHR variability with median cycle length of 53 minutes were observed. Accelerations and decelerations occurred an average of 12.2 and 4 times per 100 minutes, respectively. Bradycardia and tachycardia persisting beyond 10 minutes were not seen. FHR variability ranged from marked to decreased within recordings of the same subject; this observation has implications for nonstress testing of the fetus. © 1981, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - A critical review of the gonadotropin therapy in male infertility or hypofertility is presented. In the author's opinion, the poor and conflicting results so far obtained with this kind of treatment are mainly due to inadequate selection of the patients admitted to the treatment itself. The author stresses some points concerning the modern knowledge on the physiology of gonadotropin secretion in males; points that must be borne in mind in approaching this type of treatment, and which in some way revolutionate the old concept of “low” or “high” plasma gonadotropin levels. In this concern, the gonadotropin therapy can be applied not only to the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as for the past, but also to the spermatogenic arrests and to the idiopathic oligospermiogenesis with “normal” gonadotropin levels. The author then exposes the rigid criteria adopted in the Andrologic Center of the 5th Medical Clinic of the University of Rome for the selection of the patients to be admitted to the treatment; criteria which are based on hormonal, morphological and seminal parameters. In the final part the results are reported obtained in the selected patients with a treatment schedule with associated HMG + HCG (150–300 I.U. as FSH per week and 2000–6000 I.U. as LH per week for 12–16 weeks). The results seem very encouraging: in 85% of the patients a quantitative and qualitative amelioration of the spermatogenesis was obtained; in 30% of these cases an outcome of pregnancies in the partner has been documented so far. Moderner Zugang zur Gonadotropin‐Behandlung der Oligozoospermie Es handelt sich um eine kritische Darstellung der Gonadotropinbehandlung bei der Infertilität oder Hypofertilität des Mannes. Der Autor ist der Ansicht, daß die schlechten und widersprüchlichen Ergebnisse, die bislang mit dieser Art von Behandlung erzielt wurden, vor allem auf die inadäquate Selektion des Patientengutes für die Therapie zurückzuführen sind. Der Autor weist auf einige Punkte hin, die den heutigen Stand des Wissens über die Physiologie der Gonadotropinsekretion betreffen; Punkte, die berücksichtigt werden müssen, wenn man diese Art von Behandlung ins Auge faßt, und die nicht mehr zu dem alten Konzept von „niedrigem” und „hohem” Gonadotropinspiegel im Plasma passen. Unter diesem Aspekt kann die Gonadotropintherapie nicht nur wie schon in der Vergangenheit beim hypogonadotropen Hypogonadismus angewendet werden, sondern auch bei Reifungsstörungen wie bei der idiopathischen Oligospermiogenese mit „normalen” Gonadotropinspie‐geln. Dann bringt der Autor eine Darstellung der strengen Richtlinien, die am Andrologischen Zentrum der 5. Medizinischen Klinik der Universität Rom für die Auswahl der Patienten für diese Art von Behandlung angewendet werden. Als Parameter dienen hormonale, morphologische und strukturelle Kriterien. Im letzten Abschnitt sind die Ergebnisse zusammengefaßt, die an ausgewählten Patienten erzielt wurden, und zwar mit einer Kombinationsbehandlung von HMG + HCG (140–200 I.U. als FSH pro Woche und 2000–6000 I.U. als LH pro Woche für insgesamt 12–15 Wochen). Die Ergebnisse sind sehr ermutigend: bei 85% der Patienten ergab sich eine quantitative und auch qualitative Verbesserung der Spermatogenese; bei 30% der Fälle kam es beim Partner zu einer Schwangerschaft. 1981 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Artificial stimulation of the uterine cervix initiates a series of daily nocturnal (N) and diurnal (D) surges of PRL, which induces a prolonged luteal phase or pseudopregnancy (psp). In turn, the enhanced levels of progesterone maintain the daily PRL surges for a 12- to 13-day period. These studies describe the temporal requirement, ovarian interaction, and preliminary extraction of a PRL inhibitory factor(s) secreted by the uterus that terminates the PRL surges induced by cervical stimulation (CS). The interval over which the uterus is required for inhibition of PRL surges was determined in long term ovariectomized (OVX)-CS rats that were hysterectomized (hyst) on days 2, 4, 7, or 9 after CS. N surges of PRL were maintained until at least day 16 in all groups, whereas the N PRL surges were absent in sham-hyst controls. The D surge was prolonged only in the day 2 hyst group. These data suggest that the PRL release mechanism may be either constantly under inhibitory influence of the uterus or that such inhibition is not present until after day 9. Uteri obtained from rats on days 10–13 of psp were extracted in phosphate-buffered saline. Long term OVX-CS rats were hyst on day 4 and injected with the uterine or gut extracts on days 10–13, and blood samples were obtained on day 16 after CS. The N surge was significantly suppressed by day 16 in response to the uterine extracts. Conversely, N surges were of normal magnitude in long term OVX-CS-hyst controls receiving gut extracts. D surges were absent in both cases. This suggests that the uterine factor is extractable and may exert its inhibitory action via a blood-borne route. To determine the interaction of the ovaries and the uterus on the termination of PRL surges, CS-hyst rats were OVX on day 9 and implanted sc with progesterone and estradiol to approximate the steroid ratio that terminates PRL surges at the end of psp. This treatment effectively terminated the N and D PRL surges in rats with intact uteri. However, the N surge persisted in the absence of the uterus. These findings indicate the necessity of both the ovaries and uterus for terminating PRL surges at the end of psp.Taken together, these experiments suggest that the uterus may produce a humoral factor throughout psp that modulates the sensitivity of the PRL release mechanism within the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to the inhibitory effects of ovarian steroids. © 1981 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The preparation of iodinated insulin conserving the full biologic properties of the hormone in the early 70s permitted the direct characterization of its receptors. These are membrane glycoproteins, of molecular weight 350,000, containing four subunits which are linked by disulfide bonds. The binding of insulin to its receptor is temperature and pH dependent. The reaction does not conform to a simple reversible bimolecular model: this is due to the existence of negative cooperativity in the hormone-receptor interaction as well as to internalization and degradation of insulin by the cells at 37°C. The receptor concentration is subject to down-regulation by the hormone itself. Occupancy of binding sites is not stoichiometrically related with the biologic effects of insulin: in most tissues, there is an excess of receptors, called 'spare receptors'. Insulin binding to blood cells may be studied after their separation by density gradient centrifugation, according to Boyum. Circulating monocytes possess the highest numbers of receptors; polymorphonuclear cells, red cells and platelets also have binding sites; mature B and T lymphocytes do not bind the hormone, except after lymphoblastic transformation. In man, the assay of insulin receptor is performed on monocytes or erythrocytes. Insulin binding decreases physiologically with age; it is lower in women during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or during administration of estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives; it exhibits diurnal variation; it increases after physical training; it depends on diet, being inversely correlated with its carbohydrate content and with basal insulin concentration in plasma; finally, rapid variations in binding affinity are observed after glucose ingestion or after breakfast. Obese people are resistant to the effects of insulin and have decreased numbers of receptors on blood cells; short-term fasting induces an increase in the binding affinity, while a long-term hypocaloric diet leads to an increase in receptor numbers. Similarly non-insulin-dependent (maturity onset) diabetics, even those of normal weight, have low numbers of binding sites, which are increased by diet or after treatment by sulfonylureas. In the syndrome of insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans, there is a decrease in hormone binding, which is either primary (Type A) or secondary to the effects of circulating antibodies to the insulin receptor (Type B). In acromegaly or in insulinomas, a decrease in receptor numbers has been observed, with a simultaneous increase in receptor affinity. In liver cirrhosis, in acute viral diseases and in periodic hypokalemic paralysis the binding of insulin is decreased. Variable results have been reported in cases of lipoatrophic diabetes, leprechaunism, uremia and glucocorticoid administration. Finally, an increase in insulin receptors has been observed in anorexia nervosa, which fits well with the increased sensitivity to the hormone in patients with this disease; similar results have been described in insulinopenic diabetes. At present, methods of assay of the insulin receptors on blood cells are impeded by the heterogeneity both of the tracer and of the cell preparations. Improvement in the near future can be expected from the use of more purified iodinated insulin as well as better methods of cell separation. Simultaneous measurement of insulin binding and action in vitro may also become possible.

AB  - Heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been associated with retardation of fetal growth and abnormal fetal development. Pregnant women whose offspring are at risk because of alcohol abuse can be identified and counselled by health professionals providing prenatal care. Offspring born to women who had been drinking heavily and subsequently abstained from or reduced their intake of alcohol before the third trimester demonstrated improvement in growth and in regulation of sleep-awake states. The existing health care delivery system can be modified in a cost-effective manner to treat pregnant women who are problem drinkers. Physicians' attitudes and behaviour are critical for the success of this strategy.

AB  - The eye can be visualized ultrasonically in more than 90 percent of fetuses 16 through 42 weeks of gestational age. Slow eye movements are present by 16 weeks. Rapid eye movements begin at 23 weeks and become more frequent between 24 and 35 weeks. Eye inactivity becomes more common after 36 weeks and is associated with sustained diaphragmatic excursions implying a "quiet sleep" state. Pathologic eye movements were seen in four fetuses with dysmorphic brain structure. Copyright © 1981 AAAS.

AB  - Several interdisciplinary aspects relating to the maturation of central nervous functions and to the possible beginning of mental life in the foetus have been discussed. Particular attention has been paid to (i) the motor functions present in the foetus at early stages of development and characterized by phasic and tonic, spontaneous and reflex movements; (ii) the sensory functions that endow the foetus with the possibility of being receptive to stimuli that reach him from the maternal container in a rhythmic constant form; (iii) the integrative functions shown by a state of active sleep with movements of the eyes (certainly present after the 28-30th week of pregnancy) and of the body. In analogy with what happens in the mature brain, the hypothesis has been made that active sleep constitutes a 'biological framework' within which the sensory experiences coming through the maternal container are transformed by the foetus into 'internal representations'. Such an operation would constitute the beginning of a protomental activity in evolution, which would build itself around a nucleus of an instinctual nature transmitted genetically from the parents in the form of representations. The analogies that this prenatal psychic nucleus might have with preconceptions have also been discussed, as well as the role that can be attributed to active sleep in favouring the maturation of the psychological function of the 'skin' which in turn may be able to contain the Self of the child and to protect it from disintegrating under the pressure of the impulses that come into play at the moment of birth.

AB  - Four infants with episodic silent complete obstructed apnea are described. All had central sleep apnea, three had hypoventilation, and none had obstructive apnea observed on polygraphic recordings. Two infants were siblings of a sudden infant death syndrome victim and one was a sibling of a 'near miss' infant. One infant died as a result of a prolonged episode that began while she was awake. In two infants apnea has been controlled with theophylline administration and in the third infant resolution of the episode was temporally related to atropine administration.

AB  - Many studies have dealt with the health variables of drinking among teenagers, but few have looked at Black adolescents. Data from a sample of 728 males and females aged eleven to sixteen indicated that drinkers were more likely to report health problems. The correlation between drinking and poor health was most noted among young males and older females. Drinkers reported more sleep disturbances. Tobacco use was the most positive predictor of drinking among males and pregnancy for females.

AB  - Premature infants have frequent apneic spells, which in some cases are triggered by airway obstruction or increases in respiratory load. The response of the preterm infant to increased respiratory loads has not been adequately studied. Utilizing the airway occlusion technique, we determined the percent prolongation of the occluded, compared with the preceding unoccluded breath, in 58 newborns (gestational age 28-41 wk) during the first days of life. A significant correlation was found between gestational age and percent prolongation of inspirations (r = 0.76). At 29 wk gestation, prolongation was zero and increased up to 55% at term. The low mean prolongation obtained in the very premature infants can be explained by the large number of these infants who responded with a shortening of their inspiratory time during airway occlusion. This response may be secondary to the intercostal phrenic inhibitory reflex, which inhibits inspiration when distortions of the chest wall occur. The shortening of inspiration during airway occlusion in many premature newborns reflects their inability to tolerate respiratory loads and may contribute to the high incidence of apnea in these infants. The progressive increase in prolongation with gestational age reflects the maturation of the respiratory system toward the more stable respiratory function of the full-term neonate.

AB  - To demonstrate the presence of discriminable awake states in preterm infants, facial behaviors and visual fixation to a single patterned stimulus were recorded. Five healthy preterm infants born at a mean of 29 weeks' gestation were followed from 30 to 35 weeks' postmenstrual age. Behaviors (eye openness, movements, mouthing, and vocalizations) were recorded simultaneously with visual fixation measured by the corneal reflection technique. Test time was determined by the duration of time the infant remained awake before crying or closing eyes. The presence of both quiet awakeness and drowsiness was demonstrated. Younger infants spent more time in drowsiness, whereas older infants had more quiet awakeness. Visual pattern fixation was observed as early as 30 weeks. Fixation time increased with increasing postmenstrual age. More fixation was observed during quiet awakeness than during drowsiness.

AB  - 20 patients have been monitored over a period of six months in order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of triazolam in the treatment of chronic and sometimes refractory insomnia. The treatment group consisted of 12 chronic in-patients of a specialized institution and eight out-patients treated by a psychiatrist. There were two female drop-outs: one did not show up anymore for unknown reasons, in the other a pregnancy was diagnosed during the third week of treatment. We have found that the optimum mean dosis stabilizes approximately around 0.5 mg of triazolam given as a single dosis in the evening: slightly higher for the in-patients and slightly lower for the out-patients. This state of stabilisation is always attained as from the second month and is achieved in a period between four and six months. The tolerance appeared to be excellent; only one fourth of the patients described the classical benzodiazepine side-effects which never warranted discontinuation of treatment. The efficacy appeared to remain constant after establishing the optimum dosage for every patient. Indeed, after the second month the same dosage could be continued in all patients without any need to increase it in order to maintain the desired effect.

AB  - Antisera from inbred mice (C57BL and C3H) improve the specificity of the microimmunofluorescence test. We used this method in the serotyping of 6 strains of Chlamydia psittaci of differing origin. Inspite of relatively marked cross-reactions it was possible to distinguish 3 groups: the first group consisted of 2 strains of avian origin and the LGV strain 33L; the second group consisted of 2 strains responsible for enzootic abortion in ewes; and in the third, only 1 strain was found; this belonged to the meningopneumonitis group. The results suggest than C. psittaci has a more complex antigenic structure than does C. trachomatis.

AB  - This study examined fetal heart rate (FHR) variables during maternal sleep in subsequent siblings of infants who died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and who are thus at increased statistical risk for SIDS, and controls. Four findings differentiated the tracings of subsequent siblings of SIDS infants and controls: 1) FHR variability in subsequent siblings of SIDS infants ranged between 11 and 25 beats/min, compared with 6 to 10 beats/min in controls (P<.001). 2) Bradycardia was more frequent in subsequent siblings of SIDS infants. 3) FHR accelerations (more than 150 beats/min) followed by heart rates below 120 beats/min were elevated in subsequent siblings of SIDS infants (P<.01). 4) Strong respiratory arrhythmia was more frequent in subsequent siblings of SIDS infants. These siblings exhibited more reactive FHR patterns. Although these data cannot be interpreted as clinical markers identify the infant who will die of SIDS, they are compatible with the hypothesis that mild chronic hypoxia is associated with risk for SIDS. © 1981, by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that decreased estrogen levels accomplished by removing the ovaries affect the response to acutely administered alcohol in female mice. Sensitivity to alcohol was measured in ovariectomized, sham-operated, and non-surgical control C3H/HEN mice. Each animal received an IP injection of alcohol (3.0 or 4.0 g/kg). Core temperature, fall time, sleeptime, and waking blood alcohol levels were the dependent variables. For each of these measures, alcohol sensitivity was found to be a function of the dose of alcohol administered, but not the surgical condition. Additionally, the stage of estrus in control animals was not found to be related to alcohol sensitivity. © 1981.

AB  - Clinical effects of thiopentone (3 mg/kg body weight) and diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) were compared for elective caesarean sections in two groups of 43 and 39 women, respectively. They were given general anaesthesia in left lateral tilt. The systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were moderately elevated at onset of surgery in both groups, probably indicating light anaesthesia. Later, a gradual decrease to the preinduction levels was observed. The mean injection‐delivery (I‐D) interval was 344 s in the thiopentone group and 339 s in the diazepam group. The I‐D intervals were shorter than 10 min in 39 of the cases in the thiopentone group and 38 cases in the diazepam group. Low Apgar scores at 1 min (6 or less) occurred in five of the neonates in each group, while all had normal Apgar scores at 5 min (7 or more). Asjudged by the Apgar scores and the acid‐base status of umbilical cord blood, the effects of the induction agents on the neonatal condition were indistinguishable in the two groups. In the thiopentone group, unpleasant recollections were reported in 5 out of 40 patients (12.5%), compared to none in the diazepam group. Diazepam‐nitrous oxide anaesthesia is well accepted by the mothers and is an alternative to supplementing thiopentone induction with a volatile gas for patients who have previously experienced wakefulness or express fear of awareness. The main drawback with diazepam induction, however, is the slow induction of sleep. Harmful drug effects on the neonates must be expected if the dose has to be increased in order to ensure sleep. © 1981 Munksgaard, Copenhagen

AB  - This report describes a radioimmunoassay (RIA) method for the combined measurement of four steroid sulfoconjugates and their four unconjugated counterparts in maternal and fetal ovine plasma: pregnenolone (Δ5P), 17-hydroxypregnenolone (17Δ5P), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and estrone (E1). In the procedure a preliminary ether extraction is utilized to isolate the unconjugated steroids followed by salting out, ethyl acetate extraction, and mineral acid solvolysis of the remaining sulfated steroids. The hydrolyzed sulfoconjugates are then separated chromatographically and measured in a manner identical to their unconjugated counterparts. The combined measurement of these eight steroids in single samples of fetal and maternal ovine plasma has not been reported previously, and plasma concentrations of these steroids were heretofore unknown. Since no previous data was available for comparison, rigorous specificity evaluation of this RIA system was required prior to its use for physiologic studies and the reporting of concentrations in this species. © 1981.

AB  - In 1955 a population study in Uppsala comprising about 9,000 school children showed that migraine increased from 1.4% at the age of seven to 5.3% at fifteen. With increasing age there was an increasing predominance of girls. A matched comparison between 73 children with more pronounced migraine and 73 control children showed a greater tendency in the migraine group to abdominal pain, motion sickness, sleep disturbance and orthostatic symptoms. In a longitudinal study lasting 23 years the 73 migraine children were followed-up until all were over 30 years of age. During puberty and as young adults 62% were free from migraine for at least two years. Of these, 22% again suffered migraine regularly. Thus, 60% had migraine attacks at 30. Girls seem to have a greater relapse rate than boys. Most of the girls with classical migraine were headache free during pregnancy. Every third family with one parent belonging to the migraine group and with children over four years of age had one child with migraine symptoms. Migraine seems to be more frequently inherited via the mother, and to girls. © 1981, International Headache Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of the carotid bodies on fetal breathing activity in utero and on the establishment of postnatal breathing was studied. The electrocorticogram, the electromyogram of the lateral rectus and postural muscles, and tracheal and arterial pressures were monitored on chronically prepared intact and carotid sinus-denervated fetal lambs. The denervated fetuses required a longer time for recovery from the operation, but thereafter the sleeping and breathing behavior was similar to that of the control group. Four of the carotid sinus-denervated fetuses were allowed to be delivered spontaneously, and all established regular postnatal respiration despite conclusive evidence of nonfunctional carotid bodies. These experiments indicate that the fetal carotid chemoreceptors are not essential for the spontaneous intrauterine breathing activity during rapid-eye-movement sleep nor for the establishment of effective breathing at birth.

AB  - 60 patients, who had given their consent to participation in this study, 17 women and 43 men, of an average age of 42 years and an average body weight of 71 kg, were randomly allocated to 3 premedication groups: 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum®), check administered p.o., the product was compared with meprobamate and placebo in patients undergoing surgery on the following day. The study covered a total of 83 patients, 57 women and 26 men, 67 of whom where undergoing maxillofacial surgery and 16 gynaecological operations, and was carried out by comparison, in parallel series, of single doses of midazolam (15 mg) with meprobamate (250 mg) and placebo, according to the double-placebo method. The patients, both male and female, whose ages ranged from 18 to 60 years, were included in the study with no distinction between those with sleep disturbances and those without. The criteria for exclusion from the study were pregnancy, allergic states, psychoses, pain and severe deficiency syndromes. A total of 29 variables concerning sleeping and waking, time required to fall asleep, duration and quality of the sleep and the patient's condition on waking, were selected for assessment of the results. The codes were not broken until the end of the trial and the data were analysed statistically by means of the χ2 test. 27 patients received placebo (Group A), 26 midazolam (Group B) and 30 meprobamate (Group C). There were no significant differences between the three groups with regard to sex, age, body weight, heart rate, insomnia, use and dosage of hypnotics and the patients' opinion of their effectiveness. The results of this study show the following: 1. Midazolam and meprobamate lead to a shorter delay in the onset of sleep than does placebo, the time required to fall asleep being shorter with midazolam than with meprobamate. As assessed by the patients themselves, the time required to fall asleep was 103±14 min in Group A, 35±6.08 min in Group B and 68±7.48 min in Group C (A-B, p = 0.00016; A-C, p = 0.0368; B-C, p = 0.0368). The assessments are confirmed by the objective surveillance of the patients, which showed that after 30 min 42% of the subjects of Group B were asleep, compared with 14.8% of those of Group A and 6.6% of those of Group C (A-B, p = 0.026; B-C, p = 0.00016). 2. The mean duration of sleep, as reported by the patients, was longer in Groups B (7.5 h) and C (7.03 h) than in Group A (5.8 h) (A-B, p = 0.006; A-C, p = 0.023). 3. The patients' feeling on walking, in the sence of 'well/unwell' were comparable in Groups A and B, but more 'well' in Group C (A-B, p &gt; 0.05; C-B, p = 0.028; C-A, p = 0.007). This assessment is not, however, confirmed by the physician's evaluation, which only mentions a sensation of physician's evaluation, which only mentions a sensation of 'malaise' in Group A, in relation to Group B (p = 0.05) and Group C (p = 0.005).

AB  - Nitrazepam is one of the oldest benzodiazepines and is widely used as an hypnotic throughout the world, except North America, where it is not available. It is a safe hypnotic, with low acute toxicity and minor side effects. Development of tolerance or dependence and withdrawal symptoms are rare and very few known interactions with other drugs exist. The absorption of nitrazepam from the gastrointestinal tract is fairly rapid (tmax ranging 0.5 to 7 hours). The bioavailability after oral intake averages about 80%. Maximum plasma concentrations after a single 5mg dose are of the order of 40ng/ml. As a lipophilic drug, nitrazepam is distributed rapidly in the body. The plasma levels can be fitted to a 2-compartment open model. The α-phase is rather rapid and the elimination phase is characterised by a long half-life of about 30 hours; accumulation with daily use therefore occurs. Marked interindividual variation (up to 10-fold) is found in all pharmacokinetic parameters. Age and immobilising diseases may influence the parameters, evidently increasing Vdβ and t1/2β A similar amount of protein-free drug found in the plasma, i.e. 10 to 15% of the total plasma level, is found in the cerebrospinal fluid. In saliva the concentrations are significantly smaller. Nitrazepam penetrates the human placenta. In early pregnancy, the ratio of cord to maternal plasma concentration is about 0.5, 12 hours after drug administration. In late pregnancy, the ratio reaches 1 within a few hours. Breast milk concentrations are about one-half of those in maternal plasma. Nitrazepam has no clinically active metabolites. It is excreted mainly as conjugated and non-conjugated 7-aminonitrazepam and 7-acetamidonitrazepam. Polymorphic acetylation is not likely to be of clinical importance. Enzyme induction or significant loss of efficacy have not been found with long term use. There is no significant correlation between plasma concentrations and clinical effects (or side effects) of nitrazepam. Plasma level monitoring is therefore of no benefit clinically (except for special cases, e.g. in epileptic patients). Increased responsiveness in terms of therapeutic effects and side effects is evident in the elderly. Therefore, small doses not exceeding 5mg daily should be prescribed for geriatric patients. © 1981, ADIS Press Australasia Pty Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Even though the anesthetic agents thiopental, ketamine, propanidid and etomidate all belong to very different chemical families they are all characterized by a very large degree of liposolubility. This explains their rapid penetration into the brain. The pharmacokinetic model of thiopental is a three compartment model. There is strong protein binding and only the free fraction is active. The very short action of the product after a single injection is due to the rapid redistribution of the agent into the muscle mass because its hepatic metabolization is very slow. However, when given over prolonged time the adipose compartment plays an important role in the mixture of the product, explaining the prolonged sleep produced. The central depressant actions of thiopental and consequently its action on CMRO2 depend on the initial dose and the route of administration. A single and massive injection produces a small and temporary reduction in the CMRO2 even though the plasmic concentration is high. In contrast prolonged intravenous infusion produces more severe and longer lasting depression of the CMRO2. The pharmacokinetic model of ketamine is tri-compartmental. There is weak protein binding. After IV injection ketamine rapidly enters the brain and the maximum concentration is reached one minute later. After that the cerebral concentration rapidly falls as does the plasma level. Signs of waking are seen at a concentration of 30 μg per gram of tissue. An increase in the dose of ketamine does not much influence the duration of analgesia but does influence the increase of the waking time. This suggests that its indication in ambulatory anesthesia should be looked at with care. It is metabolized by the liver with the formation of several metabolites of which some are active. The kinetics of propanidid can be explained on the basis of a monocompartmental model. The speed of the fall in plasma level of the product is related to the speed of injection. High plasma concentrations mobilize a larger quantity of plasma pseudo-cholinesterases, increasing thus the speed of degradation. The product is rapidly hydrolyzed (plasma and liver cholinesterases). The duration of action is longer when used at low doses or when it is administered at a constant dose. Propanidid does not have any accumulative effect. The kinetics of etomidate follow a tri-compartmental model. It is very rapidly and widely distributed in the organism, the peak cerebral concentration being reached in less than one minute. There is strong protein binding. Repeated administration of the drug produces an increase in anesthetic sleep but also a delay in recovery. Etomidate is hydrolyzed by hepatic esterases. Thiopental, ketamine, propanidid and etomidate traverse the placental barrier.

AB  - 121 cases of neonatal convulsions, including 79 cases of status epilepticus and 42 cases of isolated convulsions are studied. The great number of premature infants (40/121 newborns born before a gestational age of 37 weeks) must be pointed out. The clinical symptoms and EEG activity occurring during the first 24 hours following the onset of convulsions are analysed. Their descriptions confirm previous ones. Comparison of the populations of preterm and term infants demonstrates that the pre- and post-ictal neurological states are equally severe in both groups and that there is no difference between groups in the more or less precocious onset of convulsions. The value of the interictal EEG already described in status epilepticus of term infants as predicting a poor prognosis, is confirmed. In addition, the very poor prognosis of an abnormal EEG pattern of the premature newborn, i.e. an EEG lacking any pattern corresponding to any gestational age, is demonstrated. Such EEGs of very poor prognosis have been detected in 46 cases. They reveal the degree of severity of the cerebral lesions, EEG abnormalities and cerebral lesions varying with gestational age. This study confirms the relatively mild severity of isolated convulsions as compared to status epilepticus. It demonstrates the severity of convulsions in premature newborns and of the electrographical discharges without simultaneous clinical event. The prognostic value of the absence or presence of a sleep cycle as early as the 24 hours following the onset of convulsions must be noted. Most of the nonatal convulsions are secondary to birth hypoxia or asphyxia and to meningo-encephalitis. In this study the small number of seizures due to metabolic factors is striking and contrasts with their great frequency in other series. The cause of the seizures is unknown in 12% of the cases: some of these cases of unknown origin correspond to the description of the 'convulsions of the 5th day'. The prognosis in full-term newborns has been improved greatly in recent years, probably due to improvement in obstetrical and neonatal intensive care. © 1981 Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam.

AB  - Real-time scanners have permitted investigators to measure fetal breathing movements during pregnancy in humans. It has been demonstrated that fetal breathing movements are episodic and occur about 30% of the time during the last 10 wk of pregnancy. Design of studies must account for the episodic nature of fetal breathing movements. It will be important to account for the relationship of fetal breathing movements to maternal meals, time of day, and gestational age of fetuses. Furthermore, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and drugs may alter fetal breathing measurements. Finally, fetal breathing movements are absent during accelerated labor and may normally be diminished during the last 3 days prior to spontaneous term labor. Measurement of fetal breathing movements using real-time scanners has helped to understand circadian rhythms in fetal life and may ultimately be of use in the assessment of fetal health. It is important that much more information be obtained concerning factors that normally influence fetal breathing movements before proper strategies can be suggested for the use of these measurements in the clinical assessment of fetal health.

AB  - The concentration of blood and plasma glucose in developing, pregnant and post-partum rats has been determined under uniform conditions of housing, feeding and circadian rhythms. The glucose content of erythrocytes and of the plasma compartment has been estimated using the packed cell hematocrit value as a correction factor. During pregnancy and fetal development there were significant reductions in the proportion of intracellular glucose, and significant increases during the suckling and weaning period. There was no direct relationship with plasma insulin levels. Results are discussed in relation to aspects of metabolism specific to the physiological components of the breeding cycle studied; plasma glucose homeostasis is held very constant; both intraerythrocytic and plasma concentrations should be considered when studying glucose homeostasis in given physiological situations.

AB  - By the development of highly specific antisera against estrone (E1), estradiol-17β (E2) and estriol (E3) a radioimmunoassay method for the measurement of these homones in maternal blood has been established without preceding chromatographic separation steps. The mean serum level of unconjugated E1, E2 and E3 during the luteal phase amounts to 0.58 ± 0.17 ng/ml (E1), 0.32 ± 0.13 ng/ml (E2) and 0.08 ± 0.02 ng/ml (E3), resp. Until the end of gestation the values rise to 14.3 ± 6.8 ng/ml (E1), 16.0 ± 4.3 ng/ml (E2) and 14.1 ± 4.6 ng/ml (E3). The fluctuations of the unconjugated estrogens, especially E3, exhibit over short and long periods a mean coefficient of variation between 14 and 16%, a significant circadian rhythm being only evident for E1. The surveillance of early pregnancy by determination of estrogens in maternal blood is only of limited diagnostic values, since in the first weeks of gestation estrogen synthesis does not only take place in the placenta but also in the ovary. In the second half of pregnancy especially unconjugated E3 seems to be an excellent parameter for assessment of feto-placental function and thereby the detection of fetal risks. However, determinations in blood must be specific for E3, since the share of unconjugated E3 as compared to the concentration of free E1 and E2 is only 30% and the measurement of E1 and/or E2 for the surveillance of the feto-placental function is only of limited value. Comparing studies of the urinary excretion of total estrogens and inconjugated E3 in blood in 1166 pregnancies demonstrate that either determination gives the same correct information of the fetal state. Our results show that the eminent value of the measurement of E3 has to be seen in the detection of intrauterine growth retardation. This is possible at an early stage in 70-75%.

AB  - Everted gut sac technique was used to study diurnal fluctuations of active calcium transport in the intestine of pregnant and lactating rats maintained under 12 hours light-dark cycle. At the second and third week of gestation an increase of calcium transport occurred in duodenum and adjacent part of jejunum at light phase, but the transport remained unchanged at darkness. Simultaneously the length of jejunal region able for active transport increased. In pregnant females around the term and ion lactating mothers no diurnal differences in calcium transport were seen and at the 21st day of lactation the transport was nearly equal in both duodenum and proximal jejunum. Restricted to darkness feeding of lactating rat evoked diurnal differences in jejunal but not in the duodenal transport.

High-continuity testing of drinking water consumption proved helpful in devising an automatic measurement system for time-dependent and quantity-dependent recording of drinking water consumption of litters and mothers.

AB  - Experiments were designed to investigate whether the metabolic responses of pregnant females are in keeping with the known state of gestational hyperinsulinemia. Groups of female rats fed a 32% protein diet were killed on days 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 of pregnancy, during either daytime or during night-time. Liver pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were increased over nonpregnant values from day 13 onward in agreement with what can be expected as a result of the gestational hyperinsulinemia. Liver malate dehydrogenase (NADP) activity was increased to a lesser extent and later. Pyruvate and lactate accumulated in maternal liver from day 13 onward. The fact that this accumulation could not be related to any further increase of food intake during this time and that it correlated at day 21 with litter size was taken as an indication of a probable contribution of the conceptus to maternal pyruvate and lactate accumulation in late pregnancy. Liver alanine aminotransferase activity decreased as pregnancy progressed. No change in serine dehydratase activity was found. Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase activity remained unchanged. Mitochondrial activity increased as pregnancy progressed.

AB  - In 100 patients with trophoblastic tumors the functional activity of the adrenal cortex was examined before and after chemotherapy. Androgen-producing function of the adrenal cortex was found to be reduced as well as the absolute number of excreted 17-ketosteroids separate fractions and their ratio. The glucocorticoid function of the adrenal cortex shows a monotonous character. Only in patients having uterine chorion-epithelioma with metastases a reliable reduction of the fraction of 11-hydroxy-17-ketosteroids is noted before and after chemotherapy, while the per cent content of free 17-oxy-corticoid fraction is increased with regard to their total amount. Successful chemotherapy, associated with a lower titre of chorionic gonadotropins up to its complete disappearance, does not result in normalization of values characterizing the functional activity of the adrenal cortex.

AB  - The interaction of the slow rhythmic oscillations in the 15-35 cpm range in the biological activity of the vegetative nerves with the respiratory cycle is studied under chronic conditions. It is found that under normal physiological conditions, without any influence, in the ongoing activity of the vegetative nerves, the rhythmic oscillations occur in 2% of the recordings and in only 0.3% are they in a 1:1 relation with the respiratory cycle. The state of stress of the animals resulting from prolonged natural interoceptive influences (post-parturition period) leads to changes in the adjustment of the vegetative nervous system, whereby the activity of the vegetative nerves is permanently synchronized with respiration. Experiments with different interoceptive stimuli show the role of interoceptive influences for the triggering of a system which synchronizes the activity of the vegetative nerves with the respiratory cycle. The synchronization is examined as a mechanism guaranteeing effective interaction in the vegetative nervous system upon increased demands to the organism.

AB  - Three cases of patients suffering prolactin adenoma (2 women and 1 man) and 2 cases of amenorrhea after oral contraceptive are reported. They present certain common features: the existence of amenorrhea or impotence in the man; a collapse in the basic levels of antehypophysial hormones; the normality of visual fields and the beneficient effect of bromocriptine. Individual characteristics are noted: in the cases of adenoma, the existence or not of a spontaneous galactorrhea and an insufficiency in other antehypophysial hormones; the association with Parkinson's disease; the form of treatment and subsequent evolution (in 2 cases with operation the prolactin levels remain high, whereas in one case, treated straight away with bromocriptine, the hPRL levels become normal); for the hyperprolactinemia cases, after oral contraception, one case is suspected of being microadenoma. An awareness of prolactin physiology is necessary to better understand understand the complex interrelations between prolactin and the aminergic systems of diencephalon on the one hand, and the other hormones, notably steroids and thyroids on the other. The study of receptor systems, the more ubiquitous characteristic of the actions of hPRL correlated with the clinical and experimental observations, leads to better understanding of physiological or pathological phenomena, which were poorly understood until recently. Our cases presented here are analysed in the light of a clinical study bearing on 235 cases of galactorrhea.

AB  - In the first experiment blood samples were taken once a fortnight at 7 a.m., 10 a.m., 1 p.m. or 4 p.m.. In the second experiment samples were taken twice a week at an interval of 1, 2, 4 or 7 days. Significant individual variations were observed for lipids (79%), serum glutamic oxalacetic transminase (SGOT, 59%), urea (40%) and glucose (34%), but not for non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) or beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). Concentration of the blood constituents analyzed varied according to the time of sampling and during the week, except for lipids, albuminemia and SGOT. Levels of BHB and glucose rose steadily until 1 p.m. whereas urea increased rapidly from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. By contrast, NEFA decreased strongly between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. Concentration of blood glucose, BHB and NEFA did not vary with energetic balance when nutriment requirements were covered. The results of these experiments indicate the importance of respecting standardized conditions for blood sampling with ruminants, in particular regarding the time of feeding.

AB  - The question is discussed whether odontological manipulations are permissible during pregnancy and menstruation, whether contraindications exist and whether precautionary measures should be taken. For many decades it has been a much-debated question, and not only among laymen, whether odontological treatment or extractions during pregnancy may bring about abortion and whether even minor odontological interventions, impairing the general condition and sleep, may endanger pregnancy.

AB  - Pregnant and nonpregnant female rats were fed diets containing either 25% casein (adequate) or 7.5% casein (low protein). The diets were fed in different combinations over two periods during pregnancy, namely days 4-12 and days 13-21. During these two periods, groups were given sequences of either adequate-adequate, adequate-low, low-adequate or low-low protein diets. Behavioral observations were made both in the breeding cage of each rat and in an open area (field) on days 15 and 20 of pregnancy. Pregnancy by itself caused a number of behavioral changes including reduced general activity, increased grooming and increased time sleeping. The protein level of the diet at the time of testing was found to affect behavior but not the protein level of the diet fed previously. In the breeding cage, low dietary protein reduced ventromedial grooming in pregnant rats, a behavior related to mammary development in preparation for lactating. In the open field, rearing on the hind legs was decreased among pregnant animals on the low-protein diet, a finding which may be associated with loss of muscle substance. Both of these behavioral changes have implications for the ability of the female to subsequently raise her offspring as well as to interact with her environment during pregnancy.

AB  - Observations such as those reviewed help define the ontogeny of the fetal and neonatal respiratory system. Obviously, the central and motor pathways of the fetal respiratory systems are active 'in utero' and respiration at birth is part of a continuing process. At the time of birth marked changes take place within the respiratory system leading to a stabilization of respiratory activity and alterations in the processes which control the species' response to hypoxia and carbon dioxide. The striking intervention of periods of diaphragmatic silence as term approaches with periods similar to activity state changes within the central nervous system, emphasizes the important role that the higher neural centers play in the control of fetal respiratory activity. The characteristics of the activity of the fetal diaphragm when it is operating changes little over the last third of gestation suggesting in simple terms a central 'state' generator acting on an otherwise continuously oscillating network of central respiratory neurones. 'In utero' where peripheral afferent input is reduced, the respiratory neurones require the input of an 'active central nervous system' to operate in a behavioral mode (REM sleep). However after birth even when the central nervous system is in a 'quiet' metabolic mode of operation, e.g., non-REM sleep, peripheral afferent input is sufficient to reduce the threshold of the respiratory neurones to permit them to operate. Fetal respiratory activity 'in utero' permits not only neuromuscular and skeletal development of the respiratory system to take place but enables appropriate respiratory epithelial development of the gas exchanging surfaces of the lung.

AB  - The possible effects of work and rest in pregnancy were assessed in a group of women with premature births, intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal mortality and other major disorders. From the results it can be concluded that women who work during pregnancy show an increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation, perinatal mortality and major malformations. The risk of intrauterine growth retardation applies mainly to work carried out in a standing position. With regard to the risk of a premature birth, a higher risk level was shown by women who walked a lot in their work during the 2nd trimester. Lifting heavy loads and travelling regularly by bus also appeared to increase risks. Although seven to 10 hours of sleep are suggested as optimal, further research is necessary to assess the risks of too much and too little sleep.

AB  - The sleep of 52 children suffering from febrile seizures were recorded. Their waking EEGs were free of epileptic activity. Only a few patients fell asleep without medication, the majority received 2 mg/kg body weight of promazine hydrochloride. Epileptic activity occurred in the sleep EEG of 15 out of 52 patients (29%). Exclusively short generalized paroxysms of high amplitude, mostly irregular and partially abortive 3-4/sec spike-wave complexes and occasional 2.5/sec sharp-slow-wave complexes were recorded. Epileptic discharges were detected in the B stage in 11 patients, in the C stage in 10 patients, in the A stage in 7 patients and in the stage D in two patients. They were recorded more often in cases where more than one seizure had occurred, and where the patients were more than two years of age. Generalized spikes and waves were also seen most frequently in the case of so-called complicated febrile convulsions. Although there were differences in the cases of females, in incidences of a family history of seizures and delayed toilet training, these were not statistically significant. Likewise, a complicated pregnancy and birth as well as a delayed stato-motoric development showed no correlation. These results together with other findings justify the conclusion that the majority of febrile convulsions should be classified among the primary generalized epilepsies.

AB  - Multiunit activity (MUA) of the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) was recorded on freely moving 1 to 21-day-old young as well as adult rats. Consistent state-dependent changes in the frequency of amplitude discriminated cell discharges were observed in association with wakefulness and sleep cycle from the first day of life, and MRF neuron populations were found to gain adult-like functional characterisatics of spontaneous activity by the 9th-11th postnatal day. MRF units were capable of responding to somatosensory, visual and acoustic stimulation by a significant activation from Day 1. As development proceeded, rat of responsiveness appeared to increase; however, MUA responses to different sensory modalities exhibited different developmental time-courses. High rate of responsiveness to somatosensory stimulation was characteristic of the newborn rat. Magnitude of somatosensory responses increased remarkably during the first three postnatal days reaching adult values around this age and only moderate alteration of response patterns could be detected afterwards. The MRF MUA responses to visual and acoustic stimulation increased during the first week of life and, following a striking decline of responsiveness occurring at the time of opening of eyes and external auditory meati (Day 13), visual and acoustic responses achieved adult properties by the 17th-19th postnatal day.

AB  - Mammalian fetuses make intermittent breathing movements. At birth, there is a change in the control of respiration and these intermittent breathing movements become continuous. In normal fetal lambs, the species in which most studies of fetal breathing movements (FBM) have been done, FBM are rapid and irregular, occur about 40% of the time, and only when the fetal electrocorticogram (ECoG) shows low voltage fast activity (LVFA), consistent with rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. A variety of exogenous stimuli have been shown to influence FBM; however, the factors that control FBM are unknown, as are the factors responsible for the change in the control of respiration that occurs at birth. In human infants with certain types of congenital heart disease, infusions of E-type prostaglandins have been used to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus. Apnea occurs as a complication of this therapy, especially with the use of PGE2 and this raises the possibility of an association between prostaglandins and the control of respiration. Such an association is supported by recent studies in fetal lambs which show that inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis have a marked stimulatory effect on FBM.

AB  - These studies were undertaken to determine the role palyed by the upper airway, and in particular the larynx, in the regulation of breathing during sleep in the developing animal. Initial observations in lambs showed that the adductor muscles of the larynx, unlike the abductor muscles, were profoundly influenced by behavioral state and were potentially important in the regulation of the expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. Previous studies of laryngeal function have placed little emphasis on the respiratory role of adductor muscles, probably because they are rendered inactive by surgical levels of anesthesia (Eyzaguirre and Taylor, 1963; Sherry and Megirian, 1974). Recently it has become apparent that respiratory frequency is largely regulated through adjustment of expiratory, rather than inspiratory, time and that expiration is by no means the passive process that it was once considered to be (Remmers and Bartlett, 1977).

AB  - Two developmental milestones establish the ability of the newly born infant to adapt to and survive in the atmosphere outside the uterus: Prenatal maturation of the lung surfactant system, which permits introduction and retention of air in the previously liquid-filled lungs, and formation of the capacity to generate and maintain spontaneous breathing movements, which establishes alveolar ventilation at birth. Failure of either is altogether the most common cause of illness and death of the newborn infant, particularly the prematurely born, 'preterm' infant. Failure of the surfactant system produces respiratory distress syndrome and, perhaps, other peripheral pulmonary syndromes. Failure to establish sustained regular breathing is the sign of disturbed mechanisms of respiratory control, the topic of this review.

AB  - 1. Electrocorticogram (ECoG), electromyogram (EMG) of the lateral rectus and antigravity muscles (neck and masseter) and breathing activity (FB) were monitored in chronically prepared fetal sheep of 125-140 days gestation and in newborn lambs up to 11 days postnatal age. 2. Awake state (AW), non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) were defined using standard criteria for ECoG, eye movements and postural muscle tone. 3. The percentage of time the fetuses spent in each state was: NREM sleep 53%, REM sleep 41.4%, and AW 5.6%. 4. Spontaneous intrauterine breathing activity occurred only during REM sleep, but 35% of REM sleep was not associated with FB. 5. Gasps (isolated deep inspirations) appeared occasionally throughout the recording and were not related to any specific sleep state or wakefulness. 6. In the fetus, the monosynaptic reflex (MSR) induced by direct electrical stimulation of the fibular nerve was enhanced by about 75% during REM sleep compared to NREM and AW. In the newborn lamb the adult pattern of suppression of MSR during REM sleep was not seen until several days after birth. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - 1. The respiratory response to electrical stimulation of the nose, tail, gum and fibular nerve (nonspecific somatic stimulation) was tested in chronically instrumented fetal lambs during sleep and wakefulness. 2. The respiratory response to somatic stimulation was greatest during REM sleep, lowest during NREM sleep, and intermediate during the awake state (AW). 3. Respiratory responses could follow electrical somatic stimulation up to 2 Hz in any sleep state without changing sleep state. 4. The fetal breathing (FB) response to repetitive stimulation depended on the initial sleep state and whether or not the sleep state was affected by the stimulation. Five patterns of response were seen: a) NREM→NREM (initial sleep state and sleep state at end of stimulation) - FB was initated and did not continue beyond the duration of the stimulation. b) NREM → REM sleep - FB was initiated and continued beyond the time of stimulation. c) REM → REM sleep - spontaneous FB was enhanced and continued beyond the time of stimulation. d) REM → NREM sleep - spontaneous FB was enhanced but did not continue beyond the time of stimulation. e) NREM, REM sleep, Awake → Awake - FB was initiated or enhanced and continued beyond the time of stimulation until the onset of NREM sleep. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Circulating levels of corticosterone and prolactin were measured by radioimmunoassay at hourly intervals during a 24 h period to establish the diurnal rhythm of these hormones in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Corticosterone levels exhibited a distinct circadian variation with concentrations reaching a zenith at 2000 h and a nadir at 1200 h in male and female SHR. Corticosterone levels in females were consistently greater than males. Circulating prolactin levels were greater during the light h than dark in the female; the opposite occurred in males. Measurement of pituitary prolactin content tended to be low when serum prolactin levels were high and vice versa. The circadian rhythm of circulating corticosterone and prolactin in the hypertensive SHR was found to be similar to the day-night patterns established for normotensive rats. However, these measurements were made under quiescent conditions. It is suggested that because SHR are hyper-responsive to stress and because corticosterone and prolactin have synchronous effects on stress-induced adrenal steroidogenesis, further investigation of prolactin and corticosterone may reveal a participatory role of these hormones in the pathogenesis of the genetically-programmed hypertension of SHR. © 1980.

AB  - Different biologic rhythms with effect on one and the same parameter may cause a complicated signal pattern in which no regularity can be visually identified. In this study an autocorrelation function approach, well established in the interpretation of electroencephalograms, was shown to be applicable also in the interpretation of processes with few points of observation. This technique, used on the excretion of estriol in urine, reveals several rhythms with wavelengths between 6 and 72 hours. Interference between these signals may explain the irregular visual appearance of plots of subsequent estriol determinations and the considerable rise and fall of urinary estriol excretion during pregnancy. The presence of two independent sources of the rhythms is suggested. It is concluded that the complicated and individual rhythmic changes in urinary excretion of estriol results in a low diagnostic specificity for fetoplacental malfunction of this component. © 1980.

AB  - Female mice (genetically heterogeneous stock) were fed milled mouse food containing 3 g/kg phenobarbital (PhB) and water as their only nutritional source from gestation days 9-18. Control dams received milled food and water. Blood PhB levels of treated females and fetuses were 40-200 μg/ml. At the age of 50 days, male offspring were injected with 3.5 g/kg ethanol. Sleep time was monitored and in randomly selected individuals, brain ethanol levels were determined upon awakening. To assess the rate of metabolism in the treated and control offspring, blood ethanol levels were determined in other randomly selected individuals at 60 and 120 min post-injection. Offspring who received PhB prenatally were resistant to the hypnotic effects of ethanol as evidenced by their 33% shorter sleep time compared to controls (P<0.001). The brain ethanol levels upon awakening were higher than control in the offspring born to the barbiturate-treated mothers (P<0.001), indicating that the resistance to ethanol was due to factors residing within the central nervous system. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - To examine diurnal changes in maternal and fetal steroids in chronically catheterized pregnant rhesus monkeys, the authors have measured cortisol (F), progesterone (P4), estrone, and estradiol in maternal blood and F, P4, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHAS) in simultaneous samples of fetal blood taken in the morning (07.00-10.00 hr) and in the evening (17.00-21.00 hr). In the mother, the concentrations of F, estradiol, and estrone were higher in the morning than in the evening. In contrast, progesterone was higher in evening than in morning samples. In fetal blood, there was no significant morning-evening difference for F; however, the concentrations of P4 and DHAS were higher in the evening than in the morning samples. In 3 individual monkeys, the concentrations of P4 and DHAS in serial samples of fetal blood were correlated. The authors conclude (1) that there are marked diurnal changes in the concentration of several steroids in samples of maternal and fetal blood and (2) that the concentration of F in maternal blood shows the opposite pattern to that of possible fetal adrenal steroids in fetal blood.

AB  - Term healthy newborn infants underwent polygraphy between days 4 and 6 of life. Behavioral states were determined according to Prechtl's criteria. The neonatal heart rate was analyzed for the various behavioral states, with the use of quantitative indices for long-term and short-term irregularity. The applied indices were, respectively, the long-term irregularity index (LTI index) and the interval difference index (ID index). During state 1 the R-R interval length was longer (p < 0.01), the LTI index lower (p < 0.01), and the ID index higher (p < 0.02) than in the immediately preceding or following state 2. For nonconsecutive states 1 and 2 a maximum separation was obtained with the discriminant function 0.0159 RR - 0.065 LTI + 0.062 ID - 7.49. This discriminant function gave a total percentage of correct classification for states 1 and 2 epochs of 93%. The data are discussed with respect to the presence of cycling sleep states in the newborn infant as well as in the fetus. Prospects for fetal antepartum heart rate monitoring are considered. © 1980.

AB  - Plasma prolactin (PRL) levels were investigated in chronically catheterized control, sham-lesioned, and amygdala (AMYG)-lesioned rats under a variety of conditions. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats injected with 0.5 mg of polyestradiol phosphate (PEP) exhibited a circadian rhythm of PRL secretion characteristic of proestrus rats. Small bilateral lesions of the central AMYG area had no effect on this pattern of PRL secretion in animals bled over a 24-h period, 1 week following lesioning. A second group of rats bearing lesions or sham lesions of the corticomedial AMYG nuclei were studied at 1, 2 and 3 weeks following surgery and PEP treatment. PEP produced a significant afternoon surge of PRL in controls at weeks 1 and 2 but not week 3. Lesions of the corticomedial AMYG nuclei had no effect on basal PRL, but significantly blunted the afternoon surge occurring at weeks 1 and 2. The effect of a larger lesion encompassing a greater proportion of the corticomedial AMYG was examined in another group of rats at 6 weeks post-lesion and 2 weeks after PEP injection. This lesion significantly decreased PRL levels compared to controls at 5 of 6 time periods examined over a 24-h period. The effect of this lesion on PRL secretion in non-estrogenized OVX rats was also examined. There was no difference in the low, non-fluctuating 24-h PRL levels of control and lesioned rats bled at 3 or 4 weeks post-lesion. © 1980.

AB  - The relative effects and consequences of split doses of exogenous insulin therapy (two thirds before breakfast and one third before the evening meal) on excursions and diurnal rhythm of circulating glucose during the 24-hour "metabolic clock" were examined. A longitudinal study in pregnant women with maturity-onset diabetes (N = 7) with substantial endogenous insulin secretion and juvenile onset diabetes (N = 6) with no measurable endogenous insulin secretion (judged by C-peptide measurement) was compared with identical studies performed in nondiabetic pregnant control subjects (N = 6). Plasma glucose levels determined at hourly intervals throughout the 24-hour meal-activity-sleep cycles revealed marked excursions of plasma glucose values with exaggerated hyperglycemia during the day hours and relative hypoglycemia at night in both types of diabetic pregnancies as compared to normal control pregnancies. The magnitude of glucose excursion was surprisingly large relative to the degree of increase in the mean 24-hour glucose levels and mean fasting blood glucose values. A striking disparity in the amount of exogenous insulin required to maintain glucose levels and diurnal rhythm toward the normal range in pregnant diabetic patients from second to the third trimester was observed. The degree of exogenous insulin increment imposed by pregnancy (from the second to third trimester) in juvenile-onset diabetes was relatively small (38%) and comparable to the increase in endogenous insulin (32%) found in nondiabetic pregnancies. In marked contrast, among patients with maturity-onset diabetes, in whom substantial endogenous insulin secretion was present, the corresponding increment in exogenous insulin was surprisingly large (98%) without a proportional reduction in 24-hour integrated glucose values. These findings indicate that the effects and consequences of exogenous insulin therapy between maturity-onset diabetes and juvenile-onset diabetes during pregnancy are clearly different. Our data further suggest that peripheral insulin resistance constitutes the major factor accounting for the persistence of hyperglycemia in maturity-onset diabetes. Although the mechanism by which the exaggeration of insulin resistance in maturity-onset diabetes with superimposed pregnancy remains unclear, there are at least three additive contributing events to consider: the inherent defect of insulin resistance in this type of diabetes, the pregnancy-induced insulin resistance, and the reduction in number or affinity of insulin receptors in target tissues occasioned by excessive exogenous insulin treatment. © 1980.

AB  - A longitudinal study to quantitate the progressive effects of the second and third trimesters of normal pregnancy on the levels of plasma glucose, immunoreactive insulin (IRI), and C-peptide (C-P) at hourly intervals throughout the 24-hour "metabolic clock" was made. Identical studies were conducted in each subject at 6 to 11 weeks post partum and these data were used as nonpregnant control values. Data analyses were made to determine the role of meal-activity-sleep cycles as physiologic modifiers. A diurnal rhythm of plasma glucose, IRI, and C-P was demonstrated in all study periods. During meals anabolic values of plasma glucose (increments above the 24-hour mean) in response to meal intake were remarkably small, ranging between 30 and 35 mg/100 ml in the postpartum state, and were not significantly modified by pregnancy. The corresponding IRI levels were similarly small with a mean increase on only 31% in pregnancy. However, during the third but not the second trimester of pregnancy, the peak anabolic values for both plasma glucose and IRI were significantly (p < 0.05) increased and consequently the 2-hour postprandial glucose and IRI levels were significantly elevated after meal ingestion. When values were compared with those of the postpartum state, there was a progressive increase in the degree of catabolic excursion (decrease from 24-hour mean) of plasma glucose during sleeping hours from the second to third trimester of pregnancy. This resulted in a state of relative hypoglycemia, with significantly reduced fasting (8 a.m.) plasma glucose and 24-hour integrated glucose levels. This relative nocturnal hypoglycemia was associated with synchronous IRI values but without concomitant reduction of absolute IRI levels. Consequently, the fasting, premeal, and 24-hour IRI/glucose ratios were increased. Thus, basal insulin secretion is significantly augmented relative to levels of plasma glucose, but a quantitative increase in insulin secretion following food intake is relatively small during pregnancy. These observations together with the finding of a marked diurnal rhythm of plasma glucose and relative nocturnal hypoglycemia provide important insights for the formulation of guidelines for the timing, amount, and mode of delivery of exogenous insulin necessary for the management of diabetic patients during pregnancy. © 1980.

AB  - In order to examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different steroids cortisol and estriol were measured by radioimmunoassay in maternal venous plasma taken at 30- to 60-minute intervals over 24 hours from nine healthy women at 30 to 31, 11 at 34 to 35 and 10 at 38 to 39 weeks' gestation. Maternal cortisol was maximal at 0730 to 0830 hours and fell significantly to its lowest concentration between 1830 and 0130 hours. At 30 to 31 and 34 to 35 weeks there was a significant circadian rhythm in estriol concentrations which was inversely related to the circadian rhythm in cortisol. At 38 to 39 weeks mean estriol concentrations were significantly higher than those at 30 to 31 and 34 to 35 weeks but there was no significant circadian pattern. We concluded that there is an inverse relationship between maternal cortisol and estriol at 30 to 31 and 34 to 35 weeks, which would be consistent with a maternal effect on fetal adrenal function. The increase in mean concentration and absence of circadian rhythm in maternal plasma estriol at term might suggest an additional positive stimulus to fetal adrenal function. The existence of patterns in maternal estriol concentrations must be taken into account in the use of sequential measurements of this hormone during the last 10 weeks of pregnancy. © 1980.

AB  - Female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were housed individually on a photoperiod of LD 6:18 (lights 1000-1600 h). Estrous cyclicity was interrupted for an average of 16 wk after which cycles resumed spontaneously. Such animals are photorefractory, remaining cyclic on normally nonstimulatory photoperiods. Photorefractory females were exposed to continuous darkness in which estrous cyclicity in the population rapidly became asynchronous as each hamster's "day" assumed the endogenous periodicity (tau) of her circadian clock. Tau usually approximated but rarely equaled 24 h. Successive estrous cycles in each animal possessed a periodicity of 4 tau. Preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release occurred at a specific time of the animal's circadian day, bearing a discrete phase relationship of 2 to 3 h to the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity. Thus, although seemingly asynchronous with respect to laboratory time, peak preovulatory gonadotropin release on proestrus in free-running hamsters was synchronized with respsect to circadian time. We conclude that a circadian pacemaker times preovulatory gonadotropin release in hamsters.

AB  - Circadian rhythms in locomotor activity and drinking behavior were monitored in reproductively senescent female rats (Long-Evans, hooded) in both entrained (light:dark, 14:10) and free-running (constant dim illumination) conditions and compared to rhythms in young (3- to 4-month-old) rats of the same strain displaying regular estrous cycles. Aged rats were divided into two groups on the basis of age and pattern of daily vaginal smears; old constant estrous (16-18 months) and old repetitive pseudopregnant (24-26 months). The results indicate that circadian rhythmicity in both behaviors declines with increasing age. In diurnal lighting, young cycling, old constant estrous, and old repetitive pseudopregnant rats restrict 72.7 ± 2.4%, 67.1 ± 1.7%, and 58.9 ± 2.2%, respectively, of their drinking behavior to the 10 hr of darkness. This percentage decrease in aged rats is primarily the result of fewer drinking events during the dark phase. Activity and drinking records of young rats in constant dim light reveal marked free-running rhythms which contrast to the more random distribution of activity and drinking events in the aged groups. Power spectral analyses of drinking events in both entrained and free-running conditions confirm a progressive flattening of the spectrum and a diminished circadian peak with advanced age. Circadian rhythms were also monitored in young rats (3-4 months) which had been androgen-sterilized (100 μg testosterone propionate) on the day after birth since they exhibit a permanent constant estrous state similar to the old constant estrous rat and have been viewed as a model of early reproductive senescence. In both entrained and free-running conditions, their activity and drinking rhythms were comparable to rhythms displayed by young cycling rats. © 1980 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Diurnal changes in the concentrations of oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2) in maternal peripheral plasma have been measured in samples of blood taken at one hour intervals from women at 30 to 31, 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks of pregnancy. There was a significant effect of time of sampling on the plasma concentration of E1 at all stages of gestation, and circadian changes in the levels of E1 were apparent at 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks. Peak values were measured around 0830 to 0930 hours, and troughs occurred between 0130 and 0530 hours. Significant effects of time of sampling on the plasma concentration of E2 were found at 34 to 35 and 38 to 39 weeks of pregnancy; night‐time concentrations were lower than the peak values at 0730 to 0830 hours. The relation of these changes to the circadian rhythms in the concentrations of cortisol and oestriol in maternal plasma are discussed. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The concentration of ovine placental lactogen (oPL) was measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples from chronically catheterized ewes and their fetuses from day 110 of gestation to term (about day 145). Concentrations of oPL in the plasma of the mother and fetus were raised after surgery, and remained raised for 3-5 days after the operation. Concentrations of oPL were greatest in the fetus at days 120-124 of gestation, and then declined until delivery. Mean concentrations of oPL in the fetus in late pregnancy for single, twin and triplet pregnancies were 101 ± 6 (S.E.M.), 100 ± 11 and 117 ± 59 ng/ml respectively and were not significantly different. Mean concentrations of oPL in the mother in late pregnancy for single, twin and triplet pregnancies were 718 ± 227, 1387 ± 160 and 1510 ± 459 ng/ml respectively; the difference between these means was significant (P < 0.05). Peak concentrations were noted at days 130-139 of gestation after which concentrations fell and were significantly lower on the day of delivery (P < 0.01). Concentrations of oPL in the mother showed no circadian rhythm. The mean concentrations of oPL in maternal plasma during late pregnancy were significantly correlated to the combined fetal weight at birth (r = 0.624, P < 0.01).

AB  - Two‐hourly plasma glucose measurements were made over a 24‐hour period in 24 pregnant women with chemical diabetes treated by dietary carbohydrate restriction alone. The values obtained between midnight and 0600 hours displayed the best correlation with the mean of the diurnal values, the strongest individual correlation being at 0200 hours. During the daytime, the mean of the plasma glucose values before breakfast (0600 hours) and lunch (1200 hours) and two hours after supper (2000 hours) provided the strongest correlation with the mean diurnal value and these are recommended as the routine sampling times for assessment of diabetic control in pregnant women with dietary treatment for chemical diabetes.

AB  - In female rats bearing an average litter of 10 ± 0.28 fetuses, pituitary prolactin is secreted in a pattern of 2 daily surges during the first 10 days of pregnancy only. When the number of fetuses was experimentally reduced, prolactin surges continued for a longer period and pregnancy was correspondingly lengthened. The relationship found between a reduced number of fetuses, and delay in termination of prolactin surges further supports the view that, during pregnancy, rat placental lactogen exerts a major influence in inhibiting secretion of prolactin by the maternal pituitary gland. The constant relationship found in all groups between termination of nocturnal surges of prolactin and parturition indicates that it is the interval between implantation and termination of prolactin surges which is prolonged in female rats with small litters.

AB  - The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) was investigated by immunofluorescence and quantitative electron microscopic methods, and its LHRH content was measured at intervals during the estrous cycle and in male rats. A well-defined circadian rhythm in the LHRH content was demonstrated in the OVLT. The highest value was observed on the day of proestrus with peaks at noon and in the late afternoon. The amount of LHRH was about the same in the male as in the female rats on the day of diestrus 1. The OVLT in both sexes contained LHRH-positive fibers and terminals, but less immunofluorescence was visible on the day of diestrus and in the male animals. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis shows that in the OVLT nerve terminals, abutting on the basement membrane, more granulated vesicles (80-90 nm in diameter) are present on the day of proestrus than on any other day of the cycle or in the male. Our results suggest that the OVLT may participate in some way in the control of the cyclic gonadotrophic funtion of the anterior pituitary and/or in the behavioral effect of sexual hormones. © 1980 S.

AB  - Fetal movements (FM) in utero are an expression of fetal well-being, and the importance of assessing these movements has been shown in cases of chronic fetal distress. The diurnal variations were studied in 2 groups of high-risk pregnant women who assessed FM by subjective perception. The patients in the first group assessed FM before and after meals. The majority (86%) reported no significant difference in fetal activity before and after meals; the remaining 14% noted a constant decrease after meals. Of the second group, which assessed FM 3 times daily, 82% discerned no significant differences and 18% showed significant diurnal variations. It is concluded that assessment of FM is not necessarily dependent on a strict timetable. © 1980, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The establishment of human pregnancies by the use of fertilization in vitro and placing cleaving embryos into the uterus is described. Preovulatory oocytes were aspirated at laparoscopy from the ovaries of patients soon after the beginning of the mid‐cycle surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) during the natural cycle. The LH surge was identified by assaying 3‐hourly samples of urine, and measurements of oestrogens in 24‐hour samples were used to assess follicular growth. The surge of LH was identified in 68 patients and it showed a diurnal rhythm. Preovulatory oocytes were aspirated from most of the patients. Fertilization and cleavage occurred in 34 instances, and 32 embryos were put into the mother via the cervical canal. Four patients became pregnant. There were indications that a diurnal rhythm played a role in establishing cleaving embryos, each of the four pregnancies occurring when the embryos were placed in late evening. Each of the pregnancies resulted from oocytes which were aspirated from their follicles 24 hours or longer after the LH surge began. Details are given of three abortive pregnancies in patients given gonadotrophins to stimulate the maturation of oocytes used for fertilization in vitro. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Continuous measurements of human fetal breathing movements and gross fetal body movements were made with an ultrasonic real-time scanner for periods of 24 hours in 9 women at 30 to 31 weeks' and 11 women at 38 to 39 weeks' gestation. At 30 to 31 weeks' gestation, a significant increase in fetal breathing movements occurred during the second and third hours after meals; this pattern apparently followed an increase in maternal plasma glucose concentrations. At 38 to 39 weeks' gestation, fetal breathing movements increased during the second and third hours after breakfast, but the troughs seen before lunch and supper at 30 to 31 weeks' gestation were not present. Fetal breathing movements diminished over the day and reached a minimum between 1900 and 2400 hours. Fetal breathing activity increased in both groups between 0400 and 0700 hours while mothers were asleep; this was not related to an increase in maternal glucose concentrations. Absence of fetal breathing movements was observed for up to 122 minutes in this analysis of 480 hours in 20 patients. These data show that much more information must be obtained on factors that normally influence fetal breathing activity. Only then can research strategies be suggested for clinical evaluation of the usefulness of fetal breathing movements in the assessment of fetal health. © 1980 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Intrauterine fetal breathing movements have been observed, described, and recorded for more than ninety years. The pattern of intrauterine breathing activity differs in many ways from what may be observed in air-breathing neonates and also from what is usually observed in the acutely exteriorized fetus. It is not surprising that the interpretation of intrauterine fetal breathing movements has been a matter of controversy ever since the movements were first described.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate the 24-hour periodicity in serum prolactin levels subsequent to transecting the ascending serotonergic system or ablating the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of adult (185 g) female rats. The ascending serotonergic system was transected at the level of the rostral mesencephalon using a 1.5 mm wide knife and the SCN was ablated with a modified Halász-Pupp knife. The effect of raphe transection (RT) or SCN ablation on the circadian rhythm in nonstress serum prolactin levels was assessed 45 days after surgery by measuring with radioimmunoassay the serum prolactin concentration in serial blood samples obtained from the tail vein of lightly restrained rats. Serum prolactin concentration in control and RT animals showed circadian periodicity; peak levels occurred during the midafternoon, 4 h prior to the dark phase of the lighting regime (lights on at 4 a.m., off at 6 p.m.). The amplitude of the fluctuations of both groups varied markedly and were related to the estrous cycle. However, RT animals showed a reduced amplitude in the rhythm. In controls peak prolactin levels on days of proestrus and estrus were 15–20 times higher than on days of diestrus. In contrast, serum prolactin levels in SCN-ablated rats did not vary with a circadian periodicity but rather showed random, low amplitude fluctuations. Reproductive cyclicity was also abolished by SCN ablation, i.e., SCN-ablated rats presented persistent vaginal cornification. These data indicate that circadian periodicity in serum prolactin levels is not compromised by sectioning the ascending serotonergic fibers but is abolished after ablating the SCN. © 1980 S.

AB  - The pattern of prolactin (PRL) secretion following mating consists of two daily surges, one nocturnal and the other diurnal. Under a photoperiod of 14L: 10D, the most commonly used lighting regime, the nocturnal PRL surge occurs at about 7 h after the onset of the dark phase. The present study investigated the influence of various photo-periods, constant light and dark and suprachiasmatic nucleus lesion (SCN) on the initiation and expression of the nightly PRL surges. Females were divided into five groups and each group was exposed to a different photoperiod. The five experimental photoperiods were: 22L:2D, 19L:5D, 14L: 10D, 8L:16D and 3L:21D. Following at least 8 weeks of exposure to a photoperiod the females were mated. Multiple daily blood samples for PRL determination (RIA) were obtained via chronic intra-atrial cannulae. In females exposed to a decreased period of darkness the nocturnal PRL surge was advanced with respect to the onset of the dark phase. Conversely, an increase in the length of the dark period to over 10 h/day caused a delay in the appearance of the PRL surge. When the timing of the PRL surge is calculated with respect to the midpoint of the dark or light cycle, it occurs at about the same time under all but the most extreme photoperiod (3L:21D). Prior to the experiments using constant dark or constant light the animals were habituated to the lighting conditions for 4 months. In constant darkness the nocturnal PRL surge was synchronized among all animals and peaked in the early morning; its magnitude and duration were greater than under both constant light and alternating light schedules. In constant light, irregular elevations of PRL were seen throughout the day. No elevation of PRL was found in SCN-lesioned animals following cervical stimulation. The present study demonstrates that the nocturnal PRL surges during pregnancy and pseudopregnancy are entrained to photoperiod, can be shifted within limits under various photoperiods and cannot be initiated following lesions in the SCN. On the basis of this and other studies, it is proposed that the nocturnal PRL surge resembles other endogenous circadian rhythms in the rat, but requires the external stimulation of mating for its occurrence. © 1980 S.

AB  - The association between the documented spontaneous biorhythms of uterine activity, uterine artery blood flow, and aortic blood pressure and the processes of labor and delivery was explored in 17 nonmedicated rhesus monkeys for 18 pregnancies. The characteristic circadian variations of higher hourly average values of uterine activity during periods of light than during periods of darkness were incorporated in a statistically distinct, predictable, and repetitive manner into the events of parturition. Variations in uterine artery blood flow reflected changes in intra-amniotic pressure. In those animals in which delivery occurred at night, a shift in maximal values of uterine activity from periods of light to periods of darkness occurred 48 to 60 hours prior to delivery. Progressive linear increases in hourly average values of frequency of contraction and aortic blood pressure consistently began 24 to 36 hours prior to delivery. These changes suggest that specific, directly related prodromal events occur within the maternal organism hours before parturition in the nonhuman primate.

AB  - Human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), a stimulator of the growth of a variety of tissues, appears to be identical to human β-urogastrone (hUG), an inhibitor of stimulated gastric acid secretion. Using immune affinity chromatography to extract hEGF from plasma, we have measured plasma concentrations of immunoreactive (IR) hEGF/UG. Plasma IR hEGF/ UG extracted by immune affinity column was immunologically, biologically, and physicochemically indistinguishable from highly purified hEGF standard isolated from human urine. Concentrations of plasma IR hEGF/UG in normal males and females were 163.4 ± 13.7 and 138.5 ± 6.9 pg/ml (mean ± SE), respectively; there was no significant sex difference (P > 0.2). Neither the half-hourly plasma concentrations nor the urinary excretion of IR hEGF/UG in two normal young subjects showed any apparent circadian periodicity. There was no significant correlation (P > 0.1) between concentrations of IR hEGF/UG and hGH during the 24-h study. Concentrations of plasma IR hEGF/ UG in pregnant women (121.2 ± 6.0 pg/ml) were not significantly different (P > 0.1) from those in nonpregnant women. Renal clearance of endogenous IR hEGF/UG appears to be similar to that of creatinine. The present study has established the concentrations of IR hEGF/UG in normal human plasma. The results suggest that plasma levels of IR hEGF are unrelated to sex, ingestion of meals, sleep-wake activity, or pregnancy, and hEGF/UG is cleared from plasma mostly by renal glomerular filtration. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Plasma concentrations of cortisol and corticosteroid- binding globulin are elevated substantially in pregnancy; only the free cortisol fraction is biologically active. Previous suggestions that plasma free cortisol increased above nongravid levels in pregnancy were difficult to reconcile with the absence of manifestations of hypercortisolism. Furthermore, any such elevation should be associated with some alteration in the regulation of cortisol secretion. Therefore, the physiology of cortisol secretion was studied by measuring plasma cortisol at 20-min intervals for 24 h. Free cortisol levels were evaluated by determining the plasma free cortisol index and the rate of urinary cortisol excretion. Circadian cortisol patterns in pregnant and nonpregnant subjects were virtually identical, but total plasma cortisol was significantly higher in pregnancy. Calculated plasma biological half-lives and production rates of cortisol were increased significantly in gravidas (t1/2: pregnant, 104.6 min; nonpregnant, 69.5 min; daily production rate: pregnant, 28.0 mg; nonpregnant, 11.2 mg). Such increases should produce rises in plasma free cortisol, an assumption supported by finding elevations of the free cortisol index in gravidas at 0800 and 2400 h (pregnant, 14.9 ± 1.9 and 3.3 ± 0.2; nonpregnant, 4.0 ± 0.6 and 1.2 ± 0.3) and elevations of the 24-h urinary cortisol excretion rate. Normal circadian rhythmicity despite elevated free cortisol suggests that maternal hypothalamic-pituitary regulation is altered. Resetting of feedback and lack of manifestations of hypercortisolism could be explained by tissue refractoriness to the effects of cortisol in pregnancy. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - DNA synthesis was studied in mammary tissue from 13‐ and 15‐day pregnant Balb/c mice at different times during the day. Tissue was labeled with 3H‐thymidine (3H‐TdR) using both in vivo and in vitro techniques. The labeling index of mammary epithelial cells was determined by autoradiography. Incorporation of 3H‐TdR into TCA‐precipitable material after in vitro labeling was also measured. The labeling index of mammary alveolar cells is 2.5 times higher in tissue from animals studied at midnight when compared to tissue from animals studied at noon; ductal epithelial cells do not show any variation in labeling index at these time periods. Precursor incorporation into TCA‐precipitable material is also increased at midnight when compared to values at noon. Tissue from animals at 6 A. M. and 6 P. M. show intermediate levels of 3H‐TdR incorporation when measured by both of these methods. Diurnal variations in DNA synthesis in mammary tissue may reflect daily changes in either serum levels of those hormones directly stimulating this process or fluctuations in tissue sensitivity to these hormones, and might provide a means of analyzing the regulation of mammary epithelial cell proliferation during pregnancy.

AB  - The abrupt termination of the nocturnal PRL surge on day 11 of pregnancy in the rat may be caused by secretions from the uterine-placental unit. Removal of the uterus and its contents on day 6, 8, or 10 of pregnancy prolonged for several days the occurrence of the nocturnal PRL surge, measured at 0300 h. Even after the surge had disappeared in intact pregnant rats, hysterectomy on day 11 or 12 resulted in a resumption of the surge for several days. To determine whether PRL or PRL-like materials would inhibit the surge, bovine PRL or rat placental extract was injected into pregnant rats hysterectomized on day 10. Neither of these two treatments altered serum PRL levels. However, implantation of human placental lactogen into the median eminence on day 8 of pregnancy abruptly terminated the nocturnal PRL surge and caused the pups to be aborted. To determine whether progesterone is responsible for the extended nocturnal PRL surges seen in pregnant rats after hysterectomy, progesterone in silastic tubing was implanted sc. In control pregnant rats hysterectomized and ovariectomized on day 12, no nocturnal surge was present. However, in similarly treated rats which received progesterone, the nocturnal surge returned and was similar to that in hysterectomized rats with intact ovaries. Thus, it appears that progesterone is the signal to the brain to maintain the nocturnal PRL surge if the inhibitory factor from the uterine-placental unit is absent. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The phase and activity level of the locomotor rhythms of female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) vary in synchrony with the 4-day estrous cycle. We investigated the effects of estradiol and progesterone administration in ovariectomized hamsters to explore the interaction of these two ovarian hormones in modulating circadian locomotor rhythms. Silastic implants of estradiol shorten the period length of the rhythm, change the pattern and level of activity, and decrease the observed variance of the activity onset. Progesterone implants have no effects on the rhythm when given alone; however, when progesterone is given in combination with estradiol, all three estradiol-induced changes are blocked. These results correlate well with the observed locomotor behavior of normal female hamsters. If the levels of both estradiol progesterone in the serum are taken into account, this correlation holds for a number of hormonal conditions including those found during the 4-day estrous cycle as well as during pregnancy and lactation. These data suggest that progesterone antagonizes the effects of estradiol in the normal animal and that the interaction of estradiol and progesterone modulates the circadian activity of female hamsters on a day-to-day basis.

AB  - The recent development of radio-immunoassay of prolactin has permitted, in recent years, better understanding of its role in hormone regulation. In man, the secretion of prolactin is submitted to physiological variations dependent on sex, age and also environment. It is also modified by numerous drugs. Certain of them are used during stimulation tests and inhibition tests of the pituitary gland. The determination of basic prolactinemia and during dynamic tests is now a factor in basic diagnosis for the clinician who now has available efficacious chemotherapy (derived from rye ergot) in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia.

AB  - The brain concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) increased in rats maintained on restricted volume of low-protein or normal-protein diet, whereas these two agents decreased in rats fed low-protein diet ad libitum. In these two food-restricted groups brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations were not correlated with brain tryptophan hydroxylase activity, but the concentrations correlated closely with cerebral tryptophan concentrations. The cerebral tryptophan concentration in the two food-restricted groups was not consistent with the total or free tryptophan concentration in plasma. In these restricted rats cerebral tryptophan concentration was elevated, and, unlike the plasma tryptophan, it showed no diurnal variation. These results suggested that tryptophan uptake into the brain from plasma was enhanced by limiting food volume intake. Tryptophan uptake was increased by glucagon injection without changing the plasma tryptophan level, but injection of hydrocortisone or insulin had little or no effect on tryptophan concentration in either the plasma or brain. d-Glucose injection elevated plasma tryptophan concentration but decreased brain tryptophan concentration. © 1980 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - The extent of the effects of estradiol on the locomotor rhythm in hamsters is unknown. This study was designed to determine the ability of estradiol alone and in combination with the photoperiod to alter activity patterns. Intact animals displayed higher levels of activity in LD 16:8 than in LD 6:18. Ovariectomy without estradiol treatment caused a sharp decline in activity in LD 16:8; estradiol treatment prevented this. In LD 6:18, activity levels were unaffected by either estradiol or ovariectomy. Estradiol altered the temporal distribution of activity only in LD 6:18, advancing peak activity towards lights-off. Estradiol decreased the variability in day to day onsets of activity in LD 6:18, but did not affect onsets in LD 16:8. The data suggest that the activity rhythm of the hamster is comprised of discrete components; the response of each component to estradiol is differentially altered by photoperiod. Furthermore, estradiol is vital for the expression of high activity levels in the LD 16:8 female. © 1980.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate feeding behaviour of the lactating rat over the day-night cycle. Food intake was recorded continuously in six pregnant and subsequently lactating female rats with 10 pups each. Although there was a twofold increase of food intake during the first post partum week, the meal frequency did not increase above the level of previous weeks. Only the mean meal size increased. After this week food intake increased to three times the normal intake, meal size did not change but meal frequency increased in favour of daytime meals. It is suggested that with moderate caloric demands food intake regulation in the rat occurs through changes in meal size. With higher energy requirements, however, meal frequency is also affected. The possible causal factors involved in the change in feeding are discussed. © 1980, All rights reserved.

AB  - Luteal and adrenal cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH) activity and serum PRL, LH and progesterone were measured at 3 h intervals throughout Day 6 of pseudopregnancy in mature rats. The nocturnal PRL surge which peaked at 0600 h was correlated (r = 0.95; P<0.01) with a significant increase in total luteal CEH activity which began between 0600 and 0900 h and attained its highest activity at 1200 h. Serum progesterone concentrations and total adrenal CEH activity did not change significantly at time intervals measured. A transient, but significant, increase in serum LH was observed at 1200 h. The data suggest that the nocturnal PRL surge initiates the subsequent increase in luteal CEH activity. Although the LH spurt could not initiate the increased CEH activity, it could have a modulatory role.

AB  - Occupational trends in the career of flight attendants are undergoing dramatic changes. Career duration of U.S. flight attendants has extended from approximately 2 years in the 1950's to potentially more than 30 years in the late 1970's. The U.S. Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 As Amended allows flight attendants who are capable of working to continue until the age of 70 if they so desire. Into the 1960's the airlines required female flight attendants to be unmarried, with termination of employment upon marriage, with termination of employment upon marriage, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ultimately brought an end to this policy in the early 1970's. Now, more than half of the flight attendants are married. Into the 1970's, if a flight attendant became pregnant, her employment was terminated by the airlines. Today several U.S. airlines allow flight attendants with uncomplicated pregnancies to work up to, and sometimes into the third trimester of pregnancy, with return to flight attendant duties several weeks after delivery. Into the 1960's, young Caucasian female flight attendants were sought who were petite and who fell within very restricted height and weight limits. Today there is a much wider range allowed in these dimensions and more males and minority groups are incorporated in the ranks. The flight attendant is universally recognized today as the primary cabine safety factor in the event of inflight or ground emergencies. Indeed, the U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations specify the critical nature of flight attendant safety duties. No longer do various segments of the industry view the flight attendant as primarily an airborn waitress. In actuality, the occupation of flight attendant is performed in an environment that involves exposure to the forces of inflight accelerations, circadian rhythm desynchronosis, and other environment factors plus the ever-present potential for turbulence injuries, decompressions, combative passengers, and accidents. Preventive medicine aspects of the modern flight attendant's occupation include maintaining physical fitness and mental alertness. The flight attendant is an absolutely essential crew member in modern aviation and in the future will have increasing responsibilities. Improved and extended preventive medicine programs for flight attendants are indicated.

AB  - Docile cows were used to characterize the pattern of plasma LH in systemic circulation during three periods [day 3 (early luteal), day 10 or 11 (midluteal) and day 18 or 19] of the estrous cycle. Blood samples were collected at 10-min intervals for 24 continuous h during each period. Concentration of LH, as measured by RIA, was analyzed by time domain and frequency domain methods of time series analysis. During all periods of the cycle studied, LH fluctuated in a pulsatile manner. During the early luteal period, pulses were classified as low amplitude (ΔLH, 0.3-1.8 ng) and high frequency (20-30 pulses/24 h), with each cow exhibiting an inherent rhythmic pattern. However, during the midluteal period, pulses were classified as high amplitude (ΔLH, 1.2-7.0 ng) and low frequency (6-8 pulses/24 h), without an inherent rhythmic pattern. Even though patterns differed between the early and midluteal periods in all cows, mean LH concentrations were different (P < 0.05) in only one cow. On day 18 or 19, two cows exhibited a preovulatory surge of LH. Throughout the surge, LH fluctuated in a pulsatile manner, with a frequency more like the early luteal than the midluteal period. Amplitude of the pulses was greater during the ascending than during the descending portion of the surge. These results suggest that LH fluctuates in a pulsatile manner in the plasma of the cyclic cow, and that the pattern is dependent upon the period of the estrous cycle and is probably modulated by ovarian steroids. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Concentrations of cAMP and cGMP in the anterior pituitary and medial basal hypothalamus from female rats sacrificed by microwave irradiation at various stages of the estrous cycle were measured by RIA. Pituitary cAMP levels were the lowest at 1000 h on diestrous day 1, followed by higher levels that continued until 1600 h on proestrus. The level increased thereafter to reach a peak at 2200 h on proestrus. The levels on estrus were similar to those on diestrous day 1. Pituitary cGMP levels were low and almost steady from the diestrous days to the morning of proestrus, but in the afternoon of proestrus the level rose dramatically and peaked at 2200 h. The level returned to the proestrous morning level at 1000 h on estrus but increased again in the afternoon. The concentrations of both cAMP and cGMP in the hypothalamus started to rise in the late afternoon of diestrous day 2 and remained high through the day of proestrus. The levels were lower on the day of estrus. At 2200 h on proestrus, the cGMP level was elevated further to reach the maximum found during the cycle, while cAMP did not change. It was suggested that the concentrations of pituitary cyclic nucleotides increase in parallel with the increase of pituitary hormone output which takes place during proestrus, and that concentrations of hypothalamic cyclic nucleotides increase concomitant with the increase in the estrogen level in the blood which occurs from diestrous day 2 to proestrus. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The 24 h patterns of prolactin secretion were determined in 20-26-month-old female rats during the constant estrous (CE) and pseudopregnant (PSP) states. Each female was fitted with a chronic intra-atrial cannula and serial blood samples were obtained at 3 h intervals for measurement of plasma prolactin levels. This sampling procedure for a 24 h cycle was repeated 1-3 times for each rat over a 6 day period. The pituitaries were removed at the conclusion of the study for histological examination. Prolactin levels in the CE rats were increased from baseline values to 254 ± 111 (SEM) ng/ml at 1700 h and subsequently fell to 61 ± 11 ng/ml by 2300 h. Most of the CE rats also showed a smaller nocturnal rise in prolactin between 0200-0500 h and the intervals between the diurnal surge and the nocturnal prolactin rise ranged from 9 to 15 h. In contrast to CE rats, the PSP rats exhibited large nocturnal surges of prolactin release, with peak values of 248 ± 44 and 215 ± 27 ng/ml occurring at 0200 and 0500 h. In addition, most of the PSP rats showed a smaller increase in plasma prolactin between 1400-1700 h. Both CE and PSP rats that had evidence of pituitary tumors and/or lesions exhibited static high levels of prolactin but no obvious surges of secretion. These results demonstrate that predominantly diurnal and nocturnal prolactin surges occur, respectively, in aging CE and PSP rats. Since the CE and PSP states are characterized by high levels of estrogen and progestin secretion, respectively, these distinctly different steroid hormonal milieux may be involved in the control of daily prolactin secretion patterns in aging females.

AB  - A study was conducted to assess the importance of pituitary refractoriness to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) in ending the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and in modulating the associated surge of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in rat plasma. Phenobarbital-blocked proestrous rats were infused iv with LHRH at a constant rate of 50 ng/hr to restore the rising and plateau phases of the spontaneous surges of LH and FSH in plasma. Refractoriness to LHRH was demonstrated for LH but not FSH release when LHRH was infused beyond 2 hr. The plasma LH declined from high levels from 2 to 4.5 hr of infusion while the plasma FSH remained at an elevated plateau. The decline in plasma LH was not as rapid as that observed when the infusion was ended. Injection of a large dose (1 μg) of LHRH at 2 or 3.5 hr after the start of infusion caused substantial increases in plasma LH and FSH but only the LH response after the later injection was less than that observed in other rats given the injection earlier. The results suggest that pituitary refractoriness to LHRH plays a minor role in expediting the decline in the plasma LH during the latter portion of the LH surge and that it has no appreciable effect on the pattern of the plasma FSH at this time. © 1980, SAGE Publications.

AB  - ONLY A LITTLE over a decade ago, any discussion of the function of the pineal gland included qualifying adjectives such as alleged, supposed, and putative. In the same vein, since it connoted a hormonal function, rather than referring to the pineal as a gland, the phrase pineal organ was usually employed to describe this portion of the epithalamus. However, this is no longer the case, at least in mammals. By the usual criteria in endocrinology, the pineal now fulfills all the qualifications of an organ of internal secretion. Several major discoveries revolutionized ideas concerning the function of the pineal gland. Certainly, as noted frequently in other reviews, the isolation and identification of N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin), a pineal hormone, from bovine pineal tissue by Lerner et al. (1, 2) provided a strong impetus for subsequent investigations on this sometimes exasperating organ. At least as important as this discovery, however, were the observations that light and darkness govern both the biosynthetic activity (3, 4) and endocrine capability (5, 6) of the gland. These findings provided the scientific community with a heretofore unknown handle that could be used to exploit and elucidate the functions of the pineal. Indeed, it is my conviction that the one major factor that stymied pineal research until the mid-1960s was the lack of the basic knowledge that the endocrine output of the pineal gland is determined by the photoperiod to which the experimental subjects, be they animals or man, are exposed. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Plasma and urine free carnitine concentration during human development was evaluated. A positive correlation was found between plasma level and body weight in premature neonates weighing between 1.15 and 1.80 kg. In full terms newborns, tbe free carnitine concentration (mean ± S.E., 31.2 ± 2.5. nmoles/ml) is similar to that of premature babies with 33 to 36 wk of gestational age (37.5 ±3.1 nmoles/ml) but significantly lower than that of premature babies aged 30 to 33 wk of gestation (43.0 ± 5.6 nmoles/ml). In the first 2 wk of life, free carnitine level showed a good correlation with age in the full-term newborns. Adult levels are reached by the end of the first 6 months. No sex related difference was observed in any of the different groups during growth. Urinary excretion of free carnitine per day is significantly lower in infants 0 to 3 years old (mean ± S.E., 15.5 ± 1.8 µmoles/24 hr) and in children 3 to 10 years old (115.3 ± 11.4 µmoles/24 hr) than in subjects ranging in age from 22 to 70 years (216.9 ± 20.6 µmoles/24 hr). We found no difference between day- and nighttime urinary excretion in newborns and infants. Speculation: The present observations suggest that fetal free carnitine storage mainly occurs during the 30th to 33rd wk of life. Because the fatty acids are the main energy fuel in the postnatal period and their β-oxidation is carnitine dependent, an exogenous source of this substance seems useful to maintain plasma levels similar to those found in the fetus. The lower free carnitine excretion observed in our children group compared to adult may be related to a smaller muscle mass, different kidney excretion, or reduced endogenous synthesis. © 1980 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - The circulating cortisol level in the fetus has been shown to rise 4-fold from 20 weeks gestation to 38 weeks gestation in the absence of labor. Sulfation of cortisol is a prominent route of its metabolism throughout fetal and in early neonatal life. In amniotic fluid cortisol sulfate rises 5-fold from 32 weeks to term, at a time when the fetus matures, and a close relationship (r = 0.8) has been observed between amniotic fluid levels and indicators of fetal lung maturity such as the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio. Since cortisol sulfate and the related glucocorticoid corticosterone sulfate [here referred to as glucocorticoid sulfates (GCS)] appear to be derived mainly from the fetal adrenal and since they undergo little further change in the placenta or mother, the possibility has been explored that GCS in the maternal urine might be a useful reflection of fetal GCS production. Samples from 44 high-risk patients, 40 non-pregnant patients and 20 newborn infants were studied. Very high concentrations of GCS were found in neonate urine on the first day of life with a rapid fall by the second and third days. confirming the importance of the fetal contribution. A diurnal variation with lower values at night was demonstrated in 7 of 9 women who made 8-h urine collections; 24 h collections were therefore preferred. Raised levels were found in acutely stressed adults. A moderately strong correlation with total urinary estrogens (r = 0.59) was found. Mean levels at 28 weeks of 190 μg/day rose to 425 μg/day at 41 weeks with wide individual variations. In series of three to six consecutive daily collections, the average SD was ± 17% for individual subjects; interassay precision was ± 13%. From studies of L/S ratios and levels at delivery of premature infants it appeared that an excretion of 300 μg/day or more was consistent with lung maturation; however 2 of 13 infants studied close to delivery had low levels which were not associated with the respiratory distress syndrome. While more extensive studies are required to establish the reliability of this entity, the measurement of GCS in maternal urine appears to have some promise as a non-invasive indicator of fetal adrenal function and lung maturation. © 1980.

AB  - We have studied the effects of various anesthetics on the spontaneous release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into hypophysial portal vessel blood and used the techniques of prolonged electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus and iv infusion of GnRH to determine more precisely the relationships between GnRH and LH release and between stored hormone and the amount released. A surge of GnRH (measured by RIA) occurred at the expected time of the spontaneous surge of plasma LH in rats anesthetized on proestrus with Althesin (alphaxalone and alphadolone acetate) but not in rats anesthetized with α-chloralose, ketamine hydrochloride, or urethane. The average amount of GnRH released into portal blood during the surge (128 pg) was relatively small compared to the amount stored in the hypothalamus (6-8 ng). Electrical stimulation of the medial preoptic area in rats anesthetized with urethane produced a surge of LH that was similar to the spontaneous LH surge. This induced surge of LH was preceded by a relatively small increase in the GnRH output (proportional to current strength) but was not accompanied by a significant change in the hypothalamic GnRH content or the pituitary LH content. The iv infusion of GnRH in rats anesthetized with urethane at a rate that produced peripheral plasma concentrations of GnRH similar to those in portal blood during the spontaneous surge in Althesin-treated rats evoked a surge of LH with a height similar to that of the spontaneous LH surge. These results show that 1) the amount of GnRH that needs to be released to evoke a surge of LH at proestrus is very small relative to the amount stored in the hypothalamus (∼ 2%), 2) the timing and duration of the LH surge are determined by the timing and duration of the GnRH surge, and 3) chloralose, ketamine hydrochloride, and urethane block spontaneous GnRH release. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The effect of electrochemical stimulation of the medial preoptic area (MPO) and the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) on LH release was compared among long-term ovariectomized (OVX), ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol benzoate (OVX-E) and proestrous (PE) rats under pentobarbital anesthesia. The MPO stimulation failed to facilitate LH release in OVX rats whereas the stimulation increased serum LH levels in both OVX-E and PE rats. The ARC stimulation resulted in an elevation of serum LH in OVX and PE rats. The time course of serum LH elevation after the electrochemical stimulation of the MPO or the ARC was different between OVX-E and PE rats. In PE rats serum LH concentrations began to rise 20–30 min after the stimulation of the MPO or the ARC with peak values obtained around 70–90 min. Serum LH started to elevate immediately with peak values in 10–20 min following the ARC stimulation in OVX rats and the MPO stimulation in OVX-E rats. The time courses for changes in serum LH concentrations following LH-RH administration were similar in OVX and PE rats. From these results, the lack of circadian rhythm in serum LH levels in long-term OVX rats may be due to the inability of the MPO to respond to the stimulus generated from circadian pacemaker(s). The cause of the delay observed between the stimulation of the MPO and LH rise in PE rats may not exist in the levels of neural transmission between the MPO and the ARC or the pituitary, but in the level of the mediobasal hypothalamus. © 1980, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - Virgin rats exposed for several days to foster young develop a typical pattern of maternal behavior. After the establishment of maternal behavior, the majority of virgins fail to maintain regular estrous cycles in the presence of young and enter a state of prolonged diestrus. The present study investigated whether maternal virgin rats are capable of secreting PRL in two modes which are known to be controlled differentially: 1) secretion in a circadian pattern, which is regulated autonomously, and 2) acute release, which is governed by stimulation from young. To check for circadian secretion of PRL in maternal virgins, we measured daytime (1200 h) and nigh time (0230 h) concentrations of PRL during pup-induced diestrus and throughout the estrous cycle. In maternal virgins which entered prolonged diestrus through exposure to young, PRL was secreted autonomously in a rhythmic pattern of nightly surges. In this respect, the pupinduced diestrus is similar to pseudopregnancy. In contrast, maternally behaving virgins that maintained their estrous cyclicity failed to show any elevation in PRL. To examine acute PRL release induced by pup stimulation, PRL concentrations were measured in cycling and pseudopregnant maternal virgins 4 h after separation from young (at 1300 h) and again 30 min after reunion with young. Only cycling maternal virgins exhibited acute PRL elevation in response to reunion with pups. This response was most pronounced on proestrus and estrus and was moderate or absent on diestrus. During pup-induced pseudopregnancy, however, reunion with young failed to induce any elevation in PRL levels. These results indicate that maternal virgin rats are capable of secreting PRL in two distinct modes. However, the two modes cannot occur simultaneously. Autonomous secretion of PRL in a pattern of daily nocturnal surges occurred only during pupinduced pseudopregnancy, whereas acute PRL release in response to reunion with young occurred only during the estrous cycle. It is possible that in maternal virgin rats, the acute release of PRL induced by pup stimulation is 1) dependent upon a background of estrogen which fluctuates during the estrous cycle and/or 2) suppressed by the mechanism underlying the rhythmic nightly secretion of PRL during pup-induced pseudopregnancy. © 1980 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Changes in the concentration of progesterone in milk fat were measured by radioimmunoassay in 14 lactating buffaloes during the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy. The progesterone in milk fat was minimal at oestrus (2.34 ng./100 μl. in the morning and 2.62 ng./100 μl. in the evening) and increased to 23.28 ng./100 μl. and 24.44 ng./100 μl., respectively, on day 13 after insemination. Thereafter it fell to 1.99 ng./100 μl. (morning) and 2.16 ng./100 μl. (evening) on the day of succeeding oestrus in non‐pregnant animals. In pregnant animals, the level was maintained between 23.29 and 29.88 ng./100 μl. (morning) and 23.90 to 32.88 ng./100 μl. (evening) up to 40 days of pregnancy. The progesterone concentration in the evening samples was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the morning samples. Progesterongehalt in Milchfett von Büffeln während des Brunstzyklus und der Frühgravidität Bei 14 laktierenden Büffeln wurden im Milchfett radioimmunochemisch die Konzentrationsänderungen des Progesterons während des Brunstzyklus' und der Frühgravidität bestimmt. Während der Brunst war die Progesteronkonzentration am kleinsten (morgens 2,34 ng/100 μl; abends 2,62 ng/100 μl). 13 Tage nach der Insemination betrug die Progesteronkonzentration 23,28 ng/100 μl am Morgen und 24,44 ng/100 μl am Abend. Bei unträchtigen Tieren fiel die Progesteronkonzentration bis zur nächsten Brunst auf 1,99 ng/100 μl (morgens) bzw. 2,16 ng/100 μl (abends). Bei den trächtigen Tieren schwankte der Progesteronspiegel bis zum 40. Graviditätstag zwischen 23,29 und 29,88 ng/100 μl (morgens) bzw. zwischen 23,90 und 32,88 ng/100 μl (abends). In der Abendmilch war die Progesteronkonzentration signifikant höher (P < 0,05) als in der Morgenmilch. Taux de progestérone dans la graisse du lait de buffles durant le cycle des chaleurs et le début de la gestation Les changements de concentration de progestérone pendant le cycle des chaleurs et le début de la gestation ont été déterminés radioimmunochimiquement dans les graisse du lait de 14 buffles en lactation. La concentration de progestérone fut la plus faible durant les chaleurs (matin: 2,34 ng/100 μl; soir: 2,62 ng/100 μl). La concentration en progestérone fut de 23,28 ng/100 μl le matin et 24,44 ng/100 μl le soir 13 jours après l'insémination. Cette concentration chez les animaux non portants tomba à 1,99 ng/100 μl le matin et à 2,16 ng/100 μl le soir jusqu'aux chaleurs uivantes. Le taux de progestérone oscilla entre 23,29 et 29,88 ng/100 μl le matin et 23,90 et 32,88 ng/100 μl le soir chez les animaux gravides jusqu'au 40e jour de gestation. La concentration de progestérone fut significativement plus élevée (P < 0,05) dans le lait du soir que dans celui du matin. Progesterona en la grasa de la leche de búfalas durante el ciclo oestral y la gestación temprana En 14 búfalas lactantes se valoraron en la grasa de la leche redioinmunoquímicamente las modificaciones en la concentración de la progesterona durante el ciclo oestral y la gestación temprana. Durante el celo era mínima la concentración de progesterona (por la mañana 2,34 ng./100 μl.; a primeras horas de la noche 2,62 ng./100 μl.). 13 días después de la inseminación importó la concentración de progesterona 23,28 ng./100 μl. por la mañana y 24,44 ng./100 μl. al atardecer. En los animales no gestantes descendió la tasa de progesterona hasta el celo próximo a 1,99 ng./100 μl. (por la mañana) resp. 2,16 ng./100 μl. (al anochecer). En los animales preñados oscilaba el nivel de progesterona hasta el día 40° de gravidez entre 23,29 y 29,88 ng./100 μl. (por la mañana) resp. entre 23,90 y 32,88 ng./100 μl. (al tardecer). En la leche vespertina estaba la concentración de progesterona significamente más elevada (P < 0,05) que en la leche matutina. © 1980 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Polygraphic sleep cycle studies - comprising simultaneous recording of electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, electro-oculogram, phasic body activity and respiration - were performed on 19 term newborn babies born to severely undernourished mothers, and results compared with 19 healthy newborn babies. The sleep cycle in babies of under-nourished mothers showed disorganisation during active rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and quite nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The sleep disorganisation was more pronounced during quiet NREM sleep when frequent phasic activity and ocular movements were registered, thereby leading to a significant increase in the content of intermediate sleep. Furthermore, the duration of total sleep cycle and its components, active REM and quite NREM sleep, were significantly shortened.

AB  - The blood concentration of sodium oxybutyrate has been determined in the mother and the fetus in 40 parturients after obstetrical anesthesia and also in 34 women after removal of the fetus following caeserean section. The blood concentration of sodium oxybutyrate in the fetus depended on the dose and time lag after administration of the drug. After the rest sleep no signs of anesthetic depression in the fetus could be recorded. In 7 out of 34 neonates delivered by caeserean section under sodium oxybutyrate have been found (141 ± 3.2 mg/l in the umbilical vein and 110±2.5 mg/l in the umbilical artery), reaching up to 80-70% of the maternal figures and capable of delaying the restoration of spontaneous respiration in the fetus. With upset of the utero-placental circulation the passage of the anesthetic through the placenta is decreased.

AB  - It is suggested that there exists a competitive antagonist of the cholinergic system which is secreted during sleep, pregnancy, and acute stress. A biochemical model of the sleep cycle is presented. It is suggested that normally the putative cholinergic antagonist is metabolized rapidly upon being released from the cholinergic receptor. Defective metabolism of this putative cholinergic antagonist is hypothesized to be one cause of hypotonic schizophrenia. © 1980, All rights reserved.

AB  - Plasma progesterone, pregnancy maintenance, gestation period, and litter size were measured in mice unilaterally ovariectomized on day of pregnancy (plug day = day 0) and then treated daily with dieldrin (2 mg/kg-1, p.o.). By days 15-16, dieldrin had reduced the pentobarbital sleep time by 54% (P &lt; 0.05), increased the liver mass by 8% (P &lt; 0.05), and increased hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 by 66% (P &lt; 0.05). However, the levels of plasma progesterone in the hemiovariectomized, dieldrin-treated mice were not different from those in the hemiovariectomized controls. Other experiments showed that hemiovariectomy decreased plasma progesterone by about 25%. Moreover, hemiovariectomy increased the frequency of premature delivery but it did not affect litter size; dieldrin treatment did not alter these effects. The failure of the induction to reduce plasma progesterone could result from (1) increased progesterone synthesis compensating for its elevated metabolism or (2) no (net) increase in progesterone metabolism.

AB  - The extra-auditive effects of noise may constitute a danger to health. Noise affects cardiovascular homeostasis. Sound pressures > 70dB produce peripheral vasoconstriction resulting from impulses from the sympathetic system. Individuals who have been exposed to loud noise for several years may develop hypertension as a result of the influence of noise. Animal experimental studies and epidemiological investigations support the hypothesis but important questions are not yet elucidated. Disturbances of sleep resulting from noise, waking, or alteration in the sleep pattern may result in fatigue and possibly in physical and psychiatric disease. To a limited extent, adaptation can render sleep possible in noisy surroundings but this is individually determined. Sensitivity to disturbances in sleep depends upon the age of the person concerned and the sleep pattern. Animal experiments have demonstrated that exposure to noise may have a teratological effect. The effect observed may be attributed to vasoconstriction in the uteroplacental circulation resulting in decreased oxygen tension in the embryo. No similar influence in the development of the human fetus has as yet been demonstrated but the risk should not be underestimated. The possible health dangers resulting from increasing noise levels make limitation of noise pollution essential. Establishment of acoustic limiting values which can protect the population from extra-auditive effects are desirable.

AB  - Between 106 and 144 days' gestation, periods of uterine electromyographic (EMG) activity and associated increases in uterine tone (contractures) were accompanied by a change in fetal ocular activity in 294 (63%) of 467 cases. In 260 (88.4%) of the changes, there was a switch from the active to nonactive state. The incidence of this change was significantly greater (p<0.01) than the switch from the nonactive to the active state. The fetal electrocorticogram changed state in 34 (74%) of 46 contractures, the change being from low-amplitude to high-amplitude activity in 28 (82%) of the cases. This difference was significant (p<0.01). Fetal breathing movements (FBM), as indicated by activity of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, changed in 134 (55%) of 243 contractures, the change being from active to the quiescent state in 115 (85%) of contractures. Diaphragmatic activity changed in 111 (61%) of 183 contractures, with a change from activity to quiescence occurring in 100 instances (90%). Changes in tracheal pressure were associated with an altered state of FBM in 190 (61%) of 314 contractures, and the change was from the presence of FBM to absence of them in 178 (94%) of the changes. In all three of these indicators of FBM, the change from breathing activity to quiescence was statistically significant (p<0.01).

AB  - Symptoms of narcolepsy/cataplexy developed in a monozygotic twin at the age of 56 years, 25 years after the onset of multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis of narcolepsy/cataplexy was confirmed by polygraphic recordings demonstrating sleep-onset periods of rapid eye movements (REM), increase in REM time per 24 hours, and dis­turbed nocturnal sleep. Frequent cataplectic attacks were almost com­pletely controlled by clomipramine. These symptoms may constitute one of the paroxysmal syndromes in multiple sclerosis. The discordancy for multiple sclerosis is attributed to a submaximal risk factor in the HLA system and a strong environmental factor in only one of the twins. © 1980 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Chlordiazepoxide HCl, a widely used tranquilizer, was evaluated for pre- and postnatal effects in rats by dosing orally on days 1-21 of gestation. In the prenatal study, maternally tolerated doses of 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day of chlordiazepoxide produced a dose-related decrease in fetal weight and an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies. The latter consisted of retarded calvarial ossification and miscellaneous sternal defects. In the postnatal study, the parturition was delayed for 24 h in a few dams from the 25 and 50 mg/kg groups. There was a reduction in the pup survival and mean pup weight, an increase in the number of runts, an impairment in locomotion and a delay in hair growth and opening of vagina. The 12-week-old female offspring in the 50 mg/kg group manifested a marked prolongation of hexobarbital sleeping time; suggesting that the hepatic microsomal enzymes have been suppressed in these animals. © 1980.

AB  - The pre- and postnatal effects were studied following combined oral administration of ethanol (3 g/kg/day) and chlordiazepoxide (CDX, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day) to rats. The dams were dosed on days 1-21 of gestation in the prenatal study, and on days 6-21 in the postnatal study. The controls were given distilled water or aqueous ethanol (10 ml/kg/day). Maternal toxicity was observed in the groups given ethanol plus 50 or 100 mg/kg CDX. Ethanol alone did not produce any detrimental effects on litter size, litter or pup weights. Combined administration of CDX with ethanol caused a decrease in the mean fetal weight and an increase in the incidences of resorptions, runts and a variety of skeletal anomalies. In the postnatal study, ethanol alone did not affect pup survival or growth, whereas the combined dosing of ethanol and CDX resulted in delayed parturition, increased stillbirths, reduced pup survival, lowered mean pup weight and slow body weight gain compared to the control groups. In ten week old progeny exposed to CDX and ethanol, the pentobarbital sleeping time was significantly prolonged in females but shortened in males; suggesting thereby a sex-related difference in the ability of CDX to alter pentobarbital action in rats. The results of this study compared with CDX alone treated rats suggest that there is a lack of toxic interaction between ethanol and chlordiazepoxide so far as the pre- and postnatal development of rats is concerned.

AB  - The authors interviewed 200 pregnant women and another 200 patients on their own maternity ward to find out their views and wishes regarding pain-reducing procedures during delivery, with or without reduced consciousness in the course of labour. Only 13% of them wanted to sleep during delivery, while almost 90% insisted on being kept fully alert and to play an active role in childbirth. Yet, there has been a growing demand for analgetic treatment among maternity ward patients, which obviously, has been attributable to birth trauma. For example, the percentage of women who asked for peridural anesthesia grew from 36 ante-partum to 64 post-partum. The replies given by the patients were then related to the results of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) and cerebral electric stimulation (CES). Both methods had good effects on more than 50% of the cases and partial effects on 25 to 30%. The authors feel that those no-risk simple methods should give good results in most cases in terms of less labour pain with full consciousness. Other methods, with a higher risk, might be reserved for patients on whom simple methods fail.

AB  - Des enregistrements prolongés diurnes EEG et polygraphiques ont été obtenus à 36, 38 et 40 semaines d'âge conceptionnel, puis une fois par semaine pendant 12 semaines, puis à 26 et 52 semaines aprés terme chez 5 enfants nés à 30–33 semaines de gestation. Ces bébés se sont développés normalement jusqu'à 18–38 mois. Les 74 EEGs obtenus sont normaux pour l'âge. Les données qui en dérivent sont comparées aux données similaires obtenues chez 17 bébés normaux nés à terme. Le pattern de type tracé alternant disparaît plus tôt dans le groupe de prématurés que dans le groupe contrôle (âges moyens 21.4 vs. 33.4 jours aprés terme; P < 0.01). Les fuseaux de sommeil rolandiques apparaissent plus tôt dans le groupe de prématurés (âges moyens 35.4 vs 43.8 jours; P < 0.05). Il n'y a pas de différence entre les groupes en ce qui concerne: (1) le passage de l'endormissement en sommeil actif à l'endormissement en sommeil calme; (2) les pourcentages de sommeil actif et de sommeil calme par rapport au temps de sommeil total; (3) la disparition des ondes pointues frontales. En gros, l'accession aux patterns EEG de sommeil ‘infantile’ survient entre 35 et 60 jours aprés terme (moyenne 43.8) pour le groupe prématuré et à 27–66 jours (moyenne 46.4) pour le groupe à terme (différence non significative). Ces données indiquent qu'il n'y a pas de risque d'erreur en pratique clinique si l'on applique les mêmes critères de maturation aux EEGs aprés terme des prématurés qu'aux EEGs d'enfants nés à terme. © 1980, All rights reserved.

AB  - Transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2) was continuously monitored, and behavioral state was evaluated in a group of 10 normal preterm infants and 10 normal term infants. In the preterm infant group, birth weight was 1505 ± 154 g, gestational age was 32.3 ± 2.3 wk, and postnatal age was 8.4 ± 5.1 days (mean ± S.D.). In the term infant group, birth weight was 3245 ± 247 g, gestational age was 39.9 ± 0.3 wk, and postnatal age was 6.3 ± 3.4 days (mean ± S.D.). A mean tcPO2 level for each behavioral state in each infant was calculated, and a paired comparison between all states was made. In the preterm and term infant groups, mean tcPCO2 levels were higher in state 1 (“quiet sleep”), state 4 (“active awake state”), and state 5 (“crying”) than during state 2 (“active sleep”). The difference (ΔtcPO2) was significant (P &lt; 0.05). In the preterm infant group, mean ΔtcPO2 level in state 2 was 62.9 ± 17.1 mm Hg (mean ± S.D.). Mean ΔtcPO2 in state 1 was +5.4 mm Hg (range, −0.9 to +9.2 mm Hg), mean rtcPO2 in state 4 was +6.8 mm Hg (range, +0.6 to +20.2 mm Hg), and in state 5 was +9.9 mm Hg (range, +5.1 to +17.5 mm Hg). In the term infant group, mean tcPO2 level in state 2 was 64.5 ± 9.6 mm Hg (mean ± S.D.). Mean rtcPO2 in state 1 was +5.8 mm Hg (range, −1.2 to +11.0 mm Hg), mean AtcPO2 in state 4 was +8.1 mm Hg (range, +2.2 to +32.3 mm Hg), and mean rtcPO2 in state 5 was +7.3 mm Hg (range, −1.6 to +26.5 mm Hg). There was insufficient data to evaluate tcPO2 levels during state 3 (“quiet awake state”). In the term infant group, the effect of bottle feeding on tcPO2 was also assessed. Gross alterations in tcPO2 during bottle feeding were not observed, and mean tcPO2 levels during bottle feeding (76.1 ± 8.5 mm Hg; mean ± S.D.) were not significantly different from mean tcPO2 levels found during states 1, 4, and 5. Speculation: In healthy newborn infants, crying (state 5) may be a physiologic mechanism reducing pulmonary atelectasis acquired during state 2 (“active sleep”, “REM sleep”). © 1980 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was recorded from the frontal cortex of unanaesthetized and urethane-anaesthetized lactating rats and analysed in relation to the pattern of milk ejection evoked by the nursing pups. The EEG of the anaesthetized rat fluctuated without experimental intervention between three distinctive patterns defined as synchronized, desynchronized, and stage III activity, whilst reflex milk ejection recurred at intervals of about 6 min (range 2->20 min) throughout the 1-4 h period the pups were left attached to the nipples. For > 10 s before and for up to 60 s after each milk ejection, as judged from recordings of intramammary pressure and pup behaviour, the EEG was invariably synchronized throughout. Conversely, milk ejection (n>300) was never observed during long periods of desynchronized, or stage III EEG activity. The vigorous increase in the sucking of the pups at milk ejection failed to produce a desynchronization (arousal) of the EEG as observed with other forms of sensory stimulation. Indeed, the sucking of the pups appeared to produce a soporific change in the maternal EEG for spontaneous periods of desynchronization were not observed in the 30-60 min following the initial attachment of the pups to the nipples. Similar EEG patterns were seen in the unanaesthetized rat, though arousal from the synchronized state was more easily produced, e.g., by weak auditory signals. Milk ejection, as judged from the behaviour of the pups, recurred at intervals of 2 min or more during each 20-80 min period of nursing. The rat appeared somnolent for most of the nursing period and the EEG was always synchronized for > 10 s before each milk ejection (n>200), though her eyes usually remained open. Arousal and desynchronization of the EEG was invariably observed in association with the increased pup behaviour at milk ejection. From these observations and the knowledge that oxytocin release from the neurohypophysis occurs about 10 s before milk ejection, we conclude that a synchronized EEG pattern, akin to that associated with 'slow-wave sleep', is an essential prerequisite for the expression of the milk-ejection reflex in the rat. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The effects of althesin (group A) and thiopentone (group B) in mother and newborn were compared after their use in the induction of narcosis in 80 patients undergoing Caesarean section. The mean doses of althesin (0.072 ml/kg i.v.) and thiopentone (4.1 mg/kg i.v.) proved sufficient to guarantee rapid onset of sleep (about 20 seconds) in both groups. As of cardiovascular effects on the mother in the induction-extraction period, greater stability of cardiac frequency (c.f.) was noted with thiopentone, while althesin produced rapid, frequent variations in c.f. The reverse phenomenon was observed with respect to arterial pressure variations. The clinical condition of the newborns at 1st, 3rd and 5th minutes after extractions, assessed by means of the Apgar index, was excellent in both groups of patients. Results obtained were assessed by analysing variance with the Fischer test.

AB  - There is strong evidence that sudden infant death syndrome (or cot death) is associated with upper airway (obstructive) apnœa, but the exact mechanism for the development of the apnœa is not known. This hypothesis proposes that the structural relationship of the left recurrent largyngeal nerve (LRLN) with the pulmonary artery trunk, the aorta, and ductus arteriosus constitutes a potential entrapment mechanism and a source for pathological reflexes. Intermittent stimulation/conduction block of the LRLN due to compression of the nerve by a tense and dilated pulmonary artery trunk, may result in expiration reflex or laryngeal spasm, followed by obstructive apnœa. Any condition leading to chronic hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension could subsequently involve these defensive reflexes, which in less dramatic circumstances generate secondary hypoxia and further increase the pulmonary arteriolar resistance in a cyclic fashion. If the apnœic episode were longer than 20 seconds, there could be an acute danger of definitive respiratory failure. Infants with delayed circulatory readjustment after birth might be at risk of this cyclic phenomenon developing. Screening for shunts in the neonatal period might help identify infants at risk and thereby prevent cot death. © 1980, All rights reserved.

AB  - Physiologic studies on 57 nurses in surgical departments of two general hospitals in Moscow have shown that the state of physiological functions in these nurses depends on the working regimen. The most marked alterations occurred in those working on a 24-hour basis, less marked in those working at night time with intervals of 57 or less hours between shifts, and the least marked in those on duty in daytime. Physiologic indices were worse in pregnant than in nonpregnant nurses. In addition, there was noted a considerable flattening of the arches of the feet toward the end of daytime and night-time work (by 24. 1% and 19. 4% on average, respectively).

AB  - Recordings of the electrical activity of the brain were obtained by using conventional EEG and computerized EEG. Both methods of recording have been used as an indicator of the cerebral condition before and after intravenous premedication with diazepam 20 mg. Two groups of patients were studied. The first group consisted of younger patients (Gr. A n = 8), the other of geriatric patients (Gr. B n = 8). Evaluation of EEG and CEEG was done by two experienced electroencephalographers separately. Interpretations of both methods were compared and found to correspond. In group A variations found in the baseline EEG were within normal limits and corresponded with those seen in the average population. In group B 67.5% of the examined EEG's showed variations from normal. After intravenous premedication with diazepam both groups of patients showed changes in the electrogram as well as in the clinical condition. Changes in group B were more marked. Characteristic of EEG changes induced by diazepam was a high increase of activity of beta waves from 12-20 Hz and decrease of alpha waves. The alterations were seen together with the clinical signs of psychical indifference and effects of sedation. A temporary activation of frequencies between 4-8 Hz was also found which indicates sleep.

AB  - EEGs of 82 full-term healthy newborns in the first week of life were analysed with regard to the location and frequency of bi- and triphasic sharp transients. Such patterns of different degrees of sharpness were located predominantly in the right central-temporal area in 80.5% of the tested babies and on the left in only 12%. The average interval between transients was 3 min 47 sec on the right as compared with 15 min on the left. In 20.7% of the cases unmistakable sharp and slow wave complexes were recorded. These sharp transients were recorded chiefly in the transitional phase between active and quiet sleep. They were maximal in the region of electrode T4. In bipolar records they appeared most frequently in the transverse T4-C4 derivation, and showed only inconstant spread to adjacent derivations in longitudinal temporal linkages. No relationship between head position at birth and lateralization of these graphoelements could be demonstrated. Their origin is unknown and is probably multifactorial. 'Physiological birth trauma' and immaturity of inhibitory cerebral systems in the first few weeks of life may be involved. The generally slower maturation of the sub-dominant hemisphere could explain the right predominance of these transients. The especially low convulsive threshold of the limbic system appears to be partly responsible for their predominant temporal location. © 1980.

AB  - Synopsis: Flunitrazepam1 is a benzodiazepine derivative whose hypnotic effect predominates over the sedative, anxiolytic, muscle-relaxing and anticonvulsant effects characteristic of benzodiazepines. Thus, it is used as a night-time hypnotic and in anaesthesiology; due to the pronounced hypnotic effect it is not appropriate as a daytime sedative. Asa hypnotic for insomnia its effect is usually characterised by a very fast onset of action and quiet sleep without interruptions. On the morning after a hypnotic dose some residual psychomotor impairment does occur, which is comparable to that with usual doses ofnitrazepam or flurazepam, but clinically apparent ‘hangover’ occurs infrequently.There is no pronounced cumulative effect with chronic use. In anaesthesiology it has proven to be useful as a hypnotic on the night before operation, as an oral, intramuscular or intravenous premedication, in induction and as a supplement to other anaesthetics. Its sedative and amnesic properties can also be beneficial in intensive care patients. Much of the usefulness of flunitrazepam in anaesthesia relates to its synergistic effect with other anaesthetics, to its effective amnesic action and its acceptable effects on circulation and respiration. Possible drawbacks include a somewhat unusual course of induction (when used for this purpose) and an often prolonged recovery. Although the safe dosage range is wide with flunitrazepam, its effective application both as a hypnotic for insomnia and in anaesthesiology is dependent upon use of the optimal dosage, and adequate knowledge of its pharmacokinetic properties. Pharmacodynamic Studies: Flunitrazepam, like other benzodiazepines, has a selective effect on GABA (gamma-aminobutyric-acid)-mediated synaptic processes of the brain. Facilitation of the inhibitory effect of GABAergic synaptic transmission especially affects the limbic system. (The highly selective and saturable synaptic inhibition of GABA-mediated activities is accepted as the basis of the extraordinary safety range of benzodiazepines.) The different affinity of various benzodiazepines to specific benzodiazepine receptors correlates well with their pharmacological and therapeutic potencies. The relative weight-for-weight potency of flunitrazepam is high, on an average about 10 times as potent as diazepam; however, there is wide variation in this potency coefficient for different effects. Flunitrazepam produces a dose- and time-dependent amnesic effect, which is more complete and somewhat longer than the amnesia after diazepam, but clearly less intense and shorter than that produced by lorazepam. This amnesic effect is an important characteristic of flunitrazepam’s use in different anaesthesia techniques, as it prevents patients from having unpleasant experiences during different stages of anaesthesia and operation. The most typical feature of flunitrazepam on the cardiovascular system is peripheral vasodilatation. This is possibly due to its direct relaxing effect on the muscle fibres in the vascular wall. A decrease in cardiac output also occurs, which is more pronounced in patients with cardiovascular disease. This effect, together with a marked decrease in peripheral resistance, results in a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure. The primary phenomenon may be limited to this peripheral vasodilatation, with a secondary decrease in venous return. This emphasises the importance of normal blood volume and active fluid infusion when flunitrazepam is used intravenously. Flunitrazepam has a depressive influence on respiration, even in small intravenous doses, and this effect is augmented by simultaneously administered analgesics or hypnotics. In occasional extreme cases there may be need for respiratory assistance. The effect on respiration results in a significant decrease in arterial oxygen tension; this may be corrected by increasing oxygen concentration in the inspired air. Pharmacokinetic Studies: Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic behaviour of flunitrazepam is extremely important for optimum practical use of this drug, especially in anaesthesiology. Flunitrazepam is almost completely (80 to 90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but the bioavailability of suppositories is only 50 %. After intramuscular injection the absorption corresponds with absorption via the oral route, thus differing profitably from diazepam which is erratically absorbed from intramuscular sites. Flunitrazepam is 80% bound to plasma proteins. Its pharmacokinetic behaviour can be illustrated with a 3-compartment model, which has important clinical implications. Rapid redistribution from the central (plasma) compartment to tissue compartments explains the discrepancy between the half-life of the drug and the duration of its clinical effects. Thus, the overall elimination half-life is about 20 hours, which is much longer than the duration of clinical effects. There is fairly good correlation between the clinical effects and the logarithm of the plasma concentration. Metabolism of flunitrazepam is nearly complete. There are several metabolites, but the most important are the 7-amino, the 1-desmethyl, and the 3-hydroxy derivatives. Some of the metabolites are active and may have an important influence on clinical effects. Excretion is via the urine, and thus renal insufficiency results in accumulation of the metabolites. In patients with normal renal function there is no progressive accumulation of metabolites with a daily dose of 2mg flunitrazepam. Metabolism and elimination are age-dependent, and the dose must be reduced in elderly patients. Therapeutic Trials: Flunitrazepam has been studied in 2 areas of use — as a night hypnotic and in different applications in anaesthesiology. The hypnotic effects of flunitrazepam have been studied in both ‘normal’ people and in insomniacs. In a dose of 2mg flunitrazepam is an effective and fast sleep-inducing drug with a sufficient duration of action to maintain quiet sleep until morning. In double-blind trials it was significantly better than a placebo, barbiturates or nitrazepam. Flunitrazepam causes a significant latency in the appearance of the first REM (rapid eye movement) period, and decreases the number of REM periods during the night, but not the duration of individual REM periods. There is a marked shift of REM periods to the last two-thirds of the night. These effects on sleep patterns are probably less ’unphysiological’ than the effects of barbiturates. The data concerning residual effects of flunitrazepam in the morning are somewhat divergent. Some authors claim that there is no morning-after hangover, but others have demonstrated impaired psychomotor skills the next morning. There may be residual anxiolysis on the following day, which can be desirable or undesirable depending on the patient’s daily activity and requirements. Flunitrazepam 2mg appears to be suitable for use as a premedication on the night before anaesthesia. On operation day the effect can be increased by another 2mg given orally or intramuscularly. The patient will be sleepy and anxiety minimised until anaesthesia. Anaesthesia induction may be performed with intravenous flunitrazepam. The dose is dependent on age and physical status and the use of other anaesthetics, but 0.02 to 0.03mg/kg is most frequently used. In some resistant patients anaesthesia cannot be induced with flunitrazepam. Typically, such patients are addicted to sedatives, especially benzodiazepines, or alcohol. In such cases the effect of flunitrazepam may be potentiated with agents such as fentanyl and nitrous oxide or thiopentone. Indeed, flunitrazepam shows typical synergism with nitrous oxide, analgesics and ketamine. Synergism with muscle relaxants is less obvious. The course of anaesthesia with flunitrazepam is usually quiet and even. Depending on the dose of flunitrazepam, and use of other anaesthetics, the recovery may be either relatively fast or prolonged. Typically, during recovery the patient will fall asleep when he is free from pain or is undisturbed. The amnesic properties of flunitrazepam have been widely applied in supplementation of other general or local anaesthesias using incremental doses of flunitrazepam. Properly titrated doses improve different stages and different types of anaesthesia. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are reduced by flunitrazepam. In intensive care, its amnesic and hypnotic effects and synergism with analgesics can be applied to improve the patient’s tolerance of unpleasant therapeutic procedures. Side Effects: The only common side effect of flunitrazepam when used as a hypnotic is a possible residual effect on the morning following the night of drug intake. The use of flunitrazepam in anaesthesia results in prolongation of recovery, this effect being highly dose-dependent. However, when patients are kept under proper postoperative observation the long standing anxiolytic, sedative and synergistic effect with analgesics may be advantageous. In some cases disturbing cough or hiccup may occur at induction. During injection of flunitrazepam the patient often experiences pain along the injection vein. However, significantly fewer long term venous sequelae occur than with intravenous diazepam (with propyleneglycol as solvent). No allergic reactions have been reported with flunitrazepam. Dosage and Administration: Flunitrazepam is relatively contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis. Its use during early pregnancy and in Caesarean section, as a part of general anaesthesia, is unsettled. Doses of 0.02mg/kg or more should be avoided in outpatients, because of possible long lasting disturbances in coordination. The usual dose of flunitrazepam as a sleep-inducing agent is 2mg orally. In older patients 1 mg may be more suitable. As a premedication 2mg orally on the night before operation, and then 2mg orally or 1.5 to 2 mg intramuscularly for adult patients 2 to 3 hours prior to anaesthesia is recommended. The usual induction dose is 0.02 to 0.03mg/kg. As a supplement 0.005 to 0.01 mg/kg is usually sufficient. These doses should be reduced in patients with cardiovascular disease and in older patients. © 1980, ADIS Press Australasia Pty Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till the first four months of life. Additionally sleep stages were registered polygraphically during several weeks. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own schedule. It could be demonstrated that the spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour was mainly driven by 3 endogenous rhythms: The Basic rest activity cycle with a period of about 50 minutes, a 4-hour cycle already established during the first 2 weeks of life and a circadian rhythm which developed during the second month of life. So far the presented results support earlier studies of Kleitman and Engelmann, Sterman and Hoppenbrouwers, Hellbrugge etc. the present study, however, gives further evidence, that these rhythms do not run independently, but constitute a system of interacting oscillators.

AB  - Standard oral glucose tolerance test was carried out in the morning and afternoon, in ten normal pregnant women during the third trimester. Though the mean blood sugar values at fasting 30 or 60 min were higher, and those at 90, 120, 150 min were lower in the morning test as compared to that in the afternoon, the difference was not statistically significant. Two women showed abnormal tolerance giving an incidence of gestational diabetes as 20 per cent.

AB  - The laboratory assessment of prolactin status was evaluated by detailed study of 921 subjects (587 normal subjects and 334 patients with pathological conditions). The effect on serum prolactin levels of age, sex, circadian rhythm, pulsatility of secretion, stress, drug ingestion, and pregnancy was defined in normal subjects. The normal prolactin responses to stimulation (TRH, metoclopramide) and suppression (L-dopa, bromocriptine) were also determined. Basal prolactin levels were measured in patients with defined pathological conditions including prolactinoma, idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia, acromegaly, Cushing's disease, chronic renal failure, primary hypothyroidism, pituitary ablation, Kallman's syndrome, Nelson's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, gonadotrophin deficiency, craniopharyngioma, panhypopituitarism, and chronic progressive arthropathy. Based on these data, a strategy for the routine laboratory assessment of prolactin status is outlined.

AB  - Rhythmometry on emotionally disturbed identical twins is applied for study of possible emotional chronopathology. Several circadian rhythmic variables are apparently 24-h synchronized in both twins, during a study span associated with mania in one twin and apparently 'normal' behavior in the other. While the data span of 3 weeks does not allow validation of any desynchronization with a period quite near to 24 h in the case of a manic girl, it does not rule out the possibility of uncoupling of an adrenal cortical cycle, gauged by the circadian rhythm in urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion. The question whether circadian or other dyschronism was present, and, if so, represented a trivial corollary or, perhaps, a determinant of emotional pathology, remains unanswered. The methodology here illustrated and added tests of differences in rhythm characteristics are likely to provide answers to such questions when they are combined with therapeutic manipulations and the search for possible chronobiotic drugs.

AB  - Basal activity of L-cystine arylamidase, an LH-RH-degrading enzyme, was determined in the hypothalamus of rats at 4 h intervals throughout the 4-day estrus cycle. The activity of the enzyme system fluctuated during the four estrus stages in a circadian rhythm with maximal values in the night and lowest values at noon. The injection of increasing doses of estradiol-17β at various estrus stages caused a moderate stimulation of enzyme activity with no relationship to endogenous hormone levels or estrus stage. The highest activation of the hypothalamic enzyme in response to the application of progesterone occurred at such periods of the cycle when endogenous plasma progesterone is known to be low, and vice versa. When luteinizing hormone or prostaglandin E2 were injected i.v. during the various estrus stages maximal stimulation could be observed at diestrus. The LH-RH-degrading L-cystine arylamidase in the hypothalamus of the rat seems to play a modulating role in the regulation of the tonic LH release during the estrus cycle, but apparently does not influence the events governing the preovulatory LH peak.

AB  - Deep body temperatures were monitored with an implanted radiotelemetry device from 2 to 4 days prepartum to approximately 12 days postpartum in sows. The mean prepartum temperature of five normal sows was 38.6°C, with a range of 38.3 - 38.9°C. An increase in body temperature (1.4°C) was associated with parturition. The increase in body temperature began about 12 hours before the first pig was born, peaked 1 - 2 hours after delivery of the last pig, and decreased during the first day postpartum but did not reach the prepartum values. Two days postpartum, the mean body temperature was about 1°C higher than it was during the prepartum period. The mean body temperature increased an average of 0.06°C per day during the 12-day postpartum period. A diurnal pattern was evident in the body temperature variations.

The unanesthetized animals were confined to restraining chairs and maintained in a controlled environment with continuous monitoring of spontaneous uterine dynamics. Forty-five determinations of blood: flow distribution were made using radionuclide-labeled microspheres. The microsphere injections confirmed a circadian pattern of uterine blood flow. These biorhythms are related to alterations in distribution of blood flow to placental and nonplacental portions of the uterus. Myometrial blood flow is highest during the period of light. It is correlated positively to aortic blood pressure (r = 0.490, p < 0.05) and inversely to uterine artery blood flow (r = -0.508, p < 0.05). Placental blood flow is highest during. the period of darkness. The flow rates are significantly correlated to intra-amniotic pressure (r = -0.602, p < 0.05) but not to aortic blood pressure (r = -0.185, p > 0.05). The data indicate that blood flow distribution in the primate uterus is modulated by factors in addition to physiologic pressure-flow relationships. Extrapolation to the human has potential significance. © 1979.

AB  - Choline acetyltransferase (EC. 2.3.1.6) activity in human blood showed a diurnal oscillation. A peak of activity was observed in the evening and a trough in the morning. No difference was found between the sexes at any time of the day. The diurnal differences were observed on groups of volunteers at two fixed hours of the day (11.00 and 19.00) as well as on a male and a female volunteer in a longitudinal study which lasted 4 days. The enzymatic activity appeared also to increase in the blood of pregnant women at an early time of pregnancy and lasted throughout pregnancy. Blood from newborn had an enzymatic activity comparable to that of pregnant women. Control women showed a variation in their blood choline acetyltransferase activity which was higher late in their menstrual cycle. The latter data are correlated with changes in steroid hormone levels suggesting the possibility of a functional link between hormones and choline acetyltransferase may be at the level of the induction of the enzymes.

AB  - Rats were exposed on gestational day 15 to 125 r X-irradiation, a treatment known to severely alter brain morphology. At 4-6 weeks of age the behavior of these animals was studied using two methods: (1) measurements of circadian locomotor activity, (2) photographic analysis of behavioral acts. The circadian locomotor activity of irradiated rats was similar to that of controls tested individually or as groups in a residential unit. After morphine sulfate, 2 mg/kg, the increase in locomotor activity was greater for the irradiated than control groups. Successive frames of photographic film were analyzed to determine the frequency, duration, sequencing of behavioral acts. No significant differences were present in these parameters of behavioral acts of control and irradiated rats. After morphine, irradiated rats showed a greater increase than controls in frequency and initiations of some behavioral acts, and these acts were more randomly dispersed in the sequences of acts. In this experiment activity was little affected by an agent which severely alters brain morphology, but the latent behavioral effects of the permanent brain damage became manifest, when the testing situation included challenge with a low dose of a drug which caused hyperactivity.

AB  - The study was designed to determine if chronic lead exposure would result in a maternal toxicity expressed as alterations in maternal care giving which could have adverse consequences in terms of offspring development and subsequent behavior. The dams in this study were exposed to either 0,200 or 400 mg/kg of lead acetate from 21-99 days of age via a daily restricted watering schedule with exposure continuing throughout gestation and nursing. Since availability of food and water have been shown to alter circadian pattern of maternal behavior, an ad lib control group was also included. Maternal behavior was assessed by videotaping alternate days of nursing as well as running tests of pup retrieval. Analysis of retrieval data revealed that a higher percentage of ad lib dams initiated retrieval over the days of testing as compared to the other three groups. However, analyses of the frequency of various videotaped maternal behaviors revealed only a difference in the circadian patterns between the ad lib dams and the 0, 200, and 400 dams. This was true even in the presence of elevated dam and pup lead blood levels in the latter two groups. Moreover the groups did not differ in the ages at which a number of developmental landmarks appeared. Thus it appears that alterations in maternal behavior may be eliminated as a source of confounding in examining the deleterious effects of chronic lead exposure on subsequent offspring behavior.

AB  - This article discusses the experimental evidence which suggests that the pineal gland and its innervating neurons are useful paradigms for the study of neuroendocrine integrative processes. The obtained results can be summarized as follows: 1) existence of putative receptors for various hormones (estradiol, testosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, prolactin) in the mammalian pineal gland; (2) steroid metabolic pattern in the pineal gland resembling other brain areas involved in gonadotrophic regulation; (3) control of pineal estrophilic and androphilic receptors by adrenergic transmitter through β-adrenergic receptors and at a translational level; (4) denervation supersensitivity of hormone receptors to neurotransmitter; (5) modification of neuronal activity by hormone treatment at ganglionic and preganglionic sites of action; (6) estrophilic binding sites in ganglia; (7) correlation of pineal responsiveness to hormones with activity of sympathetic nerves; (8) modification by hormones of pineal β-adrenergic mechanisms (9) dissociation of hormone effects on the pineal gland in those mediated or modulated by changes in afferent neuronal activity and those relatively unaffected by denervation. Collectively these data indicate that neuroendocrine, endocrine-neural and endocrine-endocrine transducing processes occur in the pinealocytes and superior cervical ganglia.

AB  - Two groups of pregnant rats were administered methadone hydrochloride by oral intubation during the last two weeks of gestation. Both a 10 mg/kg and a 15 mg/kg group initially received 5 mg/kg on Days 8 through 11 of gestation followed by 10 mg/kg on Days 12 through 15. The 10 mg/kg group was maintained at this level whereas the higher dose-level group was increased to 15 mg/kg on Day 16 of gestation. An intubation control group received sterile water alone on the same gestation days and a nontreated control group was left undisturbed. All experimental and control litters were fostered at birth to untreated mothers. Groups of 3 littermates from each of the treated and control groups were tested for an 8 hr observation period on electronic activity monitors at 17, 22 and 30 days of age. Compared with controls, the 10 mg/kg offspring were more active at 17 and 22 days of age and, in addition, showed more frequent shifts from low to high activity. Only an attenuated effect was observed among the 15 mg/kg group and by 30 days of age, one of the methadone treated offspring differed from the controls. The findings are discussed in relation to clinical reports on hyperactivity, sleep disturbance and increased lability of state observed among opiate exposed infants.

AB  - Oral administration of o-chloro 2-phenyl ethyl allophanate (S.C.S. 100) to male and pregnant, or not, female mice, to male and female rats, to male guinea-pigs and rabbits induces, according to tested doses and animal species, a reduction of motoricity, a state of sleepiness giving way to exterior solicitations, a loss of balance, a diminution of muscular tonus or a temporary loss of righting reflex going with narcosis and a reversible suppression of sensibility. The narco-hypnotic action of S.C.S. 100 qualitatively similar to that of secobarbital needs 1.5 to 3 times higher doses to appear and has a little longer latent period but without any excitation. The new synthesized molecule differs also from the barbiturate as its therapeutic index is 3 times higher.

AB  - Some 45 scientists from Australia and New Zealand participated in a workshop on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) research. The pathologists emphasized the need for a cooperative effort to assemble control material, since accidental deaths are rare in he SIDS age range. Animal experiments on respiratory and circulatory factors in the genesis of intrathoracic petechiae were presented. Acute asphyxial factors in SIDS were accepted, but further work was recommended on evidence currently attributed to chronic hypoxia. The physiologists focused their discussions on breathing mechanisms in the fetus and newborn, on apnoea and states of depressed arousal, and on the problems of home-monitoring. Sleep apnoea and 'near-miss' SIDS syndromes were related to the loss of muscle tone in the upper airway during REM-sleep, to the possible enlargement of the tongue with artificial feeding, and to laryngeal obstructions from vagal damage or temporal lobe seizures. The biochemists discussed 'sudden' death syndromes of poultry associated with hypoglycaemia, the effects of hypoglycaemia on disturbances of breathing, and the mechanism of fatal apnoea induced by chlormethiazole ('half' thiamine). Veterinary models were discussed for postnatal deaths during minor stress, and from preceding occult damage to the nervous system (after prenatal hyperthermia in the guinea-pigs, in foals from working-mixtures which damaged the recurrent laryngeal nerves, and in newborn foxes from thiamine deficiency). Epidemiological clues from SIDS infants included depressed reaction to needle prick, excessive sweating, fatigue and stress, and possible uneven geographical distributions.

AB  - The aim of intrapartum fetal monitoring is to prevent fetal mortality and morbidity which may occur during labour from factors other than trauma. The morbidity that gives cause for greatest concern is brain damage, leading to subsequent neurological syndromes including mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. Fetal electroencephalography is the only method available for direct monitoring of fetal cerebral function in labour. The difficulties of using fetal electroencephalography may be conveniently divided into the technical problems of obtaining a satisfactory signal and the clinical impracticalities of utilizing the voluminous unprocessed trace that is produced by conventional EEG recorders.

AB  - The clinical effects of oral oxazepam and placebo as premedicants were tested in a double-blind study in 40 gynaecological patients. The gas chromatographically measured concentrations of the active, unconjugated forms of oxazepam in the plasma were correlated with the clinical effects of oxazepam, assessed both subjectively and objectively. The insertion of an intravenous cannula was significantly more difficult (p<0.001) in the placebo premedicated group. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the cutaneous temperature of the left forefinger. Of the eleven parameters tested there was a significant difference between the oxazepam and placebo group in the quality of sleep on the night before operation (p<0.05) and in the degree of preoperative sedation (p<0.01). The combined results of the eleven parameters of the oxazepam group also differed positively significantly from the placebo group (p<0.01). There was no obvious relationship between the plasma concentration and clinical effect of oxazepam.

AB  - Studies of physiologic variables, such as the fetal heart beat and rate, fetal respiratory movements, have raised the issue of whether prenatal behavioral states exist. This combination of behavioral variables and physiologic variables may be termed psychophysiology. The purposes of the authors in this article are to present a body of information that may serve as a basis for understanding recent progress with respect to bioelectronic fetal monitoring and to introduce the concept of fetal behavioral states. Several questions are posed in this presentation. How do present monitoring techniques permit to document a fetal behavioral state? Does the existence of fetal states alter our interpretation of clinical fetal bioelectronic monitoring studies? If fetal state reflects fetal brain function, does the observation of these psychophysiologic variables allow us to determine fetal health or fetal risk? If the patterns of fetal behavior exist prior to birth, do these relate to later human behavior?

AB  - The transplacental passage of diazepam (DZ) was studied in 32 cases of vaginal breech delivery. DZ (30 mg) was injected intravenously 15-170 seconds before delivery in order to induce sleep, and general anaesthesia was maintained with N2O/O2. The concentration of DZ was measured in blood obtained from the mother, the umbilical cord and the newborn. In the majority of the infants the drug concentration in mixed cord blood and in capillary blood at the age of 2 hours were lower than previously observed in infants with cephalic presentations delivered by forceps. The short injection-delivery (I-D) intervals in breech deliveries may limit the transfer of drug to the foetus, but cord compression and circulatory changes may also lead to reduced materno-foetal exchange of DZ.

AB  - It would appear that despite our surging interest in this field, a great deal of further study is needed. More sophisticated instrumentation has allowed us to visualize and document fetal movement more effectively. The fetal movements can now be better defined, measured, and named if desired. The fetus can be stimulated with biophysical and biochemical stimuli and responses effected and measured. The relationship between several centrally mediated physiological parameters has been described. Tentative statements may be made even alluding to fetal behavioural states. However, at this time we should not yet use fetal movement aggressively as a method for determining maternal or fetal treatment. The documentation of movement in the stressed fetus or the distressed fetus or in the presence of drugs that alter central nervous system function and which may be taken by the mother in her diet for (for example, caffeine, nicotine) is not clear. The implications of these observations remain to be studied. At this time, movement is useful as an aid in alerting us to possible fetal risk. Fetal activity, as presently measured, still lacks specificity. If a patient states fetal movement is diminished or absent, it should be taken seriously as an alerting mechanism and the fetus should be carefully assessed. Indeed, if movement cannot be demonstrated, further laboratory studies, such as stressed or nonstress testing, oestriol determinations, etc., should be performed to aid the clinician in developing a management plan. Clinical decisions based on movement studies alone are not yet acceptable.

AB  - Total Oe 3 concentration was determined on serial plasma specimens over 24 hr in 8 gravids in the last three months of pregnancy with no signs of maternal of fetal disease, using a direct radioimmunological method preceded by enzymatic hydrolysis. The results suggested that no circadian rhythm exists for total Oe 3. Values varied from one subject to another. Stress is laid on the advantages of measuring total plasma as opposed to urinary values, and as opposed to the free form.

AB  - In order to examine the relationship between circadian rhythms in different steroids, cortisol (F), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3) were measured by radioimmunoassay in maternal venous plasma taken at 30 to 60-minute intervals over 24 hours from 11 healthy women at 34 to 35 weeks' gestation. Maternal F was maxinval at 0730 hours and fell significantly to its lowest concentration at 0230 hours. Maternal E, was lowest between 1000 and 1130 hours and rose significantly to maximal values between 2230 and 0030 hours. Maternal E1 was maximal between 1000 and 1130 hours and showed a significant decrease to reach its lowest concentration at 0430 to 0630 hours. No significant circadian change was measured in uncorrected concentrations of E2. We conclude that there is an inverse relationship between maternal F and E3, which would be consistent with a maternal effect on fetal adrenal function, and the existence of circadian rhythms in F, E1, E2, and E3 must be taken into account in clinical investigations of these hormones during pregnancy. © 1979.

AB  - Composition of human milk was studied during the feed in six women throughout the day, in one woman on three consecutive days and in three women on 39 occasions during established lactation. The total lipid content varied in the course of suckling as well as diurnally in a regular and predictable manner, but the fatty acid composition of the lipid remained constant and was similar in the subjects examined. Fatty acid pattern of milk lipid of one woman supplementing her diet with unsaturated fats was studied. The changes in the milk lipid composition, induced by the altered diet, are discussed in relation to the mechanism of milk fat synthesis. The described changes in milk composition are specific and may be physiologically significant. The composition of lipid in milk of mothers on adequate and balanced diet shows only limited fluctuations forming a species-specific pattern. The variations that occur in extreme dietary conditions (malnutrition, undernutrition, supplementation) are not random and can be predicted.

AB  - Neuroleptic therapy can prevent some acute episodes and may improve the level of function in some cases of chronic schizophrenia. The hazards of tardive dyskinesia require a rigorous design for any long-term use of neuroleptics. The protocol includes narrow indications, demonstrations of efficacy and necessity, and arrangements for surveillance, cooperation, and emergency. Patient instruction improves the precision of medication use and may increase adaptive efforts during episodes. © 1979 American Association All rights reserved.

AB  - HS/Ibg (heterogeneous stock) mice dams were fed milled mouse food containing 3 g/kg phenobarbital (PhB) in acid form and water as their only nutritional source from gestation days 9-19. Control females received milled food and water. Blood PhB levels of treated females and fetuses were 40-200 μg/ml blood. At the age of 50 days, male offspring were injected with C14-sodium pentobarbital (PenB) (50 mg/kg). Steep time and temperature loss were monitored and, in randomly selected individuals, brain PenB levels were determined upon awakening. The experiment was repeated on the same animals for 3 consecutive days. All offspring developed functional (central nervous system) tolerance during the 3 testing days as evidenced by the daily decrease in sleep time while brain levels of PenB upon awakening increased (P&lt;0.001). Offspring who received PhB prenatally had generally shorter sleep times, less temperature loss, and higher brain PenB levels upon awakening than controls. The differences were most pronounced on the second day (sleep time reduced 27%, P&lt;0.001; temperature loss 47%, P&lt;0.001; brain PhB levels increased 23%, P&lt;0.01). © 1979 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A total of 129 recordings of the respiratory activity of 46 normal full-term infants were obtained continuously for 24 hours in the hospital nursery at 3 days of life and in the home environment at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after birth. The pediatric pneumogram (PPG) technique, an impedance method, was used. Pneumogram data over longer than 16 hours was obtained on 77% of infants monitored. No infants experienced apnea longer than 15 seconds in duration at 40 and 44 weeks postconception, or greater than 11 seconds at 52 weeks postconception. Twenty-four hour plots of hourly apnea frequency revealed a marked variability, with evidence of clustering of apneic episodes during periods of reported sleep. Longest apnea time and hourly frequency of apneic episodes were highly correlated.

AB  - The ability of syngeneic peripheral leucocytes to cure marrow aplasia was tested in a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hæmoglobinuria (P.N.H.). Transfusion of 7.1×1010 white cells obtained by leucopheresis from an identical-twin donor, providing 3·4×104 myeloid progenitors (C.F.U.-C)/kg, failed to improve marrow function within two months. In contrast, transfusion of 1·3×1010 nucleated bone-marrow cells, representing 6·4×104 C.F.U.-c/kg, from the same donor resulted in prompt bone-marrow recovery. These observations support the hypothesis that aplastic anæmia in P.N.H. is a stem-cell defect that may be corrected by the simple infusion of relatively small numbers of normal bone-marrow cells. They also seem to indicate a distinct advantage of marrow cells over peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in their ability to correct marrow aplasia. © 1979.

AB  - Biorhythm of sleep, wakefulness and paradoxical sleep was studied in unanesthetized, freely moving, female rats. A concentric bipolar stainless steel electrode for EEG recording was placed in the dorsal hippocampus and monopolar EEG recording electrodes were placed in the formal cortex. One week after surgery, and the resumption of consecutive 4 days estrous cycles, EEG patterns were recorded for 7 consecutive days. Female rats subjected to light and dark schedule (LD) during the period of gestation and through puberty exhibited a diurnal rhythm of sleep, and paradoxical sleep; a circadian rhythm with peaks of sleep during the light phase. When these rats were transferred from LD to continous illumination (CI), circadian rhythm was annihilated and indeed all rhythms disappeared. It seems likely that light serves as synchronizer or oscillator for regulation of circadian rhythm of sleep, wakefulness and paradoxical sleep. However, in female rats subjected to CI during the period of gestation and puberty, light apparently does not serve as synchronizer or oscillator for the regulation of circadian rhythm. Further, these rats exhibit a nocturnal rhythm (12 h shift of acrophase of circadian rhythm of sleep and parodoxical sleep from rats born and reared in LD) of sleep, and paradoxical sleep; a circadian rhythm with peaks of sleep during midnight. The evidence illustrates the nature of oscillatory phenomena controlling circadian rhythm of sleep, wakefulness and paradoxical sleep in rats. © 1979.

AB  - Previous studies of the effects of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) destruction and visual pathway transections in adult rodents have revealed the primary significance of the SCN and the retinohypothalamic (RH) projection in the generation and entrainment of circadian rhythms. In the present study we found that complete ablation of the SCN in 2-day-old rats, prior to its innervation by the RH projection, permanently eliminates circadian rhythms in spontaneous locomotor activity and drinking; activity and drinking appear randomly distributed over the light-dark cycle. In addition, females exhibit long periods of constant vaginal cornification and an absence of normal estrous cycles. These effects are independent of the animal's visual status; that is, they occur in blinded as well as sighted animals. Incomplete SCN lesions results in partial disruption of rhythmic functions such as damping of circadian rhythms in activity and/or drinking, irregular estrous cycling, and/or complete disruption of only one or two of these measures of rhythmicity. The absence of spared functions after early SCN destruction is consistent with the high degree of specificity for the SCN exhibited by developing RH fibers and further emphasizes the significance of the SCN in circadian rhythm generation. Neither morphological nor functional plasticity has been found following neonatal ablation of the SCN in the rat. © 1979.

AB  - The serum concentration of unconjugated estriol, total estriol, cortisol in one hour intervals and the urinary excretion of total estrogens and cortisol in three hour intervals was determined in eleven apparently healthy women between 26 and 40 weeks of gestation. They were divided into two groups, in order to study the influence of Fenoterol treatment on the daily variations of the measured parameters. Six patients were treated with Fenoterol and five patients received no medication. Between the two groups no statistical differences could be detected for the measured parameters. Regular and marked diurnal variations in cortisol have been observed, whereas total and unconjugated estriol showed small and irregular daily changes. These daily variations of "estriol" were of the same magnitude as the two-fold methodical standard deviation. For this reason it is not necessary to standardize the sampling time. © 1979.

AB  - The measurement of free cortisol would be preferable with respect to the total hormone content, since it yields more reliable information about the plasma levels of the biologically active steroid. The methods so far described for the measurement of free cortisol in plasma use radiolabelled cortisol for determination of the steroid free fraction, and are generally unsuitable for routine use. We have developed a new method for the determination of the apparent free plasma cortisol concentration by means of direct radioimmunological measurement of dialyzed cortisol. This method is characterized by a sufficient degree of reproducibility and high sensitivity. Apparent free cortisol concentration in 40 control subjects of both sexes (blood drawn at 8 a.m.) was 9.00 ± 4.6 ng/ml. The mean value of free cortisol concentration in blood samples drawn at 11--12 p.m. from 21 of these subjects was highly significantly different (2.3 ± 1.6 ng/ml, p < 0.001). In addition, in 13 of these subjects circadian variation of the apparent free cortisol concentration showed a pattern similar to that of total cortisol concentration. The mean free cortisol concentration found in a group of women during normal pregnancy was significant higher than in non-pregnant women. Patients with renal insufficiency do not show a significant difference in free cortisol plasma levels, whereas higher values were found in hepatic cyrrhosis. © 1979.

AB  - Influences of circadian rhythm and ovarian cycles upon the glycogen content of heart, liver, fast twitch red muscle, and fast twitch white muscle were studied in female rats, weighing between 150-300 g. Red vastus muscle demonstrated a significant circadian rhythm during estrus and metestrus, with peak glycogen levels at 0800 h and nadirs at 2400 h. When the data were expressed only as a function of time of day, a significant ultradian rhythm existed, with highs at 0800 and 2000 h and lows at 1200 and 2400 h. White vastus muscle demonstrated a circadian rhythm during estrus, metestrus, and diestrus. Fluctuations ranged from 7.75 mg/g (0800 h) to 2.75 mg/g (2000 h). Myocardial circadian rhythms existed during estrus and metestrus, with peak glycogen concentrations occurring during metestrus (7.23 mg/g at 0800 h) and low concentrations occurring during estrus (3.0 mg/g at 2000 h). Hepatic glycogen content demonstrated circadian rhythms throughout all phases of the estrus cycle. The most dramatic fluctuation occurred during estrus, 61 mg/g (0800 h) to 21 mg/g (2400 h), a change of 61% and 45%, respectively, from the 24 h mean. Blood glucose had a significant circadian rhythm corresponding marginally with the variation measured in liver glycogen. When data were analyzed disregarding the time of day when the animal was sacrificed, there was no noticeable ovarian hormonal influence on glycogen content in any tissue analyzed. It is concluded that definite circadian rhythms exist in tissue glycogen. However, ovarian hormones may cause alterations in the patterns, either accentuating or depressing these circadian fluctuations. © 1979 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The role of suprachiasmatic efferents in the control of circadian rhythms was investigated using female Long-Evans rats. Coronal knife cuts placed posterior to the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus failed to eliminate the feeding, drinking, and activity rhythms of the animals. On the other hand, this manipulation eliminated the estrous cycle of rats. These and previous results suggest that hypothalamic circuits involved in the generation of several behavioral rhythms are anatomically different from those regulating hormonal rhythms of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system. © 1979 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The present study investigates the diurnal variations of free plasma oestradiol levels in late human pregnancy. The oestradiol levels are correlated to the maternal adrenal function as reflected by the plasma levels of cortisol. According to the half life of oestradiol, blood samples were collected at short time intervals of 30 and 60 min, respectively. Three pregnant women volunteered in the study. Free oestradiol was measured by radioimmunoassay and cortisol was quantitated by a protein binding method. All patients exhibited a circadian rhythm for free oestradiol with significantly higher values in the early morning (28.3 ± 7.2 ng/ml) than in the afternoon and early night (21.2 ± 3.6 ng/ml, P<0.001). The course of oestradiol followed in a moderate but significant correlation plasma cortisol (r=0.34, P<0.001). During the period of increasing cortisol the oestradiol levels demonstrated the phenomenon of episodic secretion. The results obtained suggest that the maternal adrenals predominantly regulate the diurnal rhythm of free oestradiol in late human pregnancy.

AB  - The present study concerns the diurnal variations of free plasma oestriol and their relationship to maternal plasma cortisol in late human pregnancy. Four pregnant women volunteered for the study. According to the halflife time oestriol blood was drawn at intervals of 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, over a period of 24 hours. Free oestriol was measured by radioimmunoassay and cortisol was quantitated by a protein binding method. All patients exhibited a circadian rhythm for free oestriol with higher values in the evening and early night (14.4 ± 3.7 ng/ml) than in the morning (11.3 ± 2.4 mg/ml, P < 0.001). The course of oestriol followed plasma cortisol in a significant negative correlation (r = 0.566, P < 0.001). During the period of low cortisol concentration oestriol levels demonstrated the phenomenon of episodic secretion. The results suggest that the maternal adrenals predominantly regulate the circadian rhythm of free oestriol by a negative feed-back on the foetal hypothalamus.

AB  - Maternal plasma levels of pregnancy-specific beta-1-glyco-protein (PSBG) in 166 normal and 169 toxemic pregnancies were measured by radioimmunoassay in the third trimester. Individual PSBG levels were studied in 16 women during weeks 7 through 39 of normal pregnancy. The levels were found to increase as pregnancy progressed. During the third trimester neither normal nor toxemic pregnancies showed any circadian rhythm in PSBG levels. In toxemic pregnancies low PSBG values were seen mainly in cases with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Plasma PSBG concentrations at weeks 39-40 in toxemic patients correlated positively with placental weight. No-such correlation was found in normal or toxemic pregnancies at 37-38 weeks or in either group between PSBG level and infant birth weight, birth length, or Apgar score. In toxemic pregnancies with low PSBG values during the last trimester, birth weights were somewhat lower than in those with normal levels. Thus, low levels of maternal plasma PSBG may reflect IUGR, but will be of little value for assessment of fetal condition at birth. © 1979, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - Diurnal variations in plasma unconjugated and total estriol were assessed in 11 third-trimester subjects with uncomplicated pregnancies. Commercially available125I-labeled radioimmunoassay kits were used. Total plasma estriois reach a nadir during the hours of sleep (400 and 700 hours) which exceeds the episodic fluctuations seen from day to day or during a given 90-minutc period. Plasma uncon-jugated estriol fluctuations over 24 hours did not significantly exceed our previously reported episodic fluctuation of 15.6 ± 8.2%. The data are interpreted as showing no circadian rhythm, but reflecting, in the case of total plasma estriois, an effect of improved renal clearance during hours of rest. Plasma unconjugated estriol emerges as the test of choice in the monitoring of high-risk pregnancies. © 1979 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - The normal ovarian cycle of female rats is typically replaced by persistent estrus when these animals are housed under constant light. Evidence presented here shows that the maintenance of periodicity in the environment can at least delay (if not prevent) the photic induction of persistent vaginal estrus. Female rats in constant light were exposed to vaginal smearing at random times or at the same time every day. In another experiment, female rats were exposed to either constant bright light, constant dim light, or a 24-hour photic cycle of bright and dim light. The onset of persistent vaginal estrus was delayed in rats exposed to 24-hour time cues even though the light intensities were the same as or greater than those for the aperiodic control groups. The results suggest that the absence of 24-hour time cues in constant light contributes to the induction of persistent estrus.

AB  - This review clearly demonstrates the coupling of the adrenal and gonadal hormone rhythmicities. The physiological significance of this coupling is subject to considerable speculation. It is possible that adrenal secretions provide a transient period of quiescence or heightened gonadal secretion which may be important in reproductive performance and synchronization with other biological clocks. A breakdown in this interrelationship between the endocrine glands due to factors such as environment, stress (internal or external) or others may herald reproductive senescence. These studies also firmly establish the concept that gonadal steroids are able to modify hypothalamic LHRH activity. In this respect, while androgens and oestrogens were equipotent there was an indication that the central field of androgen action as compared to that of oestrogen may be restricted to the basal hypothalamus. The preoptic area (POA) LHRH neurons and their innervation to the organum vasculosum of lamina terminalis (OVLT) were resistant to steroid action. This raised the possibility of the existence of more than one population of LHRH neurons. Our studies suggest that only those LHRH neurons which project into the median eminence possess the ability to respond to changes in steroid titre. © 1979.

AB  - A circadian rhythm in pineal melatonin content persisted throughout the estrous cycle of female hamsters maintained in a 14-hr-light:10-hr-dark photoperiod. Peak melatonin concentrations occurred 8 hr after the onset of darkness and were of similar duration and magnitude on each day of the reproductive cycle. These results do not support the hypothesis that pineal melatonin production in hamsters is inhibited by estrogen feedback. © 1979, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last 3 to 4 months of their pregnancies, six healthy mothers provided a daily record of their own activity together with the amount of fetal movement. Fetal movement increased throughout most of the daytime to reach a peak in the evening. The mothers detected most movement when they were lying, less when they were sitting and least when they were standing. Later in the day the mothers were less likely to be standing and more likely to be sitting; when fetal movement was measured with the mother in the sitting posture, more movement occurred as the day progressed. Mealtimes did not have any effect upon movement. Some implications of these findings, both for the assessment of fetal well‐being and for theories of the development of circadian rhythms in the infant, are discussed.

AB  - To study blood corticosterone rhythm, a micromethod of blood sampling from individual infant rats by tail tip incision was developed. Twenty microliters of whole blood were enough for the determination of corticosterone levels. Using this method, 48-h patterns were determined at 4-h intervals in individual pups of 2–5 weeks of age. Values during the dark period tended to be higher than those during the light period at 3 weeks of age. However, a distinct circadian rhythm was observed around the end of the fourth week after birth. Time sequence analysis revealed that the circadian adrenocortical rhythm was established at this age. Well nurtured pups tended to develop the rhythm earlier than poorly nurtured ones. However, nutrition condition did not appear to be essential for the development of the adrenocortical rhythm, because the manifestation of the rhythm in the poorly nurtured group was delayed only 3 days. The intact pups reared by blinded mothers showed normal circadian rhythms entrained to lighting condition at 4 weeks of age, indicating that the blinding of the mother did not influence the development of the normal rhythm. On the other hand, in the pups blinded on the day of birth, a free-running rhythm was observed. The peaks in mean blood corticosterone levels were 2300 h at 4 weeks and 0300 h at 6 weeks of age. These facts indicate that the eyes and light are not essential for the development of the endogenous circadian adrenocortical rhythm in pups. © 1979 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Circulating levels of pregnancy‐specific β1 glycoprotein have been determined in a number of physiological situations in late pregnancy. The apparent variation in five subjects studied over a 24‐hour period was not in excess of that due to the assay. Excess variation was apparent in 2 of 11 subjects studied daily for up to 8 days, and in 6 of 16 patients studied serially during labour. Copyright © 1979, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The role of light in the regulation of the prolactin surges of the female rat was investigated. Two model systems were utilized: one was the pseudopregnant rat which normally has 2 daily prolactin surges and the other was the ovariectomized (OVX) polyestradiol phosphate (PEP)-treated rat which normally has a daily afternoon prolactin surge. A 6 h phase advance of the 14 h:10 h photoperiod phase advanced the prolactin surges of pseudopregnant and OVX+PEP rats a corresponding 6 h. Blinded pseudopregnant and OVX+PEP rats had prolactin surges which were free running with respect to time of day, but the maximum values were similar to sighted 14 h:10 h controls. Pseudopregnant or OVX+PEP animals maintained on constant light also had free running prolactin rhythms, but the maximum prolactin values were significantly less than 14 h:10 h controls. Pinealectomy had no effect on the prolactin values of pseudopregnant rats maintained on constant light. It was concluded that the prolactin surges of pseudopregnant and OVX+PEP rats are endogenous circadian rhythms which can be entrained to an exogenous light-dark cycle.

AB  - pineal acetyl‐CoA hydrolase is measurable at 4 days before birth. It increases rapidly to a maximum of 0.37 nmol/min/0.1 mg protein during the first week after birth, thereafter gradually decreasing and stabilizing at adult levels (0.27 nmol/min/0.1 mg protein) 3‐4 weeks after birth. Unlike A/‐acetyltransferase, the activity of acetyl‐CoA hydrolase does not increase following treatment with isoproterenol, does not exhibit a circadian rhythm and is not inactivated on exposure of the animals to light at night. In addition, denervation of the pineal gland does not alter acetyl‐CoA hydrolase activity. Copyright © 1979, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Small rodents are the animals most utilized in investigating the effects of acute and long-term carbon monoxide intoxications. These animals can be used in sufficient numbers to produce statistically significant results. Furthermore, the 2- to 3-year life span of rats and mice enable life-long exposures and make possible studies of several subsequent generations in controlled environmental conditions. Experimental investigations of acute toxicity show differences related to age, sex, pregnancy, and adrenal factors. Differences in strains, body size, respiratory parameters, span of life, carboxyhemoglobin dissociation, endogen carbon monoxide production, and circadian rhythms must be taken into consideration when comparing results obtained with different animal models. Experiments of the effects of tobacco smoke and automotive exhaust are of great interest for they associate carbon monoxide with other toxic components that constitute a risk for human health. © 1979.

AB  - Serotonin has a strong vasoconstrictor action, able to produce necrotic lesions in placenta. 5-HT increases during hypoxia and pregnancy. For this reason it seemed interesting to study the excretion of 5-HIAA in pregnant women with anemia (Hb≤9.8). Twelve pregnant women with anemia 49 pregnant women without anemia, 6 non-pregnant women with anemia, and 53 non-pregnant women with normal Hb were studied. The circadian rhythm of 5-HIAA excretion was studied in 12 hour periods. (8.20 hr and 20.8 hr). In the pregnant women with normal Hb, 5-HIAA excretion was 1.66 μg/min during the day and 1.21 μg/min during the night. The day/night (d/n) relation was 1.37. In the non-pregnant women with anemia the diurnal excretion was 2.07 μg/min and the nocturnal 1.54 μg/min; the d/n relation was 1.34. In the pregnant women without anemia the diurnal excretion was 2.84 μg/min and the nocturnal 1.63 μg/min; the d/n relation was 1.74. In the pregnant women with anemia the diurnal excretion was 3.21 μg/min, the nocturnal 1.85 and the d/n relation 1.74. It seems anemia produces an increase in 5-HIAA excretion that is additive to the increase produced by gestation.

AB  - Sleep-awake state distribution during feed intervals over a 24-hour period on the thrid day of life was investigated by means of a continuous non-intrusive bassinet sleep monitor. 31 infants were studied: 14 born to mothers who drank heavily throughout pregnancy (group A), eight whose mothers modified their heavy drinking (group B) and nine whose mothers never were heavy drinkers (group C). Over the 24-hour period, group A infants slept less than those in group B. In comparison with group C, group A infants had a larger proportion of quiet sleep episodes interrupted by awake or unclassified epochs, and were more restless, with more frequent major body movements. These observations suggest that heavy maternal consumption of alcohol, when continued throughout pregnancy, is associated with a disturbance of sleep-awake state distribution. Successful therapy of heavy drinking during pregnancy may improve the physiological competence of the newborn to regulate sleep-awake states and facilitate interaction between mother and infant.

AB  - Changes in the concentration of adrenocorticotrophin and corticosteroid in the plasma of pregnant and foetal sheep have been followed at different times of day. Wide fluctuations were seen in the concentrations of both in the foetus and ewe, although no evidence for a diurnal rhythm in the ewe was obtained. The foetal plasma adrenocorticotrophin was higher at 07.00-11.00 hr than at 21.00-01.00 hr, but no corticosteroid rhythm was observed. A consistently close relation between maternal and foetal hormone concentrations was not observed. The diurnal rhythm in adrenocorticotrophin concentration in the foetus is discussed in relation to rhythms in indicators or central nervous activity.

AB  - The application of measurements of urinary oestrogen excretion and plasma oestrogen concentration for the prediction of fetal death have been compared. It is concluded from a review of published results, that estimation of plasma oestrogens cannot yet be recommended as a sole alternative to measurement of urinary oestrogen excretion for this purpose. The simplicity, robustness and precision of urinary techniques makes them particularly attractive. Evidence for an increased incidence of abnormal development of infants delivered as a consequence of subnormal oestrogen excretion has not yet been provided. © 1979.

AB  - A diurnal pattern of changes in plasma TSH concentrations was found throughout pregnancy in rats. TSH levels (˜400 ng/ml) were highest at 0200 hr and 0600 hr and lowest (˜240 ng/ml) at 1500 hr. The diurnal pattern in TSH levels changed between the first and second halves of gestation. Whereas TSH levels declined to basal levels by 0900 hr (X ˜ 240 ng/ml) from Days 2 to 10, they remained high at 0900 hr (X ˜ 400 ng/ml) from Days 13 to 22. The temporal correlation between the nocturnal secretion of TSH and PRL in the pregnant rat was discussed. Finally, a large increase in plasma TSH (X = 682 ng/ml) occurred 2-4 hr postpartum. This postpartum rise in hormone concentration appeared to result from pup-induced stimuli, i.e., suckling. © 1979, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The incidence and frequency of fetal respiratory movements (FRM) and fetal trunk movements (FTM) were measured in 21 normal pregnancies between 28 and 39 weeks gestation. Fetal activity was assessed with a real‐time ultrasound scanner and all observed movements were punched directly onto computer tape. Recordings were made for one hour in three over a 24 hour period, providing a total of 168 hours for analysis. The overall mean percentage incidence of FRM was 31 per cent at a mean breathing rate of 43 breaths/minute. The mean percentage incidence of FRM during the day (0800–1759 hours) was 37 per cent. The overall mean percentage incidence of FTM was 18 per cent with a mean of 29 moves per 30 minute observation period. The mean percentage incidence of FTM during the day (0800–1759 hours) was 16 per cent. There was a well‐defined circadian variation in fetal activity with FRM peaking between 1900 and 2200 hours, and FTM between 2200 and 0100 hours. There was considerable variation in the amount of FRM and FTM recorded from hour to hour. Total fetal activity rarely fell below 10 per cent in any one recording period and this measurement may be a more useful clinical test of fetal well‐being than FRM or FTM alone.

All but one of the successive periods of oestrus occurred during winter. Hourly measurements of body temperature by telemetry showed a rhythm typical of nocturnal species. Superimposed on this diurnal rhythm was another rhythm whoch could be correlated with the oestrous cycle.

AB  - Observations of 2 groups of dams and their litters were made every 3 hr around the clock on Days 1‐20 postpartum. The dams were fed either an 8% or a 25% casein diet for 5 weeks before mating and during gestation and lactation. Dams on the low protein diet spent more time in the nest actively nursing their young than did high protein dams, and they exhibited no deficits in other maternal behaviors. Five of 11 kinds of behavior developed more slowly in the undernourished pups than in the well‐nourished ones, but the developmental delays were no longer than a few days. Circadian fluctuations were apparent in all of the pups' activities during the 3rd postnatal week as well as in grooming and horizontal movement, 2 behaviors that were present earlier, by 6–10 days of age.

AB  - Prenatal and postnatal chronic lead intoxicaton was induced in Wistar rats with 0.1 mg/ml PbCl2 in the drinking water of pregnant and lactating females. Offspring were supplied lead water at weaning. Exposure totaled 14 months. Activity was measured in the Wahman LC-33 wheel. Running activity experimental and control rats was maximized with a 23-hr light cycle followed by a 5-hr dark period in the wheels. There was no significant difference in body weight gains or lead intake (as measured by water consumption) between any sex-matched group. Lead was found to produce overall hypoactivity in both males and females. Under auditory stress the hypoactivity in the males was normalized by combination of a hypoactivity component in the controls and a progressive hyperactivity in the lead animals. This study clearly shows a sex-dependent hypoactivity effect of chronic lead intoxication and suggests its mechanism as an interaction between lead and environmental stress. © 1979.

AB  - The time of parturition in rats is determined in part by the photoperiod, and an 8 h advance in the timing of the light-dark cycle before mid-pregnancy delays parturition by about 12 h. This effect of the photoperiod was eliminated by lesions placed in the anterior hypothalamus, whereas pinealectomy had no effect. In a cross-sectional study, rats under control and time-advanced photoperiods were killed at 3 h intervals up to the predicted time of parturition. The decline in plasma progesterone, the rise in prolactin and the appearance of 20αOHSDHase activity in the ovaries were correlated with the time of parturition. All three events were delayed in rats subjected to the 8 h advance in the photoperiod. Plasma levels of LH and FSH, and the prepartum fetal growth spurt, were more closely related to gestational age than the predicted hour of birth. There was a marked circadian rhythm in plasma corticosterone reaching peak levels shortly before the onset of darkness. Parturition occurred when the plasma levels of corticosterone were low. Various pharmacological treatments designed to influence the levels or actions of prolactin, oestrogen and corticosterone in pregnant rats under both control and time-advanced photoperiods were investigated. These studies indicate that a sequence of three key endocrine events leads to parturition in the rat: 1) luteal regression, creating basal levels of progesterone for the last 24 h of pregnancy, 2) a phase during which the uterus is prepared for parturition under the influence of oestrogen and relaxin, and 3) a delivery phase during which the uterus is stimulated to contract, possibly by the production of a time-dependent signal. © 1979.

AB  - Prepartum maternal serum concentrations of progesterone and 5α-pregnane-3, 20-dione are reportedly higher at 2100 h than at 0900 h (Sholl, S. A., J. A. Robinson, and R. C. Wolf, Endocrinology, in press). These findings were interpreted to mean thatplacental progestin secretion is elevated during the evening. The present study was initiated to determine whether the fetoplacental unit exhibits a similar pattern of secretory activity as might be reflected in a temporal alteration in serum estrone, 17β-estradiol, and cortisol concentrations in the mother and whether there are consistent daily changes in morningevening steroid levels preceding parturition. Steroid levels were measured by radioligand assays of maternal systemic serum obtained at 0900 and 2100 h around the time of parturition. Estrogen levels in the four animals examined increased during the 9 days immediately preceding parturition to maximum levels on the day of delivery. In direct contrast to the reported diurnal alteration in progesterone and 5α-pregnane-3, 20-dione, the prepartum concentrations of estrone, 17β-estradiol, and cortisol were substantially higher at 0900 than at 2100 h. No change occurred in the magnitude of this difference as gestation advanced. After parturition, serum estrogen levels were substantially lower. In two monkeys nursing their infants, no diurnal variation in hormone concentration was detected during the 16 days after parturition; thus, it would appear that the prepartum variation originated in the fetoplacental unit and not in the ovary. Unlike estrogen, day to day cortisol levels did not change during the final 2 weeks of gestation or immediately after delivery. However, morning cortisol concentration on day 16 postpartum was substantially lower than on the day after parturition. A nocturnal decline in hormone concentration, which probably originated in the mother, was observed in both pre- and postpartum animals. The prepartum increase in estrogen levels suggests an estrogen involvement in parturition. Moreover, the diurnal fluctuation in circulating estrogen may be important in restricting parturition to the evening or early morning. The initiator(s) of this prepartum estrogen cyclicity remains to be elucidated; however, this change may be effected by an alteration in fetal adrenal activity mediated by negative feedback of cortisol on fetal pituitary ACTH secretion. © 1979 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - A radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of both unconjugated and total serum estetrol has been developed, using an antiserum to an E4-3-conjugate and a 125I-radioiodinated E4 tracer. Assay of dried ethyl ether extracts was used for the deter-mination of unconjugated E4. while a direct measurement of unextracted hydrolyzed serum in the presence of 0.3% 8-anilino-l-naphthalene sulphonic acid (ANS) proved ade-quate for total E4. Assay reliability was evaluated and the procedure standardized through a series of tests aimed at assessing accuracy, sensitivity and precision. No steroidal interference was found to practically affect the assay (0.3% estriol cross-reactivity), nor were solvent and sample blanks observed in the case of unconjugated E4. For total E4 assay, the sample blank effects were acceptably overcome by using hydrolyzed male serum and 0.3% ANS, as a standard diluent. An interassay variability amounting to approximately 10 and 6% resulted for unconjugated E4 and total E4 RIA, respectively. A number of serum samples (285 for unconjugated E4, 147 for total E4) randomly collected throughout normal pregnancy were assayed. The unconjugated E4 levels at 15th week and at term were 62.7 ± 22.6 and 766.5 ± 208.2 (SD) pg/ml, respectively. Total E4 was about 6-7 times higher than the levels of free E4 and increased 7 times from the 15th week to term. © 1979 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The role of neurotransmitters in the release of prolactin (PRL) is reviewed. Special attention is paid to dopamine (DA) as the possible prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF). Among other agents, estrogens alone can act directly on the pituitary galactotropes without involving hypothalamic factors. Peripherally, in addition to its stimulatory action on mammary tissue, PRL exerts a permissive role on ovarian steroidogenesis. A possible physiological action of this hormone on the regulation of adrenal function remains uncertain. The secretory rhythms of PRL are described and the mechanisms involved are discussed. A number of drugs can modify the secreting pattern of PRL mainly by acting on the dopaminergic control mechanisms. The usefulness of such agents in the clinical evaluation of galactotrope cell function is reviewed. © 1979 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The effects of mineral intake and long-term oral contraceptive use before pregnancy on the mineral content of milk of healthy lactating women were evaluated in a study of 52 volunteers ages 18-31. Subjects reporting previous oral contraceptive use had significantly lower levels of copper in serum, perhaps reflecting reduced copper stores resulting from prolonged estrogen exposure, but concomitant changes in copper levels in their milk were not noted. Serum calcium and magnesium levels were not significantly affected by prior pill use. Pill use had no significant effect on concentrations of calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, or iron in colostrum at day 3 or more mature milk at day 14 of lactation, while mean manganese levels were significantly lower at both times for previous oral contraceptive users (but still exceeded manganese levels recommended for infants). Mineral and vitamin supplementation significantly improved the levels of zinc and iron intake, but did not appreciably alter the mineral content of milk. Higher levels of zinc were found in colostrum compared to day 14 milk, while manganese concentrations increased significantly during the 1st 2 weeks of lactation. Calcium, magnesium, iron and copper levels did not change significantly as lactation progressed. Levels of calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, and manganese in colostrum were significantly positively correlated with the mineral concentration on day 14. No significant diurnal or daily variation was observed in the levels of calcium, magnesium, or zinc content in milk during 2 24-hour periods.

AB  - Factors influencing the positive feedback action of estrogen, especially those related to dose and the time of day of injection, were investigated in the ovariectomized female guinea pig Adult guinea pigs were housed in a light-controlled room (12 h light, 0600–1800 h) and ovariectomized 2 weeks before estradiol benzoate (EB) injections. EB doses of 1.5, 10, or 50 μg were administered sc at 1000 or 2200 h. Blood samples were obtained through a chronic indwelling venous catheter. Plasma LH was estimated by RIA. The mean latency from the time of EB injection to the occurrence of the LH surge was not influenced by the time of day of injection but was clearly related to the dose of estrogen administered. The mean latency to the LH surge from the time of injection decreased with increasing doses of estrogen but the mean dose-dependent latency was comparable in the same dose groups regardless of the time of day of injection. However, at each dose of estrogen, the temporal distributions of the individual LH surges were clearly different between morning and evening groups. Overall, a greater percentage of animals showed the LH surge during the dark phase than light phase. At all doses tested, 100% of the responders showed LH surges in the dark phase when the estrogen injection was timed so that the dosetypical latency was coincident with the midpoint of the dark phase of the cycle. When the dose-typical latency was coincident with the midpoint of the light phase, episodes of the LH surge were widely distributed and occurred in the dark as well as in the light phases of the cycle. This tendency for episodes of the LH surge to be shifted out of the light phase into the preceding and subsequent dark phases was inversely related to the dose of estrogen administered. Thus, the effect was most clearly observed in animals given 1.5 μg EB. These data indicate that the timing of the estrogen-induced LH surge in the ovariectomized guinea pig is regulated by two major factors: 1) the dose of estrogen given and 2) the lighting conditions (environmental light-dark cycle). © 1979 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Electrical stimulation of the uterine cervix eventuates in a 13-day pseudopregnancy characterized by nocturnal and diurnal surges of PRL secretion and constantly elevated levels of serum progesterone. Upon removal of the uterus shortly after cervical stimulation (CS), both surges of PRL are continued beyond day 13, and decline of progesterone secretion by the pereisting corpora lutea is prevented. This study describes the effects of absence of the uterus and persistent secretion of progesterone on continuation of daily PRL surges. CS on proestrus (day 0) and estrus (day 1) and hysterectomy on day 5 resulted in nocturnal and diurnal PRL surges prolonged through day 16, while sham-hysterectomized (hyst) rats no longer showed surges on day 16. Cervically stimulated ovariectomized (OV) rats which were hyst on day 5 presented attenuated nocturnal surges of PRL until day 16. However, no diurnal surges were present at this time. Neither surge continued until day 16 in OV-CS-shamhyst rats. OV-CS rats with intact uteri responded to sc placement of progesterone-containing Silastic implants by presenting attenuated nocturnal surges of PRL until day 16. Diurnal surges were not present at that time. Neither surge was continued until day 16 in OV-CS rats bearing blank implants. However, in OV-CS rats, which were hyst and implanted with progesterone, magnified nocturnal surges and normal diurnal surges continued until day 16. If the nocturnal surges are to persist, either disinhibition from uterine influence or sufficient stimulation by progesterone in the presence of the uterus is required. On the other hand, both disinhibition from uterine influence and the presence of progesterone secreted by the maintained corpora lutea are required for prolongation of normal diurnal PRL surges. © 1979 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - In order to provide normative values of heart and respiratory rate and variability in relation to gestation and sleep states, 32 neonates who were free from cardiopulmonary disease were studied during the lst-6 day of life. The infants were grouped as follows: group A, 9 infants with gestational ages of 27-33 wk; group B, 14 infants with gestational ages of 34-36 wk; and group C, 9 infants with gestational ages of 37-40 wk. Recordings and observations were made during a 1-hr postprandial nap. During active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS), heart rate, short-term and long-term variability of the heart rate, respiratory rate, variability of the respiratory rate and apnea density were measured. Both the long- and short-term heart rate variability was less in preterm infants (group A) than the less immature or full term infants (groups B and C, P < 0.01). Breath-to-breath respiratory variability was not significantly affected by gestational age, whereas percent duration of apnea was less in full term (group C) than the preterm groups of infants during quiet sleep (groups A and B, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between baseline heart rate, short-term heart rate variability, and respiratory rate during AS and QS states at any given gestational age. Long-term variations in heart rate, breath-to-breath respiratory variability, and percent duration of apnea were significantly less in QS in comparison to AS at each gestational age group (P < 0.01). Speculation: Systematic monitoring of newborn infants by the techniques presented in this report would further define normal cardiorespiratory functions in relation to maturity and sleep states. Application of these techniques to the study of the distressed newborn should provide an early indication of morbidity and recovery from disease. © 1979 International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - The developmental sequence of sleep cycles has been found to be a useful index of central nervous system maturation in premature infants. To determine the effects of severe reversible stress on the maturation of sleep cycles, 6‐ to 8‐hour sleep studies were done on 10 premature infants with severe hyaline membrane disease (HMD) and 10 healthy premature babies. The studies were done in the neonatal intensive care unit and included patients from 30 weeks' gestation to term and in all stages of the disease. Prior studies were confirmed showing that percentage of quiet sleep increases, transitional sleep changes little, and active sleep decrease from 30 weeks' gestation to term. In infants with severe HMD, the percentage of quiet sleep was less and active sleep higher than in unstressed infants of similar age who acted as controls. Once the infants revovered from HMD, sleep patterns became similar to those found in the control group. These data suggest that when respiratory distress occurs in the premature infant, there is a transient delay in central nervous system maturation as measured by sleep cycle analysis.

AB  - Sleep‐awake state distribution during inter‐feed intervals over a 24‐hour period on the third day of life was investigated by means of a continuous non‐intrusive bassinet sleep monitor. 31 infants were studied: 14 born to mothers who drank heavily throughout pregnancy (group A), eight whose mothers modified their heavy drinking (group B) and nine whose mothers never were heavy drinkers (group C). Over the 24‐hour period, group A infants slept less than those in group B. In comparison with group C, group A infants had a larger proportion of quiet sleep episodes interrupted by awake or unclassified epochs, and were more restless, with more frequent major body movements. These pilot observations suggest that heavy maternal consumption of alcohol, when continued throughout pregnancy, is associated with a disturbance of sleep‐awake state distribution. Successful therapy of heavy drinking during pregnancy may improve the physiological competence of the newborn to regulate sleep‐awake states and facilitate interaction between mother and infant.

AB  - Correlations between cerebral activity of nursing rats and the milk ejection reflex were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats with 15 to 17-day-old litters. The stretch reaction of the pups, which expresses the onset of milk ejection, was closely correlated with the slow sleep epochs of the mother. Once the litter started suckling, milk ejection only took place when the mother fell asleep and electroencephalographic features of slow wave sleep appeared. Milk ejection was never found during paradoxical sleep nor when the mother was awake. Sleep deprivation for 30 min impaired milk ejection in spite of continuous suckling of the nipples by the pups. If the mother was allowed to sleep immediately afterwards, ejection of milk occurred. A 24-h sleep-wakefulness pattern did not show differences between nursing and controls. Our results show that suckling, although necessary, is not enough to set off milk ejection. This reflex only appears when the mother falls asleep, suggesting that oxytocin release is linked to suckling and slow wave sleep. © 1979 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The action of the diaphragm in inspiration is to decrease intrathoracic pressure and raise abdominal pressure, which elevates the rib cage. In the supine position, the rise in abdominal pressure is smaller because of the lack of abdominal muscle tone. In premature infants the inward pull of the diaphragm on the very compliant ribs causes inward movement on inspiration (i.e. distortion) which is exacerbated by the lack of intercostal muscle activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, their predominant state. We raised abdominal pressure by means of an inflatable cuff in 12 newborn infants (gestation 28 to 40 weeks) to try to improve inspiratory coupling of the rib cage and diaphragm. There was no significant change in minute ventilation, indicating no ventilatory impairment. In all studies in which there was distortion, abdominal loading produced a reduction or abolition of distortion (P<.01). Abdominal loading may be useful in reducing diaphragmatic activity in premature infants.

AB  - Wistar rats of both sexes received 15 mg/kg of methadone (MET) by once daily oral intubation for 60 days before and during a 10-day mating period, and for the females through weaning of pups. The dose was selected on basis of prior work (Pace et al., 1974) to comprise max. tolerated (subtoxic) dose for testing reproductive effects by FDA guidelines. Control rats received H2O instead of MET. After birth, some C and MET pups were cross-fostered; others remained with their own mothers. Parental parameters studied included male sexual performance, body wt., testes wt., and liver enzymatic activities related to drug metab., female fertility index, litter size, maternal behavior and lactation. Offspring parameters included viability, body wt. and rate of gain, open-field behavior (9 to 23 days old), activity in photoactometers (65-74 days), avoid. conditioning (100-110 days), and barbiturate sleeping times (130-140 days). Treatment effects of MET included reduced male fertility and impaired structural and functional integrity of testes; decr. fertility index of female without decr. in litter size; low body wt. and reduced neonatal survival of F1 pups; behavioral alterations of F1 pups exposed during lactation only or during gestation; reduced barb. response of F2 male offspring from MET-exposed F1 parents.

AB  - A review is presented of the literature relevant to neonatal electroencephalography, in order to describe in detail the recording of the newborn at term. Firstly, there is a general description of the recording. This is followed by an analysis of each of the following aspects of the recording: sleep-wake differentiation, topographic organization, inter-hemispheric synchrony, reactivity and the relationship between cerebral maturation, the extrauterine environment, and the weight of the child at birth. There then follows a description of the characteristic bioelectrical activity of wakefulness, of REM sleep and of quiet sleep. Finally there is a description of those polemic E.E.G. patterns which are not necessarily pathological such as 'alpha-like activity', 'spindle-like activity', slow anterior dysrhythmia, frontal sharp transients, spikes and sharp waves, etc. As part of the analysis of E.E.G. characteristics, their overall ontogenesis is included.

AB  - Female rats received barbital or chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in their drinking water or ethanol in a liquid diet with drug administration beginning before breeding and continuing until the offspring were weaned. Control groups received either tap water and lab chow (untreated controls) or a liquid diet containing sucrose which was delivered in restricted amounts such that it was equicaloric to the diet consumed by the ethanol group. Both birth weight and weight at 1 week of age were reduced by barbital exposure but not by CDP exposure. Growth was reduced slightly in the ethanol group, as compared to the sucrose control group. At 21 days of age the offspring were trained to avoid footshock and retested at 28 days of age. In both sessions the barbital offspring displayed longer avoidance latencies than controls, while the CDP and ethanol groups displayed shorter latencies than controls only during the training session. When trained to respond for food presentation under a fixed-ratio 20 schedule, the response rates of the barbital and CDP groups were less than those of the untreated control group while the response rates of both the ethanol and sucrose groups were greater than those of the untreated control group. When injected with ethanol or pentobarbital, the duration of narcosis was less for the offspring of the CDP- and barbital-treated mothers than for the untreated controls. Ethanol and sucrose offspring were not different in this regard. These results demonstrate that chronic maternal ingestion of ethanol, barbital, or CDP during gestation and nursing can affect the growth, behavior, and drug sensitivity of the offspring. © 1979 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Our group has been carrying out interdisciplinary studies on the effects of prenatal and postnatal protein malnutrition on the developing rat brain. Anatomical, physiological, biochemical and behavioral approaches using the same animal model have revealed that protein malnutrition affects the brain at various levels, i.e., (1) anatomical, as revealed by Golgi findings of deranged dendritic trees on analysis of cortical and subcortical areas; (2) physiological, as revealed by delayed sleep pattern maturation, disturbances in seizure thresholds, slowing of sensory cortico-cortical and thalamocortical evoked potentials, and changed power in hippocampal theta activity; (3) biochemical, as revealed by marked increases in biogenic amines dating from birth, as well as modifications in tryptophan metabolism; and (4) behavioral, as revealed by various changes in responses to different kinds of aversive stimulation. Reversal studies have revealed that many changes are permanent and not amenable to nutritional rehabilitation even at birth, which is before the brain growth spurt in the rat. Our paradigm closely mimicks the human condition of low level, chronic protein undernutrition and thus reveals the underlying disturbances due to malnutrition. The dietary reversal studies are attempts at pin-pointing critical brain growth periods, beyond which recovery of functions is not possible. © 1979.

AB  - Carefully controlled intravenous administration of ketamine produced excellent analgesia and dissociative sleep in all patients in the active phase of labor. The introduction to delivery interval was significantly shortened (3.6 vs 6 hours) in our general populations. Of the 50 patients studied, 49 were unable to remember if contractions were painful and 80% experienced and narrated dreams. The auditory component was consistently intact in 82% of the cases; 78% described the total experience as pleasant, while the rest found it unpleasant or uncertain. The one-minute Apgar score of 6.8 was not significantly different from that of the general population.

AB  - In order to investigate the influence of spontaneous changes of CNS activity on ante partum FHR and fetal motor activity state specific heart rate and motor activity patterns of newborn in fan t s were compared with patterns seen in the fetus. Instantaneous FHR derived from abdominal FECG, the external tocogram and fetal movements äs indicated by the mother via push button were recorded continuously for 8 hours on strip chait and analog tape. At least 4 days after parturition the same individuae, now newborn (except 2 anencephaiy, who died during parturition) were observed for assessment of newborn infant state behavior. Heart rate and respiration again were recorded for 8 hours continuously and during the whole time close observation and protocoi of the newborns states and all interesting events was performed. Visual evaluation and Computer analysis of recordings revealed that in the newborn infant state related heart rate pattern changes do occur and that identical heart rate patterns and their changes can be seen in the fetus too. Definition of states according to typical and comparable heart rate patterns in the newborn and in the fetus was supported by taking into account newborn and fetal motor activity patterns. © 1979, Walter de Gruyter.

AB  - In part I of this publication it has been demonstrated that state related changes of heart rate pattern occur in the newborn infant and that visually identical heait rate pattern and their changes can be seen in the fetus too. On the basis of compaiison and analogy it was assumed that in the fetus the regulär change in the state of the central nervous coordination and/or arousal - äs in the newborn - is the predominating factor governing antepartum FHR pattern and its Variation in fetal wellbeing. For off line Computer analysis of visually identical neonatal and fetal heart rate patterns 8 hour heart rate recordings were digitized and data of sequential segments of l min duration were analysed in respect to baseline level, amplitude äs well äs frequency of macrofluctuation and microfluctuation. This was done according to quantification methods developed by the author. The author’s concept of analysis closely follows the rules of visual FHR analysis. The components of FHR pattern are defined and quantitated äs follows 1. Baseline is defined äs the statistical mean of heart rate per unit time when no deviations from baseline are present It is quantitated in beats per minute (BPM). 2. Deviations from baseline are accelerations and decelerations. 3. Macrofluctuation of baseline is the Variation of heart rate around its statistical mean when no deviations are present. Macrofluctuation amplitude is defined äs twice the mean absolute peak deviation from baseline per unit time. It is quantitated in BPM. Macrofluctuation frequency is the mean of the lower frequency spectrum contained in the heart rate per unit time. It is quantitated in cycles per min (CPM).4. Microfluctuation is the high frequency component of heart rate. It is quantitated äs the mean absolute deviation of sampled heart rate from the slightly smoothed heart rate per unit time in BPM. © 1979, Walter de Gruyter. All rights reserved.

AB  - Etomidate and thiopental were compared in hypnotic-narcotic-nitrous oxide anesthesia for minor gynecologic operations. The mean total dose of etomidate was 0.03 mg/kg/min (range: 0.016 to 0.045) and the mean total dose of thiopental was 0.33 mg/kg/min (range: 0.18 to 0.82). The induction dose of thiopental was 13 times that of etomidate, and the total dose administered was 11 times that of etomidate. Awakening times were shorter after etomidate, although the difference was not statistically significant. No patient had persistent venous irritation or phlebitis, but two patients receiving etomidate felt burning on injection. Muscle tremors resembling shivering, accompanied by rigidity of the extremities, lasting about 3 min, were observed in two patients in the etomidate group. These did not recur when subsequent doses were given. In Group A, (etomidate) 10/20 patients vomited and 1/20 was nauseated but did not vomit upon awakening. Six patients underwent voluntary interruption of pregnancy and received oxytocics. In Group B, 1/20 vomited and 2/20 were nauseated. The one who vomited underwent voluntary interruption of pregnancy. Nausea and vomiting were the only side effects, occurring more frequently in patients who received etomidate (P<0.025). No other side effect was seen with either drug.

AB  - Differences in hexenal detoxication rate and its induction with small doses of phenobarbital in mongrel female rats, depending upon the stage of the sex cycle, were investigated. The application of the hexobarbital test demonstrated that the duration of a continuous lateral position and re-establishment of locomotion after administration of a standard dose of hexobarbital in the stages of proestrus and estrus are much shorter than they are in the stages meta- and diestrus. In females pretreated with small doses of phenobarbital the same temporal correlations of sleep and restored locomotion during corresponding cycles following administration of hexobarbital were found as in controls, but their levels proved 2-3 times lower respectively than they were in control females. Low doses of phenobarbital (10, 10 and 20 mg/kg) used in the present experiments are nearly as effective as are doses almost by one order higher (80-150 mg/kg), used by other authors.

AB  - Fetal effects of maternal bacterial and viral infections (measles, cytomegalic, herpes, etc.) are well documented. However, drug and chemical effects are less recognized and understood, and actually there was very little in the literature about these effects until recently. Evidence is overwhelming that the nonbarbiturate, sleep-inducing drug thalidomide produced severe malformations of the extremities (phocomelia - 'seal extremities') in numerous newborns in Germany and other parts of Western Europe in the early 1960s. The only medications known definitely and absolutely to be teratogenic in the human are folic-acid antagonists (primarily aminopterin), thalidomide, and masculinizing steroids. Cortisone and its analogues, suspect in cleft palate, should be avoided if possible, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy. Oral anticoagulants pass readily through the placental barrier and can have teratogenic effects. Heparin should be used instead, since it cannot cross the placental barrier. Drugs suspected or associated with increased risk to the fetus and neonate are listed. Chronic alcoholism in the mother can produce fetal abnormalities (the'fetal alcohol syndrome'). Alcohol readily crosses the placenta and goes directly into the fetus. Assorted heavy metals are probably the leading and most serious environmental pollutants affecting the fetus.

AB  - The clinical effects of oral flunitrazepam (2 mg on the night before operation followed by 2 mg on the morning of operation) and placebo as premedicants were tested in a double‐blind study in 81 gynaecological patients. The separate or total concentrations of flunitrazepam and its demethylated metabolite in plasma (measured by gas chromatography) were correlated with the clinical effects of flunitrazepam prcmedication, assessed both subjectively and objectively. In most parameters tested (sleep on the night before operation, sedation, apprehension, headache, pulse rate), there was a positive, significant difference between the flunitrazepam group (n = 44) and the placebo group (n = 37). No significant difference was found between the two groups in emetic effect, excitement, systolic blood pressure increase, and venc‐puncture, but the patients receiving flunitrazepam felt significantly more dizziness. The temperature of the left forefinger before, during and after the anaesthesia did not vary significantly between the two groups. There was no correlation between the plasma concentration of flunitrazepam and its demethylated metabolite (separate or total concentrations) and any of the parameters tested before induction of anaesthesia. Flunitrazepam is a new oral premedicant with prominent sedative and anxiolytic actions. When the drug is given as a sedative on the night before operation, followed by a second dose on the morning of operation, the beneficial effects last for at least 8 hours after the second dose. © 1979 The Scandinavian Society of Anaesthesiologists

But it is obvious that if we can watch the fetus living ex utero as we wish, and can stimulate it delicately at any precise point, on the other hand, in utero, too brief an examination and often a very fragmentary one (for the very reason that the angle of vision becomes too narrow to obtain an overall view of a fetus more than 16 weeks old), must be repeated regularly and this leads to conclusions that are alarmist because they are too hasty. Among the many aspects of the information supplied by clinical work and useful for ultrasound monitoring of fetal life, two items seem important to us. Observation of fetal dynamics must bear on position, motility and reactivity. Phases of deep sleep, moments of total immobility even with complete absence of reactions, can be durable; they are nevertheless physiological states. Reactions to tactile stimulation are possible, both ex utero and in utero. In the latter case, the infant stimulates himself. There are three choice areas.'Bursts of motility', typical of the very early fetal ages, alternate with phases of deep sleep: breathing is often periodic, then registers durable pauses, the termination of which corresponds precisely with the beginning of the bursts of motility. Are they triggered by hypercapnia? At this very young age, when all muscular activity is global, are respiratory and overall somatic activity linked or better yet, blended into one? The neurological behavior of a fetus in good vital condition. This must necessarily be exactly that of his real fetal age, with its own specific characteristics, and whatever the degree of somatic growth, which may be influenced by certain types of maternal pathology. The type of behavior observed is therefore ipso facto an additional reference for the detection or the pinpointing of the degree of fetal maturation and therefore the gestational age. It may also confirm or invalidate an eventual diagnosis of intrauterine growth retardation. Discrepancies in the various somatic growth parameters perceived in utero and discrepancy between these parameters and fetal age, first presumed, then confirmed visually. Good fetal vitality must also be expressed by continuous evolutive modifications in neurological behavior. Monitored longitudinally by ultrasound, these modifications must follow the ascending curve of known fetal maturation. We have also seen the advantage of early detection of durable fetal malpositions with their consequences, which can sometimes be tragic at birth, even though the infant is strictly normal. Thus on the ever fundamental basis of clinical observation, following the fetus in utero thanks to the immense contribution of the dynamic vision provided by real-time ultrasound, constitutes an invaluable step forward and a source of information of great practical value. All this testifies to the mutual benefit to be derived from all exchanges between specialists in different disciplines and the absolute necessity of close and constant working relations between obstetricians and neonatologists.

AB  - Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity regulates the circadian rhythm of melatonin synthesis in pineal gland. NAT rhythm persisted in continuous darkness or in blinded rats. Development of the circadian rhythm of NAT activity was followed in the infant rats raised under various lighting schedules. The pups born and raised in continuous darkness or under constant illumination showed a rhythmic change indicating that the biological clock for NAT is generated inborn independent of environmental light-dark schedules. In the absence of light, the rhythms of pups synchronized with mother's rhythm. When rats were maintained under a ultradian light-dark schedule (LD 6:6), NAT activity showed a circadian change increasing once a day. When pups were born and raised under the ultradian lighting condition, NAT activity rhythm coincided with mother's rhythm. When pups were raised by a foster mother who had an inverted rhythm from that of an original mother, the rhythm of the pups synchronized with that of the foster mother. Whe pups were separated from their mother daily for 12 hours, their NAT rhythms reappeared when they were separated from their mother. These observations indicated a novel mechanism that in the absence of light-dark schedule, mothers taught the circadian rhythm to the pups as they raised them.

AB  - The sleep-waking behavior of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till the first 4 mth of life. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own schedule and was fed only if his behavior could be judged as a feeding demand. Using several methods of computerized analysis it could be demonstrated that the spontaneous sleep-waking behavior was mainly driven by 2 endogenous rhythms, an ultradian cycle and a circadian one. While the ultradian rhythm was already established at term showing a mean period of 4 hr, the circadian variation developed during the first 3 mth of life. So far the authors' results support earlier studies. The present paper, however, gives further evidence that both rhythms do not run independently, but seem to constitute a system of connected oscillators. As soon as the circadian rhythm is manifestly developed, the period of the ultradian rhythm seems to be modulated according to circadian variations. More specifically, during the nocturnal phase of the circadian rhythm the ultradian rhythm decelerated. By contrast, during the diurnal phase the ultradian cycle was accelerated. Using circadian frequency modulation of the ultradian cycle as the underlying principle, a computerized model of both connected oscillators was developed. The theoretically predicted sleep-waking behavior was compared to the behavior actually observed in the infant of this study. During postnatal development the coupled rhythms cause characteristic periodicities of the sleep-waking pattern. Since the infant experiences his world within a basic framework of sleep and waking spans, the different periodicities may be considered as a structure timing the information process in the developing brain.

AB  - The basal activity of an LH-RH degrading enzyme system, L-cystine arylamidase, was determined in the pituitary gland of female rats at 4 h intervals throughout the 4-day oestrus cycle. The activity of the enzyme was found to be fluctuating during the four stages of the cycle in a circadian rhythm with the highest values occurring at night and the lowest values at noon. The maximal activity for the whole cycle was measured at 04.00 h on the day of metoestrus and the minimal activity between 12.00 h and 16.00 h on the day of pro-oestrus. The iv injection of various doses of oestradiol caused only a slight change in enzyme activity of the pituitary during oestrus, but considerable increases were observed during the other three stages. The stimulation of enzyme activity by progesterone was much more pronounced during dioestrus and pro-oestrus as compared with metroestrus and oestrus. Similarly the reactions to the injection with LH and prostaglandin E2, respectively, were not very pronounced during oestrus and metoestrus, whereas the enzyme activity rose +50% and +100%, respectively, during dioestrus and pro-oestrus. The LH-RH-degrading enzyme system in the pituitary seems to be involved in the control of the tonic LH release, and in the maintenance and regulation of the sensitivity of the gonadotrophs to alterations in LH-RH release from the median eminence.

AB  - The cytological appearance of the pineal body is related to stage of development or age, time of day, exposure to illumination, season of the year, and reproductive state. Experimental manipulations that alter the normal cytology of the pineal include hypophysectomy, administration of any of several hormones or drugs, blinding, denervation and exposure to stressful influences such as heat or cold. The effects of blinding are similar to the effects of continuous darkness on the pineal's cytology. Ultrastructural examinations reveal a number of changes in the organelles, especially an increased number of vesicles and complex membranous whorls. These features suggest heightened activity and generally are coincident with sexual quiescence. Membranous whorls also may be induced by cold exposure. Prolonged or continuous illumination leads to a reduction in the size of pinealocytes and to changes in their organelles that suggest reduced activity. Such alterations can often be correlated with heightened sexual activity. Sympathetic denervation of pineal glands also results in atrophy of the pinealocytes. Reproductive condition is reflected in the appearance of the pinealocytes. The estrous cycle, pregnancy, castration and the administration of gonadotropins or gonadal steroids affect pinealocyte structure. A feedback system involving the gonads and pineal gland is indicated.

AB  - During a study on the phylogeny and ontogeny of human hiccups, essentially all hiccups to occur over continuous periods of 3m - 11y were recorded from 20 healthy people of either sex and various ages. Hiccups displayed considerable structure in time. If more than a few occurred together, they became 'established' and a hiccup bout ensued, which did not stop until a certain 'minimum' number of hiccups had occurred. For many subjects, two or more bouts frequently occurred on the same hiccup day, even though days on which bouts occurred were weeks apart. Number of hiccups was correlated with age, sex, reproductive status and stage of menstrual cycle, time of day, length of time since previous hiccup day, length of time since previous hiccup bout, and length of hiccup-hiccup intervals within a bout. Findings support the hypothesis that human hiccup is a 'fixed action pattern' (FAP) - a central theoretical concept in ethology - and provide leads for further studies aimed at learning the biological function(s) of human hiccup and its possible homologues in other species.

AB  - The present study is concerned with the role of maternal cortisol in regulating diurnal rhythm of unconjugated oestriol in 9 pregnant women. Blood was drawn at 30 min intervals between 5 p.m. and 3 a.m. (1700-0300). In 5 patients endogenous ACTH-secretion was simultaneously suppressed by 12 mg dexamethasone over 48 hr. Between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m. 0.25 mg ACTH(1-24) (Synacthen) was infused into the subjects. Free oestriol was measured by radioimmunoassay, and the total plasma cortisol by the protein binding method. Patients without dexamethasone demonstrated high oestriol levels (21.5 ± 9 ng/ml) and episodic secretion between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. (1700-2000). At the same time cortisol concentrations were relatively low (274.1 ± 66 ng/ml). Ninety min after starting ACTH-infusion, plasma oestriol decreased in negative correlation to rising cortisol (r=0.916,P>0.001). Between 11 p.m and 2 a.m. (2300-0200) oestriol levels were significantly below the control values (12.9 ± 3 ng/ml, P< 0.001) and were associated with high cortisol levels (887 ± 312 ng/ml). Episodic oestriol production did not occur during the period of elevated cortisol levels. Under dexamethasone, both oestriol (2.1 ± 1.2 ng/ml) and cortisol values (36.5 ± 24 ng/ml) were markedly suppressed. Only cortisol production could be stimulated during ACTH-infusion (374 ± 80 ng/ml), whereas oestriol concentration remained in the range of the controls (1.91 ± 0.5 ng/ml). These results suggest that diurnal rhythm of unconjugated oestriol is predominantly regulated by feed-back action of maternal cortisol on the foetal hypothalamus.

AB  - Frontal hypothalamic deafferentation, which disconnects the anterior hypothalamus from the preoptic area, stops the twice daily surges of prolactin secretion of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy in the rat, and causes rapid luteolysis. Medial hypothalamic deafferentation (MHD), which separates the anterior from the posterior half of the hypothalamus, does not interrupt pregnancy and causes a significant increase in the size of the corpora lutea. To see whether MHD induced an increase in the basal level of prolactin and/or a change in the pattern of prolactin surges, pseudopregnant rats were subjected to MHD or a sham operation on day 3 (day 1 = day of oestrus) and their bloods assayed for prolactin on either day 5 or days 7-8. MHD caused a specific disappearance of the day-time prolactin surge and a diminution in the height of the night-time surge, but no change from the controls in the basal prolactin level. In spite of what thus appears to be a lesser secretion of prolactin than in the controls, the corpora lutea of the MHD rats were larger, and progesterone was secreted at a higher rate and for a longer time, than in the controls. The relation of these findings to the existence of a 'surge centre' in the hypothalamus was discussed.

AB  - Daily rhythms in pineal methoxyindole metabolism have been described in rodents and humans: serotonin levels in rat pineals are highest during the daylight hours and fall markedly soon after the onset of darkness, coincident with increases in the levels of pineal melatonin and 5-methoxy-tryptophol and the activities of pineal serotonin-N--acetyltransferase (SNAT) and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT). The fact that the levels of melatonin and 5-methoxytryptophol vary in parallel suggests that the major factor generating the methoxyindole rhythms is not SNAT activity, as has been suggested, but a proximal step, perhaps a change in the availability (for metabolism) of "stored" serotonin. Melatonin levels in human serum and urine exhibit rhythms similar to those observed in rats, i.e., they rise sharply during the daily dark period. When the onset of darkness is delayed by 12 hours, human melatonin rhythms usually require 3 or 4 days to adjust to the new lighting regimen. Environmental factors, other than light, that activate the sympathetic nervous system or cause epinephrine to be secreted from the adrenal medulla (e.g., the stress of immobilization; insulin-induced hypoglycemia) can override the inhibitory effects of light and accelerate melatonin synthesis. Melatonin levels in rat blood and urine are lowest during the proestrous and estrous phases of the estrous cycle. Although this effect of the ovarian steroid hormones is accompanied by a reduction in urinary norepinephrine levels, it is not caused simply by a decrease in the quantity of norepinephrine acting on the pineal but also involves a direct action of the hormones. Ovariectomy increases serum melatonin levels, whereas the administration of estradiol plus progesterone (to ovariectomized animals) lowers melatonin levels. The spectral and intensity-response characteristics of the photic inhibition of melatonin synthesis have been established for the rat. Rhythms in melatonin synthesis apparently persist among animals placed in environments of continuous darkness; the source of the cyclic signal (mediated by the pineal sympathetic nerves) has not yet been identified. Preliminary evidence suggests that levels of a peptide hormone, arginine vasotocin, in rat pineals and sera also exhibit daily rhythms and are increased by norepinephrine.

AB  - There are apparent differences in the mechanisms governing cyclic gonadotrophin release in rats and women. Yet, the discovery of the mechanisms which appear unique to the rat may lead to new breakthroughs. For example, the mid-cycle increases in plasma LH and FSH in women are prolonged when compared to those in the rat and two phases of FSH release are not discernible. It very well may be that the FSH surge in women is the result of both hypothalamic LHRH release and the factors responsible for producing the second phase of FSH release in rats. It may become possible to control FSH release selectively in women through application of knowledge, as yet not obtained, on mechanisms responsible for oestrous FSH release in rats. This could lead to control of ovarian follicular development with administration of endogenous substances. Along a similar line, cyclic gonadotrophin release in women is not synchronized to the lighting schedule. Whether a neural clock is absent or simply non-functional in women is not known. Nevertheless, when the clock mechanism is fully understood, it may become possible to apply this knowledge to ensure synchronization of ovulation in women.

AB  - Five hundred and fifty-seven full term newborns born at National Taiwan University Hospital during the past 5 years had 557 waking and natural sleep electroencephalograms recorded within 12 to 24 hours after birth. These were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in regard to the background activities in frequency band spectrum and percentile, the response 78.333.773.Q eye opening, sound and stroboscopic photic stimulation, paroxysmal discharges, the characteristics of traces alternants, and the amount of quiet as well as paradoxical sleep. With a mean energy percentage of 62% for delta, 26% for theta, 5% for alpha and 2.5% for beta spectrum, the background activities presented a significantly mild degree of asymmetry in theta, alpha and beta spectrum. Photic drivings of 5 Hz occurred in 23% and both 5 Hz and 10 Hz occurred in 0.5%, while visual attenuation which was regarded as an unremarkable response occurred in only 0.7% of cases. Sound response, found in 47.6% of the cases, revealed a striking association with photic drivings. Paroxysmal discharges were found in 4.3% characterized by paroxysmal flat (50%) and stereotyped alpha like transient (29.2%) patterns. Among 481 of the 557 cases (86.4%), 54.1% showed both type 1 and type 2, while 27% showed type 1, type 2 and type 3 traces alternants in the sleep record. More than 96% of type 1, type 2 and type 3 were synchronous. The mean duration of type 1 trace alternant was 0.86 sec., and those of both type 2 and type 3 were 2.6 sec. The interval between two successive traces alternants averaged 10.3 seconds. The quiet sleep occupied on an average 24%, and the paradoxical sleep 76% of the total sleep. The 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile of the energy percentage for each frequency spectrum, the duration of each type of trace alternant and the interval between traces alternants, and the mean percentage of both quiet and paradoxical sleep were calculated as a standard for future reference. Comparisons of electroencephalographic parameters between male and female newborns, between normal newborns born after premature rupture and those without premature rupture of membrane, and between normal newborns born by vacuum or forceps delivery and those born spontaneously, revealed that the type of delivery influenced the electroencephalogram of newborns more than other factors, i.e., sex and state of amniotic sac membrane in regard to background activities, the response to sound and photic stimulation as well as some electroencephalographic parameters of sleep, including the duration of trace alternant, interval between traces alternants, and mean percentage of quiet and paradoxical sleep.

AB  - The literature on neurologic sequelae in infants with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is reviewed. In many studies this term is used for only those infants who have a birthweight (BW) below the 10th percentile and are labeled small for gestational age (SGA). The etiology of IUGR can often be correlated with a characteristic pattern of in utero growth and a subsequently predictable pattern of postnatal growth and/or developmental outcome. The concept that certain premature infants who are appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA) but whose birth weights fall below the 50th percentile may have IUGR is supported by the analysis of data from this study. In attempting to predict the neurologic outcome, it may be more helpful to recognize etiologic factors such as sleep disturbances than to analyze infants by birth weight gestational age groups.

AB  - The present data show that the uterine vasodilatation produced by estrogens is accompanied by a marked increase in the production rate of progesterone in the pregnant but not in the nonpregnant animal. This seems to point to the placenta as being the source of the augmented production of progesterone. Two aspects of this estrogen-induced phenomenon deserve some considerations. The first is concerned with the pattern of the increased progesterone production as compared to that of the increase in uterine blood flow. The data clearly show that the progesterone production rate started to increase after estrogen injection at the same time that the uterine blood flow began to increase. Progesterone production, however, reached a peak and fell rapidly to control levels while the uterine blood flow was still elevated. In other words, the changes in progesterone production induced by estrogens did not keep pace with the changes in uterine blood flow. The second aspect is concerned with the pulsatile pattern of progesterone production by the uteroplacental tissue. Although during the control period there was some suggestion of pulsatile pattern, such a pattern became clearly evident and highly magnified after estrogen administration.

AB  - CONTROVERSY surrounds the conflicts between the requirements of human safety and the preservation of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) in western North America. It has been difficult to separate the effect of factors such as the closure of garbage dumps from that of the climate. It has also proved difficult to relate climatic data to changes in the populations of large mammals. I report here a correlation of climatic change with fluctuations in the sizes of litters of grizzly bears born in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, during 1958-1976. The decrease in litter sizes observed since the closure of garbage dumps seems to be largely a consequence of unfavourable weather during the periods of the final fattening of the mother, winter sleep, birth, lactation and early spring foraging. This study represents one of the few times that the effects of climate have been demonstrated for large omnivorous or carnivorous mammals. © 1978 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - l (+)-α-{1-[(3,3-Di-3-thienylallyl)amino]-ethyl}-benzyl-alcohol hydrochloride (tinofedrine hydrochloride, D 8955, Novocebrin) a new cerebral-active compound, was tested in animal experiments for several pharmacological activities and side-effects. The influence of tinofedrine on the central nervous system shows slight calming and anxiolytic effects. Central nervous side-effects regarding behavior and motor disturbances are not to be expected on the basis of the authors' animal experimental results with therapeutic doses. Respiratory depression induced by methadone as well as morphine analgesia are not increased by tinofedrine. Tinofedrine does not affect the gastro-intestinal tract in a negative manner. On the contrary, it shows protective activity on some experimental ulcers. Secretion of bile also is not affected by tinofedrine. High doses of tinofedrine cause a decrease in urine output for a relatively short time. This decrease is compensated later by increased urine output. Similarly, sodium and chloride retention occurs first, and is compensated by increased excretion during the latter part of the experiment. In isolated organ preparations, tinofedrine antagonizes different spasmogenic agents. Especially it exerts antagonism against bradykinin, barium chloride, prostaglandin E 1 and serotonin. Histamine is antagonized by tinofedrine only in the isolated guinea-pig ileum but not in the trachea. Against acetylcholine, tinofedrine does not show considerable activity. This corresponds well with the ineffectiveness on the pupil diameter. Spontaneous tonus of isolated trachea is not influenced considerably by tinofedrine. Furthermore, tinofedrine possesses remarkable local-anesthetic activity which is stronger than that of lidocaine. In the carrageenin rat paw edema test tinofedrine shows relatively strong anti-inflammatory effects. The consequences of the observed activities are discussed.

AB  - Changes in brain activity after electrochemical stimulation of the preoptic area of pro-oestrous rats were studied by the measurement of the electro-encephalogram (EEG) of the frontal cortex and the recording of single neurones in the anterior hypothalamus. All rats were anaesthetized with urethane between 10.00 and 12.00 h to allow prolonged electrophysiological recording and to block the spontaneous surge of LH during the afternoon. Electrochemical stimulation was applied, between 12.00 and 14.00 h, as an anodal current through an implanted steel electrode; this caused the electrolytic deposition of iron and evoked the release of LH and ovulation. Electrochemical stimulation of the preoptic area changed the cortical EEG, either immediately or after a delay of a few minutes, from a labile pattern with alternate periods of arousal and slow-wave sleep, to a stage of continuous arousal which persisted for the remainder of the recording period (2-3 h). Conversely, the EEG pattern of the cortex was not disturbed by electrolytic lesions placed in the preoptic area through a platinum electrode. Electrochemical stimulation of the arcuate region of the hypothalamus, the lateral septal area, the medial amygdaloid complex and the anterior parts of the thalamus caused no obvious change in the EEG patterns. Ipsilateral anterior hypothalamic neurones, about 1 mm caudal to the focus of electrochemical stimulation, displayed an immediate decrease in electrical activity after application of the current. After 10-20 min however, the rates of discharge of action potentials in 9 out of the 16 neurones under consideration increased progressively from 0.5 to 15-25 action potentials/s and these rates were maintained until the recordings were lost after 90-230 min. No such acceleration in electrical activity was observed in neurones on the contralateral side. Iron deposited during electrochemical stimulation was precipitated as sulphide and stained by Timm's method. There was a central damaged area of radius 0.6 mm surrounded by an 'undamaged' area with considerable infiltration of iron, up to a distance of 1.7 mm from the electrode tip. Cells within the area of infiltration did not stain for iron 10 min after electrochemical stimulation, but after 30 min, neural elements in this peripheral zone were stained in a manner similar to the Golgi method. The concentrations of LH in the plasma remained unchanged in all rats for 10-15 min after electrochemical stimulation. Thereafter, the concentratons increased progressively and approximately in parallel to the changes in action potential activity until, after 2 h, the individual concentrations of 300-600 ng LH/ml were more than six times the values obtained before stimulation. Bilateral electrochemical stimulation resulted in appreciably higher concentrations of LH and produced values close to those observed during the pro-oestrous surge of the hormone. Electrochemical stimulation during the afternoon of the day before pro-oestrus consistently advanced ovulation; this response occurred irrespective of whether the resultant lesions were large or small. The production of a large lesion during the aftenoon of the day before pro-oestrus without concomitant deposition of iron by the use of a platinum electrode appeared to block the surge of LH on the subsequent day and the preovulatory follicles became atretic. These results suggest that the ovulatory response to electrochemical stimulation is related primarily to an increase in the electrical activity of the hypothalamus and not to the destruction of brain tissue.

AB  - Second trimester interruption of pregnancy through D&E (dilatation and evacuation) procedure has been used at the Boulder (Colorado) Abortion Clinic with an exceedingly low complication rate, lower than abortion with prostaglandins or saline solution infusion. However, according to a doctor who has performed more than 300 such abortions, while the procedure is easier emotionally for the patient since she does not have to deliver a fetus which may have signs of life, it produces intense psychological reactions on doctors and on assisting nurses. 15 members of the Boulder Abortion Clinic were polled to obtain reactions to the D&E procedure. Many subjects reported serious emotional reactions which produced physiological symptoms, sleep disturbances, effects on personal relationships, moral anguish, conscious stress, and unconscious manifestations such as dreams. A few respondents expressed feelings of resentment and irritation toward patients who waited so long before seeking abortion, and most felt a deep sympathy for doctors performing the procedure, and a desire to protect them from the trauma of having to view the fetus. It was observed that many of those capable of performing or assisting with the procedure are having strong personal reservations about participating in an operation which they view as destructive and violent.

AB  - Continuous measurements of human fetal breathing movements at 34 to 35 weeks' gestational age were made with an ultrasonic real-time scanner for periods of 24 hours in 11 women. A significant increase occurred in fetal breathing activity during the second and third hour following meals and this pattern apparently followed an increase in maternal plasma glucose concentration. There was a prolonged significant increase in fetal breathing activity between 0100 and 0700 hours. Increases in human fetal breathing activity accompanied by increased gross fetal body movements occurred for periods of 20 to 60 minutes out of every 1.0 to 1.5 hours of observation time. It was concluded that the percentage of time spent breathing by normal fetuses was related to time of day and maternal meals. The alternating changes of fetal activity and inactivity observed may represent biologic changes of sleep state in the human fetus in utero at 34 to 35 weeks' gestational age. It will be important to account for these three patterns of fetal breathing activity in clinical studies which examine the usefulness of fetal breathing movements in assessing fetal health. © 1978.

AB  - This prospective study describes intrauterine behavioral states in the human fetus. The variables used are fetal movement and two expressions of fetal heart rate (FHR): long-term variability and baseline rate. Fetal movement was recorded with the use of two strain gauges. FHR was measured with a transabdominal fetal electrocardiographic processor. Sixteen fetuses of normal pregnant patients were studied near term. One-minute periods called "epochs" were classified as quiet, active, and intermediate, based on the presence or absence of fetal movement (longer in duration than one second), increased or decreased long-term FHR variability, and the baseline of the FHR. Complete agreement in epoch classification was noted in 79.3 per cent of the 2,054 epochs analyzed. Quiet and active one-minute epochs were clustered into longer time periods representing quiet and active fetal behavior states similar to those seen in the neonate. The overall visual evaluation of the tracings based on the above noted criteria demonstrated the presence of quiet, active, and transitional states in the fetus. Mean duration of a complete cycle, including the quiet, active, and transitional states, was 62.3 minutes. The mean duration in the quiet state was 22.8 minutes and the mean duration in the nonquiet states (active and transitional) was 39.5 minutes. The significance of these intrauterine behavioral states is stressed. © 1978.

AB  - Serum prolactin was measured in 581 blood samples collected immediately after birth from 568 single new-born and from 9 pairs of twins. Cord serum prolactin is high at birth: the mean level is some 5 times higher than in adults. There is no sex difference in cord serum prolactin concentration in the neonate. Mean serum prolactin is significantly higher at 1.00 and 2.00 a.m. Thus a circadian periodicity in serum prolactin concentration seems to appear already during foetal life well before the organization of sleep rhythm. Cord serum prolactin increases with birth weight ranging from 1500 g to 3500 g. Thus, the control of levels of circulating prolactin changes during foetal life resulting in a progressive increase starting from mid-pregnancy. Mean cord serum prolactin at birth is lower in twins than in single new-borns. There is no significant difference in serum prolactin between the first and second twin.

AB  - The short- and long-term effects of surgical procedures and chair restraint on total plasma cortisol were assessed in the chronic rhesus monkey preparation. Three nonpregnant and six pregnant animals were sampled daily, morning and evening. Fetal plasma specimens were obtained simultaneously from the pregnant animals. In the nonpregnant rhesus monkey, a circadian rhythm is present the day following venous catheterization and chair restraint, with individual values similar to those in trained, unanesthetized animals. In the pregnant animals, a postoperative rise in cortisol is followed by a gradual decline to a plateau and a return of circadian rhythm. No consistent daily fluctuations are seen in fetal cortisol, and although correlated with maternal cortisol, the exact relationship is uncertain. The data indicate that operation, as expected, is stressful but acclimation to the chair occurs. © 1978.

AB  - In the adult rat, fed ad libitum, the activity of jejunal sucrase shows a diurnal rhythm with a peak during the dark period. Ontogenically, sucrase activity appears around the 16th postnatal day, then rises rapidly, and reaches adult levels by the 25th day. Our aim was to determine the developmental stage at which the diurnal rhythm appears and to elucidate its physiological basis. When sampled every 3 h on the 19th day, jejunal sucrase showed no discernible pattern with time. In contrast, at 22 days (1 day after completion of weaning) a circadian rhythm very similar to that of adults had appeared. Weights of stomach contents showed that the adult pattern of nocturnal feeding also matured between days 19 and 22. When weaning was prevented, no sucrase rhythm was detected on day 22, despite an imposed rhythm of suckling. Thus the sucrase rhythm is normally cued by some aspect of weaning other than rhythmic ingestion per se. Although corticosterone seemed a likely mediator of the sucrase rhythm, studies in adult rats showed that the rhythm persists in adrenalectomized animals.

AB  - Pineal protein synthesis in female rats, estimated from the incorporation of labeled amino acids into proteins in vitro, exhibited significant changes as a function of the stage of the estrous cycle. These changes were restricted to the proestrous and estrous days; pineal protein synthesis attained its maximum on the morning of proestrus declining abruptly by 53% during the evening, at the time of the expected gonadotrophin and prolactin release. Pineal serotonin-N-acetyltransferase activity increased by 10 to 15 times during night-time on every day of cycle; no appreciable modification of its daily rhythm was detected along the estrous cycle. Spayed rats treated for 2 days with progesterone showed a dose-dependent decrease of amino acid incorporation into pineal proteins, regardless of whether estradiol was simultaneously administered or not. Pineal protein synthesis in spayed rats administered with estradiol for 2 days and killed at 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the third day, did not show differences as a function of time of sacrifice. When progesterone was injected on the morning of the third day a significant decline in protein synthesis was observed at 5 p.m. Only in the latter group serum LH levels showed significantly greater values at 5 p.m. Pineal serotonin content of estradiol-treated rats increased significantly at evening, an effect which was obliterated by the administration of progesterone; progesterone alone did not affect pineal serotonin content. Radioactivity uptake by pineal glands incubated with labeled progesterone did not show changes along the estrous cycle. These data argue in favour of the involvement of progesterone in the changes of pineal protein synthesis observed during the "critical period" for gonadotrophin and prolactin release. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The effect of brain lesion or surgical isolation of the neural circuit on SWS and PS circadian rhythm have been studied in female rats under a 14/10 light-dark schedule. Cortical EEGs and dorsal neck EMG were used to monitor SWS, PS and alertness in female rats. Intact and operated controls showed regular 4-5-day vaginal cycles and nocturnal sleep rhythm, but the night PS value on proestrus was lower than in other cycles. Following septal lesion, MPO roof cut, vaginal cycles and SWS rhythm were regularly maintained; however, the PS appearance at night, except during proestrus, increased (night PS peak). These results were similar to those for pinealectomized or ovariectomized female rats. A frontal cut of the MBH produced persistent estrus and disturbed both SWS and PS circadian rhythm. The suprachiasmatic-lesioned rats showed persistent estrus and disrupted SWS rhythm, but regularly maintained the circadian PS rhythm. The vaginal cycles and SWS rhythm in the fornical-transected rats were regularly maintained, but the PS rhythm was disturbed during diestrus and showed ultradian rhythm. From these results, it is suggested that the pineal hormone and the gonadal feedback mechanisms may be involved in the night PS peak and this mechanism may involve the septal- and amygdaloid-hypothalamic systems. A different neural mechanism exist for SWS and PS circadian rhythm; SWS rhythm involves the suprachiasmatic-basal hypothalamic system and PS circadian rhythm is related, in part, to the hippocampal-hypothalamic system. © 1978.

AB  - Chronic maternal administration of diazepam resulted in a modification of fetal respiratory-like activity (FRLA) in the sheep. An over-all increase in this activity occurred. This increase was probably due to a rebound effect following periods of acute suppression with each administration of diazepam. Loss of central control in the regulation of FRLA was implied. A complete reversal of a circadian rhythm of FRLA was observed in animals receiving diazepam. These changes have implications with respect to the antenatal monitoring of the fetus and sequelae in the newborn infant. © 1978.

AB  - The spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour of a male infant, normal with respect to pregnancy, delivery and Apgar score, was observed continuously from birth till the first four months of life. Additionally sleep stages were scored by means of polygraphic method during several weeks. The infant was allowed to sleep and awake according to his own schedule and was fed if his behaviour could be judged as a feeding demand. Using statistical analysis it could be deomonstrated, that the spontaneous sleep-waking behaviour was mainly driven by three endogenous rhythms: The Basic rest aktivity cycle with periods of about 50 minutes, a circafour-hour rhythm already established at term and a circadian periodicity which developed during the first three months of life. So far our results support earlier studies of Kleitman and Engelmann, Parmelee, Hellbrügge etc. The present study, however, gives further evidence, that these rhythms do not run independently, but constitute a system of interacting oscillators. During postnatal development these connected rhythms cause characteristic periodicities of the spontaneous sleep-waking pattern. Since the newborn experiences his world within a basic framework of sleep and waking epochs, the system of interacting, endogenous rhythms may be considered as a structure timing the information process in the developing brain.

AB  - The authors, after a classification of the main biological rhythms, mention the parameters of the circadian rhythm deduced by mathematical analysis of so-called "Cosinor". They then devote their study to the main hormones, the secretion of which depends on circadian periodicity. They emphasize the effect that their biorhythm has on the value of plasma concentrations depending on the time of sampling. They suggest standardisation of this time in drawing up international norms.

AB  - Diurnal profile studies have been used to define the fetal carbohydrate and lipid substrate environment in normal and diabetic women during late pregnancy. In women with normal glucose tolerance the diurnal plasma glucose concentration was maintained within close limits (mean +/- S.D., 4.70 +/- 0.38 mmol/l) but in chemical and insulin-dependent diabetics there was a marked increase in both the mean diurnal glucose value and in the variability of the plasma glucose levels observed through the day (mean +/- S.D., 5.61 +/- 5.61 +/- 1.03 and 6.02 +/- 1.26 mmol/l respectively, P less than 0.01). No difference was observed between the peripheral insulin activity of the normal and chemical diabetic women, and the impaired glucose tolerance of the latter group was due to a deficient insulin response to goucose. The diurnal glucose variability, expressed as the standard deviation of the mean, was found to be inversely correlated with the residual C-peptide response in insulin-requiring diabetics. The mean diurnal plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration was slightly raised in chemical diabetic subjects compared to normal women (mean +/- S.D., 0.77 +/- 0.34 and 0.68 +/- 0.20 mmol/l respectively) but this difference was not significant. Insulin treatment produced a marked reduction in circulating FFA concentration, with a mean value in the insulin-dependent diabetic group of 0.45 +/- 0.11 mmol/l (P less than 0.001). Neonatal glucose assimilation during the first two hours of life correlated strongly with several functions of maternal carbohydrate tolerance. This was associated with higher plasma insulin concentrations at birth, and a marked tendency to hypoglycaemia in the infants of untreated chemical diabetic women. Impaired mobilization of triglyceride stores was also observed during the two hours after birth in the infants of diabetic women. This, however, appears to be due not to impaired lipolysis but to rapid re-esterification of FFA. These findings all indicate a state of functional hyperinsulinism in the infant of the diabetic women secondary to maternal hyperglycaemia.

AB  - Sixty-two consecutive diabetic women hospitalized from one to eight weeks prior to delivery were included in this study. Some 1,100 simultaneous unconjugated plasma estriol, total plasma estriol, 24 hour urinary estriol, and creatinine assays were performed on an almost daily schedule. Clinical management was based upon a weekly oxytocin challenge test and daily 24 hour urinary estriol and creatinine determinations. Twenty patients had spontaneous onset of labor and 32 were delivered electively at 38 weeks while three were delivered for maternal and seven for fetal indications. Gestational age at delivery averaged 38 weeks and ranged from 35 to 42 weeks. A total of 840 day-to-day variations of unconjugated plasma estriol, total plasma estriol, and the urinary estriol/creatinine ratio were computed as the per cent rise or fall from the highest mean of three consecutive preceding values. Observed were 369, 419, and 428 decreases in unconjugated plasma estriol, total plasma estriol, and urinary estriol/creatinine, respectively, averaging 12.8 ± 9.6 (S.D.), 13.4 ± 10.1, and 14.4 ± 10.6 per cent. One stillbirth occurred, which was preceded by a 42 per cent decrease in unconjugated plasma estriol but unheralded by either a drop in total plasma estriol or the urinary estriol/creatinine ratio. There were fewer falls of more than 40 per cent unassociated with perinatal morbidity and death with unconjugated plasma estriol (No. = 3) than with total plasma estriol (No. = 8) and urinary estriol/creatinine (No. = 8). These data suggest that unconjugated plasma estriol is the most predictive test among presently available estriol assays for managing the pregnant diabetic patient. © 1978.

AB  - Primary sleep disorders include narcolepsy, the Pickwickian syndrome, sleep apnea in infants and other rare conditions. Secondary sleep disorders occur in depression, alcoholism, endocrinopathies, heart failure and pregnancy. Medical symptomatology often increases during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when physiologic activity is high. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, requires careful work-up, attempts at environmental manipulation and judicious short-term pharmacotherapy. Pharmacologic manipulation of sleep is beset with complications. A basic understanding of properties and side effects of the sleep-inducing drugs is needed in order to select the optimal agent.

AB  - The concentration of lactose in the mammary secretion from individual glands of two sows increased significantly (P < 0·01) between 0 and 24 h after parturition. In six sows studied during the perinatal period there was a negative correlation (r = - 0.80; P < 0·02) at parturition between the concentration of progesterone in the blood and the concentration of lactose in the mammary secretion. Furthermore, the increase in concentration of lactose in the mammary secretion after parturition was related to the timing of the decline of plasma progesterone to low levels. The results indicate that the initiation of lactation occurs within 24 h of parturition in most sows, and the results are consistent with the hypothesis that progesterone withdrawal acts as the 'trigger'. Neither the changes in corticosteroid binding globulin nor the changes in total corticosteroids were temporally related to the initiation of lactation. However, a circadian rhythm was observed for total corticosteroids in the blood of three out of nine lactating and pregnant sows, whereas no circadian rhythm was observed in progesterone of the four pregnant sows. The results are discussed in relation to the disease complex mastitis-metritis-agalactia. © 1978 ASEG.

AB  - A radioimmunoassay specific for the direct measurement of dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate in 0.5 or 1 μl of human serum was developed using an antibody directed against dehydroisoandrosterone hemisuccinate coupled to thyroglobulin. Dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate levels were measured in pregnant women throughout gestation starting with the 6th week of pregnancy, and in young ovulatory women, postmenopausal women and in men. During pregnancy the concentrations of dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate in maternal serum decreased steadily with advancing gestation [1825 ± 68 ng/ml (mean and S.E.) at 6-8 weeks gestation vs 706 ± 141 ng/ml at 36-41 weeks gestation], and the most striking decrease was observed between 14 and 16 weeks of gestation. The mean concentrations of dehydroiso-androsterone sulfate were higher in men than in young nonpregnant women (2679 ±196 ng/ml vs 2020 ± 108 ng/ml respectively). In postmenopausal women, mean serum dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate concentrations (764 ± 28 ng/ml) were considerably lower than those in young premenopausal women P < 0.001). © 1978.

AB  - Adult hamsters gnawed a wooden dowel which passively protruded into the cage. Gnawing was detected by a simple switch closed by movement of the dowel in the X-Y plane. Rhythmicity of the gnawing activity was circadian in nature and closely resembled the wheelrunning rhythm recorded simultaneously or sequentially under a variety of lighting conditions. Intact or castrated male or female hamsters did not differ in the mean number of switch closures generated per 24 hr by gnawing. There was a very large interindividual difference with this measure. The data indicated a tendency for the daily amplitude of gnawing to vary with the estrous cycle. The gnawbar may prove useful as a device for assessing effects of photoperiod on endocrine variables which can be obscured if hamsters have access to running wheels. © 1978.

AB  - Seasonal variations in the incidence of the conception of multiple pregnancies are compared in the same population area in two centuries. 12,617 singleton and 101 twin pregnancies from 1803 to 1852 are compared to 63,967 singleton, 473 twin and 5 triplet pregnancies from 1965 to 1970. In both groups the percentage decrease of multiple conceptions during the first three months of the year was higher than the percentage decrease of singleton conceptions. In both groups the percentage increase of multiple conceptions during the summer months was higher than the percentage increase of singleton conceptions. The question of the influence of light on the hypothalamic-pituitary centres as a cause of the variations in multiple conceptions is discussed. The incidence of multiple conceptions has decreased since the beginning of the 19th century independant of the progress in obstetrics and perinatology. The decreased rate of multiparas and especially older multiparas is suggested as the likely cause for this decrease.

AB  - Mating initiates a pattern of prolactin secretion composed of daily surges which appear with semicircadian rhymicity until Day 8 (Day 0=Day of plug detection) of mouse gestation. On Day 8, the diurnal (1500-2100 h) prolactin increase diminishes in magnitude in a line selected for high embryo survival (E). By Day 9, the diurnal surge has been terminated. The noctural prolactin surge (2400-0900 h) is present in the line E through Day 9 of pregnancy, but on Day 10 it disappears. The temporal pattern of prolactin secretion in a randomly bred control line (C) is similar on Days 2 and 4 of pregnancy to that observed in line E. Collection of head blood and/or trunk blood had no effect on plasma prolactin concentration in either line C or E if no more than 30 seconds elapsed between cage handling and sample collection. In contrast, prolactin levels were dramatically elevated in the blood of animals placed in the same room in which serial exsanguination was performed.

AB  - ABSTRACT. A double‐blind study of 18 children aged 6–12 years suffering from primary nocturnal enuresis without signs of underlying organic disease is reported. 20 μg of DDAVP (desamino‐d‐arginine vasopressin, Minirin®) was given intranasally at bedtime. The effect was prompt and satisfactory in 8 children and relatively good in another 8 children. No adverse effects were noted. DDAVP is advocated for temporary use in children with nocturnal enuresis needing immediate help. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Twentyone young female patients are described who presented with amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea or infertility, and were treated by 90y pituitary implantation of 20 000 rads. there was no morbidity. in all patients serum prolactin values were elevated and radiographs of the pituitary fossa were abnormal. observations are available for 1-76 months (mean 27) after implantation. the median fall in prolactin values was 60 per cent while there was no deterioration in pituitary function if normal pre-operatively. luteinizing hormone values, both basally and following gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, rose to normal after operation; several instances of sellar remodelling were observed radlologically, and no instance of relapse was found radiologically, biochemically or clinically. thirteen patients desiring fertility have been observed since implantation; so far nine have become pregnant, in three instances without any additional therapy; since four patients became pregnant twice, a total of 13 pregnancies have occurred. no case of tumour expansion was observed during pregnancy. 90y implantation can be considered as a therapeutic procedure in young female patients requiring fertility which is competitive with surgical methods, and together with a short course of bromocriptine if needed, could prove to be the treatment of choice. © 1978, Oxford University Press.

AB  - Plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) levels were measured every 30 or 60 minutes over 24 hours in normal subjects and in unipolar and bipolar depressed patients. A circadian rhythm characterized by the occurrence in the mid afternoon hours of a single peak of magnitude between 13 % and 39 % of the mean level was detected in all normal subjects. In depressed patients, significant episodic variations were frequent and the mid afternoon elevation no longer appeared as the sole major event in the 24-hour variation. To quantify these alterations, two indices, to be computed from the data, have been introduced. The Difference between the Coefficients of Variation (DCV) of the first half (8 A.M. to 8 P.M.) and the second half (8 P.M. to 8 A.M.) of the pattern characterizes the relative importance of the mid afternoon elevation whereas the Percentage of Low Frequencies (PLF) is a measure of the Variability of the pattern about its mean level. Deviations from normal were generally more important in bipolar than in unipolar patients but they did not correlate with the severity of the mood alterations. The PLF index allowed a discrimination between groups of unipolars and bipolars. Alterations of the 24-hour DBH pattern, quantified by DCV and PLF indices, could provide an objective biological indicator of endogenous depression. © 1978.

AB  - A positive correlation between the number of preejaculatory intromissions that a female receives during copulation and the probability of successful pregnancy has been demonstrated previously. In the present investigation the nocturnal secretion of prolactin (PRL) was followed for 4 days after mating in female rats receiving either 3-5 intromissions before ejaculation (low intromission group) or 15-18 intromissions (high intromission group). Nightly PRL surges occurred in most of the females ( 9 12) in the high intromission group and the same 9 females became pregnant. Only 2 9 females in the low intromission group exhibited nightly PRL surges and again only these 2 females became pregnant. This study demonstrates that the stimulation which the female receives from multiple intromissions during mating is effective in setting off nightly PRL surges. We propose that the so-called pregnancy-inducing neuroendocrine reflex which is triggered in this manner is expressed in a characteristic pattern of nightly surges of prolactin, the hormone known to be essential for the activation of the corpora lutea and their secretion of progesterone. © 1978.

AB  - A specific and sensitive homologous RIA for ovine placental lactogen (oPL) has been developed. The assay is specific for oPL in that ovine pituitary PRL (oPRL), GH (oGH), and other pituitary hormones, as well as rat, caprine, bovine, monkey, and human PLs exhibit no cross-reaction in the assay. The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay is 1.0 ng/ml. In uterine vein samples oPL was measurable after day 40 of gestation and in peripheral sera after day 48 (3.5 ± 1.9 ng/ml). Peripheral plasma oPL concentrations reached peak levels by day 131–141 (649 ± 205–565 ± 347 ng/ml), then began to decline approximately 5 days before parturition and disappeared rapidly after delivery. No significant circadian variation in serum oPL concentrations was found during a 4-day period of sampling from day 120–125 of gestation. Fetal serum oPL levels ranged from 24–150 ng/ml throughout pregnancy. oPL was measurable in fetal membranes as early as day 20–30 (0.21 ± 0.06 μg/g wet wt), whereas the concentration in maternal caruncles at this time was 0.1 ± 0.06 μg/g wet wt. In the placentomes, peak concentrations occurred around day 101–130. Peak concentrations of oPL in allantoic fluid were found between day 35–50, with detectable levels as early as day 18. In amniotic fluid, oPL was measurable between day 40–50. Concentrations of oPL in urine from the pregnant ewe never exceeded 5 ng/ml. © 1978 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Plasma unconjugated oestriol (E3) concentrations were determined by radio‐immunoassay in 10 normal subjects in late pregnancy, throughout a normal day and night, and after a 50 g oral glucose load. There was a circadian pattern in E2 concentration characterized by an abrupt increase of 15 per cent at night. There was no significant rhythm during the day or night, taken separately. However there was a 10 to 11 per cent reduction in E3 concentrations soon after some meals and after a glucose load, possibly due to expansion of the plasma volume. Excluding the effect of meals, the fluctuation of E3 concentrations in individuals (median of the coefficients of variation) was 11 5 per cent in the day. Overall, it was 13·2 per cent in the day, 12·1 per cent at night and 15·9 per cent over the whole period studied. Since the variation in plasma unconjugated E3 concentrations through 24 hours was no greater than random fluctuations or day‐to‐day variation there is no need to restrict the time of blood sampling in clinical practice.

AB  - Simultaneous measurement of serum concentrations of estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and progesterone were carried out in multiple serial blood samples obtained during the last 3-10 weeks of pregnancy, labor, and the immediate postpartum period in 5 normal women. Estrogen and progesterone levels showed a small, but statistically significant diurnal variation during pregnancy. They did not change during labor; however, with the exception of E1 levels, all declined following delivery. Individual patterns preceding labor, derived from calculated moving mean values, showed no consistent decline in progesterone levels nor a surge in E1 and E2 concentrations whereas estriol levels showed a steady rise starting 14-28 days prior to the onset of labor. Whether this E3 elevation reflects fetal maturation and/or plays a role in the triggering mechanism of labor is unknown. Failure to detect changes in E1, E2, and progesterone levels in the maternal peripheral circulation does not preclude the possibility that alterations of metabolism of these hormones in the fetal or uterine compartments might be involved in the initiation of human labor. © 1978 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - To assess prognostic factors the author has analysed the clinical data on 127 patients, subjected to three variants of the treatment (chemotherapy - in 72, surgery + chemotherapy - in 34, surgery + chemotherapy + radiotherapy - in 21). The following factors have been examined: patient's age, duration of the affection symptoms in relation to their pregnancy prior to the disease, issues of pregnancy preceding the disease, the size of the primary focus (the uterus), the degree of the process spread, the height of the chorionic gonadotropin level in diurnal urine before the treatment, the method of initial therapy. Based on the data obtained, it was demonstrated that besides the tumor morphological structure and the extent of the process spread the results of the treatment are influenced by a sum of clinical signs of the disease, which should be taken into account in selecting an optimum method of treatment and in prognosis.

AB  - Blood ethanol levels, caloric intake and weight gain were monitored over the 21-day gestational period in the gravid Sprague-Dawley rat as a function of the administration of ethanol in either a liquid diet (Ensure) or an aqueous saccharin solution. The mean daily percentage of ethanol consumed (38% vs 31%), and g/Kg of ethanol consumed (11.9 vs 9.7 g/Kg) were higher for the liquid diet group than the aqueous solution group. Ethanol consumption varied by the trimester in the Ensure but not in the saccharin solution rats. Proportional maternal weight gain, live little size, and live litter weight did not vary as a function of the method of ethanol administration. Both groups exhibited significant diurnal periodicity in ethanol consumption, and the greatest caloric intake during the second trimester. The implications of these results for ethanol administration in gravid rats is discussed. © 1978.

AB  - EEG, vascular-vegetative tension, metabolism of biogenic amines and psychopathological state were studied in patients with depressive syndrome before and after a single injection of aminasine. These indexes are of the same direction in patients with endogenous (circulatory) depression independent of their age. Most patients with psychogenic depression are characterized by a desynchonized EEG and progressive sympathicotonia of the vegetative system with an absence of changes in the vascular tension and catecholamine metabolism. In patients with the presenile (involutional) depression, there was no correlation of the studied indexes. The anxious phenomena with synchronized EEG, normal and lowered vascular tension and sharply decreased excretion of catecholamines are typical of them. Injection of aminasine to patients with endogenous depression either has no effect or intensifies the negative sign of the affection. In psychogenic depression, aminasine causes relaxation or disappearance of the symptoms. With presenile depression aminasine injection evokes a pronounced vagotonic and paradoxic sympathicotonic reaction and a worsening of the condition.

AB  - Plasma levels of progesterone (P), oestradiol (OE2), unconjugated oestriol (OE3) and total OE3 were measured in blood samples taken from patients with fetal growth retardation, pre‐eclampsia and other complications of pregnancy. The levels were compared with the 24‐hour urinary excretion levels of total oestrogen (OE) in these patients, and with the plasma levels found in 31 normal pregnant patients from whom blood samples were taken serially from 21 weeks gestation onwards. There was good correlation between plasma unconjugated and total OE, levels, and urinary OE levels (r = 0.77). In 12 patients with fetal growth retardation and no other abnormality, levels of all hormones were significantly lower than normal; unconjugated OE3, total OE3, and urinary OE levels were significantly less than 1 SD below the normal mean. In 22 patients with mild or moderate pre‐eclampsia who were delivered of normal birth weight infants none of the hormone levels were significantly different from normal. In 12 patients with mild or moderate pre‐eclampsia in association with fetal growth retardation OE2, unconjugated OE3 and urinary OE levels were significantly lower than normal, and total OE3 levels were significantly less than 1 SD below the normal mean. In 12 patients with severe pre‐eclampsia, OE2, levels were significantly less than 1 SD below the normal mean and unconjugated OE3, total OE3, and urinary OE levels were significantly less than 2 SD below the normal mean. In studies of diurnal and day‐to‐day variation the coefficients of variation for P were respectively 12.7 per cent and 14.2 per cent, for OE2, 11 per cent and 12.7 per cent, for unconjugated OE3, 15.6 per cent and 14.1 per cent, and for total OE3, 15 per cent and 15.8 per cent. It was concluded that measurements of plasma total OE, and urinary OE were probably of comparable value and that the plasma estimation had much to commend it. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Fetal adrenal function in utero was studied in chronically catheterized rhesus monkey fetuses (129–154 days gestational age). Measurements of fetal pH, pCO2, pO2, heart rate, and fetal and maternal blood pressure were normal by 24 h after surgery. Maternal cortisol levels were 484.6 ± 60.7 ng/ml (mean ± SE) after surgery, decreasing to 300 ± 26.9 and 227.8 ± 30.6 ng/ml by the second and third day after surgery and stabilizing thereafter. No consistent pattern in fetal cortisol was seen after surgery. A significant increase in fetal concentration was observed between 145 and 149 and 150 and 154 days' gestation (87.9 ± 9.3 and 123.8 ± 20.0 ng/ml, respectively). A significant diurnal variation of cortisol levels was found in the fetal, but not maternal, circulation (fetal levels: AM, 167 ± 13.4 ng/ml, PM, 115 ± 8.9 ng/ml; maternal levels: AM, 326 ± 18.8 ng/ml, PM, 319 ± 38.5 ng/ml). Seven fetuses were challenged with bolus injections of 0.5 IU ACTH. An increase in circulating cortisol levels in response to ACTH was seen in only two of the fetuses. Dexamethasone (8 mg/day) was administered in four pregnancies. Fetal ACTH decreased from a baseline of 55.8 ± 14.5 to 30.5 ±4.1 and 17.9 ± 4.5 pg/ml 24 and 48 h after starting the dexamethasone infusion. Basal cortisol levels were 78.5 ± 8.7 ng/ml and decreased to 16.4 ± 2.8 and 12.3 ±1.6 ng/ml at 24 and 48 h, respectively, after dexamethasone. Both ACTH and cortisol values returned to pretreatment levels after cessation of treatment. These data are interpreted as indicating that fetal adrenal function is regulated by the fetal pituitary. However, the limited response of the fetal adrenal in situ to exogenous ACTH suggests a decreased responsiveness of the gland in utero. © 1978 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Human embryonic neutrophils (N) in the liver (from 8.5 mm crown‐rump length) are alkaline phosphatase (AP) negative during the first trimester of pregnancy. Early bone marrow granulocytes (from eleventh to sixteenth weeks of gestation) behave similarly. Only a small percentage of slightly AP positive cells could be found. Occasional cells with strong NAP reaction appear in the second trimester. NAP positivity greatly increases in the third trimester and term‐babies have a somewhat higher than normal NAP activity in circulating blood. Unlike NAP reaction, naphthol‐AS‐D‐chloroacetate esterase and peroxidase reactions are positive even in the earliest (AP negative) neutrophils. Copyright © 1978 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

AB  - The present study investigates the timing of cessation of nocturnal prolactin (PRL) surges in rats with various lengths of delay in implantation. In order to manipulate the timing of implantation, female rats were mated during the post-partum estrus and allowed to nurse their pups for varying intervals. In Exp 1, mothers were separated from their pups either on day 0 (the day on which sperm was found in the vaginal smear), or on day 5, 7, or 9, which resulted in implantation on day 5, 7, 9, or 11, respectively. In Exp 2, mothers remained with their pups, and those mothers in which spontaneous implantation occurred after day 11 were used. To determine the exact time at which the hypophysis ceases secreting nocturnal prolactin surges, blood samples were taken via a chronic intracardiac cannula twice daily at 0200 and 0400 h for six consecutive days. When implantation occurred on day 5 of lactational pregnancy, the last nocturnal PRL surges occurred on day 10, as in normal pregnancy. In the groups in which implantation occurred after day 5 the nocturnal PRL surges terminated 5 days after implantation. In Exp 3, hypophysectomy was performed on the day of the last nocturnal PRL surge or on the following day in three groups of females corresponding to the last three groups in Exp 1. The first day on which the pituitary could be removed without causing abortion was, in each case, the first day on which the nocturnal PRL surge was absent. Thus, the strong correlation between the timing of implantation and the termination of pituitary PRL surges suggests that at a constant interval after implantation, rat placental lactogen levels are sufficiently high to inhibit PRL secretion by the pituitary. © 1978 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Prolactin is secreted by cells in the anterior pituitary gland that are sensitive to inhibiting and stimulating factors coming from the hypothalamus. Dopamine depressed the secretion of prolactin by direct action and perhaps also by stimulating an inhibiting hypothalamic factor which has not yet been isolated. Thyroid releasing hormone and serotonine exert a stimulating action although their pathways are different. The hypothesis that there is a releasing agent for prolactin which is sensitive to serotonine has been put forward but has not been demonstrated. There are many pharmacological or physiological agents that can interfere by activating or depressing the two dopaminergic and serotoninergic pathways that are implicated in the control of prolactin secretion. This last is further stimulated by oestrogens and inhibited by thyroid hormones. Plasma prolactin levels fluctuate physiologically in relationship to sleep (nyctohemeral cycle), with the level of oestrogens (menstrual cycle, pregancy, fetal wellbeing) and with stress. Prolactin has an action on the breasts, which is not clear-cut, and a lactotropic effect when acting together with other hormones. In excess it inhibits ovulation by a mechanism that is not yet properly established and which may be ovarian or possibly hypothalamic. Its role in the control of the activity of the corpus luteum is not yet worked out. Other effects on Leydig cells, on the adrenals and on glucide metabolism have also been postulated. Investigation of prolactin secretion requires the estimation of base levels which should be repeated in the morning when the hormone is at its lowest concentration in the plasma. The analysis of the nyctohemeral cycle is the method of choice, which is limited by the practical difficulties in carrying it out. Tests of stimulation or of inhibition are of physiopathological interest but so far are unable to differentiate hyperprolactinaemia due to tumours.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify and quantify fetal and maternal heart rate (FHR, MHR) periodicities and to examine their interrelation as well as the relation of fetal cycles with the maternal REM-NREM sleep cycle. Heart rate periodicities of the same subjects after birth were correlated with the neonatal REM-NREM sleep cycle. Sixteen all-night polygraphic recordings were obtained during the last trimester of pregnancy and the 1st week of life in seven subjects. Abdominal leads were used to obtain continuous fetal heart rates. Maternal and infant sleep states were scored according to standard criteria. Minute-by-minute values for maternal, fetal, and neonatal heart rates were analyzed on a PDP-12 computer and subjected to time series analyses including auto spectral techniques and complex demodulation. Period lengths of less than 1 h, between 1 and 2 h, and even longer were present in the tracings of mother, fetus, and neonate. Predictable interaction between maternal and fetal heart rate periodicities could not be established. None of the fetal rhythms bore a consistent relationship with the maternal REM-NREM sleep cycles. Maternal sleep onset or the first sleep cycle was accompanied by an increase in fetal heart rate lasting between 10 and 20 min in six of the nine recordings. Fetal heart rate cycles between 1 and 2 hr are probably early manifestations of the neonatal REM-NREM sleep cycle. The transient rise in fetal heart rate could be an adaptive response to either the fall in blood pressure or the shift in acid-base balance upon maternal sleep onset to which the fetus habituates within a short time. © 1978.

AB  - Periodic sleep apnea, a chronic sleep deprivation state, in which marked changes in the arterial PO2 and PCO2 tensions have been recorded, is a relatively new syndrome not previously reported in pregnancy. It is characterized by episodes of apnea, prevalently obstructive, during sleep. The majority of patients with this syndrome have snored heavily for years, suggesting a causal relationship between snoring and periodic sleep apnea. The effects of prolonged snoring on alveolar ventilation and systemic pressure(s) suggest that this snoring has physiopathological implications on maternal cardio-respiratory reserve and indirectly upon the fetus, especially as there are recordable changes in fetal heart rate and also a change in the acid-base status of the fetus. The possibility that this syndrome may have an adverse effect upon the fetus is stressed. © 1978.

AB  - Clinical responses to peppermint odor were observed in 100 healthy term and preterm infants during active sleep on two successive days. Thirty-six asphyxiated term infants and three infants with holoprosencephaly also were tested. Olfactory reflexes were regularly elicited in normal infants after 32 weeks' gestation, but some premature infants as young as 28 weeks also responded. Responses included initiation of sucking and arousal-withdrawal. Habituation occurred after two or three trials. A Moro response was seen only in a few asphyxiated infants; loss of olfactory reflexes appeared to parallel suppression of brainstem reflexes. Olfactory reflexes are useful in excluding cerebral malformations associated with agenesis of the olfactory bulbs. © 1978 The C. V. Mosby Company.

AB  - Summary: The aetiology of the sudden infant death syndrome: Current ideas on breathing and sleep and possible links to deranged thiamine Neurochemistry. The sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is now the commonest cause of death between one week and one year of age in most western countries. An asphyxia/ death, with unrecognised hypoxic episodes during sleep in the preceding weeks, has been postulated from autopsy evidence for both acute and chronic hypoxia; the evidence includes Po2 values, intra‐thoracic distribution of petechiae, pulmonary arteriolar and right ventricular hypertrophy. Long‐term monitoring of infants resuscitated from a “near miss” SIDS demonstrates sleep apnoea, sometimes associated with episodic collapse and obstruction of the upper airway. Physiological studies in healthy babies and animals highlight factors leading to vulnerability to asphyxia in different phases of sleep. In REM‐sleep (rapid‐eye‐movement), inhibition of intercostal muscle activity leads to: inspiratory collapse of the rib‐cage, impaired reflex compensation for airway obstruction, overall lung‐deflation with reduction of O2‐stores and rapid hypoxaemia during apnoea. In REM‐sleep, breathing efforts are not augmented by hypercapnia and the defense against asphyxia depends on reflex responses to hypoxia. Sleep apnoea sometimes occurs in infants with a rare congenital defect of brain thiamine triphosphate. This draws attention to many similarities of modern SIDS and other infantile syndromes reported historically which involve deranged thiamine neurochemistry. Sudden unexpected deaths occur in apparently thriving infants of asymptomatic thiamine deficient mothers. Other similarities include: a peak incidence at 2–4 months of age; precipitation often by minor febrile episodes; seasonal and familial risk factors, with increased risk in twins; many common findings at autopsy. Although asymptomatic maternal thiamine deficiency is common in western communities ingesting high carbohydrate diets containing various thiamine antagonists, the effect on infant thiamine stores has received little attention. Future research is needed to evaluate SIDS incidence after identification and elimination of low thiamine states. Defective neural control of breathing during sleep should be evaluated in relation to thiamine‐neurochemistry, particularly to the leaky blood‐brain barrier, to glutamate and GAB A, to sympathetic denervation and to defective vagal reflexes of the lungs and larynx.

AB  - Five infants born of mothers maintained on methadone HCl (20 to 70 mg daily) were studied at intervals during the first 2 mth of life. One of the children was born prematurely after a 36 wk gestation; the birth weight was 2.36 kg. The remaining 4 were term infants. Their average birth weight was 3.28 kg and the weights ranged from 2.89 to 3.93 kg. Ventilatory response to carbon dioxide inhalation was determined with the use of a steady state technique while the infants were in natural quiet sleep. The slope of the carbon dioxide response curve was markedly below normal on the first day of life and did not reach the normal range for an average of 21.5 days. The decreased sensitivity to carbon dioxide persisted beyond the time when methadone could be detected in serum by a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay. The elimination half life of methadone in serum, determined in 4 of the infants, averaged 51 hr and ranged from 25 to 69 hr. The decreased ventilatory response to carbon dioxide may contribute to the increased incidence of sudden death which has been reported in infants born of mothers maintained on methadone.

AB  - The past decade has seen the end of the debate over the existence of spontaneous fetal breathing movements under normal conditions. Episodes of rapid, shallow breathing activity occur normally, but are absent during electrocortical activity associated with quiet sleep and are suppressed by acute hypoxia and by a variety of drugs and external stimuli. The activation of fetal breathing occurs mainly during rapid eye movement sleep, but the physiologic control of the activation has not been identified. Abnormal conditions preceding fetal death may be associated with decreases in normal breathing activity, prolonged apnea, intermittent gasping, rapid episodic breathing with diminished variability, and continuous breathing or gasping. Positive identification of these abnormal patterns requires prolonged periods of observation and accurate recording of the incidence, rate, and variability of breathing movements. These requirements are met readily in studies of animals with implanted recording devices, but for human observations the available ultrasonic systems using external transducers have important theoretical and practical drawbacks. The technical problems of recording breathing movements in utero by external methods appear to less formidable than the biologic problems of ascertaining how the movements are controlled.

AB  - Thirty-three women with PRL secreting pituitary adenomas were studied before, during, and after trans-sphenoidal removal of the tumor. Based on neuroradiological evaluation, 2 groups were separated. Group I patients, (18 cases) were characterized by: 1) adenoma confined to the sella turcica; 2) basal plasma PRL concentration of 175 ± 51 ng/ml (mean ± SE); 3) abnormal plasma 24-h PRL profile in contrast to a clear nocturnal rise of GH; 4) variable modifications of plasma PRL under provocative tests; and 5) no pituitary deficiency observed. Group II patients (15 cases) were characterized by: 1) tumor invasion of surrounding structures; 2) basal plasma PRL concentration of 898 ± 441 ng/ml; 3) no nocturnal rise of PRL plasma levels, whereas GH levels increased at the onset of sleep in only 3 of 8 patients; and 4) decrease of somatotropic function in 3 cases and gonadotropic deficiency in 3 other cases. Peri-operative estimation of PRL plasma levels showed a fast return to normal levels in group I patients (13 ± 2 ng/ml) 2 h after surgery. A 50% decrease of pre-operative PRL levels was obtained in group II patients in the same conditions. In all group I patients, an ovulatory cycle was observed 36 ± 5 days after surgery and PRL plasma levels were 9.6 ± 1.2 ng/ml 3-12 months after surgery. Nine group I patients became pregnant, among which 5 were followed-up during pregnancy and lactation. No abnormalities were observed during these periods. Among the 9 remaining patients, the 24-h PRL profiles were normal and, in particular, a clear nocturnal rise was observed in 4 patients. PRL response was normal after bromocriptine suppression and TRH stimulation in 7 of the group I patients explored. No pituitary deficiency was noted in any group I patients. In all group II patients, bromocriptine treatment was necessary to reduce PRL plasma concentration to normal levels. The reported data on circumscribed PRL secreting adenomas emphasize the intrapituitary localization of such tumors. Moreover, the elevated plasma PRL levels immediately fell after selective removal of the adenoma. Post-operative follow-up established the absence of any abnormality in the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis. © 1978 by The Endocrine Society.

This is part of a study of evolving neurointegrative disorders that may be associated with a genetic risk for schizophrenia. Transiently decreased vestibular responses coincided with several developmental disorders that were related to psychopathology at 10 years. Absent to decreased responses were associated with (1) a “pandevelopmental retardation” involving physical growth as well as postural-motor and visualmotor development, (2) an “abnormally quiet,” state in the first month, and (3) failures of bimanual integration between 4 and 6 months. The transitory nature of the decreased nystagmus rules out the possibility of an organic lesion of the vestibular system. Rather, it suggests that some covert decrease in arousal accompanied those periods when central nervous system integration was disrupted. © 1978, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Postpartum depression is a common and very important order with implications for the mother-child relationship and maternal adaptation. Postpartum depression is not a discrete and circumscribed entity, but a symptom of an underlying preexistent disturbance. In the case described, the patient was a depressive character with masked depression before and between the acute postpartum depressions, and with related symptoms of appetite and sleep disturbance and addictive tendencies. While constitutional and somatic factors were doubtless involved, the case illustrates the importance of psychogenesis with depressive predisposition. Reconstruction is a valuable therapeutic tool, but is also valuable in the testing and integration of new data and theory. Analytic reconstruction uncovered the presence of a preoedipal depressive configuration which developed during the period just before and after her sibling's birth when she was 2 yrs old. The reconstruction highlighted the role of this persistent infantile depressive configuration and predisposition, crystallizing during the anal phase and rapprochement subphase of separation-individuation. An intense negative ambivalence and depressive basic mood developed, associated with oral regression. Developmental and analytic data also indicated significant oral fixation and oral-phase disorder. These formulations are consistent with classical psychoanalytic contributions to the theory of depression. The data articulate with and are illuminated by contemporary analytic theory, and point to the role of preoedipal influences on the oedipus complex, as well as superego and character formation. As anticipated by Freud and A. Freud, the utilization of both analytic and developmental data obtained from direct infant observation potentiates the investigation of early development and pathogenesis.

AB  - The rate of transplacental passage of diazepam (DZ) has been studied in 33 cases of cephalic presentation where operative forceps delivery was indicated by intrauterine hypoxia or by prolonged second stage of labor. The drug (30 mg) was injected intravenously immediately before delivery either during uterine contractions (Group 1) or in the relaxation period (Group II) according to a randomized protocol. As judged by the concentration in the newborn and the child/mother concentration ratio at 2 hr after delivery, and the concentration on the second day, the fetal exposure to the drug was probably less when the injection was timed to coincide with uterine contractions. In the group of patients given the drug in the relaxation period, the injection-delivery (I-D) interval was up to 305 sec, and the 2-hr child/mother concentration ratio was close to unity in some cases. It therefore appears that the transplacental passage of DZ is rapid when the high initial concentrations in the maternal circulation coincide with favorable conditions for transfer in the relaxation period. Although sleep was induced by the injection of DZ in all of the mothers, the amounts of drug transferred during the short I-D intervals in the present study did not exert deleterious effects on the newborn infants. © 1978.

AB  - An association was found in a sample of 59 healthy middle‐class first‐born babies between regular night‐waking at one year old and pre‐ and perinatal events. The findings closely resemble those reported by Bernal (1973). The only measure of parental behaviour discriminating night wakers from regular sleepers was that mothers of wakers responded more rapidly to crying during daytime observations. However, this was shown to be a difference related to the child's obstetric history and the persistence of crying, and not directly to night waking. Rapid response to crying, and night waking itself, seem to be separate outcomes of a sub‐optimal obstetric history. The evidence is that no aspect of parental behaviour yet examined produces night‐waking children. Associations entre facteurs périnataux et réveil nocturne ultérieur Il a été trouvé un lien chez un échantillon de 59 nourrissons, premier‐né, en bonne santé, appartenant à la classe moyenne entre le réveil nocturne régulier à l'âge d'un an et les manifestations pré et péri‐natales. Les données correspondent étroitement à celles qui ont été rapportées par Bernal (1973). Une seule mesure de comportement parental différenciait les sujets se réveillant des dormeurs réguliers: les mères des nourrissons se réveillant répondaient plus rapidement aux pleurs durant les observations de jour. Cependant, cette attitude s'est révélée une différence liée à l'histoire obstétricale de l'enfant et à la persistance de ses pleurs, non directement au réveil nocturne. Une réponse rapide aux pleurs et le reveil nocturne paraissent des conséquences indépendantes d'une anamnèse obstétricale suboptimale. Il semble done qu'aucun aspect du comportement parental examiné jusqu'à ce jour n'influence le réveil nocturne des enfants. Die Beziehung zwischen perinataler Anamnese und späteren nächtlichen Aufwachens Bei einer Gruppe von 59 gesunden erstgeborenen Kindern aus der Mittelklasse wurde eine Beziehung zwischen regelmässigen nächtlichen Aufwachens im Alter von einem Jahr und prae‐ und perinatalen Faktoren gefunden. Die Befunde entsprechen fast denen von Bernal (1973). Nur in einem Punkt elterlichen Verhaltens wurden die Kinder, die nachts aufwachen, von denen, die nachts durchschlafen, unterschieden—die Mütter der Aufwachkinder reagierten sehr viel schneller auf das Schreien während der Beobachtungen am Tage. Jedoch zeigte sich, dass dieser Unterschied mit der geburtshilflichen Anamnese des Kindes und mit der Dauer seines Schreiens zusammenhing und nicht direkt mit dem nächtlichen Aufwachen. Rasche Reaktion auf Schreien und nächtliches Aufwachen scheinen unabhängige Ergebnisse einer nicht normalen geburtshilflichen Anamnese zu sein. Es wurde gefunden, dass keine bisher untersuchte Verhaltensweise von Eltern Kinder zum nächtlichen Aufwachen veranlasst. Asociación entre factores perinatales e incontinencia nocturna posterior Se halló una asociación en una muestra de 59 lactantes sanos de clase media primerizos entre el despertar nocturno regular al año de edad y los acontecimientos pre y perinatales. Los hallazgos son muy semejantes a los hallados por Bernal (1973). Sólo un dato en el comportamiento de los padres discriminaba los que se despertaban durante la noche de los que dormían regularmente: Las madres de los que se despertaban respondían más rapidamente al Ilanto durante las observaciones hechas durante el dia. Sin embargo se vió que esta diferencia estaba en relación con la historia obstétrica del niño y la persistencia de su Ilanto y no directamente con su despertar nocturno. La respuesta rápida al Ilanto y el despertar nocturno parece que son dos acontecimientos separados de una historia obstétrica sub‐óptima. Se evidencia que ningún aspecto del comportamiento de los padres examinados produce el despertar nocturno de los niños. © 1978 Mac Keith Press

AB  - 159 first‐born infants and their mothers were studied at birth, two months, and again at the age of 18 months. Only 23 children had been completely healthy since birth. Upper respiratory infections were the most common problem, occurring in 70 children; seven children had had more than four attacks. Antibiotics had been prescribed by the family doctor for 77 children on 153 occasions; 12 children had had four or more courses. There was a significant trend showing a positive association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the frequency of ears, nose, throat and respiratory illnesses in the children during the first 18 months after birth. Teething was said to cause considerable or severe upset in 47 children. 39 children were waking their parents most nights or more than once a night at the age of 18 months, and 34 children cried or screamed when they were put to bed. 39 children had been given sedatives at some time since birth. The exhibition of temper tantrums two or three times a week seems to be about the norm for children of this age. No association was found between sleeping problems and temper tantrums, and their incidence was not related to the child's developmental status or social class. Neither the incidence and severity of the problems encountered, nor the number of illnesses the child had had since birth, bore any relationship to these mothers' plans for a subsequent pregnancy. L'enfant premier‐né: problèmes d'avant la marche assurée 159 nourrissons premier‐nés et leurs mères ont été examinés à la naissance, à deux mois et de nouveau à l'âge de 18 mois. Parmi eux, 23 enfantes seulement ont été tout à fait en bonne santé depuis le naissance. Les infections des voies aériennes supérieures ont été le problème le plus commun survenant chez 70 des nourrissons. Sept enfants ont eu plus de quatre épisodes. Les antibiotiques ont été prescrits par le médecin de famille pour 77 enfants à 153 occasions; 12 enfants ont reçu quatre traitements ou plus. Il y a une tendance significative révélant une association entre l'usage du tabac chez la mère durant la grossesse et la fréquence des affections des oreilles, du nez, de la gorge et du système respiratoire des nourrissons durant les 18 premiers mois après la naissance. Les percées dentaires ont été dites, provoquant des perturbations considérables ou sérieuses chez 47 enfants. 39 enfants réveillaient leurs parents la plupart des nuits ou plus qu'une fois au cours de la nuit à l'âge de 18 mois et 34 enfants pleuraient ou criaient lorsqu'ils étaient mis au lit. 39 enfants ont reçu des calmants à un moment donné depuis la naissance. Les manifestations de colère, deux ou trois fois la semaine, semblent âtre la norme pour des nourrissons de cet âge. Aucune association n'a été trouvée entre les difficultés du sommeil et les crises de colère. Leur survenue n'est pas liée à l'allure du développement de l'enfant ou à la classe sociale. La survenue et la gravité des problèmes rencontrés, le nombre d'affections présentées par l'enfant depuis la naissance ne sont pas liés aux projets de la mère concernant une grossesse ultérieure. Das erstgeborene Kind: Krabbler Probleme 159 erstgeborene Kinder und deren Mütter wurden bei Geburt, nach zwei Monaten und ein drittes Mal im Alter von 1.5 Jahren untersucht. Seit der Geburt waren nur 23 Kinder vollständig gesund gewesen. Infektionen des oberen Respirationstraktes waren am häufigsten und traten bei 70 Kindern auf. Sieben Kinder waren mehr als viermal daran erkrankt. Antibiotika waren durch den Hausarzt 77 Kindern bei 153 Gelegenheiten verschrieben worden. 12 Kinder hatter viermal oder häufiger eine antibiotische Behandlung bekommen. Es bestand eine deutliche Tendenz zu einer positiven Korrelation zwischen Rauchen der Mütter während der Schwangerschaft und der Häufigkeit von Ohr‐, Nasen‐, Rachen‐ und Respirations‐trakt‐Erkrankungen bei den Kindern während der ersten 18 Lebensmonate. Nach Aussagen der Mütter verursachte das Zahnen häufig ernste Probleme bei 47 Kindern. 39 Kinder weckten fast jede Nacht oder mehr als einmal pro Nacht ihre Eltern im Alter von 18 Monaten auf. 34 Kinder schrien oder weinten, wenn sie zu Bett gebracht wurden. 39 Kinder hatten gelegentliche Sedativa bekommen. Das Auftreten von zwei bis drei Wutanfällen pro Woche scheint fur Kinder dieser Altersstufe die Norm zu sein. Keine Verbindung bestand zwischen Schlafschwierigkeiten und Wutanfällen, deren Häufigkeit unabhängig vom Entwicklungsstand des Kindes oder seiner sozialen Herkunft waren. Die Haufigkeit und Härte der aufgezählten Probleme wie auch die Anzahl der Erkrankungen der Kinder beeinflussten die Mütter nicht in ihren Wunsch auf eine zweite Schwangerschaft. El niño nacido primero: problemas del niño único 159 niños primerizos y sus madres fueron estudiados en el nacimientos, a los dos mesess y de nuevo a la edad de 18 meses. Solamente 23 niños habían estado completamente sano, desde el nacimiento. Las infecciones del tracto respiratorio alto fueron el problema más corriente, ocurriendo en 70 de todos los niños; 7 niños habían tenido más de cuatro ataques. El médico de la familia había prescrito antibioticos para 77 niños en 153 ocasiones; 12 niños habían tenido cuatro o más tandas. Había una tendencia significativa mostrando una asociación positiva entre el fumar de la madre durante la gestación y la frecuencia de las enfermedades de oido, nariz, garganta y aparato respiratorio en los niños durante los primeros 18 meses después del nacimiento. Se dijo que la dentición era la causa considerable de alteraciones graves en 47 niños. 39 niños despertaban a sus padres la mayoria de las noches o más de una vez durante la noche a la edad de 18 meses, y 34 niños lloraban o gritaban cuando se les ponía en la cama. 39 niños habían recibido sedantes en algún momento después del nacimiento. La exhibición de alteraciones del temperamento dos o tres veces por semana parece que era la norma para estos niños en esta edad. No se halló asociación entre los problemas del sueño y las alteraciones del temperamento, y su incidencia no estaba en relación con el grado de desarrollo del niño o clase social. La incidencia o gravedad de los problemas encontrados y el número de enfermedades que el niño había tenido desde el nacimiento no constituyeron ninguna relación para los planes maternos en vistas a una segunda gestación. © 1978 Mac Keith Press

AB  - Post-natal development of the circadian rhythm of hypothalamic content of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) was examined in male and female rats, separately. CRF activity was estimated by the intrapituitary injection technique. The circadian rhythm of the CRF content observed at the third week was without any noticeable sex difference: both male and female rats began their circadian rhythm with higher values in the afternoon than in the morning. Male rats maintained this pattern up to maturity. In contrast, female rats showed a marked change at ages of fifth to sixth week: the CRF rhythm in female rats changed to a female pattern, with higher values in the morning than in the afternoon. During this period, the vaginal opening occurred concurrently with a marked afternoon rise in the plasma corticosterone, characteristic of mature female rats. On the other hand, no essential difference could be observed between male and female rats in the developmental change in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity. These results indicate that a sex difference in the CRF rhythm is not essentially related to the process of sex differentiation in the central nervous system, but is rather related to changes in ovarian activity following the onset of puberty.

In 3 cases venous samples were taken every second hr over a 24 hr period; in 20 patients venous samples were taken at 2 fixed times. On the basis of 76 samples it is concluded that there is a circadian rhythm of plasma estriol levels in late pregnancy, characterized by higher levels in the early morning.

AB  - In an attempt to understand better the nature of the mechanism timing periovulatory gonadotropin release in hamsters we subjected cycling females to one, two or three consecutive daily injections of phenobarbital. Periovulatory gonadotropin release was delayed 24, 48 or 72 h, respectively. Irrespective of the duration of the delay in hormone release, peak serum LH and FSH levels occurred at nearly the same time of day as those of controls. Although both of the biphasic peaks of serum FSH were delayed by phenobarbital, serum FSH levels increased following the initial injection, plateaued at approximately 25% of peak levels and then declined gradually over the next 2 days. Subsequent pre- and postovulatory FSH release was superimposed on this chronic elevation of serum FSH. Our results support the hypothesis that periovulatory gonadotropin release in golden hamsters is timed by a neural (circadian?) clock.

AB  - The possibility that 24-hour rhythms exist in uterine blood flow (UtBF) and umbilical blood flow (UmBF) was investigated in 5 days postoperative chronically instrumented near-term pregnant sheep acclimated to a controlled environment. UtBF, UmBF and pressure measurements were made at 15-min intervals over 24 hr beginning at 0800 hr. Each data series was examined for the presence of significant rhythms of a 24-hour period using a method of Fourier analysis. UtBF 24-hour rhythms were found in all ewes; UmBF 24-hour rhythms were found in 4 of 5 lambs. A consistent reciprocal phase relationship between UtBF and UmBF was evident within animals. There were no associated rhythms in maternal arterial, fetal arterial or amniotic fluid pressures. The results indicate that the presence of circadian rhythms must be considered as a possible variable when long-term uteroplacental hemodynamic studies are planned.

AB  - Blood pressure was monitored continuously and intra arterially for 24 hours in healthy and pre-eclamptic pregnant women. The monitoring system almost excluded sources of error. The 24-hours-rhythm revealed a blood pressure decrease af about 20 Torr systolically and diastolically between 2.00 a.m. and 5.00 a.m. in normal pregnancy. This decrease after midnight was diminished in mild cases of pre-eclampsia. Hypertensive peaks were present after midnight in severe pre-eclamptic toxemia even under medication. Measuring of the blood pressure in pre-eclamptic patients during nighttime from 0.00 a.m. until 5.00 a.m. seems to be advisable in order to identify unstabilized hypertensive peaks.

AB  - The authors report a continuous-flow fluorometric method for total urinary estrogens that involves the Kober reaction, with extraction of the reaction product into dichloroethane containing trichloroacetic acid as described by Hahnel and Jones [Clin. Chim. Acta 16, 185 (1967)]. The dichloroethane extraction gives greater stability to the Kober color and sharper separation of aqueous and organic phases. The analytical system is adjusted to give maximum response to estriol 16α,β-D-glucuronide, the principal estrogen conjugate in urine from late pregnancy, when calibrated with estriol standards. An initial 20-fold dilution of the sample with water increased analytical recovery of estriol conjugates from urine while maintaining adequate fluorescent response. Glucose interference was reduced by dilution and eliminated by treatment with sodium borohydride. Urinary protein up to 20 g/liter did not interfere. Total estriol, as determined by gas-liquid chromatography, comprises about 70% of total urinary estrogens in late pregnancy as measured by their continuous-flow fluorometric method. A reference range is presented based on 209 randomly collected urine specimens in which total urinary estrogens are expressed as a ratio to creatinine.

AB  - Rat pups suckled by dams fed either a semipurified diet or a commercial rat feed displayed an increase in hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme-A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) [mevalonate:NADP oxidoreductase (acylating CoA) EC1.1.1.34] activity reaching a maximum at 4 days after weaning, after which time activity decreased to a minimal plateau. However, the enzyme level was significantly higher in the group consuming commercial feed. Also, the rats fed the semipurified diet reached their adult level (0.17 nmoles mevalonic acid formed/minute/mg protein) at 35 days of age while the level in the commercial rat feed group did not become constant (0.55 nmoles/minute/mg protein) until 60 days of age. Times of diurnal fluctuations were found to be independent of dietary constituents. There were no differences in growth rate, liver size, liver cholesterol or liver lipids due to the diet variables tested. No inhibitor of the enzyme was found in either the microsomal or 105,000 x g supernatant fractions. Insulin gave a normal response in both dietary groups. Rats fed the semipurified diet until 30 or 40 days of age and then fed the commercial rat feed did not maintain the low level of enzyme activity, but soon achieved the high level of the commercial rat feed group. However, those given the semipurified diet until 60 or 80 days of age and then fed the commercial rat feed for 20 days, maintained the low HMG-CoA reductase activity the entire 20 days. The data support the hypothesis that HMG-CoA reductase perturbation by diet manipulation during development may be long lasting or even permanent.

AB  - Infants of alcoholic mothers showed prominent EEG hypersynchrony in all three stages of sleep: in quiet sleep, indeterminate sleep and active-REM sleep. Spectral analysis of the EEG using fast Fourier transform revealed significant increase in power in most frequency bands in all three stages of sleep in infants born to alcoholic mothers when compared with normal healthy infants matched for gestational age. In quiet sleep 'alcoholic' infants differed from healthy babies by significantly higher power in a wide range of frequency bands (1.5-17.5 Hz) with an average 143% increase of the integrated EEG (1.5-25 Hz). In indeterminate sleep 'alcoholic' infants showed significantly higher power in all analyzed frequency bands (0.1-25 Hz) with an average 196% increase of the integrated EEG (1.5-25 Hz). In active-REM sleep infants of alcoholic mothers showed significantly higher power in the frequency range from 0.1 to 17.5 Hz in comparison with healthy controls. The average increase of the integrated EEG (1.5-25 Hz) was 200%. All healthy term infants showed significantly higher power in most frequency bands during quiet sleep in comparison with active-REM sleep. In infants born to alcoholic mothers this quiet sleep - REM sleep frequency spectrum difference in the majority of cases was nonsignificant mainly due to high values of the EEG power during REM sleep. It is unlikely that the EEG hypersynchrony in infants of alcoholic mothers represents one of the symptoms of the neonatal alcohol-withdrawal syndrome since hypersynchrony has been detected as long as 6 weeks after birth. During this time any withdrawal symptoms would have been dissipated.

AB  - The effects of chronic alcohol ingestion are quantitatively related to intake, but little information is available on the topic. In Part A of this review, intake-effect relationships are examined for chronic dysfunctions of the liver, pancreas, cardiovascular system, testis and fetus. Part B considers central nervous system effects such as the withdrawal syndrome, psychosis, brain damage, memory loss, alterations of attention, sleep disturbances and EEG changes. Alcohol and the elderly, evidence of favorable effects of alcohol and the question of alcoholism are also discussed. In the vast majority of studies the documented daily intake levels have been over 150 g of ethanol (the equivalent of one pint of 80-proof spirits), often in the range of 250-300 g. Other potential risk factors such as malnutrition are rarely considered, and little information is available on the effects of more moderate daily intake. The liver emerges as the most vulnerable organ to regular alcohol use with the hazardous range beginning at a daily intake of 80-100 g of ethanol. There is some evidence of beneficial effects, especially in the elderly, of daily intakes of 15-30 g and epidemiological evidence of a lower incidence of myocardial infarction in those with a daily intake approximating 56 g. More information is needed on chronic intake-effect relationships, particularly at levels below 150 g.

AB  - The problems involved in EEG recordings in the premature child, electrogenesis, and the symptomatology of the graph in relation to gestational age are analysed in the light of the usefulness and importance of electrical activity in appraising degree of prematurity. As for the prognostic significance of the premature child EEG, it is extremely difficult to lay down precise limits within which such a graph can be considered normal. A number of EEG pictures also exist to which a serious prognostic significance is attributed: the inactive graph, the graph with positive Rolandic spikes, and the graph with figures of epileptic type. Particular stress is laid on the seriousness of the epileptic EEG picture to which correspond clonic, tonic or rarely tonicoclonic or atypical attacks, or the absence of any motor sign in premature children in deep coma. In this latter event EEG investigation is useful for diagnosing epilepsy even when the prognosis is always serious.

AB  - The 24-hr activity patterns of intestinal maltase, lactase, leucylnaphthylamine hydrolyzing activity, γ-glutamyltransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were determined in pregnant rats maintained on a 12-12 light-dark cycle, with feeding during the dark period (1800-0600 hr, EST). The activities of these enzymes plus those of lysosomal maltase and lactase were followed during the same time period in 19- to 20-day-old fetuses. The activity patterns in the dams followed circadian rhythms, with peak activities occurring during the feeding-dark period. These rhythms are similar to the feeding schedule-cued rhythms observed in male rats and, therefore, are assumed to be feeding schedule cued also. In the fetuses, which obtained nutrients through the placenta, the activities increased in a somewhat nonlinear manner throughout the entire 24-hr period, but did not display a defined rhythm. It is concluded that endogenous intestinal enzyme rhythms do not exist in utero, and that oral and/or intermittent feeding is necessary for these rhythms to occur. © 1977.

AB  - Twelve rhesus monkeys confined to restraining chairs and maintained in a controlled environment were used to explore the existence and effect of biorhythms in the dynamics of the uterus during the last half of pregnancy. Spontaneous uterine activity, aortic blood pressure, and uterine artery blood flow were monitored continuously for periods of five to 25 days. During a 24 hour period, the variation in hourly average values of all measured functions occurred in repetitive and predictable patterns conforming to highly significant Fourier curves that were entrained by the light-dark cycle. Highest amniotic fluid and blood pressure values were recorded during the periods of light. Amplitudes of the sine curves calculated from intra-amniotic pressure data ranged from 1.8 to 59.4 per cent of the 24 hour mean, and in eight animals, they were positively correlated with blood pressure changes. In general, highest hourly average uterine artery blood flow rates occurred during the periods of darkness when intra-amniotic fluid pressures were minimal. The differences between minimal and maximal average flow rates ranged from 17.0 to 63.6 per cent of mean daily flow and were inversely correlated to amniotic fluid pressure changes. Disparities observed in the chronology and amplitude of the 24 hour periodic functions recorded for intra-amniotic pressure, blood pressure, and uterine blood flow indicate these biorhythms are modulated by factors in addition to those engendered by physiological pressure-flow relationships. The existence of these circadian rhythms should be considered when studying the kinetics and kinematics of the pregnant primate uterus. © 1977.

AB  - During recent years respiratory movements by the human fetus have been rediscovered. The types of movements have been defined, and their dependence on some physiologic conditions has been described. Pharmacologic agents influence not only the occurrence of the movements but also their rate and depth. A tidal flow of fluid between lung and amnionic sac has been established, which may play an important role in lung development. Demonstration of this route for exchange of water and soluble substances identifies the lung as an organ very likely involved in exchange between fetal compartments. Additionally, the deposition in the lung of the particulate matter contained in amnionic fluid may not be proof of pathologic aspiration as previously thought. © 1977.

AB  - In a total of 120 rats the number of 3H-Tdr-labelled nuclei of the adrenocortex was counted during various phases of the estrous cycle. In two separate experiments cyclic variations in the number of DNA synthesizing cells were found. The labelling index of the zona glomerulosa showed a significant maximum in proestrus whereas in zona fasciculata a minimum was revealed in estrus. In the glomerulosa the maximum of labelled cells was followed by a mitotic peak in estrus. Due to very low numbers of labelled cells no rhythm was found in the reticularis. The possible endocrine regulations of this endogenous rhythm of adrenocortical cell replication are discussed. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - 1. Catheters were inserted into the foetal carotid artery and maternal middle uterine artery and vein in twenty foetuses from fifteen sows, 91‐105 days pregnant. Blood samples were collected from foetal and maternal circulations for periods of 7‐21 days after surgery. 2. Blood gas tensions, pH, packed cell volume (PCV) and the levels of glucose, fructose and lactic acid in conscious pigs were followed in foetal and maternal bloods during late pregnancy. 3. Foetal blood gas tensions, pH, PCV, lactic acid and glucose levels did not change markedly during the last 20‐25 days of gestation. Blood fructose concentration fell during this period with the greatest change occurring after 100 days gestation. Foetal and maternal blood pH values were higher than those reported in the sheep, cow, mare and rhesus monkey. 4. Small changes in PCO2 and pH in foetal carotid blood were associated with similar changes in maternal uterine venous blood, so that gradients between sow and foetus remained relatively constant. 5. Daily changes in maternal blood glucose levels were associated with smaller changes in foetal blood glucose and fructose levels. Blood glucose concentrations in foetal blood were generally 40‐70% of maternal concentrations. Over‐all relationships between maternal blood glucose and foetal blood fructose concentrations were masked by the independent fall in foetal fructose levels with age. 6. The present findings have been compared with previous observations on acute, anaesthetized preparations in pigs, and chronic preparations in other domestic animals. © 1977 The Physiological Society

AB  - The relationship of heart rate variability to sleep state was examined in 9 term newborn infants at one to three days of age. Spectral density plots of rhythmic variations in heart rate during active sleep and quiet sleep were characteristic and always distinct from each other. Heart rate and heart rate variability were significantly higher during active sleep than during quiet sleep. It was always possible to identify quiet sleep and active sleep during sleep periods by inspecting spectral density plots of the variations in heart rate. Similar relationships between heart rate variability and sleep states may exist in utero. Spectral analysis of heart rate variations may provide an indirect measurement of fetal sleep states, and such measurements might become useful in assessing fetal brain maturity and fetal well-being. © 1977.

AB  - The LS (long-sleep) and SS (short-sleep) selected lines of mice exhibit relatively high and low sensitivity to alcohol, respectively, because of their previous history of selective breeding. The present study identifies other differences between the two lines. SS animals are almost twice as fertile as LS animals. Analysis of vaginal plug formation suggested that higher sexual activity of SS mice is an important component of their greater fertility. Forced maternal drinking of a 10% ethanol solution during gestation, and especially during lactation, caused a decrease in survival of LS but not of SS offspring. Increased cannibalism of pups by LS mothers was probably an important component of this decrease in progeny survival. Maternal consumption of liquid in both lines was decreased during gestation, and especially during lactation, when 10% ethanol was the only available liquid in each case. The physiological basis for decreased survival of LS progeny may involve either direct effects of alcohol on progeny or indirect effects caused by water, nutritional, or hormonal imbalance in LS mothers when they are exposed to alcohol stress. The relationship of fertility and progeny survival differences in the two lines to their differences in alcohol sensitivity produced by selective breeding is discussed. © 1977 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - In lambs during the last third of gestation fetal heart periods were measured to 0.2 msec, and the variation was calculated with a computer in real time. The rate was subject to low-frequency variations in association with breathing movements, with a 2 to 4 hour rhythm of large amplitude and unknown origin, with the time of day, and with increasing gestational age. The calculated standard deviation of heart period bore a semilogarithmic relation to increasing length of observational epoch. There were also multiple rhythms in heart rate variability. The immediate effect of fetal hypoxia was to increase heart rate variability despite the arrest of fetal breathing movements. The analysis of heart rate variability is examined critically. © 1977.

AB  - In a population of cycling female hamsters entrained to an LD 6:18 light cycle (lights 1000–1600 hours), preovulatory release of luteinizing hormone and follicle‐stimulating hormone occurred in some animals at 1300–1400 hours and in others at 1900 hours. In every case peak release was phase‐locked (2–3‐hour positive phase angle) to the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity. The pattern of entrainment of gonadotropin release on LD 6:18 is fully explicable in terms of the hamster's phase response curve to light. We conclude that periodic gonadotropin release in cycling females is timed by a circadian oscillator (biological clock) that is probably the same oscillator driving the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity.

AB  - Both premature and postmature births among mammals are hazardous to the offspring. Determinants of gestation length are therefore important. Circadian rhythms influence many biologic phenomena. We wondered whether gestation length was determined by the number of light-dark cycles or by an absolute length of time. C57BL mice were bred and raised under conditions of a 21-h light-dark cycle (10 1/2 L:10 1/2 D). Entrainment was demonstrated by measuring running activity. The animals were then used for these experiments. They were bred first (Period 1) under the 10 1/2L:10 1/2 D cycle (21 pregnancies), then (Period 2) for a few weeks under a 12L:12D cycle (10 pregnancies), then again (Period 3) under a 10 1/2L:10 1/2 D cycle (9 pregnancies). Gestation lengths (mode and range in 24-h days) were: Period 1: 20 (19-20), Period 2: 20 (20-21), Period 3: 21 (20-22). The findings indicate that gestation length remained approximately constant in terms of absolute time when the mice were entrained to a shortened light-dark cycle.

AB  - Continuous administration of estradiol benzoate by means of subcutaneously implanted capsules shortened the free-running circadian period of locomotor activity of blind hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) that had had their ovaries removed. Estradiol also advanced the phase of the wheel running of sighted female hamsters without ovaries that were entrained to a photoperiod with 12 hours of light and 12 of darkness. These results, and findings from hamsters undergoing natural estrous cycles, indicate that endogenous estradiol is involved in the regulation of circadian periodicity.

AB  - Young adult female rats were kept on a normal light/dark (LD) schedule (12 h light beginning at 0600 h) for 10 days. Eighteen rats were then kept in constant light (LL) for 110 days; 9 controls were maintained on LD. All rats were then kept on LD for a further 30 days. Vaginal smears were made 5 days per week. Plasma TSH and corticosterone were measured on consecutive days at 1100–1130 h and 1745–1815 h. LD controls maintained normal rhythms of plasma TSH and corticosterone and of estrus throughout the experiment. After beginning LL, plasma corticosterone and TSH AM-PM differences in group means disappeared within one week, while constant estrus did not appear until approximately 4 weeks. Marked AM-PM differences in plasma hormone concentration were present in individual LL rats. Within 1 week of the return to LD, normal estrous, TSH, and corticosterone rhythms had resumed. There was a significant negative correlation of plasma TSH and corticosterone (P < .02) during LD but not during LL (P > 0.1). From these and other data, we conclude that a free-running circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone, and probably of TSH, occurs within a few days of transfer from LD to LL. These rhythms are independent of each other, indicating different pacemakers for each. Both “free-run” in LL before the estrous cycle is lost. In spite of prolonged free-running, entrainment of all 3 cycles resumes promptly when LD cues are restored. © 1977 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Continuous recording of foetal ECoG, eye and body movements and heart rate were carried our in the same animal during late pregnancy and perinatal period. Alternation of NREM sleep and REM sleep was recorded in 5 foetal lambs as an ultradian rhythm occupying 90% of the time during the 3 weeks prior to birth. The period of the rhythm was 30-40 min with a ratio of NREM/REM of 1/1 from 4 months post-conceptional age until 6-8 h before birth. Foetal kinetic behaviour was differentiated into simple or complex movements and gross activity. Kinesis, particularly the periods of gross activity which accompanied foetal alert wakefulness, was both more frequent and more intense during the night-time. After birth, the total sleep time was reduced to 40% of the recording time, at one week post-partum the ratio of NREM/ REM was 5/1. In the neonate the NREM-REM sleep cycles persisted but the period was reduced by half. Three to five sleep cycles were grouped in episodes of 90-120 min, separated by wakefulness and alimentary behaviour. Throughout the experiment, the main criterion for distinguishing alert wakefulness from NREM sleep was oculomotor activity. Wakefulness occupied about 10% of each 24 h period pre-partum and 60% post-partum. © 1977.

AB  - The uterine wet weight in fed and starved immature rats was investigated at three hour intervals over a 24-hr period. Control animals received injections of 0.1 cc of oil while 0.06 μg of estradiol-17β was administered to experimental rats; the animals were sacrificed 24 hr later. For control fed animals a high uterine weight appeared at 2400 hr and for estradiol-treated rats at 1200 hours. The low value for controls appeared at 1800 hours and for experimentals at 0900 hours. The difference between low and high points represented a 16% increase for control and 29% for estradiol-treated animals. In rats starved for 36 hr, the peak weight appeared at 1800 hours for both control and estradiol-treated rats. The low value for controls appeared at 0600 hours and for experimentals at 1200 hours. The difference between low and high points represented a 27% increase for control and 40% for estradiol treated animals. These data demonstrate that the uterus of the immature rat has a circadian rhythm of wet weight and responds differently to estradiol stimulation depending on the time of day the hormone is given. Of significance is the fact that the rhythm continues in starved rats although a different pattern of responsiveness is observed.

AB  - Simultaneous determinations of unconjugated estriol and 15α-hydroxyestriol (E4) levels in maternal serum were studied serially to ascertain the relative usefulness of these estrogens as indicators of fetal welfare. Complicated pregnancies included 16 patients with pre-eclampsia and/or hypertension, six patients with severe Rh-isoimmunization, 12 patients with diabetes mellitus, of which four had vascular disease, three patients with fetal death in utero, and three twin pregnancies. Retrospective analysis failed to indicate a clinically useful role for serum E4 determinations in the evaluation of fetal welfare during high-risk pregnancies.

AB  - An automated method for determining total estrogen in 24-hour urine was reported. The 'estrogen-cretinine quotient' was computed in order to make the results of collective errors as independent as possible. This numerical value also makes possible comparative studies of 24-hour urine and morning urine (6:00 a.m.) as well as of urine specimens taken every two hours between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. A total of 1000 analyses were made in 110 pregnant women; in addition, 82 daily profiles were studied. A high correlation was found between the E/C from 24-hour urine and from morning urine. In approximately two thirds of the cases, the deviation between morning urine and 24-hour did not exceed 10%. In the daily profiles, however, a wide variation in the daily rhythm of some patients could be observed. According to our results, the determination of E/C in morning urine is well suited as a screening method for quick detection of estrogen elimination, particularly in high risk pregnancies.

AB  - Pregnant mice and rats were treated by stomach intubation on day 15 of gestation with 240 mg/kg of ethylenethiourea (ETU) made up in part with radiolabeled ETU. Animals were sacrificed at specific times post‐treatment, and maternal tissues, fetus, urine and feces were collected for determination of radioactivity. Maternal and fetal tissue levels of ETU were similar at three hours post treatment; thereafter, the mouse (maternal and fetus) showed much less ETU than the rat. The t½ of ETU elimination from the maternal blood was 9.4 and 5.5 hours for the rat and mouse, respectively. Analysis of urine by thinlayer chromatography and radiochromatography revealed that the mouse and rat metabolized ETU by different pathways. Furthermore, the mouse is able to metabolize ETU to a greater extent than the rat. Copyright © 1977 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - (1) Circadian rhythms mediate various cycles of the hamster's reproductive physiology and behavior. (2) Destruction of the suprachiasmatic nuclei interfered with the integration and/or generation of coherent circadian rhythms of wheel-running behavior and also abolished photoperiodic regulation of the testes, which remain large and functional after the lesion regardless of photoperiod or presence of the eyes. (3) The retinohypothalamic tract is the principal visual projection for the entrainment of circadian activity rhythms to the light: dark cycle and also appears necessary and sufficient for mediating the effects of photoperiod on the reproductive physiology of the male hamster. (4) The hamster estrous cycle free-ran under constant dim illumination with a period significantly different from 4 days; regression analyses of concurrently recorded free-running heat onsets and wheel-running behavior showed that the period of the estrous cycle was a multiple (× 4) of the circadian activity period. This implies a circadian organization of the estrous cycle and mediation of both activity and estrous behaviors by a common circadian system. Implications of these findings for contemporary views of sexual differentiation of gonadotrophin release are considered. (5) Estradiol influenced the phase angle of entrainment of wheel-running behavior by ovariectomized hamsters. The period of the free-running activity rhythm was significantly shortened in blind ovariectomized hamsters implanted with Silastic capsules containing estradiol benzoate. The functional significance of these hormone-mediated changes in rhythm periodicity is discussed. (6) Exposure of male hamsters to short daily photoperiods reduced the frequency of copulation. Castrated males maintained on short daily photoperiods were less responsive than those on long days to the activational effects of testosterone on copulation. The significance of this photoperiodically induced refractoriness to hormones, which in this species appears limited to the male, is discussed. © 1977.

AB  - Knife cuts placed posterior, anterior, or lateral to the suprachiasmatic nuclei failed to eliminate the drinking and eating rhythms of rats. Partial isolation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, interrupting simultaneously lateral, caudal, and dorsal efferents, permanently abolished drinking rhythms in the presence of a light-dark cycle and in constant dim light. This manipulation also eliminated the estrus cycle of rats. The results suggest that drinking rhythms are controlled by neural efferents from the suprachiasmatic nuclei. While the exact course of these efferents could not be determined, they appear to be anatomically different from those regulating hormonal rhythms of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system. © 1977 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Syrian hamsters were maintained on a long photoperiod (lights on 0600–2000 h) and injected daily with melatonin (10 μg per injection) for 6–7 weeks. Females injected at 2000 h or 0400 h ceased estrous cyclicity, and males treated similarly at these times had reduced testis weights by the sixth week of treatment. Daily administration of the same dosage of melatonin at 2400 and 0100 h failed to interrupt estrous cyclicity or reduce testis weight. These, observations suggest that exogenous melatonin administered at 2000 h or 0400 h may be temporally adding to endogenous circulating melatonin, inducing gonadal quiescence. © 1977 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The dose of a drug applied to a patient is determined by his physiological and pathological data, by specific properties of the drug and by the mode of application. The most important physiological data which influence the dose are body weight, sex, age, a pregnancy, genetic variations and circadian rhythm. Pathological findings such as organ insufficiencies (kidneys, heart, liver, endocrinium, transport protein in the blood, etc.) are also to be considered. Particularities of the drug kinetics (insignificant absorption, excessive biological half life, specific affinities to tissues, etc.), of metabolism (first pass effect, toxic metabolites, saturable detoxification, stress, etc.) or a high toxicity are other parameters of consequence. Finally attention has to be paid to the mode of application (p.o., i.v., etc.), to the kind of galenic preparation (liquid or solid, slow releasing preparation, etc.), to interactions if using combinations of drugs and to a long lasting pharmacotherapy. Additional problems are encountered in clinical trials especially in early phases while determining the tolerable therapeutic dose.

AB  - Abstract. Radioimmunoassay of sex steroids and prostaglandins was performed on plasma obtained from 10 uncomplicated primigravid subjects at a stated time of the day at varying stages of gestation. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), oestrone and oestriol concentrations reached a peak a few weeks before term and then declined. Progesterone, 17‐hydroxyprogesterone and oestradiol increased during pregnancy particularly after 32 weeks. In two normal patients repeated blood samples were taken throughout the day at weekly intervals in late pregnancy for sex steroid assays to evaluate the variation of concentrations with the time of sampling and the significance of changes in mean concentrations of different steroids with approaching parturition. Marked variability was found in the levels of different steroids during the day. Plasma oestriol values were lowest at 8.00 a.m. in one patient sampled frequently. A marked decrease in oestriol, oestrone, oestradiol and 17‐hydroxyprogesterone was found in one patient prior to the onset of spontaneous labour. In another subject there was no decrease in concentrations of oestrogens or progestogens prior to induction of labour at term. 1977 Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand

AB  - A continuous blood sampling technique has been used to monitor human growth hormone (GH) during sleep in fourteen normal short children (age range 6.5‐15.0 years), twelve hypopituitary children (2.8‐17.3 years), three children with psychosocial GH deficiency (4.0‐13.0 years), and three children with intrauterine growth retardation (9.5‐11.3 years). The mean GH level of a 5 h sleep period (22.30‐03.30 hours) was used to represent the GH response to sleep. The GH response to insulin induced hypoglycaemia (IST) was also determined. In normal short children there was a significant relationship between 5 h mean GH levels and chronological age. The curve defining this relationship was similar to the third centile linear growth velocity curve. The 5 h mean GH levels of the hypopituitary and psycho‐social GH deficiency children were more than 2 SD below the age related mean established for normal short children. The children with intrauterine growth retardation demonstrated values which were more than 2 SD above the age related mean. The evaluation of serum growth hormone (GH) during sleep, has recently been used as a test of pituitary function in growth retarded children (Eastman & Lazarus, 1973; Wise et al., 1975). Interpretation of the response is difficult because normal GH values during sleep have not been established. We have used a continuous blood sampling technique to define the range of nocturnal GH levels for normal short children. The sleep GH response of children with hypopituitarism, psychosocial GH deficiency and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been similarly investigated and is reported with reference to the range established for normal short children.

AB  - Diurnal plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and glucose concentrations were measured in 23 normal women, 13 chemical diabetics, and 11 insulin-dependent diabetics in late pregnancy. The mean diurnal FFA value was lowest in the insulin-requiring diabetics and highest in the chemical diabetics. Although no association was found between percentile birthweight and maternal mean fasting or diurnal FFA, there was a positive correlation between percentile birthweight and both mean maternal fasting plasma glucose and mean diurnal glucose in normal and chemical diabetic women. These observations support the view that glucose is the major substrate used by the fetus, but birthweight may be influenced more by the total substrate crossing the placenta than by maternal levels of either glucose or FFA alone. © 1977, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

AB  - Morphological degeneration of the fetus and associated embryological tissues was temporarily correlated with a precipitous decline in serum progesterone concentrations following ovariectomy (OVX) and ovariectomy combined with adrenalectomy (OVX, ADX) on Day 11 of pregnancy in the rat. Definitive signs of morphological change were seen upon histological examination 12 h following OVX and OVX/ADX when serum progesterone concentrations were at base levels. A greater degree of degeneration was observed in the OVX/ADX animals in contrast to OVX animals. Progesterone administration of 4.0 mg/day to Day 14 maintained pregnancy and prevented morphological degeneration. OVX rats as compared to OVX/ADX animals showed consistently higher serum progesterone levels throughout the 30 h experimental period following surgery as well as a serum progesterone peak at 2200 h which was not evidenced in the OVX/ADX animals. These observations support a significant adrenal contribution to the serum progesterone pool and the possibility of a diurnal rhythm in adrenal progesterone during pregnancy in the rat.

AB  - Plasma human placental lactogen (HPL) concentrations have been measured at frequent intervals over 24 hours in 24 normal women, 13 chemical and 13 insulin dependent diabetic patients during the third trimester of pregnancy. Most of the women studied displayed variation in HPL levels during the day, but there was no evidence of a diurnal rhythm, nor significant changes following meals or during the nocturnal fast. The mean plasma HPL concentrations over 24 hours in the chemical and insulin dependent diabetic patients (5·9±SD 1·3 and 5·9±l·7 μg/ml respectively) were greater than those in normal women (5·1·1·2 μg/ml) but this difference was not significant. No significant change in plasma HPL concentrations was observed during a five‐hour oral glucose tolerance test in either the normal or chemical diabetic group. It is suggested that in normal pregnant women HPL does not itself contribute to glucose homeostasis but acts as a ‘regulator’ which alters the actions of certain maternal hormones to achieve a favourable environment for fetal growth.

AB  - Variations in the counts of circulating basophile leucocytes in 225 subjects were studied. The results obtained are as follows: 1) The counts (per mm3) show a gradual rise with growth, from infancy to adolescence, and maintain a fair constancy in adults. 2) No significant sex difference was found in the peripheral basophile counts. 3) A definite diurnal variation in the counts exists, which is lowest in the morning and highest in the evening. 4) The counts are altered in different phases of the menstrual cycle. 5) Pregnant women show lower counts than nonpregnant women. 6) Surgical trauma and a single electroconvulsive shock lowers the counts significantly but variations are not significant after meals and physical exercise. 7) Smokers have slightly higher counts than non-smokers. 8) A course of irradiation therapy lowers the counts significantly in patients with inoperable neoplastic diseases. 9) Counts show insignificant variation with alteration of blood glucose level. The results mentioned above are discussed. © 1977, PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extensive lesions of the suprachiasmatic nuclei result in failure of ovulation in the female rat. Damage to adjacent structures (optic chiasma, anterior pole of the arcuate nuclei, anterior hypothalamus, preoptic area) is neither necessary nor, in itself, sufficient to cause failure of ovulation. All anovulatory animals showed a high level of sexual receptivity and some ovulated after mating but few became pregnant. There was no consistent relation between the incidence of ovulation after mating or after progesterone administration and the administration to oestrogen-primed animals after ovariectomy. Nor could these responses be correlated with the extent or anatomical location of the lesions. It is suggested that the failure of ovulation may be related to the abolition or disruption of the normal diurnal variation in sensitivity to the facilitatory effects of ovarian steroid hormones.

AB  - Two human neurophysins, nicotine stimulated neurophysin (NSN), and estrogen stimulated neurophysin (ESN) were assayed during physiologic maneuvers and pathologic states in man. NSN is thought to be associated with vasopressin and was elevated in some subjects by volume depletion, surgical stress, hypotension and hypertonic saline infusion. Overnight dehydration did not elevate NSN in spite of urinary concentration. NSN was elevated in some subjects with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and when tested was unresponsive to administered water, alcohol or nicotine. ESN was elevated during estrogen administration, in pregnancy, in newborns and in patients with cirrhosis. NSN was also acutely increased at parturition. These data support the association of NSN with vasopressin although changes in NSN were found only with potent stimuli for vasopressin release.

AB  - The possibility that 24-hour rhythms exist in uterine blood flow (UtBF) and umbilical blood flow (UmBF) was investigated in 5 days postoperative chronically instrumented near-term pregnant sheep acclimated to a controlled environment. UtBF, UmBF and pressure measurements were made at 15-min intervals over 24 h beginning at 0800 h. Each data series was examined for the presence of significant rhythms of a 24-hour period using a method of Fourier analysis. UtBF 24-hour rhythms were found in all ewes; UmBF 24-hour rhythms were found in 4 of 5 lambs. A consistent reciprocal phase relationship between UtBF and UmBF was evident within animals. There were no associated rhythms in maternal arterial, fetal arterial, or amniotic fluid pressures. These results indicate that the presence of circadian rhythms must be considered as a possible variable when long-term uteroplacental hemodynamic studies are planned. © 1977 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - 6-Hydroxydopamine was mi-croinjected bilaterally into the ventral nor-adrenergic tract at the level of the interpe-duncular nucleus. Effective injections into the tract as indicated by the lesions induced and by a decline in the catecholamine fluo-resence in the anterior hypothalamus were associated with a complete blockade of the rise in prolactin which occurs on the afternoon of proestrus and, in fact, a decline in prolactin ensued. Lesions which were asymmetrical or missed the ventral noradrenergic tract had only a slight effect in inhibiting the release of prolactin on the afternoon of proestrus. All lesions were capable of blocking the release of LH on the afternoon of proestrus. It is postulated that increased impulse traffic along the ventral noradrenergic tract induces the proestrous discharge of prolactin and LH or that, alternatively, tonic activity in this tract is required for this release to occur. © 1977, SAGE Publications.

AB  - By estimating the LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels by the radioimmunoassay technique, the pituitary gonadotropin responses to intravenously injected LH-RH were studied in relation to the previous pituitary levels of LH and FSH in ovariectomized estrogen-progesterone treated, intact and chlorpromazine-blocked proestrous, diestrous, estrogen-produced pseudopregnant, and immature male rats. Although the pituitary weight was not significantly different among the proestrous, diestrous, estrogen-produced pseudopregnant, and ovariectomized estrogen-progesterone treated animals, both the pituitary LH and FSH in the former 3 groups were significantly lower than in the latter group, LH ranging from 1/5 to 1/7 and FSH ranging from 1/4 to 1/7. The pituitary weight, LH and FSH in immature male rats were about one-fifth, -twentieth, and -second of those in ovariectomized estrogen-progesterone treated animals, respectively. However, when the pituitary LH and FSH were expressed as tissue concentration, the former was one-fourth and the latter was 2.5-fold in immature male rats compared with those in ovariectomized estrogen-progesterone treated animals. Both hormones in the pituitary in ovariectomized estrogen-progesterone treated, proestrous and immature male rats did not vary significantly after intravenous injection of LH-RH and also when the circulating LH and FSH varied markedly due to the diurnal rhythm.

AB  - Daily corticosterone injections (20 μg/g b.w., i.p), on either days 2, 3 and 4 or days 16, 17 and 18, abolished the normal development of the a.m.-p.m. difference in plasma corticosterone levels, as no a.m.-p.m. difference was present in either group on day 21. Thyroxine treatment (10 μg/g b.w., s.c.) on days 8, 9 and 10 was able to counteract the effect of corticosterone at both ages, i.e. animals treated with thyroxine and corticosterone exhibited a significant a.m.-p.m. difference on day 18, the same day as controls. On the other hand, thyroxine-treated rats with prior corticosterone injections continued to show significantly earlier eye-opening than controls. These results suggest that thyroxine advances the maturation of central structures which are involved in the control of pituitary-adrenal activity and which are sensitive to high perinatal plasma levels of corticosterone. © 1977 S.

AB  - Thyroxine (10 μg/g b.w., s.c.), injected either on days 2, 3 and 4 or days 8, 9 and 10, resulted in a higher a.m.-p.m. plasma corticosterone difference on day 23, compared to the vehicle-treated controls. In a separate experiment the same dose of thyroxine on days 8, 9 and 10 caused an earlier appearance of significantly higher p.m. than a.m. plasma corticosterone levels (day 15 vs day 18 in vehicle-treated controls), and earlier eye-opening (12.38±0.11 thyroxine vs 15.36±0.14 days, vehicle). These results suggest that thyroxine influences the maturation of those neural structures which participate in the regulation of the diurnal rhythm of ACTH secretion and, as a consequence, in that of corticosterone production. © 1977 S.

AB  - Industrial medical and socio-gynaecological preventive examinations and morbidity analyses show that the state of health of women working shifts does not differ from the state of health of women not working night shifts. Complications in the pregnancy and childbirth in the case of women working night shifts are not more frequent than in the case of women not working night shifts. These positive results showing that night shift work has not harmful effects on the health of working women are attributed to the fact that priority is given in the GFR to improving the working and living conditions of night shift workers. These measures include fitness examinations and check-ups. Conditions in socialist society make it possible for women with health impairments to switch to jobs not connected with night work (active and passive selection). That is why in some diagnostic groups women doing night shift work have fever dysfunctions than those not doing night shift work. The legal provisions and methods of medical examination to go into effect on 1 January 1979 prescribe a basic medical fitness examination before employment and medical check-ups every two years for night-shift workers.

AB  - Compared to laboratory animals, humans are extremely heterogeneous with respect to the many factors that can influence the distribution and biological effects of toxic chemicals. This heterogeneity can prevent an accurate assessment of the impact of a particular toxic compound on the health of an individual subject. Some of the factors that can significantly modify the host response to certain drugs, which serve in this review as a model for environmental chemicals, are enumerated and discussed. Although the mechanisms by which many of these factors modify the biological effects of certain environmental chemicals and drugs have been determined in some cases, better definition of the nature of interactions between these factors and environmental chemicals in a particular individual is required at a biochemical and molecular level. Recommendations are offered for the further development of our knowledge concerning interactions between environmental chemicals and such factors in a particular individual.

AB  - Nursing by two mother-infant pairs in a caged colony of Macaca fascicularis was monitored at 1-min intervals for 8 h beginning 8:30 a. m. BST, once a week for 3 months in the summer of 1973. Nursing occupied about 210 min in 8 daylight hours for the infants at 10 weeks of age, and the time spent nursing decreased at the average rate of 9.4 min per week until the infants were about 6 months old. The time spent nursing by the infants studied here resembles closely the times spent nursing by some other macaques and by baboons. In the course of a day the amount of time spent nursing varies significantly with a diurnal peak. If nursing by one mother-infant pair is independent of nursing by the other pair, then the time the two pairs spend nursing together would be a function of the product of the frequencies of nursing by each pair. The expected times for the pairs nursing together based on the hypothesis of independent events were significantly less than the observed times the pairs nursed together. Nursing, therefore, involves a positive influence or imitation of one nursing pair by the other. Nursing sessions involving both mother-infant pairs were longer on the average than sessions involving only one pair. © 1977 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Many of the factors altering corticosterone in the rat have similar effects on prolactin. Resting prolactin, like corticosterone, is higher in animals housed singly than in those multiply housed. Unlike corticosterone, gentling did not lower prolactin. An exquisite sensitivity to environmental stimuli which results in rapid elevations in prolactin levels has been indentified in the rat which is considerably greater than that for corticosterone. Like corticosterone, the pattern of prolactin stress responses varies according to time of day. This differential sensitivity may well account for the diurnal variation in prolactin reported by some investigators. The limbic system has an important influence on prolactin. Lesions of the septal region do not modify resting levels but alter the pattern of prolactin stress responses in ways which are only partly similar to the effects of such lesions on corticosterone. In rhesus monkeys, individual variation in resting prolactin levels was observed, similar to that seen in the human. Levels are stable over periods of up to 50 days and are characteristic of the individual animal. In response to the stress of electric shock or shaping to a bar press response, prolactin elevation occurs only in animals with high resting levels, suggesting that a common mechanism is responsible for controlling both resting levels and magnitude of stress responses.

AB  - Growth hormone and prolactin are secreted episodically in man and experimental animals. To investigate physiologic mechanisms of GH and PRL secretion, a series of experiments were performed in individual, unanaesthetized male and female rats. GH secretion in the male rat is characterized by intermittent surges that occur approximately every 3 h and are entrained to the light‐dark cycle. Peaks reach 200‐400 ng/ml and troughs are unmeasurable. PRL is secreted in more frequent episodes with a pattern distinct from GH. In the female rat, GH surges occur more frequently‐approximately once each hour. PRL levels are low (<15 ng/ml) except on the afternoon of pro‐oestrous when they surge to levels of 100‐300 ng/ml. Prolactin rises 4‐6 h before delivery. Levels decline rapidly at the onset of parturition and surge with each episode of suckling in the post‐partum period. Growth hormone and corticosterone rise during delivery and remain elevated for several hours after delivery. Reinstitution of suckling after removal of pups causes an immediate rise in PRL and GH. The PRL response is sustained for 3‐4 h, whereas the GH response is brief with return to baseline within 1 h. The time courses of the two responses are clearly independent. Stress in the male rat causes a rapid rise in PRL and suppression in GH. The PRL surge to stress is brief with return to baseline by 1 h. GH pulses are suppressed for up to 5 h after stress. These studies indicate that separate neuroendocrine control mechanisms exist for regulation of the episodic release of GH and PRL in the rat. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) given i.v. to immature rats caused a maximal (x 70) increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity (ODC) at 3 hr; enzyme activity declined to about 10 times the control level by 9 hr and a second rise began after about 20 hr. Anti PMSG given 30 min after PMSG reduced the peak response by 70%. Actinomycin D, or cycloheximide, completely prevented an increase in ODC when given with PMSG, but only cycloheximide lowered the enzyme activity when given 18 hr later. Ovine FSH plus LH also produced a peak in ODC at 3 hr but the activity decreased quickly and by 9 hr it was at the control level. Secretion of endogenous FSH and LH, induced by hourly injections of LH releasing hormone (LH RH) increased ODC to the same extent as did the exogenous hormones; ODC was still higher than in the controls 4 hr after the last dose of LH RH. Increased endogenous levels of FSH and LH did not consistently raise ovarian cyclic AMP content and the increases found were much less than those obtained after injection of PMSG or FSH + LH. The results indicate that increased ODC is induced and maintained by the continual presence of gonadotrophin. The dependence of increased ODC upon increased cyclic AMP cannot be unequivocally determined because of important differences in the timing of the responses and the difficulty in determining biologically significant changes in cyclic AMP.

AB  - The effect of prenatal exposure to alcohol was studied in two lines of mice selectively bred for different sensitivities to alcohol: the long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) lines. LS females took longer than SS females to be come pregnant. Fewer LS offspring survived, even when not treated with alcohol. Although LS females tended to consume smaller doses of alcohol, offspring of LS dams consuming alcohol during the second half of gestation survived considerably less than 50% of the time. No such effect was seen in the SS line. These results are in agreement with others, indicating a line difference in several aspects of alcohol sensitivity. © 1977 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Hypothalamic corticotrophin releasing (CR) activity and LH-releasing factor (RF) content, and pituitary and plasma LH, FSH and ACTH were measured in adult male and female Wistar rats maintained under 14 hr light per day. Hypothalamic LH-RF and pituitary and plasma hormones were estimated by radioimmunoassay while CR activity was assessed by the amount of ACTH released from hemipituitaries in vitro. Two experiments were carried out on male animals. In the first, some of the animals were kept in a room, distant from the animal house, in which the lighting was reversed with respect to the external environment. In animals exposed to the reversed lighting regime, hypothalamic LH-RF content and pituitary gonadotropin concentrations were significantly lower than the values in male rats kept in the animal house where they were in close proximity to female rats. In the second experiment, which was carried out on animals which had all been kept in the animal house, there were no significant differences between the LH-RF contents measured at 3-4 hr intervals throughout the day. Pituitary LH and FSH contents, but not concentrations, were significantly increased at 12.00 hr. There was little difference between the experiments in CR-activity, plasma ACTH concentrations and profiles of pituitary ACTH content and concentration. As expected there was diurnal rhythm in plasma corticosterone concentrations (determined by competitive protein-binding assay) with the peak occurring between 15.00 and 18.00 hr. The profiles of plasma and pituitary ACTH were similar to that of plasma corticosterone. Corticotrophin releasing activity dropped significantly between 12.00 and 16.00 hr, but remained steady at the other times. In female rats there were no significant differences between hypothalamic LH-RF content throughout the 4-day cycle. During pro-estrus the mean LH-RF content rose to reach a high level at 18.00 at which time plasma LH concentration had risen sharply to a level consistent with the peak of the preovulatory surge. Plasma FSH concentration also rose significantly between 15.00 and 18.00 hr of pro-estrus. At metoestrus and dioestrus, plasma FSH levels were lower in the morning than in the evening. These results suggest that there is no diurnal rhythm in hypothalamic LH-RF, there may be a diurnal rhythm in pituitary gonadotrophin content in the male and in plasma FSH concentration on the days of metoestrus and dioestrus in the female, if a surge of LH-RF does occur on the afternoon of pro-estrus, the rate of LH-RF synthesis exceeds its release, and the mechanism which regulates gonadotrophin secretion in the male may be affected by factors in the environment other than daylength. The results provide further evidence for the view that the diurnal rhythm of corticosterone secretion is under hypothalamo-hypophysial control.

AB  - Effects of maternal administration of alpha-methyl-L-DOPA on sleep in utero were studied by polygraphic method in Guinea Pig fœtus from the 53th day of gestation. Maternal injection of alpha-methyl-L-DOPA (100 and 200 mg/kg) produces a typical sedative effect on the fœtus from the first hour after drug administration. But, effects appear attenuated in comparison to those of the new-born Guinea Pig : a paradoxical sleep-deprivation of only 30 % is observed during the 12 hours period after drug injection. Causes of the attenuation in utero of these drug effects are discussed. © 1977 Masson, Paris.

AB  - Sleep behavior was studied in 70- to 140-day-old rats subjected to protein malnutrition at various stages of development. Dams of experimental animals were fed one of two isocaloric diets containing either 25% casein or 8% casein for 5 weeks prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation. After weaning (21 days) the offspring were either maintained on the diet fed their mother or switched to the other diet. Dietary protein restriction, either prior to or following weaning, resulted in a shift of the distribution of rapid eye-movement sleep such that a significantly greater proportion of total rapid eye-movement sleep occurred during the dark phase of the 24-h recording period. Combined preweaning and postweaning restriction produced a somewhat greater effect. None of the malnourished groups differed significantly from the well-nourished control group in amount of waking, slow-wave sleep, or rapid eye-movement sleep in 24 h. A control group fed rat chow did not differ from the well-nourished group in any of these aspects of sleep behavior. These results indicate the possibility of involvement of malnutrition-induced changes in biogenic amine metabolism or endocrine function. © 1977.

AB  - 6-14/sec positive spikes (PS) (in our cases 7-14) were observed during 6 all-night sleep, recordings in one pair of monozygotic twins (aged 7 years), who had severe speech retardation, no epilepsy and were otherwise normal (CAT were normal). The EEG during wakefulness and sleep showed multifocal independent spikes over the left mid-temporal and right parieto-occipital areas. The 7-14 PS, which were similar in both twins, occurred slightly during light sleep, were absent during slow sleep and were most prominent during REM sleep (mean = 6.3 sec of PS bursts/min of REM). During REM sleep, the 7-14 PS bursts were negatively related to bursts of eye movements ; PS were 7 times more frequent in the intervals between than during bursts of eye movements. In addition, long bursts of PS (up to 6 sec) might interupt the bursts of eye movements suggesting a functional antagonism between mechanisms (still unclear) responsible for PS and for REM. The predominance of PS during REM sleep and the inverse relationship with the eye movements are not peculiar to our case, since similar findings have been reported in other cases (Tsuzuki 1967 ; Okuma et al., 1968). During the sleep stages when PS occurred spontaneously, PS could also be evoked by a click or a tone, with a latency of 1,5-2 sec. © 1977 Masson, Paris.

AB  - This study is the statement of the present knowledge of the normal EEG activity of the full term and the premature neonates. The criteria for normality of the records are based on transversal studies of normal newborn babies, born after a normal pregnancy and a normal delivery (Apgar 9 and 10). Follow up studies of children over a period of 3 years or more have allowed to appreciate the variability of the neonatal EEG, especially in premature babies having a late normal psycho-motor development. The variability of bioelectric activity is considerable from child and in the same child from one moment to another especially during quiet sleep. EEG activity varies according to the states of vigilance and sleep. Organisation of sleep is independant of the recording methods, as shown by a comparative study using different technics of electrode application. © 1977 Masson, Paris.

AB  - Respiratory pattern and heart rate were studied in 28 pre‐term infants and four full‐term infants during the first weeks of life. Sleep state was identified by standard neurological and eeg criteria. Apneic spells lasting 10 seconds or more were most frequent in the least mature infants, and their frequency tended to diminish with increasing maturity. When these apneic attacks were related to sleep state they were found to occur more frequently during non‐REM sleep in infants of 30 to 33 weeks gestation. This was the only statistically significant difference found. No over‐all pattern relating sleep state to the frequency of apnea could be detected for individual infants. It was also difficult to relate the occurrence of bradycardia to apnea in terms of sleep state or gestational age. It is concluded that no simple relationship between sleep state, apnea and bradycardia exists and that a complex interrelation between central and peripheral factors is involved in these events. Etat de sommeil, apnée et bradycardie chez les prématures L'aspect de la respiration et le rythme cardiaque ont étéétudiés durant les premières semaines de la vie chez 28 prématurés et quatre nourrissons nés à terme. Les états de sommeil ont été identifiés selon les standards neurologiques et les critères électroencéphalographiques. Des intervalles d'apnee de dix secondes ou plus ont été trouvés très fréquents chez les nourrissons les moins matures: leur fréquence tendait à diminuer avec la maturité. Lorsque ces périodes d'apnée étaient mises en relation avec les états de sommeil, elles apparaissaient au maximum durant les périodes de sommeil non‐PMO, chez les nourrissons de 30 à 33 semaines de gestation. Ce fut la seule différence statistique observée. Aucun groupement général reliant l'état du sommeil à la fréquence de l'apnée n'a pu ětre décelé individuellement chez les nourissons. II fut également difficile de relier l'apparition de bradycardie avec l'apnée en termes d'état de sommeil ou d'ǎge de gestation. II est conclu à partir des données de cette présente étude qu'il n'existe pas de relation simple entre l'état de sommeil, l'apnée et la bradycardie et qu'une interrelation complexe entre facteurs centraux et périphériques doit ětre invoquée dans ces manifestations. Eslado de sueño, apnea y bradieardia en niños a pretérmino Se estudiaron el esquema respiratorio y la frecuencia del corazón en 28 niños pretérmino y cuatro niños a término durante las primeras semanas de vida. El estado de sueño fue identificado por criterios neurológicos standard y por el electroencefalograma. Accesos de apnea de 10 o más segundos de duración eran más frecuentes en los niños menos maduros: Su frecuencia tendía a disminuir a medida que aumentaba la madurez. Cuando estos ataques de apnea fueron considerados en relación con el estado de sueño, se halló que ocurrían con mayor frecuencia durante el sueño no‐REM en lactantes de 30 a 33 semanas de gestación. Esta fue la única diferencia estadistica encontrada. No pudo ser detectado ningún esquema general relacionando el estado de sueño con la frecuencia de la apnea en lactantes individuales. Fue también dificil relacionar la incidencia de bradicardia a apnea en términos de estado de sueño o de edad gestacional. Por los datos presentados en el presente estudio se concluye que no existe ninguna relación simple entre el estado de sueño, la apnea y la bradicardia y que en estas eventualidades está implicada una compleja interrelación entre factores centrales y periféricos.

AB  - An ethologically-oriented experimental design has been evolved to test the hypothesis that in the developing animal, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may be concerned with integrating inherited aspects of attachment and territorial behavior with higher cognitive processes. Isolated weaned mice were daily submitted to 3-5 hr of treadmill sleep deprivation throughout maturation from 28 days until they were adult at 4 months. In some (controls) the treadmill preceded, and in others (experimental), it followed a 2 1 2 hr socialization period during which the males and females interacted in a complex population cage. The adult responses of the various groups were tested in an open field by measuring their activity and elevation of plasma corticosterone. The capacity for organized social interaction was evaluated by observing blood pressure and other responses to two months of continuous exposure to colony life in a population cage. Mice that were routinely put on the treadmill immediately after socialization behaved as though they had been isolated throughout their development. Those that experienced the treadmill before socialization developed a normal hierarchy despite 21 1 2 hr of isolation between the daily socialization experiences. There was a statistically significant difference between the open field activity, the open field corticosterone value, and the blood pressure of the control and the experimental groups. © 1977.

AB  - The development of 40 postterm, postmature infants was compared to that of 40 normal control infants during the first year of life. The postterm, postmature infants had more prenatal complications and received lower Brazelton interaction and motor scores at birth. At four months they scored lower on the Denver developmental scale and were rated "difficult" babies by their mothers. At eight months their Bayley motor scores were equivalent to those of the control infants, but their mental scores were lower. At this time their mothers reported a higher incidence of illnesses and of feeding and sleep disturbances. © 1977 The C. V. Mosby Company.

AB  - The reactions of babies to aircraft noise were studied by means of electroplethysmography (PLG) and electroencephalography (EEG). It was found that the babies whose mothers had moved to the area around the Osaka International Airport before conception (group I) or during the first five months of pregnancy (group II) showed little or no reaction on PLG and on EEG to aircraft noise. In contrast, babies whose mothers had moved closed to the airport during the second half of the pregnancy or after birth (group III or IV) and the babies whose mothers lived in a quiet living area (group V) reacted to the same auditory stimuli. The babies in groups I and II showed differential responses depending on whether the auditory stimuli were aircraft noise or music. Abnormal PLG and EEG were observed in the majority of babies living in an area where noise levels were over 95 dB A. This suggests that the deep sleep of the babies living in such an area was disturbed. © 1977, Acoustical Society of America. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ocular abnormalities and psychomotor difficulties were prominent in two unrelated children; in addition, the older child had respiratory irregularity during sleep. The pathologic findings included lesions of the optic nerve in the case with available material and established the diagnosis of Leigh's subacute necrotizing encephalopathy. This disorder is thought to result from inhibition of a thiamine-dependent enzymatic process and may be modified by greatly increased thiamine intake. Suspicion of the diagnosis in a child with ophthalmoplegia or other ocular abnormalities may lead to earlier recognition and more successful treatment of the disease. © 1977, American Medical Association.

AB  - Sixty female white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were fed either ad libitum or 70% ad libitum diets for 5 weeks. During the last 3 weeks of feeding a polychlorinated biphenyl (Aroclor 1254) was incorporated into the diets at levels of 0,25, or 100 ppm (based on ad libitum intake). Polychlorinated biphenyl ingestion increased liver weights, reduced pentobarbital-induced sleep times, and generally reduced plasma corticoid levels but had no effect on reproductive organ weights or the incidence of estrus (as judged by vaginal smears). Feed restriction caused marked atrophy of the ovaries and uterus and reduced the incidence of estrus. © 1977.

AB  - The aim of the research was a computer analysis of the EEG after child-birth. Cases unaffected by fatigue, pain or previous medication were considered. Tracings were recorded at the eight month of pregnancy and compared to those obtained 48-72 hrs following delivery, after a regular sleep and with a normal blood sugar level. Subjects also tested by the Hamilton scale for anxiety. Sixty-four sec. artefact-free epochs were stored on magnetic tape from several scalp electrodes by using Common Average Reference derivation. Computer analysis was made by a 16K machine. Peak amplitude, activity and mobility of the α-band were calculated. Following delivery slight increase of both peak amplitude and activity was observed with less mobility. Individual spectral features were nevertheless mantained. Irritability was the most affected psychological parameter, the Hamilton scale showing a clear decrease, which fairly paralleled the slight α-increase. Although a prolactin effect could be suspected, this hormone plays no role, for no relationship exists between α-amplitude and prolactin levels, checked by radioimmunology. High α-peaks were often found in subjects having low blood concentration of that hormone and viceversa. Moreover, bromocriptine given at a dose of 5 mg/day after delivery leaves the EEG unaffected in spite of the inhibition of the prolactin. The fast drop of progesterone is thought to be involved.

AB  - Teratologic studies on flurazepam free base, a new sleep inducer, were carried out in rabbits. Flurazepam free base, which suspended in 0.2% CMC solution, was orally administered at doses of 5, 15 or 45 mg/kg during the period of organogenesis. No effects on the maternal body weight gain of flurazepam free base were observed in nearly all dose groups. Although a significant difference was recognized statistically compared with the control group in both the number of placental remnants and of surviving fetuses, effects on the lethality and the developmental abnormality of fetuses were not observed in all dose groups. No external or skeletal malformations were observed in any dose group. It is concluded from the present study that flurazepam free base has no teratogenic effects in rabbits.

AB  - This article provides an in-depth analysis of hallucinations in monozygous quadruplets concordant for schizophrenia. Since all four are genetically identical, deviations among them with regard to various aspects of hallucinations probably represent the effects that nongenetic factors can produce in hallucinating schizophrenics. Concordances probably represent the effects of genetic factors. We present here findings based on this research strategy, and a brief review of the literature on hallucinations. © 1977, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

They studied normal E.E.Gs and emphasise the existence of a sleep-waking pattern during dilatation. They consider the E.E.G. changes during the different stages of labour and assess the results against other techniques used to assess fœtal well-being. They record the effects on the E.E.G. of various anaesthetics and analgesics given to the mother. The difficulty of the technique is stressed and they conclude that despite the obvious interest of the technique it is not currently suitable for routine obstetric practice. © 1977 Masson, Paris.

AB  - Sixty-one patients received nitrazepam 5 mg by mouth on the night before operation, followed by 2.5 mg given on the morning of operation and were compared with 60 patients who received no premedication. All were undergoing either therapeutic abortion, by dilatation and curettage, or explorative curettage. The plasma concentrations of nitrazepam were determined by gas chromat-ography and compared with the clinical effects of the drug. The premedicated patients slept better on the night before operation, and were more sedated and less apprehensive. Headache was more frequent following nitrazepam. There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of dizziness and nausea. The unpremedicated patients had a faster average heart rate. There was no obvious relationship between the plasma concentration of nitrazepam and the quality of sleep, degree of sedation, apprehension, excitement or headache. © 1977 Copyright: Macmillan Journals Ltd.

AB  - Twenty women hospitalized in a gynaecological clinic for threatening miscarriages were treated by beta-mimetic drugs and examined from a neuro-psychological viewpoint. Disorders in the quality of sleep, trembling fingers and modification in the tone of voice were noted, and associated in five cases, to a slight hypertonia, extra-pyramidal-like. Eleven women had difficulties in concentrating, and 17 felt distressing changes of mood: mentism, pessimistic thoughts, feeling of being abandoned, and sometimes, beliefs of being persecuted, which in 2 patients required the administration of haloperidol.

AB  - Today the endocrin therapy of the advanced mastocarcinoma is in common use. Besides the already known therapy by estrogens, androgens, gestagens, and steroids, Tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, is a very promising therapeutic drug. In the presented study, Tamoxifen was submitted to a critical clinical control during a period of one year from 1st october 1975 until 1st october 1976. After a 3 months' treatment, a rate of 41% of objective remissions could be obtained. The criteria of success were estimated according to the scheme of Karnofsky. The average remission time is 5,5 months. By a determination of the estrogen receptors it would be possible to realize a therapeutic selection and to achieve a higher remission rate. The authors made an interesting observation, i.e. a probably immuno-stimulating effect which, however, still has to be submitted to further examinations. The side effects are described in detail and the indications are established. It is astonishing that the subjective ameliorations, i.e. cessation of pains in case of generalized formation of metastases in the bones are much more frequent than the objective remissions. We came to the conclusion that the treatment by Tamoxifen is a valuable alternative in the therapy of the mastocarcinoma, above all in the postmenopausal period if the disease is advanced and incurable.

AB  - The pharmacological actions of KW-1062, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic, were investigated. Summary of pharmacological actions and minimal effective doses (MED) of KW-1062 was as follows :-fall of blood pressure of the rabbit (10 mg/kg), inhibition of respiration of the rabbit (50 mg/kg), bradycardia of rabbit ECG (100 mg/kg), inhibiton of isolated guinea pig atrium (5 x 10-5 g/ml), stimulation of permeability of rabbit skin vessels (10 dug) and inhibition of isolated rabbit and guinea pig intestine (10-4 g/ml), of isolated guinea pig trachea (10-4 g/ml), and of isloated nonpregnant and pregnant rat uteri (2 × 10-5 and 2×10-6 g/ml). No effect on rabbit ear vessels was observed in a concentration up to 2 x 10-1 g/ml. The actions and MED were similar to those of gentamicin. In nervemuscle preparation of rat diaphragm, contraction by indirect stimulation was inhibited at a concetration of 5 × 10-4 g/ml. ED50 in which moderate paralysis was elicited in mice was calculated as approximately 200 mg/kg (sc). No potentiating effects of KW-1062 on ether anesthesia and Pentobarbital sleep were observed. KW-1062 did ont protect the Pentetrazol convulsions. The increase in body weight, volume of urine, urinary excretion of sodium and potassium, and urinary findings in the rat applied KW-1062 in doses from 12. 5 to 100 mg/kg subcutaneously once a day for 7 days were similar to normal values and those of the control group, except that application of 100 mg/kg showed tendency of inhibition of body weight increase and decreased excretion of sodium. © 1977, Japanese Society of Chemotherapy.

AB  - It is not understood by what mechanism one sleep state changes into the other during state cycling in newborn infants. A better understanding of the ‘morphology’ of the changes (e.g. their duration and sequence) in the polygraphically recorded variables may contribute to clarification. From 12 six‐hour recordings of 11 newborns, 45 peritransitional epochs from state 1 (quiet sleep) into state 2 (active sleep), and the same number from state 2 into state 1, were analysed by hand in consecutive 10‐second epochs. Identification of the moment of transition was taken as the change in regularity of respiration of at least three minutes duration. The peritransitional epochs from state 1 into state 2 are shorter than those from state 2 into state 1, although there are large intra‐ and inter‐individual differences. 65 per cent of the transitions from state 1 into state 2 are accompanied by gross movements, though fewer are seen in abnormal infants. The sequence of changes in eeg patterns, in the occurrence of slow and rapid eye‐movements and in tonic muscle activity are loosely and inconsistently related in time to the change in respiratory regularity, even if several transitions are analysed in the same recording of a single infant. No one variable could be identified which consistently followed or preceded a change in any other specific variable. Nevertheless, sequences were found in abnormal neonates which were not observed in normal infants. Transitions des ŕtats de sommeil chez le nouveau‐nŕ: ŕtude primaire On ne connait pas le mŕcanisme permettant le passage d̂un ŕtat de sommeil à 'autre dans les cycles du nouveau‐nŕ. Une meilleure comprŕhension de la ‘morphologie’ des changements (c'est à dire de leur durŕe et sŕquence) à travers les variables enregistrŕes polygraphiquement peut contribuer à une clarification. A partir de 12 enregistrements de six heures chez 11 nouveaux‐nŕs, 45 passages transitionnels de 'ŕtat 1 (sommeil tranquille) à 'ŕtat 2 (sommeil actif) et le même nombre de 'ŕtat 2 à 'ŕtat 1 ont ŕtŕ ŕtudiŕs sur des tranches consŕcutives de dix secondes. 'identification du moment de la transition a ŕtŕ ŕtablie par la modification dans la rŕgularitŕ de la respiration d̂une durŕe d̂au moins trois minutes. Les tranches transitionnelles de 'ŕtat 1 à 'ŕtat 2 sont plus courtes que celles de 'ŕtat 2 à 'ŕtat 1 bien qu'il existe de larges diffŕrences intra et inter‐individuelles. 65 pour cent des transitions de 'ŕtat 1 à 'ŕtat 2 sont accompagnŕes de larges mouvements, plus rares chez les enfants anormaux. Les sŕquences des modifications des tracŕs EEG de la survenue des mouvements oculaires lents et rapides et de 'activitŕ tonique musculaire sont reliŕes dans le temps de façon 15che et inconsistante aux modifications de la rŕgularitŕ respiratoire même si plusieurs transitions sont analysŕes sur le même enregistrement d̂un seul nouveau‐nŕ. II n'est possible d̂identifier aucune variable unique qui suive ou prŕcède rŕgulièrement une modification d̂une autre variable spŕcifique. Nŕanmoins, il a ŕtŕ possible d̂observer chez les nouveaux‐nŕs anormaux des sŕquences non observŕes chez les nouveaux‐nŕs normaux. Die Mechanismen, die während der Schlafzyklen eines Neugeborenen die eine Schlafphase in die andere verändern, sind unbekannt. Eine bessere Kenntnis der ‘Morphologie’ der polygraphisch registrierten Änderungen der Variablen (Dauer und Reihenfolge) könnten zu einer Klärung beitragen. 12‐sechs‐stündige Ableitungen von 11 Neugeborenen lieferten für die Analyse 45 Übergangsepochen von Verhaltenszustand 1 (ruhiger Schlaf) in Verhaltenszustand 2 (aktiver Schlaf) und die gleiche Zahl Übergänge vom Verhaltenszustand 2 in Verhaltenszustand 1. Diese Epochen wurden von Hand in aufeinanderfolgenden Abschnitten von losec analysiert. Der Augenblick des Übergangs von einem Verhaltenszustand in den anderen wurde an der Änderung der Regularität der Atmung identifiziert. Die Äderung musste mindestens 3 Minuten oder langer dauern. Die Übergangsphasen von Zustand 1 in Zustand 2 waren konsistent kürzer als jene von Zustand 2 in Zustand 1, obwohl auch dabei grosse intra‐ und interindividuelle Unterschiede bestehen. 65 Prozent der Übergänge von Zustand 1 in Zustand 2 werden von generalisierten Bewegungen begleitet; bei abnormen Kindern war dies weniger der Fall. Die Übergänge in der Regelmässigkeit der Atmung wurde inkonsistent von Änderungen der EEG‐Muster, langsamen und schnellen Augenbewegungen und tonischer Aktivität in den Muskeln begleitet, selbst wenn mehrere Verhaltensübergänge in derselben Ableitung eines einzelnen Kindes verglichen wurden. Es konnte keine ‘fuhrende Variable’ gefunden werden, die regelmässig den Änderungen folgt oder ihnen vorausgeht. Manche abnorme Neugeborene haben Sequenzen in den Übergängen ihrer Verhaltenszustände, die bei gesunden Kindern nicht beobachtet werden konnten. Transiciones en el estado de sueño en reciŕn nacidos. Estudio preliminar No se conoce por que mecanismo un estado de sueño se cambia en otro durante el estado cíclico en el lactante. Una mejor comprensión de la ‘morfologia’ de los cambios (esto es su duración y frecuencia) en las variables registradas poligráficamente puede contribuir a su esclarecimiento. De un grupo de 12 registros de 6 horas en 11 reciŕn nacidos se analizaron manualmente en secuencias de 10 segundos, 45 ŕpocas peritransicionales del estado 1 (sueño tranquilo) a1 estado 2 (sueño activo) y el mismo número del estado 2 al estado 1. El cambio en la regularidad de la respiración durante tres minutos como mínimo, sirvió para identificar el momento de la transición. Las ŕpocas peritransicionales del estado 1 al estado 2 son más cortas que las del estado 2 al estado 1, aunque hay grandes diferencias intra‐ e interindividuales. El 65 por ciento de las transiciones del estado 1 al estado 2 se acompañan de movimientos groseros, aunque se ven menos en niños anormales. La secuencia de los cambios en los patrones de EEG en la aparición de movimientos oculares lentos y rápidos y en la actividad tónica muscular están en una relación no consistente en el tiempo con el cambio en la regularidad respiratoria, incluso si se analizan varias transiciones en el mismo registro de un mismo niño. Ninguna variable aislada pudo ser identificada, como precediendo o siguiendo de forma consistente un cambio en otra variable específica. Por otra parte en reciŕn nacidos anormales pueden hallarse secuencias que no han sido observadas en niños normales. © 1977 Mac Keith Press

AB  - The authors report a 32-yr-old woman suffering from anoxic encephalopathy with endocrinologic disorders. Three min postpartum cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness occurred. Several mth later, she obtained the awake-sleep rhythm pattern again but could not speak and sometimes displayed negativistic attitude and psychomotoric excitement. Meanwhile, she began to demonstrate dry skin, breast atrophy, amenorrhea, poliosis and baldness of axillar and pubic hairs. Laboratory findings revealed the dysfunction of thyroid gland. With these symptoms and results, the authors guessed post-partum pituitary necrosis (Sheehan) and then administrated steroid, decicated thyroid and neuroleptica. But with few changes of clinical symptoms, she expired 15 months after the onset of the complaints. At necropsy, macroscopically, there were diffuse cerebral atrophy, particularly great damage in bilateral middle- and inferior frontal gyri, superior- and middle temporal gyri, precuneus and lateral temporooccipital gyri. The vertico-frontal sections showed the moderate dilatation of ventricule and slight atrophy of caudate and putamen but globus pallidus was normal. There were no pathological findings in thalamus, brainstem and cerebellum. Histopathologically, in cerebral cortex, diffuse laminar necrosis with spongy state and proliferation of small vessels and gemistocytic astroglias were observed. In Ammon's horn, there was slightly ischemic change of nerve cell but in Sommer's sector, moderate loss of neuron and astrocytic proliferation. The caudate and putamen were only slightly changed. In globus pallidus, there were neither hemorrhagic nor necrotic foci. Thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem were intact. Cerebellum did not show remarkable changes. In white matter, variable diffuse pallor of myelin staining were seen. In hypophysis, macroscopically, severe atrophy was ascertained and histologically, it had diffuse fibrosis with partially small hemorrhagic patch in the anterior lobe cell and interstitial proliferation, but the posterior lobe was well preserved.

AB  - The nasal fossae with their anterior (nostrils) and posterior (conchae) orifices already formed and leaving a free passage for air in the fourth intrauterine month, cannot be considered a cavity but rather a tube with two free orifices. By a curious morphophysiologic phenomenon of the tongue, the nose is transformed in intrauterine life in a cavity that is pneumatized by hematogenic route with the gases of the pregnant mother's blood. The role of air in the nose in intrauterine life is very important and is described in the author's monograph on 'The Appearance of Hearing before Birth', which unquestionably demonstrates hematogenic pneumatization of all the cephalic cavities (nose, middle ear, antral cell, beginning of pneumatization of the mastoid bones, facial sinuses, etc.). Pneumatization of these cavities, apart from the nose, has been described in all the textbooks as occurring after birth, with atmospheric air. It is shown that in intrauterine life the tongue strongly compresses the soft palate and uvula against the posterior orifices of the nose which it closes hermetically. Water introduced with a syringe into the nose of a 5-6 months fetus does not penetrate in the mouth. By tight closing of the conchae the nose is transformed into a cavity that will be pneumatized, preventing the amniotic fluid from penetrating into the nose from the ear. This closing of the conchae by the soft palate and uvula suggested the idea of investigating the causes of snoring. The author considers that snoring is produced while sleeping on the back, because the uvula and soft palate fall toward the pharynx, acting as a stopper to the conchae, preventing breathing through the nose. Air pressure makes the uvula and soft palate vibrate to the rhythm of respiration, producing snoring. Proof is the snorer who wakes up and continues to sleep on one side when snoring ceases.

AB  - The marriage rate of epileptic patients was 62% in males und 78% in females. Compared with the rates in the general population, the male patients had a 15% lower rate, but there was no difference in females. There were 263 patients with at least one offspring selected for the study. There were 243 sons and 272 daughters (506 total, 1.9 per patient). Distribution by types of seizure was awakening grand mal, absence or myoclonic petit mal in 24%, grand mal with no aura in 21%, grand mal during sleep in 23%, diffuse grand mal in 7%, grand mal with aura in 13%, psychomotor seizure in 9%, and focal seizure in 3%. The probands were composed of 79% idiopathic and 21% symptomatic in pathogenetic classification. An epileptic EEG abnormality was demonstrated in 22% of male and 44% of female probands. The incidence of seizures among offspring was 2.4% (4.2% age-corrected) in a narrow sense (epilepsy) and 9.1% in a broad sense including febrile convulsions. The latter morbidity was 11.0% for the idiopathic and 3.2% for the symptomatic group; 11.0% for female and 6.9% for male probands; 10.2% for sons and 8.1% for daughters. The figure was higher for the probands with the age range at onset of seizure of 0-4 years (20.6%) and 20-29 years (12.6%) than for those with other age ranges; higher for those with awakening grand mal, absence, myoclonic petit mal, or grand mal with no aura than for those with other types of seizure; and higher for those with family history of epilepsy than those without it. Possible correlation of types of seizure between probands and offspring was demonstrated. Thirty-seven percent of offspring exhibited epileptic EEG abnormalities, and the ratio of epileptic EEG abnormalities to clinical manifestation is about 4:1. Possible existence of familial aggregation of EEG abnormalities and of two kinds of families with large or small epileptic predisposition was indicated. The importance of the role of hereditary and environmental factors in epileptic pathogenesis is proved, and the results of an investigation of congenital malformation among offspring of epileptic mothers are presented. These results were considered to be useful for genetic counseling of epileptic patients. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The development of the adrenal corticosterone and progesterone diurnal rhythms was retarded by a single injection of cortisol acetate, dexamethasone acetate or progesterone into 3-day-old female rats. This effect was transient with the establishment of the corticosterone rhythm by day 70. The retardation of adrenal hormone rhythmicity may alter the normal process of sexual maturation, because cortisol and dexamethasone-treated animals but not progesterone treated rats exhibited a desynchronization of the events associated with puberty. Vaginal opening was delayed, and dissociated from first ovulation in these rats. Further, neonatal cortisol administration lengthened the estrous cycle in adulthood. It can be concluded from our study that the maturation of the neural centers controlling adrenal steroid secretion may be essential for the proper timing of pubertal events in the female rat. © 1976.

AB  - The most potent environmental synchronizer of 'biologic clocks' in mammals is the light dark cycle. The author describes experiments that identify a particular pathway, a direct connection between retina and hypothalamus, as the main route by which such biologic rhythms as the daily activity cycle, the estrous cycle, and the annual reproductive cycle are entrained to the external environment.

AB  - Total protein and the so called classical blood plasma fractions were examined in hourly intervals over 24 hours in ten clinically intact pregnant Jersey cows. The average total protein values recorded from the plasma samples were 6.9% and thus physiologically normal. The arithmetic mean values within one circadian rhythm did not differ markedly within each of the following fractions: albumin (38.7 ± 5.08), α1-globulin (11.22 ± 2.22), α2-globulin (14.25 ± 1.95), and β-globulins (12.56 ± 0.91). Moderate rises were established only for the γ-globulins at 1 a.m., 7 a.m., and 7 p.m. The protein fractions of blood plasma, consequently, are not subject to any circadian rhythm, and the time of blood sampling, therefore, has no bearings on laboratory diagnosis.

AB  - Elevation of arterial blood pressure complicates one-fifth of all pregnancies and contributes significantly to perinatal mortality. Despite the improvements in antenatal and neonatal care over the past ten years the perinatal mortality rate for pregnancy complicated by hypertension is unchanged. A longitudinal study of the variability of blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive patients has been commenced and the initial results show that the method is safe and acceptable to the patient, and confirms that arterial blood pressure (as in the non-pregnant subject) has a diurnal variation, and changes with posture.

AB  - Using an automatic indirect method of measurement, diurnal blood pressure patterns have been studied in normal and hypertensive pregnancies. In the last trimester, normotensive and hypertensive pregnant subjects show small but significant increases of blood pressure that develop especially during the evening and night. This change is more clear-cut for the systolic than the diastolic pressure. The tendency to a relatively greater increased pressure at night is exaggerated in preeclampsia. This fact explains earlier observations of a dimunution of the nocturnal fall of blood pressure in preeclampsia. In very severe preeclampsia, the nocturnal increase of blood pressure may be so exaggerated as to reverse the normal diurnal blood pressure pattern. These changes have been documented sequentially, and their implications are discussed briefly.

AB  - Two or three fetal lambs regularly result in a varying degree of carbohydrate shortage in mother ewes in late pregnancy. We have investigated the correlation between plasma insulin, growth hormone and energy substrate concentrations in ewes 8 and 1 wk before lambing. Plasma growth hormone was fairly constant (2-3 ng/ml) throughout the 24 hr cycle 8 wk before parturition. Seven weeks later higher average levels and increased diurnal fluctuations were observed in 3 out of 4 multiparous ewes. The average post absorptive insulin levels were reduced by 50% during the same interval. Simultaneously decreased post absorptive sugar and increased acetoacetate levels were observed. It is concluded that the hormonal adaptations to the increasing carbohydrate deficit in late pregnancy, especially among multiparous ewes, included: reduced post absorptive plasma insulin levels, reduced insulin responses to feeding, and increased levels of growth hormone in the plasma.

AB  - Methods for management of diabetic pregnancy in the outpatient setting require strict glucose control. To assess the effect of diet and injection of short and intermediate acting insulin on glucose, diabetic patients tested their urine daily for glucose and had biweekly serum glucose tests. A brief metabolic ward study in 9 diabetic patients during the third trimester yielded hourly glucose determinations. These results defined the range of serum glucose over a 24 hour period. Glucose data on 6 normal third trimester women also came from hourly glucose values. Glucose results of normal and diabetic subjects were similar. A 16th subject with diabetic eye, renal, and foot complications is included as a case report to illustrate management technics. Infants of the diabetic women had no perinatal mortality, morbidity, or macrosomia and thus differ from an earlier study where glucose was not strictly controlled. The data suggest hospitalization can be short and low perinatal morbidity and mortality are possible with this outpatient method of management of the pregnant diabetic patient.

AB  - This review has examined the evidence from both clinical and experimental data that insulin has a key role in stimulating fetal growth. Human disorders where excessive insulin secretion and beta cell hyperplasia are present result in fetal overgrowth. Experimental models confirm an important anabolic effect of insulin in utero. Contrasted with this data is the evidence of intrauterine growth retardation occurring in association with insulinopenia or total absence of fetal insulin. Without the anabolic effect of insulin, no amount of substrate will induce optimal growth. It is evident from both the clinical and experimental data that sensitivity to insulin (probably individual receptor sites) develops in the latter stages of pregnancy. This point of sensitivity to the anabolic action of insulin has yet to be identified in a number of fetal tissues.

AB  - Nocturnal peaks in core body temperature of rats during the estrous cycle were highest during the night of ovulation (23.00-02.00 hr, proestrus-estrus) and lowest during the night before (diestrus 2 proestrus). Less dramatic diurnal secondary peaks, absent only during estrus, occurred 3-4 h after the onset of daylight. After induction of pseudopregnancy, mean temperature declined, but both daily peaks persisted until the first postluteal estrus, when the secondary peak was again absent transiently. Ovariectomy reduced mean core temperature and abolished all secondary peaks. In contrast, castration during pseudopregnancy did not abolish the secondary peaks. When cyclic rats were gonadectomized (abolishing the secondary rhythm) it was possible to reestablish this rhythm by stimulating the uterine cervix (as if to induce pseudopregnancy). However, in animals exposed to darkness (which also abolishes the secondary rhythm) reinduction by cervical stimulation was ineffective. These results indicated that the integrity of the secondary peak, though dependent on photoperiod, nevertheless was influenced by a neuroendocrine reflex arc.

AB  - Radiotelemetry of core temperature in unrestrained, mature female rats revealed the existence of a 24 h rhythm that was bimodal. The principal peak occurred during the night under control conditions of 14 h light and 10 h darkness, and a less pronounced, secondary peak occurred 3-4 h after the onset of the light phase. Shifts in the phase of the photoperiod or alteration of the proportion of light per day revealed that the temperature rhythm was entrained by light, but that the two component peaks were governed by different aspects of the lighting regimen. Exposure of rats to continuous darkness, continuous light, or to a 20 h photoperiod revealed that the primary rhythm was endogenous, entrained by circadian photoperiods only, whereas the secondary rhythm was exogenous, requiring a circadian light/dark rhythm. A relationship between mean core temperature and the proportion of light per day was severely altered after pinealectomy, but no effect on rhythmicity was noted. The data indicated that the pineal gland regulates a light/dark dependent set point about which oscillations in core temperature may be generated.

AB  - Studies on the response of female rats to various stresses during the course of lactation showed a marked reduction in pituitary-adrenal activity. Maximum suppression coincided with the period of maximum lactation, about 14 days after parturition. Both pituitary corticotropin and the release of corticosterone were significantly reduced. Females showing maternal behaviour but not lactating did not exhibit this buffering of the stress response. Another aspect of pituitary-adrenal activity has been studied in lactating female rats. Females, although they have a buffered stress response, responded differently, in terms of pituitary-adrenal activity, to stimuli emitted by the pups: pups which are exposed to noxious stimuli elicit a much greater pituitary-adrenal response in lactating females than do pups which are merely handled. Separation from the pups does not elicit a pituitary-adrenal response. This difference in response is modified if the infants are malnourished and is not observed in virgin animals that are not lactating.

AB  - The basal plasma concentration of prolactin was determined by radioimmunoassay in Caucasian women at different risk for breast cancer and in three races of women at risk for breast cancer. Samples taken under comparable conditions showed similar basal levels at birth and in prepubertal Bantu and Caucasian girls, or in healthy pre and postmenopausal Bantu, Caucasian, or Japanese women. Elevated plasma prolactin levels were found in women castrated prior to 35 years of age and in women whose first pregnancy occurred after 35 years. Evidence indicates that the prolactin/estrogen relationship may not be similar in women 35 to 45 years of age as compared to young women and suggests that elevation of serum prolactin per se does not appear to be related to an increased risk of breast cancer. The prolactin level was increased only in Caucasian women with breast cancer. If a high prolactin/estradiol ratio increases the susceptibility of the mammary epithelium to neoplastic growth, the lack of changes in prolactin levels in premenopausal Japanese patients and in postmenopausal patients of the three ethnic groups indicates that other factors are involved. Further study of the effects of life style and diet on the basal level and stimulated release of prolactin is required to resolve the relationship of prolactin to breast cancer.

AB  - The diet and feeding patterns of developing rats were determined from feed bin weight losses and analysis of stomach contents (details in a previous report). Parotid gland development in the same rats was assessed from the specific activities of the secretory enzymes α amylase, RNase and DNase, with particular attention to the occurrence of circadian variations. The results indicate that during the first wk post partum, rats suckle much more by day than by night but have no circadian cycles in their parotid glands. Between 10 and 20 days, there were no consistent cycles either in feeding activity or in parotid enzymes. The progressive change from milk to stock diet between 14 and 30 days appears to promote the maturation of the parotid gland. The halfway point in the dietary change at 21 days coincides with the onset of inversely related circadian cycles in feeding and the parotid enzymes. Premature weaning at 21 days accentuates both cycles and accelerates parotid maturation. The findings indicate that the physical consistency of the diet has an important regulatory role in the developmental patterns of feeding activity and parotid glands of rats, but they also hint that other dietary qualities may be involved. Chronologic fluctuations in plasma corticosterone suggest an intricate relationship among this hormone, feeding behavior, and parotid glands in developing rats.

AB  - Electrical activity of the brain was examined throughout the estrous cycle in the 4 day cycling female rat by means of recording integrated multiple unit activity (MUA). Circadian rhythmicity and that with estrous cycle were confirmed in many regions of the brain. MUA level was higher in the afternoon in medial preoptic area (MPO), arcuate median eminence region (ARC) and medial amygdala (m AMYG) throughout the cycle. MUA level increased with the course of the cycle and reached the maximum level around the critical period in MPO and ARC and on diestrus 2 (D II) in m AMYG. Higher MUA level was observed during the dark period in the lateral amygdala (l AMYG), hippocampus (HPC) and fornix (Fx) throughout the cycle. MUA level decreased accompanying with the course of the cycle and the minimum level was observed around the critical period in l AMYG, HPC and Fx. Rather clear circadian rhythmicity was observed in the MPO and ARC of the MPO roof cut rat. ARC MUA was enhanced after estradiol 17 β administration and HPC MUA was facilitated after progesterone administration on diestrus 1. Estradiol benzoate (EB) implantation into m AMYG on D II facilitated ARC MUA on the following day and advanced ovulation by one day in 5 day cycles. Serum LH and FSH levels increased but prolactin level decreased after m AMYG stimulation in the EB primed ovariectomized rat. LH, FSH and prolactin levels decreased after HPC stimulation. From these results, the following mechanisms in the brain are suggested. As the inhibitory action of HPC, Fx and l AMYG begins to decrease with the progress of the estrous cycle, first m AMYG activity starts to rise and then drive MPO ARC activity. Thus ARC enhances its activity and pulls the trigger of ovulatory LH discharge at the critical period when inhibitory effects from limbic structures become the lowest. Limbic forebrain structures exert both inhibitory and facilitatory influences on basal hypothalamic regions to modulate their rhythmicities.

AB  - Daily, weekly, and within day variations in copper, iron, and zinc contents of human milk were investigated in order to determine whether one sample from an individual is representative of these elements. Total solids, fat, and protein contents were also measured. Fifty women in their 6th to 12th week of lactation each provided seven milk samples consisting of five consecutive daily samples and two additional samples collected either within a single day or at weekly intervals. Fat varied the most of all constituents and total milk solids reflected this variability. Values ranged from 0.2 to 10.4 g/100 ml for fat and from 8.58 to 17.49 g/100 ml for total solids. Protein varied from 0.76 to 2.04 g/100 ml among individuals, with little variation within an individual. Copper content varied considerably among women and within the same woman. With a large proportion of low values, the range was 0.09 to 0.63 μg/ml. Iron content was also found to vary within women as well as among women. Values ranged from < 0.1 to 1.6 μg/ml with a preponderance of low values. Zinc content was more evenly distributed over the range 0.14 to 3.95 μg/ml, and within an individual it did not vary widely. A representative estimate of copper and iron contents would therefore require multiple samples, whereas only one sample may provide a representative estimate of zinc content. Comparison of morning, midday, and evening values showed that copper and zinc are higher in the morning and iron is lower at this time. Increased amounts of copper, iron, and zinc were found in multiparous women whether or not they had previously lactated. Milk from older women had lower iron and higher copper and zinc contents than that from younger women. No differences were found in milk of women receiving dietary mineral and vitamin supplements. Calculations indicated that fully breast fed infants under 3 months of age receive approximately 0.35 mg/kg per day of zinc and 0.05 mg/kg per day of both copper and iron.

AB  - The authors obtained early case histories of 16 children with chronic nonspecific diarrhea and 16 control subjects and found that the index subjects had a significantly higher frequency of sleep problems, crying and irritability, digestive problems excluding diarrhea, overactivity, resistance to discipline, and family history of gastrointestinal problems. They conclude that these behavioral characteristics represent temperamental traits based on physiological factors, perhaps an imbalance of autonomic nervous system function. They speculate that chronic nonspecific diarrhea may occur in association with certain temperamental traits because both the somatic and psychic components stem from a common disturbance in autonomic nervous system function.

AB  - Adult male, female and pregnant rats were treated with single and repeated doses of carbamazepine (CBZ). The time course of the drug concentrations in plasma and tissues was followed. In all cases, data on plasma levels were subjected to pharmacokinetic analyses. Attempts were made to relate the pharmacokinetic properties of carbamazepine to its effect on pentobarbital sleeping time and on protection against electroshock. After intense and repeated administration, it was found that male rats eliminate carbamazepine faster than females: total body clearance (TB C) was was 16 ml/min/kg and 9.4 ml/min/kg, respectively. Two dose levels (25 and 50 mg/kg) had the same pharmacokinetic properties in young rats. Pregnant rats cleared CBZ to a lesser extent than controls. CBZ was found to accelerate its own elimination after repeated administration in both adult and young rats as revealed by the shortening of its half life and an increase of 50% in clearance. Moreover, the protection against electroshock was significantly reduced after repeated administration, compared with a single dose administration. Repeated administration of CBZ in rats shortens pentobarbital sleeping time and significantly decreases the level of pentobarbital in the brain.

AB  - The fetal alcohol syndrome is the clinical occurrence of mental retardation, growth failure, and certain physiognomic, anatomic, and physiologic features characteristically found in about one half of the infants of severely alcoholic mothers. As is true in most syndromes there is no one unifying observable feature, but rather a complex of morphological and behavioral features which form the syndrome. These are readily recognized and allow the distinction of the syndrome which now is the third leading cause of mental retardation in Seattle, Washington, where it was first described and is presently recognized. After the first description of the syndrome in 1973, several other workers provided additional cases which corroborate the initial description. Palmer and associates, while demonstrating the growth retardation, microcephaly, and physical malformations of the progeny of alcoholic mothers, also demonstrated that there is little evidence for a malnutrition factor or genetic factor being responsible for the syndrome. There is solid evidence that alcohol readily crosses the blood brain and placental barriers of the fetus. Both alcohol labeled with radioactive carbon (C14) and blood sample specimens have demonstrated that the alcohol passes from the maternal circulation to the fetus in approximately the same concentration as in the mother. Clinical demonstration of neonatal alcoholic withdrawal supports these findings. The effect of alcohol is direct toxic damage to the fetus. The generalized nature of the changes seen in the fetal alcohol syndrome support this concept. The syndrome is heralded at birth by an increased incidence of breech deliveries. The infant is small in length in comparison to weight. The ponderal indices for the infants with the syndrome have been within normal limits for gestational age, while most affected infants have been below the third percentile for weight, height, and head circumference. There is no definitive study of the placentas from these pregnancies, although severely alcoholic mothers have a fatal fetal outcome in a significant proportion of their pregnancies. Jones, Smith, Streissguth and Myrianthopoulos recorded a 17% perinatal mortality in one study group.

AB  - The blood pressures and pulse rates of 257 normal full term infants and their mothers were measured two to four days after birth. Birthweight was correlated with systolic (P=.038), but not with diastolic blood pressure. Infants who were asleep had significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure than infants who were awake (P<.001). Sex, body length, and feedings did not appear to influence infant's blood pressure nor did the anesthesia given to the mothers. Maternal diastolic pressure correlated with infant's diastolic pressure (regression coefficient, .128) (P<.01), whereas for systolic pressure the regression coefficient between maternal and infant pressure was .085 (P=NS). The aggregation between the diastolic blood pressures of infants and mothers was not influenced by birthweight, age of the mother, or medication administered to the mother. The pulse rates of black infants were significantly higher than those of white infants (P<.002). There was no correlation between the pulse rates and blood pressures in infants.

AB  - 232 patients attending a breast clinic with breast pain as the primary presenting symptom were studied prospectively to define clinical syndromes and to attempt to elucidate aetiological factors. Those women in whom mastalgia was a minor aspect of their complaint, or who were primarily seeking reassurance that they did not have cancer, were excluded. Most mastalgia patients could be placed into well-defined subgroups on the basis of clinical, radiological, and pathological features. After excluding causes of pain arising outside the breast, six specific groups with widely differing aetiological bases were defined, leaving only 7% unclassified lithout known aetiology. The six defined groups were cyclical pronounced mastalgia, (believed to be hormonally based), duct ectasia. Tietze syndrome, trauma, sclerosing adenosis, and cancer. Psychological factors were found to be less important than has been previously suggested. Classification of patients with mastalgia into homogeneous subgroups is a prerequisite of any therapeutic study.

AB  - Katamnestic neurological and electroencephalographic studies were performed on a group of 6 to 11 years old children who had beed born in the years of 1960 to 1966 with the signs of placental dysfunction. Of a total of 288 children (2,8% of the deliveries at the department of obstetrics & gynecology of the Cologne university) 177 were analized katamnestically and 152 underwent a clinical examination. For comparison a group of 384 children were studied who had been born in the same years spontaneously from vertex presentation after a maximum duration of labour of 16 hours. At the time of delivery these children were mature and eutrophic. 133 children of this group were studied katamnestically and 114 underwent clinical examination. The katamnestic studies showed that the group with symptoms of placental dysfunction differed in their development from the control group: these children learned later to sit, to walk, to speak, to dress without help, and to control urination. No differences were found in the ability to write and to read or in their results at school. However a larger percentage of the control group was found to attend a higher educational institution. No differences were found in the incidence of disease or behavioral abnormalities. Sleeping problems and lack concentration were more often observed in the group of children with symptoms of placental dysfunction. The general clinical examination showed no differences between the two groups. The applied different tests to examine gross movements were performed less perfect in a higher percentage by the children born with signs of placental dysfunction. Even greater differences were found in testing the voluntery skilled movements. The electroencephalogram of children of both groups showed a normal basic activity, a distinct blocking effect and a significant activation upon hyperventilation. An abnormal and pathological EEG was however significantly more often found in children born with symptoms of placental dysfunction. The results of the examination of the individual children and the combination of these results in the groups of symptoms showed that children with signs of placental dysfunction demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of symptoms. It was furthermore obvious that these symptoms were not singular but part of a complex disturbance which was manifested in the obstetrical characteristics as well as in the katamnesis and in the clinical examination. Thus, these studies have demonstrated a higher rate of morbidity in children with placental dysfunction in addition to the known high perinatal mortality. This points to the necessity of an early prepartual diagnosis in particular in pregnancies with predisposition, in order to reduce not only the perinatal mortality but also to avoid the described complications in children born after placental dysfunction. © 1976 J.

AB  - To examine differences among pregnant diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, serum glucose, and immunoreactivity of C-peptide, free and total insulin were measured at hourly intervals during a 24-h third trimester metabolic ward evaluation. Six normals, three mild, and four juvenile-onset type diabetics were studied. Diets were identical for all subjects. Mild diabetics differed from juvenile diabetics by having significant residual pancreatic B-cell function, as measured by C-peptide immunoreactivity. Short and intermediate acting insulins given once or twice daily to diabetics maintained serum glucose levels within the normal range throughout the 24 h. Despite wide variation in serum total insulin levels, peripheral free insulin concentrations in well-controlled diabetics fell within a relatively narrow range that was higher than in controls. Infants of the diabetic subjects were comparable to the offspring of the control women. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Providing patients with clear, informative explanations has the beneficial effect of allowing them to participate in their own care. In this week's Journal, Scott and Rose show that childbirth education reduces narcotic use, the number of forceps deliveries and recourse to nerve-block anesthesia during labor. Many physicians remain unconvinced about the advantages of maternal education and consider it costly in time and money. A mere decade ago, conventional wisdom accepted padded side rails, restraints, the wails and writhing of “twilight sleep” (scopolamine, a barbiturate and a narcotic) as the best obstetric practice. The mother had amnesia; the father, relegated. © 1976, Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The alternation between NREM-REM sleep occurs in the foetal lamb as an ultradian rhythm with a period of 30-40 min. until 6 to 8 hrs. before birth. Cycling of sleep-wakefulness in the neonate is related to a circadian cycle of exploratory activity and feeding, to an ultradian basic rest activity cycle and to an alternation between NREM-REM within a period of sleep.

AB  - Concentrations of 17 free amino acids were measured in the serum of 15 healthy pregnant women at the end of pregnancy in intervals of 4-5 h. A circadian rhythm with its concentration peak at 5 p.m. could be observed for Ser, Val, Met, Ile, Leu, His, Lys and Arg. Exogenic and endogenic synchronizators are being discussed as possible causes for these fluctuations during the day. The rhythm of the free amino acids makes it necessary that only fasting blood is examined and that the time of day is always registered when the blood specimen is taken. © 1976 J. F. Bergmann-Verlag.

AB  - 1. Changes in the plasma kinin precursor, kininogen, occur following treatment with oestrogens and progestogens. This work was undertaken to attempt to relate plasma kininogen values to hormonal changes in various reproductive states. 2. During the oestrous cycle kininogen concentrations follow a nychthemeral rhythm, kininogen depletion occurring during the increase in general activity of the rat. 3. Superimposed on the nychthemeral changes in kininogen concentration are changes which may be related to the hormonal events of the oestrous cycle. 4. During early pregnancy and pseudopregnancy the kininogen level rises; this increase may be due to changes in the circulating levels of oestrogens and progestogens. 5. It is suggested that the changes in kininogen concentration may result from utilization of kinin which could be of functional significance. © 1976 The Physiological Society

AB  - Normal values of unconjugated, total, and immunoreactive (measured without extraction) plasma estriol (E3) have been determined from radioimmunoassay data obtained in 217 uncomplicated third-trimester pregnancies. Small but significant diurnal variations in unconjugated and total plasma E3 have been observed in a study comprising 12 women who were hospitalized during late pregnancy for diabetes, toxemia, or placenta previa. The late morning decreases in unconjugated and the afternoon/evening decreases in total plasma E3 concentrations, averaging some 10 to 15 per cent, were overshadowed by considerable episodic fluctuations and may thus be clinically irrelevant. Day-to-day changes of unconjugated and total plasma E3 concentrations in late pregnancy were similar and smaller than changes in urinary E3 measurements. The urinary E3/creatinine ratio, however, reducing inadequacies of 24 hour urine collections, varied less than unconjugated or total plasma E3. The data suggest that a decrease in unconjugated or total plasma E3 must exceed 40 to 45 per cent of the mean of the three preceding determinations if it is to be considered a signal of fetal distress. © 1976.

AB  - Destruction of the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the golden hamster by bilateral radiofrequency lesions abolishes three well-documented circadian rhythms - locomotor activity, estrous cyclicity, and photoperiodic photosensitivity. Entrainment of these rhythms by light cycles fails in lesioned hamsters; females become persistently estrous; in both sexes locomotor activity becomes sporadic, confined primarily to the light instead of darkness, and is totally arrhythmic when lesioned animals are exposed to continuous darkness; the photoperiodic gonadal response (gonadal regression induced by short day lengths) is abolished; lesioned animals remain reproductively mature irrespective of photoperiodic treatment.

AB  - (1) Two central neural mechanisms are neceessary for the regulation of diurnal rhythms in mammals. The first is a visual pathway to mediate the effects of light in the entrainment of such rhythms. The second is an endogenous 'clock' mechanism. (2) The retinohypothalamic projection terminating in the suprachiasmatic hypothalamic nuclei appears to be the visual pathway which mediates entrainment of rhythms. (3) Ablation of the suprachiasmatic nuclei results in loss of diurnal rhythms indicating that this region of the hypothalamus plays an essential role in the endogenous central generation of rhythmic functions. © 1976.

AB  - Reversal of the normal diurnal blood pressure pattern has been demonstrated in women with severe hypertension and renal impairment in pregnancy (pre eclampsia). Maximum arterial pressure occurred at night in these women. The phenomenon was not due to hypotensive drug therapy or posture. Patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension in pregnancy retained a normal diurnal blood pressure pattern. Nocturnal hypertension in pre eclampsia is of theoretical interest and practical importance.

AB  - In constant dim illumination the hamster estrous cycle free runs with a period that is a quadruple multiple of the concurrently recorded rhythm of wheel running activity; both activity and estrous cycles are generated by biological clocks. Maintenance of stable phase angle differences between heat onset and running onset before and after treatment with deuterium oxide suggests that a common circadian system generates periodicities in estrus and activity. An organization of the estrous cycle is proposed in which the stimulus for the ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone is generated by a circadian system that includes the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Various possible interactions of estradiol and photoperiod with the neurogenic stimulus for the luteinizing hormone surge are described and implications of different types of circadian organization of the estrous cycle for theories of sexual differentiation are considered.

They are present from early gestation (0.27 of term in both species) and in sheep are associated with rapid-eye-movement sleep. The movements are irregular, episodic and have a diurnal rhythm. They are readily abolished by hypoxemia and have proved, in both sheep and in man, a useful indicator of fetal health in utero. Some of the biological implications are considered in relation to early development of the lungs and of sleep state. © 1976 Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press

AB  - In order to investigate pituitary adrenal relationships in fetus and pregnant women, plasma ACTH levels were measured in pregnant women and in the umbilical cord using radioimmunoassay. Basal morning plasma ACTH levels of pregnant women were usually within normal limits, but slightly elevated in some cases at the late stage of pregnancy. A normal circadian rhythm was maintained. Negative feedback control mechanism appeared normal when assessed by a dexamethasone suppression test. Plasma ACTH levels of umbilical cord and maternal blood were determined during vaginal and Cesarian delivery. Plasma ACTH levels were remarkably elevated in both cord and maternal blood. In Cesarian delivery, plasma ACTH levels in maternal blood were usually not so high. In some cases, ACTH in the umbilical cord blood was higher than that in maternal blood. ACTH was not detected in the cord blood of an anencephalic child. These results suggest that the fetus can regulate its ACTH secretion independently from that of the mother.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide information concerning the amount of nuclear binding sites for estrogen in endometrial cells during the first week of pregnancy in the rat. The “insoluble” (high-salt non-extractable) binding during the first four days of pregnancy follows a circadian rhythm, with a maximal value at midnight, and a minimal one at noon. By day 5, the amount plateaus at a minimal value. The number of estradiol binding sites of the soluble (high-salt extractable) nuclear fraction shows a similar pattern. All the necessary elements for the estrogen-dependent induction of endometrial receptivity for nidation appear, therefore, to be present already by day 3, but the turningon of the endometrial response to estrogen on day 4 seems to depend on additional factor(s). © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The present study was designed to determine whether environmental factors other than light would alter the daily periodicity in the rat's maternal behavior and whether such a change in the dam's behavior pattern would in turn alter the pattern of her sucklings' milk intake. Experiment 1 determined the daily pattern of litter weight gain (which presumably reflects milk intake) displayed by young reared by dams fed and watered either ad lib (Group C), only during the day (Group D), or only at night (Group N). Experiment 2 compared nocturnal and diurnal frequency of maternal behavior in Groups C, D, and N. The pattern of both litter weight gain and maternal behavior was observed to be diurnal in Groups C and N and nocturnal in Group D. Copyright © 1976 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - 1.The excretion of estrogens by 42 menstruant and 7 pregnant (1st trimester) women ranged from 2 - 550 μg/24hr.2.These changes were followed by measuring estrogen to creatinine ratios in small samples of urine.3.Values of the ratio changed little in each 24 hr, and correlated closely with daily estrogen output4.The data suggests that ovarian activity in women, including those given gonadotropins to induce ovulation, may be followed by measuring estrogen to creatinine ratios in small samples of urine; the collection of 24 hr samples is unnecessary. © 1976.

AB  - Sex difference in the circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic content of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) and plasma corticosterone levels was examined in the rat. In the male rat the CRF content was higher in the afternoon than in the morning. In contrast, the hypothalamic CRF content in the female rat was higher in the morning. The peak value was found at 8 a.m. and it fell rapidly around noon with a concomitant sharp rise in the plasma corticosterone. Thus, the whole pattern of CRF content during a 24-hour period makes a mirror image of that of plasma corticosterone. The influence of gonadal hormones on the sex difference was then examined by following variations in the CRF content after ovariectomy. Even after chronic ovariectomy, essential features of the female pattern of CRF rhythm persisted: rapid fall of the CRF content was accompanied by a sharp rise in the plasma corticosterone level. It is noteworthy however that ovariectomy reduced the morning level of CRF activity without elevating the afternoon level, resulting in a peak shift toward noon. The female pattern of CRF rhythmpersisted similarly after bilateral ganglionectomy which is known to affect the biogenic amine rhythm in the pineal gland. The persistence of the female pattern may suggest some endogenous nature of the rhythm. It was then possibly that sex differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS) might be related with manifestation of the female pattern. In order to elucidate this point, postnatal development of circadian rhythm of CRF activity was examined in male and female rats separately. It was found that the CRF rhythm became manifest both in male and female rats around the third week of postnatal life and there was no essential difference in their rhythm pattern. In other words, both male and female rats begin their CRF rhythm with so-called male pattern, with higher values in the afternoon than in the end of the third week of life. In contrast, the CRF rhythm in females rats showed a marked change at ages of five to six weeks during which the onset of puberty intervened in our series of experiment;during this period, the CRF rhythm in female rats turned into the so-called female pattern, with higher values of CRF activity in the morning than in the afternoon. It was of interest that a marked rise in the plasma corticosterone, characteristic of mature female rats, concomitantly appeared. Further attempt were made to examine the effect of gonadal hormones in the periratal period. The hypothalamic CRF content in androgen sterilized female rats as well as in neonatally castrated male rats showed no circadian rhythm. The results implicate subtleness of hormonal effect in simulating physiological processes. In fact, CRF rhythms are variable depending on stages of the estrous cycle: during proestrus and estrus, the CRF content was markedly higher in the morning (9 a.m.) than in the afternoon (4 p.m.). But no significant difference was observed between them during diestrus I and II...

AB  - In order to understand better the evolution and adaptive value of hibernation, ecological aspects and experimental studies of closely related hibernators, the Marmotini, are examined. The central hypothesis is that annual changes in the environment integrate three or, perhaps, four physiological processes: torpor, reporduction, consumption of food, and metabolism. Reproduction occurs promptly after emergence from hibernation. For most species, the breeding season is very short. Although the experimental data are rather meager, no variation in external factors has consistently altered the season of reproduction. Consumption of food and change in weight increases until July or September and then decreases. The large members of the Marmotini store their energy as fat, but small species store their energy as seeds and nuts. Experiments to test the hypothesis that some aspect of the supply, such as fat content, might vary seasonally have produced negative results. Complex experiments on the length of the photoperiod on woodchucks and several species of ground squirrels failed to alter the annual cycle of consumption of food. Animals kept in constant conditions showed a cycle of about 11 months, but woodchucks sent tto Australia changed their cycle in two years to match the seasons of the southern hemisphere. Experiments with temperature and torpor and castration did not alter the annual did not alter the rhythm...

AB  - The chronoperiodicity in response to a single intra-amniotic injection of 40 mg prostaglandin F2α. for the induction of a mid-trimester abortion in 73 patients has been studied. The induction-abortion interval was significantly shorter when the initial intra-amniotic injection was given between 12.00 and 14.00 hours, than when it was given at other times of day. This possible chronoperiodicity is different from that previously reported. The reasons for this are unknown at present. © 1976.

Samples were taken during 24-h intervals at the end of each 3 wk. Sharp and similar peaks in rumen ammonia followed feeding of urea and gelatinized urea-starch product twice daily in the concentrate mixture. A much lower ammonia peak followed the once daily feeding of the complete ration. Use of complete rations offered ad libitum eliminates the need for products with sustained ammonia release. © 1976, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pattern of plasma prolactin following uterine cervical stimulation consists of two surges each day, one nocturnal, occurring between 0100-0900 h (lights on 0600-1800 h), and one diurnal, occurring between 1500-2100 h. This pattern of prolactin continued throughout pseudopregnancy; the last surge was observed on the morning of day 11 (day 1 was taken as the first day of diestrus of pregnancy or pseudopregnancy). Prolactin levels remained low thereafter until the spontaneous proestrous surge on the afternoon of day 12, signalling the onset of a new estrous cycle. In contrast, the two daily prolactin surges did not continue throughout pregnancy, and in fact, were terminated sooner in pregnant animals than in pseudopregnant animals. The last diurnal surge was observed on day 8 while the last nocturnal surge was observed on day 10. The early termination of prolactin surges during pregnancy correlated with the increased secretion of rat placental lactogen. However, placental extracts obtained from day 11 of pregnancy and injected in large doses failed to inhibit prolactin surges in pseudopregnant animals. Prolactin surges also continued for a longer period of time in pseudopregnant rats bearing decidualized uteri than in pregnant animals. Thus, the two major components of pregnancy that differed from pseudopregnancy, that is, the presence of rat placental lactogen or decidual tissue, did not appear to account for the early termination of prolactin surges during pregnancy. © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The mean values and the 95% confidence intervals have been calculated by means of 111 estimations in duplicate of the levels of unconjugated oestradiol and oestriol in serum of normal pregnant women between the 24th and the 42nd gestational week. During the period examined, the levels of oestradiol were doubled, while the values of oestriol rose almost fivefold. The level of unconjugated oestriol in serum was significantly correlated with the urinary excretion of total oestriol. The day to day variation of conjugated oestradiol and oestriol in serum during a period of 8 days was examined in 8 women with normal pregnancies and in 8 women with pregnancies complicated by slight preeclampsia. The mean coefficient of variation for the levels of oestradiol was 13.5% in the women with normal pregnancies, and 15.8% in the women with pregnancies complicated by slight pre eclampsia, while the corresponding figures for the levels of oestriol were 12.7% and 13.5%. These day to day variations only amount to almost half of the day variation of the urinary excretion of total oestriol. The diurnal variation of unconjugated oestradiol in serum did not show systematical fluctuations. However, the values of unconjugated oestriol at 08.00 A.M. were found to be at a significantly lower level as compared to the values of the rest of the 24 hr period examined. By means of the two assays reported here, it should be possible to follow pregnant women and to detect single values lying outside those of the normal material and to reveal series of values with greater variations than those here reported especially towards the levels. With the present knowledge of the biosynthesis of oestrogens during pregnancy, the fetal condition will most likely more closely be reflected by the measurement of unconjugated oestriol in serum than of oestradiol.

AB  - An 18-year-old phenotypic girl with XY gonadal agenesis had endocrine studies. The patient had a small amount of sexual hair, a slightly enlarged clitoris, normal labia and no posterior fusion. Her vagina was of normal length, but no cervix was palpable. At laparoscopy, no gonads, uterus or fallopian tubes were identified. The buccal smear was chromatin negative and the karyotype was 46 XY. The 24 h LH plasma pattern was qualitatively similar to that found in normal late pubertal subjects, but the values were in the castrate range. The 24 h mean plasma concentrations of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were 16.4 ng/dl and 14.2 ng/dl, respectively. Urinary estrogen excretion was 15 and 19 /μg/day. These clinical and endocrine findings suggest that the patient was a genetic male in whom Mullerian regression occurred normally; however, the testes probably ceased functioning early in gestation preventing normal development of the Wolffian system. This set of events resulted in agenesis of the gonaductal system and female external genitalia. The patient represents the second example of this variation of male pseudohermaphroditism associated with XY gonadal agenesis. © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Hydroxyproline, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase values were determined in serum over 24 h in Holstein cows. The cows represented two age groups and three percents of diet calcium. Hydroxyproline followed a cyclic pattern dipping at 0800 and 1600 h after milking at 0500 and 1530 h. Phosphorus showed a 24 h rhythm peaking at 1600 h. No other time effects were demonstrated. Hydroxyproline and alkaline phosphatase were both lower in the older cows, indicating a decreased calcium mobilization from bone with age. There was a correlation coefficient of only .20 between serum calcium and hydroxyproline. The calcium concentration in serum was maintained within a narrow range presumably as a result of homeostatic mechanisms involving bone resorption, i.e. the release of calcium and hydroxyproline. In this way serum hydroxyproline may indicate the degree of homeostasis required to maintain serum calcium. © 1976, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Prior parturitional experience and genotype have previously been found to affect the proportion of nonpregnant female rats and mice that will eat foster placenta. The present series of experiments was designed to investigate the influence of estrous cycle stage on placentophagia in rats. Foster placenta was presented to nonpregnant Long-Evans females, purchased from a commercial breeder, for 15 min on 5 consecutive days. We found that virgin placentophages were most likely to have eaten placenta on the first presentation, unless the first presentation occurred during proestrus. In fact, virgins would not eat placenta for the first time during proestrus, regardless of test-day. However, once they had eaten placenta, either in a nonproestrus stage, or, in the case of primiparae, during parturition, they would eat placenta during proestrus. Long-Evans rats born in our laboratory differed from the purchased rats, manifesting an incidence of placentophagia that was too low to be analyzed by stage of the estrous cycle: when tested as primiparae, however, there were no differences between the two groups. © 1976.

AB  - A series of experiments examined the effects of estrous cycles, ovariectomy, and estradiol-replacement on free-feeding meal patterns of female rats maintained on a liquid diet. The proestrous decrease in food intake was accomplished by a decrease in meal size and a less than fully compensatory increase in meal frequency. The hyperphagia induced by ovariectomy was reflected in an increase in meal size and a decrease in meal frequency. When food intake returned to preoperative levels, meal size remained elevated while frequency decreased further. Estradiol benzoate (2 μg/day) permanently decreased meal size in long-term ovariectomized rats. The subsequent return to food intake levels of controls was due primarily to an increase in meal frequency. These results suggest that the transient changes in food intake caused by estradiol withdrawal and replacement are accomplished by permanent changes in meal size followed by compensatory changes in the number of meals consumed per day. They suggest that the decrease in meal size at proestrus is due to a direct effect of estradiol on the mechanisms that terminate short-term food intake and are not secondary to changes in the level of total daily food intake. © 1976.

AB  - A group of 60 housed Friesian cows were observed continuously for a period of 25 days, during which time all cows were recorded for incidence of mounting activity and 18 selected cows were recorded for various aspects of maintenance activity. All 60 cows were judged as showing oestrus. Average duration of oestrus (+/-SD) in 33 cows was 14-9 +/- 4-7 hours, and the cows were mounted 56-3 +/- 34-8 times. The greatest mounting activity was associated with the night hours. There was no diurnal pattern of onset of oestrus. The majority of mounting activity (79 per cent) occurred in the cubicle area of the building. Comparison of maintenance activities showed that oestrous cows spent, on average, less time standing in a cubicle (P less than 0-01), lying in a cubicle (P less than 0-001) and more time standing elsewhere (P less than 0-001) than non-oestrous cows. The results are discussed in relation to oestrus detection.

AB  - Estriol determinations are most commonly used in the management of complicated pregnancies as a means of predicting the state of the fetoplacental function. Estriol production by the placenta depends to a large degree on the provision of C 19 precursors by the fetus and it seems likely that this fetoplacental interaction can explain the good correlation between the fetal well being and estriol concentration in urine and plasma. On the other hand, the complex enzymatic system and the different organs involved in estriol production may explain the discrepancy between the fetal state and estriol concentration in, for example, Rh immunization. In several surveys regarding estrogen determinations in more than 1,000 pregnancies, the diagnostic value has been assessed in a very positive way by the individual authors. The incidence of low estriol excretion in an obstetric population amounts to 10-15%; whereas the perinatal mortality in pregnancies with normal concentration is between 0.3 and 3.9%, there is an average of up to 42.4% in pregnancies with decreased estriol excretion, and if the values range below 4 mg/24 h the rate of perinatal mortality is even up to 85.7%. Based on experiences during supervision of more than 10,000 pregnancies, Beischer and Brown considered that 'pure controls' for patients beyond 36 weeks of gestation with estriol excretion confirmed to be less than 6 mg/24 h are out of the question as a matter of medical ethics and that termination of pregnancy should be achieved. The incidence of a fetal acidosis during delivery can often be observed too if the estriol values are diminished. Surveying 1,000 risk pregnancies by means of estriol excretion in urine, the state of the newborn corresponded in 81.1% to the expectations, in 8.3% the state was better and only in 2.6% worse than expected. However, experiences of comparably large investigations concerning serum estriol have not yet been made so far in order to fully replace the measurement of estrogens in urine which proved its value for two decades. In view of the future the good correlation between estriol in serum and urine and the low day to day variations of serum estriol plead, however, for the determination of this steroid in blood. The estimation of estriol in plasma offers several advantages over the measurement of estrogens in 24 h urine. It results from the previous statements that nowadays estriol determinations are indispensable for the surveillance of high risk pregnancies, but also in inconspicuous pregnancies, estrogen determinations should be integrated into the clinical routine. However, hormone assays should not be taken by themselves, but only in the context of the whole clinical picture and the sensible combination of chemical and physical methods can contribute considerably to the decision whether a pregnancy must be terminated prematurely or not. This applies especially to cases in which repeated estriol determinations have resulted in values just inside or below the normal range, an area which might be called 'the grey zone'. The decreasing risk of premature birth during progression of pregnancy must be balanced against the increasing risk caused by EPH syndrome, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, intrauterine growth retardation, etc., or other complications in pregnancy.

AB  - The flight of air traffic has in the last two decades gradually caught up with rail, road and sea traffic. The article outlines the specific hazards inherent in air traffic, focussing both on passengers as well as noise impact on those living in the vicinity of airports. After an outline of the increasing number of passengers carried by IATA members, an estimate of type and amount of patients among these passengers is reported: 3 to 6% of all passengers transported are under some form of medical supervision, this amounts to an annual number of 12 to 24 million passengers. A jumbo jet will carry an average of 30 to 40 patients. The influence of inflight conditions such as low pressure and speed on air sickness is discussed in addition to noise, vibration and adjustment to time lags. Other problems concern communicability of infectious diseases. A list of types of patients which should not be allowed to go by air transport includes: hypertony patients; anemia patients; patients with a pneumothorax; normally no dangers exist for patients with pace makers, pregnant mothers or epileptics. Finally, observations as regards pollution produced by air traffic, including noise stress, are presented.

AB  - To investigate the role of ovarian steroids in the initiation and maintenance ofthe prolactin surges typical of pseudopregnancy in the rat, the pattern of plasma prolactin concentrations resulting from cervical stimulation of long-term ovariectomized rats was determined. Cervical stimulation of rats, ovariectomized 2-4 weeks previously, at 1900 h (lights on 0600-1800 h) resulted in a surge of prolactin which was initiated 4-6 h later and which was similar in timing and duration to the nocturnal prolactin surge of intact, pseudopregnant rats. Daily prolactin surges continued for 6 days but declined thereafter. Because plasma progesterone levels were elevated significantly after cervical stimulation, the experiment was repeated in adrenalectomized- ovariectomized rats. Prolactin surges were still observed, demonstrating that ovarian and adrenal steroids are required neither for initiation nor maintenance of prolactin surges after cervical stimulation. Cervical stimulation at different times of the day (1900 h, 2400 h or 0400 h) always resulted in a surge of prolactin which peaked at 0300-0700 h. The latency from cervical stimulation to the peak of the prolactin surge was 8 h for the 1900 h group, 5 h for the 2400 h group, and 3 h for the 0400 h group. Thus, the appearance of prolactin surges is related to the time of day rather than to the time cervical stimulation is applied, demonstrating the existence of a “critical period” for cervically-induced prolactin release. © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The hypothesis was tested that exposure of neonatal rats to carbon monoxide (CO) to the point of respiratory failure would result in brain damage evidenced as hyperactivity. Five-day-old rats were exposed in a dynamic flow chamber to a concentration of carbon monoxide in air which caused coma and respiratory failure (defined as failure to breathe in 20 sec) after about 2 hr of exposure. From 7 to 15 days after birth, signs of hyperactivity were present in the CO-exposed rats in an open field test. In the same age period, tests of reflex development did not demonstrate differences between CO-exposed and control rats. From 17 to 22 days of age, the CO-exposed rats were more often awake in the nest box than control rats. After weaning, the CO-exposed rats were found to be hyperactive, particularly at night, in a residential maze. This hyperactivity was present at 4, 5, 6, and 8 weeks of age, but the rats recovered by 3 months of age. When adult rats were exposed to CO, mild nocturnal hyperactivity usually developed several weeks after exposure, and no recovery was found up to 5 months later. The rapid onset and complete reversibility of hyperactivity in rats exposed to CO as neonates makes this form of anoxic damage an interesting model for further investigation. © 1976.

AB  - The influence of the level of vitamin B6 intake on the content of the vitamin in milk was studied in 19 healthy subjects whose stages of lactation ranged from 3 wk to 30 mth. Total vitamin B6 intakes, including extra dietary sources of the vitamin, ranged from 1.3 to 12.5 mg/day with 6 subjects consuming less than the recommended allowance of 2.5 mg/day (RDA, 1974). Subjects consuming &lt;2.5 mg of vitamin B6 per day had significantly less vitamin B6/l milk (129 μg) than groups consuming 2.5 to 5 or &gt;5 mg/day (239 and 314 μg, resp.). Among subjects consuming &gt;2.5 mg of vitamin per day the stage of lactation did not influence the levels of protein or vitamin B6 in milk. Vitamin B6 intakes 2 to 5 times the recommended allowance did not significantly elevate the level of the vitamin in milk compared to values for subjects whose intakes approximated the allowance. The vitamin B6/protein ratio in milk of subjects consuming &lt;2.5 mg vitamin B6 per day was 13 μg/g and was significantly lower than that observed for the other 2 groups (23 and 28 μg/g). Daily and weekly variations of the vitamin B6 and protein content in milk of individuals were small. However, marked diurnal variations in the vitamin B6 content were found in milk of individuals taking daily supplements of the vitamin with peak levels occurring in the afternoon 3 to 5 hr after supplements were taken in the morning.

AB  - Hamsters were maintained on a long photoperiod (14L:10D) and were injected once daily with melatonin (10-25 μg) or sesame oil. Males which received melatonin during the afternoon (e.g., 6.5-13.75 h after lights-on) showed regressed testes and decreased levels of serum LH and FSH after several weeks of treatment. Injections of the oil vehicle or injections of melatonin given in the morning (3 h after lights-on) had no detectable effect on testicular size or on serum gonadotropins. Females which received melatonin during the afternoon became acyclic after several weeks of treatment and showed a diurnal pattern of LH secretion. The acyclic females required 4-6 weeks to resume estrous cyclicity following termination of the melatonin injections. The effects of melatonin on gonadal function and on serum gonadotropin concentrations in both sexes were similar to the previously observed effects of prolonged exposure to short photoperiods. These results indicate that chronic daily injections of melatonin can depress reproductive function in hamsters and that the effectiveness of the injections is dependent upon the time of day at which they are administered. © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Twenty-four-hour changes in the in vitro serotonin (5-HT) uptake capacity of hypothalamic homogenates and of “Vibratome” slices of the suprachiasmatic nuclear region (SNR) of the hypothalamus were studied in 60-90-day-old Holtzman (albino) rats. Animals acclimated to artificially illuminated (fluorescent, LD 12:12) and temperaturecontrolled (22 ± 2C) rooms were killed 6 per each of 8 time points. Synaptosomal fractions from homogenates of whole hypothalamus, and slices of the SNR were incubated for 20 min in Krebs-Henseleit buffer with [3H]5-HT. Males showed a single daily peak in SNR uptake at the start of darkness, and a minimum near the onset of light, while a more complex pattern containing 3 peaks and minima occurred in uptake by hypothalamic homogenates. Proestrous females showed a single high amplitude peak SNR uptake during the critical period, just prior to the plasma LH peak determined in the same animals by radioimmunoassay. It is suggested that this shortterm and 4-fold increase in SNR uptake of 5-HT may serve to limit free 5-HT and its inhibitory or other effects on the gonadotropin release hormone system and thereby on LH release and ovulation. © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Seasonal hormonal and sex skin coloration peaks were found to be synchronized in free-ranging, socially enclosed, and individually isolated rhesus monkeys of both sexes. These occurred during the October-January mating season on La Cueva island, Puerto Rico. Individually isolated females displayed a mid-cycle peak in sex skin coloration during the period of regular cycles (September-April). Females who became pregnant during the mating season did not show the significant sex skin coloration decrease seen in nonpregnant females during the months that follow the mating season. Environmental cues, perhaps acting on a seasonal biological clock rather than social factors, are thought to be mainly responsible for the synchronous seasonal fluctuations observed. The technique used for assessing changes in sex skin coloration is shown to be an effective and reliable method for recording seasonal and intramenstrual variations of sex hormones in free-tanging and captive rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, the procedure may prove useful in studies relating behavior with sex endocrines. © 1976.

AB  - From 1960 to 1970 the city police of Zurich recorded 438 attempted suicides in young persons aged from 12 to 25 years, of whom 239 were females and 199 males. There was a clear peak in the 20th and 21st years of life. 18% of the victims had previously attempted suicide. The occupational dominance was among scholars, students, sales personnel, and workers in the hotel business. More than a third of the girls and every fifth boy had decided to end their life because of love affairs. More than one cause was given by 14% of the masculine and 7% of the feminine self immolators. 5% of the girls involved made an unwanted pregnancy responsible for the act. 11% were under the influence of alcohol. The method adopted was tablets in 63% of the girls and in 51% of the boys. The girls chose the time before, the boys the time after midnight for the fatal deed. Among the men there was a significant peak on Tuesdays. The women presented a significantly high rate in September. Without specification of sex there was a striking annual lowering of the curve in July and a peak in August/September. Among the 438 cases there were 3 of double suicide. 28% announced the reason for their suicide, almost always by a farewell letter. It was the 18 years old who most often wrote farewell missives. In this there was no difference between the sexes. One of the groups wrote in an appealing mood, or asking forgiveness, or making reproaches against the recipient. A second group revealed by the contents of their letters that the objective of the suicide was revenge, especially when jealousy was at work, or when the objective was to bring pressure to bear on the loved one. A third group of farewell notes directly referred to the suicide in telegrammatic form or giving details about the method to be used. The language was mostly undifferentiated and in the form of cliches to bring home to the reader the inescapable situation.

AB  - In order to study the sequence of hormonal changes that accompany the onset of puberty in the female rat, immature animals were sacrificed by decapitation between days 32 and 38, and plasma titers of gonadotropins, prolactin, and LHRH, and the hypothalamic content of LHRH were determined by specific radioimmunoassays (RIA). Animals were decapitated at 10:00 and 16:00 h throughout the pubertal period, the uterine weight was recorded, and the ovaries were inspected for signs of ovulation. Animals with the vagina closed were grouped according to the condition of the uterus as anestrus (A), early proestrus (EP) and late proestrus (LP), the uterus being unstimulated, dilated with some fluid, or ballooned, respectively. Vaginal opening was usually associated with ovulation and in most cases occurred at the end of the late proestrous phase. Animals were studied up to 3 days after vaginal opening and were grouped according to vaginal cytology. Uterine weight, taken as an index of estrogen secretion, was low during A, increased during EP, and reached a peak at LP, declining thereafter. Plasma LH and FSH were low from A until the afternoon of LP. At this time, uterine weight was maximal and both gonadotropins increased dramatically. The following morning (estrus), LH, but not FSH, had returned to basal values. FSH returned to basal levels on the afternoon of estrus. Plasma prolactin was low in the morning during the entire period, but showed peaks on the afternoons, which reached a maximum at LP and declined thereafter following the pattern of changes in uterine weight. Plasma LHRH was uniformly low throughout the entire pubertal period, whereas hypothalamic LHRH content declined on the morning of estrus (day of vaginal opening). We suggest that the onset of puberty in the female rat is brought about by a gradual increase in estrogen secretion which, acting at the CNS-pituitary level, triggers a preovulatory proestrous-like surge of gonadotropins and prolactin. © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - (1) Available data on breeding seasonality in primates are summarized. (2) When intact female rhesus monkeys, whose Fallopian tubes had been ligated to prevent pregnancy, were paired with intact males in a laboratory in London, the timing of the annual increase (autumn) in mating activity was closely similar to that in India. (3) When ovariectomized, estrogentreated females were paired with intact males in a laboratory in Atlanta, where the photoperiod was strictly controlled, the annual increase in mating activity persisted during the first year, although it was less well-circumscribed. (4) During the second year in a fixed photoperiod, in a sham-castrated group, the annual increase in sexual activity virtually disappeared. (5) During the second year in a fixed photoperiod, however, in a castrated, testosterone-treated group, a brief increase in sexual activity occurred at the expected time. (6) When ovariectomized, estrogen-treated female rhesus monkeys were paired with castrated, testosterone-treated males in a laboratory in London, the seasonal increase in sexual activity occurred at the expected time, indicating that it was not entirely dependent upon pituitary activation of the gonads. (7) Seasonal factors operating in the female are also considered. © 1976.

AB  - In this part of the chapter we have described the characteristics of two alternating sleep states - REM and NREM sleep in preterm and full-term infants. We have indicated how individual physiologic measures, recorded during sleep, mature and become synchromized into patterns that define the sleep states. We have described abnormalities in this process and have related them to clinical populations of deviant infants. Throughout, we have emphasized the complexity of the process and the methodologic sophistication required to investigate adequately the multiple dimensions of sleep. Despite somewhat discrepant and confusing reports in the literature, we continue to believe that sleep studies will provide rewarding insights into the central nervous system functioning of the developing young infant.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of the foetal electrocorticogram, eye movements and heart rate in ewes during the last month of gestation showed rapid placental transfer from the mother to the foetus of phenothiazine derivatives (acepromazine maleate), short-acting barbiturates (thiopental sodium) and narcotic analgesics (meperidine). Acepromazine and thiopental partially disrupted the foetal sleep cycle by synchronization of the ECoG for 1-2 h but increased the heart rate for 2-3 h. The effects of meperidine were similar but lasted only 5-10 min for the ECoG and less than 0.5 h for the heart rate. © 1976.

AB  - Small doses of pentobarbitone (4 mg/kg i.v.) administered to sheep in the last third of pregnancy had little overt effect on the mothers. In the foetus they caused arrest of breathing movements, an alteration in the character of the electrocorticogram and cardiovascular changes which varied with gestational age. In contrast, relatively large doses of pethidine (100–200 mg) administered to the mother had no consistent effect on normal foetal breathing movements, though they abolished the foetal response to hypercapnia. The results are discussed in relation to foetal sleep state. 1976 British Pharmacological Society

AB  - Twenty-one neonates of over 36 weeks' gestation suffered perinatal asphyxia but not chronic hypoxia. Three clinical stages of postanoxic encephalopathy were distinguished. Stage 1 lasted less than 24 hours and was characterized by hyperalertness, uninhibited Moro and stretch reflexes, sympathetic effects, and a normal electroencephalogram. Stage 2 was marked by obtundation, hypotonia, strong distal flexion, and multifocal seizures. The EEG showed a periodic pattern sometimes preceded by continuous delta activity. Infants in stage 3 were stuporous, flaccid, and brain stem and autonomic functions were suppressed. The EEG was isopotential or had infrequent periodic discharges. Infants who did not enter stage 3 and who had signs of stage 2 for less than five days appeared normal in later infancy. Persistence of stage 2 for more than seven days or failure of the EEG to revert to normal was associated with later neurologic impairment or death. © 1976, American Medical Association.

AB  - The effects of fluctuations of free amino acid concentrations in plasma on sleep patterns and operant behavior in the squirrel monkey were studied. Plasma phenylalanine (PHE) and tyrosine (TYR) were rapidly lowered to trace levels within 4 hr by intraperitoneal administration of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), an enzyme which specifically deaminates both PHE and TYR to inactive products. Significant alterations in sleep patterns and in performance on a chained operant task involving hold and reaction time components were found, but no significant effect on the performance of a simple operant task was observed. Administration of saline or trans-p-cinnamic acid and trans-p-coumaric acid, the products of PHE and TYR deamination, produced no changes in behavior or sleep patterns. The reduction of plasma PHE and TYR resulted in a significant decrease in PHE and TYR levels in whole rat brain. Brain serotonin levels were increased within 4 hr after PAL administration, whereas, dopamine and norepinephrine levels were decreased subsequently (within 8 hr). These studies suggest that circulating levels of PHE and TYR are involved directly or indirectly in the modulation of certain parameters of brain function. © 1976.

AB  - Neurophysiological and neuro chemical studies on normal and pathological sleep have greatly progressed in recent years. Similarly, neuropharmacology of hypnotic drugs has advanced thanks to complex and strict methodology. Numerous E.E.G. recordings have determined the organisation of the various phases of sleep: physiological sleep and that due to psychotropic drugs. In spite of the progress of these techniques and studies, the prescription of a hypnotic in a case of insomnia should remain fairly exceptional. There are three main reasons for this: the first is that there is still no ideal hypnotic inducing normal sleep; the second resides in the purely symptomatic character of the prescription of a sleeping drug which may ignore the cause of the insomnia; the third is that regular and repeated taking of hypnotics includes significant risks of drug addiction and mental deterioration. However, in spite of these reasons, the use of hypnotic drugs is becoming more and more wide spread in modern society. One should insist on the absolute necessity of a full clinical history in insomnia and distinguish false insomnia from insomnia due to organic disease, e.g. psychiatric conditions. One should contrast the acute and chronic forms, psychotic causes should be distinguished from neurotic causes and one should detect psychopathic drug addiction personalities and recognize true depressive syndromes and the varieties of constitutional neurosis. Insomnia in normal subjects is the only true indication for an hypnotic drug, whether barbiturate or not, chosen in relation to the constitutional background, the age and the duration of action. Also one should emphasize that many anxiolytic or antihistaminic sedative psychotropic drugs are sufficient inducers of sleep for most patients.

AB  - In a group of 120 children with prenatal and postnatal trauma 31 children with epileptic seizures were found who accounted for 25.8% of neuropsychiatric complications in this group. Epilepsy was more frequent in children with a history of asphyxia than after other forms of perinatal trauma. Seizures were observed either immediately after birth or up to the age of 100 mth. In children with delayed onset of seizures evidence of abnormal behavior with excessive motor agitation, sleep and appetite disturbances was found from birth. Besides prophylactic measures applied to avoid complications of pregnancy and labor it is indispensable to separate the children with perinatal trauma and group them for further neuropsychiatric observation in outpatient clinics and to begin treatment which may prevent development of epilepsy in at least a part of these children and may contribute to better rehabilitation of brain damaged children.

AB  - The temporal relationship between changes in mammary blood flow (MBF) and changes in the concentrations of plasma prolactin, progesterone, estradiol-17β, and cortisol, was examined in chronic sheep preparations undergoing spontaneous labor (Group I) or labor induced by an infusion of dexamethasone (1 mg/24 h) to the fetus (Group II). In Group I, an increase in prolactin (45 to 489 ng/ml), a decrease in progesterone (15 to 4 ng/ml), and an increase in MBF (97 to 365 ml/min) occurred at about the same time, whereas increases in estradiol-17β (80 to 211 pg/ml) and cortisol (9 to 39 ng/ml) followed the change in MBF. A similar pattern of changes in MBF and hormonal concentrations occurred over a shorter time period when premature labor was induced in the animals in Group II. These findings suggest that changes in plasma prolactin and progesterone concentrations play an important role in the regulation of MBF at the time of parturition. © 1976 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The authors designed a piezo electric microphone in order to tap and analyze intrauterine sounds. The band that is used ranges from 3-700 Hz. A sound that has a small microphone at its tip is introduced into the uterus and then relayed to an amplifier. The sounds mainly come from the blood vessels and their frequency ranges between a few Hz and a thousand Hz. The acoustic pressure is high for low frequencies and weak for high frequencies. The sounds that are heard in the uterus have a calming effect on new born children and stop them crying in 86% of cases where it has been tried. It sends them to sleep in 30% and this was confirmed by E.E.G. This method is more effective than the older ones which used slumber tone. The reason is that the product is the same as that which has been experienced by the fetus in utero.

AB  - Differential effects of electrochemical stimulation of the midbrain raphe and dorsal tegmentum on multiple unit activity in the medial preoptic area were observed in proestrous female rats. Stimulation of the median raphe nucleus induced a marked increase in activity (spikes per minute). This increase was not found in unstimulated sham-treated rats or after a control lesion at the same site. Dorsal tegmental stimulation had the opposite effect, i.e., a marked tendency to decreased activity after stimulation, an effect not reproduced by a control lesion of similar size without iron deposition. It is suggested that the changes observed may be related to the effects on luteinizing hormone release and ovulation induced by the same stimulation parameters. © 1976.

AB  - Patterns of gonadotropia output were studied in normal individuals and in patients with menstrual dysfunction by radioimmunoassay measurement of LH and FSH output in samples taken every 20 minutes for 6-8 hours, and following administration of synthetic luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LRH). Follicular phase LH pulses occurred every 1-2 hours, whereas those in the luteal phase occurred less frequently and with higher amplitude. FSH output was irregular, and had no correlation with LH dynamics. In anorexia nervosa, pulsatile LH activity was minimal, and the response to LRH variable, correlating somewhat with the clinical status of the patient. Pulsatile LH activity was observed in patients with postpill and postpartum amenorrhea, and also in one individual with a probable prolactin-producing pituitary tumor. Patients with polycystic ovarian disease had obvious LH pulsatile activity, with a greater amplitude and frequency than seen in the luteal phase, and a decrease in percentage increment, suggesting some difference in the hypothalamic-pituitary control mechanisms under these conditions. The character and pattern of the LH pulsatile activity does vary with different forms of menstrual dysfunction and may be predictive of the LRH response when considered in relation to the LH baseline values. Pulsatile LH activity, analyzed in conjunction with response patterns following LRH stimulation, may reflect the degree of hypothalamic dysfunction. © 1976 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - An extensive review of the literature on circadian, ultradian, and infradian rhythms is reported here, and their relationship to the course and individual phases of cyclothymia is explored. Attention is drawn to a series of heretofore neglected incidental findings which together indicate a disturbance in the temporal structure of sleep, particularly in the organization of sleep stages and sleep cycles. Among the many psychometric, endocrinological, biochemical and physiological studies, a few merit special attention because they are methodologically suggestive of productive avenues of research, e.g., the studies on episodic secretion of cortisol, 24 hour EEG recordings with appropriate frequency analyses, and 24 hour registration of psychomotor activity. On the whole, investigations of these parameters indicate a disturbance in the rather complex temporal organization of circadian and ultradian rhythmical phenomena. The depressive phases frequently show a temporal relation to certain times of the day night cycle and of the annual cycle, to meteorological oscillations, to hormonal adjustment at puberty, at premenstruum, at puerperium and at menopause, to different phases of development or involution, and, last but not least, to major changes in social life requiring a difficult readjustment. Following a historical introduction to a series of models of central regulation, a chronobiological concept of autoregulation is presented. This paper presents a new conceptualization of pathogenetic aspects of cyclothymia, as derived from empirical data and current theory about the temporal regulation of biological rhythms in the organism. In this model, an insufficiency of the mechanisms of internal synchronization is considered to be the basic genetic disturbance. The manifestation of depression is associated primarily with quantifiable internal and external desynchronizations, and secondarily, with instability of ultradian rhythms as well as with infradian rhythms detectable in the temporal course of cyclothymia. The times in which cyclothymic phases are manifest with highest probability are conceptualized as periods of increased risk of desynchronization. This conceptualization of cyclothymia may be related to the catecholamine and serotonine hypotheses. This follows from the fact that monoaminergic neurons play a central role in the temporal regulation of sleep waking cycles, in the neuroendocrinological regulation, and, eventually, in other mechanisms of internal and external synchronization.

AB  - Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were injected with hydroxyurea (750 mg/kg) or physiologic saline on the 12th day of gestation. Hydroxyurea and saline (control) treated groups were each composed of 6 subgroups injected at consecutive 4 h intervals (i.e., group 1 at 0000, group 2 at 0400,...). All females were injected at the same circadian phase as they were mated. The developmental age of all fetuses was 288±2 hr at the time of injection. The fetuses were taken by cesarean section on the 20th or 21st day of gestation. Teratogenesis was greatest when hydroxyurea was administered in the light phase (light dark 12:12 cycle). Deformity rates correlate with motor activity, mitotic rates and DNA synthesis.

AB  - A methodological study of healthy subjects was conducted to investigate factors influencing plasma free tryptophan and platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. The following changes were found during the menstrual cycle: free tryptophan was lower during the 'ovulatory' phase than during the 'premenstrual' phase, MAO activity was 20% lower during the 'premenstrual' phase as compared with the 'neutral' phase (days: menses -24 to -1). During pregnancy MAO activity was also lower than the values found six weeks postpartum. MAO activity in women was significantly higher than in men and exhibited greater variability. A circadian rhythm for free tryptophan was observed (minimum at midday, maximum at midnight). No diurnal variation in MAO activity could be established. Preliminary data from untreated endogenous depressive patients showed no difference in free tryptophan concentrations at 8 a.m. or 4 p.m. from control values.

AB  - The total and incremental area under a 3 hr 50 g oral GTT curve correlated best with the utilization of glucose by the neonate during the first 2 hr after delivery and with the neonatal glucose level at 2 hr. Of the 4 indices of maternal carbohydrate metabolism that were divided from the standard 50 g 3 hr oral GTT, the total area under the curve correlated best with the mean diurnal glucose value. It is suggested that diurnal glucose profile studies may prove to be of value in achieving optimal therapeutic control of blood glucose levels in diabetic pregnancy.

AB  - The development of the Free Cortisol Index, an indirect measurement of the free or metabolically active portion of circulating cortisol, is described. Patients with non-adrenal disease had FCl values in the same range as normal subjects and in patients with adrenal disease the FCl values moved in the same direction as the total plasma cortisol. FCl values exhibited the same diurnal variation and response to ACTH as did total plasma cortisol in normal subjects. In pregnancy a significant rise in FCl was found confirming previous evidence of a degree of hyperadrenocorticalism in this condition. © 1975 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The concentration of testosterone (ng/100 ml; mean ± SD) has been determined in peripheral venous plasma at 4 hourly intervals for 24 h from 9 non pregnant women (39.8 ± 11.8) and 9 during late pregnancy (70 ± 32). In addition, the level of this hormone has been measured in samples of plasma removed daily (between 08.30 and 10.00 h) throughout 9 ovarian cycles (41.6 ± 11.8), and weekly from 10 women during gestation (57.6 ± 14.7). The results show that there is considerable individual variation in both the concentration and pattern in serial samples over the respective time scales. The values of the arithmetic mean from non pregnant subjects show that there is a tendency for the concentration to be lower between 20.00 and 04.00 h. However, the differences between the values at defined times over a 24 h period are not statistically significant. During the ovarian cycle 3 subjects had peak values during the peri ovulatory phase, 2 in the luteal, 1 in the follicular and 3 showed no consistent pattern. There was no significant difference in values (40.9 ± 11.8, 41.9 ± 11.9 and 41.8 ± 11.9) for the 3 phases of the cycle. There is a significant rise in the concentration of plasma testosterone during pregnancy (P<0.0005), but the pattern of the arithmetic mean is not related to the corresponding values for progesterone or oestradiol. During late pregnancy (34 weeks to term) there is a change in the nycterohemeral pattern, with the highest mean values occurring between 16.00 and 04.00 h. The results are discussed.

AB  - Human prolactin blood levels were determined by radioimmunoassay in basal condition and in response to various inhibiting and/or stimulating agents (levodopa, water overload, insulinic hypoglycaemia, synthetic TRH, sulpiride) in cases of disturbed hypothalamo-pituitary axis (failure to lactate, prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, acromegaly, other pituitary tumours, clinical panhypopituitarism). A blunted prolactin response to suckling was evidenced in 2 post-partum women who were unable to breast feed. Hyperprolactinaemia, whether related to the existence of a prolactin-producing adenoma or not, was associated with the disappearance of the normal circadian pattern of prolactin secretion and with a blunted relative response to TRH; the latter phenomenon occurred also in acromegaly regardless of the basal prolactinaemia, and during the last trimester of pregnancy. Water overload was unsuccessful to suppress prolactin during the last trimester of pregnancy while the acute administration of levodopa was quite effective in about half of the patients with pituitary tumour. Therefore none of the dynamic tests presently studied allowed us to attribute a hyperprolactinaemia to a pituitary tumour rather than to a functional disturbance. On the contrary, stimulation tests can help to locate the level of a defect in cases of hypopituitarism.

A comparison was then made between nocturnal and early morning temperatures in 17 of the women who recently gave birth to a full term baby. Nocturnal temperature curves were arbitrarily classified into 4 types. Temperature curve for the cycle during which pregnancy invariably occurred was diphasic in the entire series of 17 cases. Temperature curve for 3 consecutive cycles previous to the last menstruation was diphasic in 14 cases and irregular or monophasic in the other 3. Hormonal therapy did not give rise to any gross changes in body temperature in 22 of the 28 cycles treated.

AB  - A simple and rapid homologous radioimmunoassay of human prolactin (hPRL), by the use of 66% ethanol containing 6.6% ammonium acetate for the separation of free and bound hormones, has been established. PRL levels showed marked individual and daily variations as well as a circadian periodicity in both men and women. Levels of plasma PRL rose with puberty and decreased during post menopause and in elderly men (ages 60-73 yr). There was no marked change in plasma PRL levels at midcycle; however, in some subjects, luteal levels were slightly higher than follicular levels. Administration of oestradiol 17β caused marked increase in plasma PRL levels during menstrual cycle. During pregnancy, the plasma PRL levels rose as high as 200 ng/ml and decreased within a week or 2 post partum. During lactation, the levels were higher and increased with suckling. In a patient with habitual abortion, the plasma PRL level showed a sudden drop prior to abortion. Administration of LH RH had no effect on the secretion of PRL in human subjects.

AB  - In industrial countries the symptom 'headache' has an incidence of about 10%, and hypertension between 20 and 25%. Both terms are summary and may be pointers to and warning signals of the most varied disease processes. While, in malignant hypertensions, and pheochromocytoma, headache is a cardinal symptom, its causal connection with permanently raised blood pressure in the 'benign' forms is viewed with scepticism. The observation that hypertensives frequently complain of headaches with a maximum intensity in the early hours of the morning is connected with the fall in blood pressure with accumulation of CO2 in shallow breathing. Headache as a symptom characteristic of hypertension is frequently only facultative in nature and must be classified among the series of symptoms of sequelae. But it offers a sufficient reason to institute a selective examination programme, especially as hypertension is still the most common cause of death even today.

AB  - Androgens produce a permanent organizational effect on the brain of rats during a postnatal period of sexual differentiation. In male rats, this process occurs as a consequence of the endogenous release of androgens; however, exposing female rats to exogenous androgens during this critical period initiates the same process, such that early exposure to androgens results in a dose dependent increase in body weight. Sex specific gonadal hormones further modulate this basic organizational difference in that androgens and estrogens have facilitatory and inhibitory effects, respectively, on the regulation of food intake (FI) and body weight (BWt). While the biochemical or anatomical basis of this sexual dimorphism in energy regulation has not been defined, the data presented here support the idea of a functional sex difference in the hypothalamic regulation of FI and BWt. In general, the same kinds of behavioral tests which differentiate between normal animals and rats with lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) or lateral hypothalamus (LH) also differentiate between male and female rats. Male rats respond to regulatory challenges more similar to VMH lesioned animals than do female rats. In addition, it has been shown that the VMH may be a primary neural site for the organizational effects of androgens on the brain. Based upon these data and the fact that rats show a sex difference in exactly those regulatory behaviors which are presumably controlled by the VMH, a model is proposed to account for sex differences in energy regulation.

AB  - A progressive depression in the in vitro hepatic microsomal enzyme metabolism of drug substrates, during pregnancy in the Wistar rat, was measured against various parameters. This depression was greatest with aniline para hydroxylation and least with p nitrobenzoic acid reduction. The depressed metabolism, which correlated with prolonged in vivo hexobarbital sleeping times, was paralleled by falls in hepatic microsomal cytochrome P 450 levels. There was a rapid reversal of this depression just before delivery, but these changes did not appear to be controlled by progesterone levels. The suggestion is advanced that the lower levels of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity might reflect a biological control mechanism to ensure the elevated levels of progesterone required to maintain the pregnant state. The relationship between changes in liver weight and enzyme activity was also examined as a possible explanation of the observed depression in drug metabolism during pregnancy.

AB  - The results of the study to date have confirmed the absence of pronounced behavioral or endocrine derangements in the long term THC exposed subjects. However, a consistent persistent change in affect or 'personality' has been noted which is manifest in a social context as increased irritable aggressiveness. The data further suggest that this behavioral change becomes more evident after the development of behavioral tolerance to the initial effects of THC which are characteristic of the marihuana 'high.'

AB  - Psychogenic symptoms that occur after accidents that entitle the victim to indemnity are as a rule reactions to the indemnification procedure rather than to the accident. Juridically, therefore, they do not constitute a consequence of the accident and, accordingly, should be classified as indemnification neuroses rather than as traumatic neuroses. The situation is different when the accident brings about severe, persistent, biographic alterations which then in their turn lead to a neurotic development. In such cases, a traumatic neurosis in the proper sense of the term may be involved, which is then to be regarded as a consequence of the accident, entitling the victim to indemnification. The problems involved are discussed with reference to a personal case.

AB  - Hibernation does not correspond to a period of rest of the ovary, nor to the prolongation of a period of anoestrus. Hibernation is necessary for the normal course of genital activity. Its suppression tends to modify more or less severely the physiological equilibrium implicated in the control of genital activities. However, the animal can find a more or less normal rhythm even if it is deprived of hibernation during the course of a second year. Prolongation of hibernation in hemicastrated animals during the entire period of genital activity suppresses the ovular discharge and the ovulating secretion of FSH and LH, without affecting the tonic secretions of FSH. It inhibits the phenomenon of compensatory hypertrophy. However, in hemicastrated animals deprived of hibernation, the reaction to hemicastration does not take place either during anoestrus or during mid December or mid March but only when the period of genital activity begins again.

AB  - The pharmacological and toxicological properties of 7 chloro 1 propargyl 5 phenyl 3H 1,4 benzodiazepin 2 one pinazepam) were investigated and compared with those of diazepam. In mouse and rat acute toxicity, in rat motor coordination and in rat metrazole convulsion tests pinazepam was compared with oxazepam, too. Pinazepam, which is characterized by the presence of a propargylic side chain, showed a lower toxicity, hypnotic activity and muscular relaxant activity than diazepam. Pinazepam and diazepam showed however, similar activity in reducing aggressive behavior in mice, stimulating the exploratory behavior in rats and in potentiating hexobarbital narcosis. No clear cut differences were observed in the anticonvulsant properties of the 2 drugs when tested against metrazole, strychnine and electroshock induced seizures. Pinazepam differs from diazepam in its longer duration of action. The main metabolic product found in the urine of rats and dogs treated with pinazepam was oxazepam.

AB  - The early statements that the EEG alone could correctly be used for the assessment of gestational age (cf., among others, Dreyfus Brisac, 1964; Parmelee et al., 1968; and Nolte et al., 1969), even in pathological babies, need some restrictive qualifications. Likewise, the more recent statements that certain neurophysiological parameters, including nerve conduction velocity and basic EEG patterns are independent not only of gestational age and body weight, but also of various abnormal factors in the pre and perinatal periods, appear also too rigid, at least as regards the EEG and the other parameters used in this study. As a matter of fact, some authors who had adhered rather strictly to these concepts have later on presented evidence suggesting some deviations in bioelectric brain maturation in some cases, as for example, in small for date newborns of toxemic mothers (Schulte et al., 1972). When more exact quantification by coding techniques was applied (Parmelee et al., 1968), the conclusion was also reached that extrauterine and intrauterine development of bioelectric brain activity developed according to the conceptional age, regardless of variable extrauterine experience, although it was recognized that other categories of behavioral and neurophysiological activities, for example, Moro reflex, states stability, crying, sucking scores, etc., are more liable to environmental and pathological factors (Prechtl et al., 1972; Michaelis et al., 1973).

AB  - The authors carried out 150 estimations of sodium gamma hydroxybutyrate in the maternal blood sequentially during the course of 18 anesthetics and in the cord blood of the infant at birth. In the case of a single injection, in the mother the authors find a curve of biphasic form. After a peak concentration during the first two minutes, and corresponding to the bolus of drug injected, the level of gamma OH falls regularly to reach eventually a renewed increase which occurs in different cases between the fifth and the tenth minute or between the twentieth and the twenty fifth minute, finally falling away again regularly from about the thirtieth minute. In the fetus, the blood levels of the drug are similar to those found in the mother and appear to vary in a like manner according to the duration of anesthesia. With the exception of a single case, they remained always less than 180 micrograms/ml. In the case of repeated injections, in the mother a repeat injection is generally followed by an increase in the blood level of the drug. In the fetus, the blood levels of the drug are again close to the maternal levels in this case. In no case did they exceed a value of 200 micrograms/ml. The authors particularly note that the blood levels of gamma OH, at birth in the fetus, were always below the level of 250 micrograms/ml which Herlich and Bessman have fixed as the level necessary to obtain a 'light' clinical sleep and the electro encephalograph modifications typical of sleep. One can find in this an explanation of the good condition of the infants at birth, confirmed by the large number of Apgar scores normal at the first minute.

AB  - Etomidate, R (+) ethyl 1 (1 phenylethyl) 1H imidazole 5 carboxylate was found to be a potent, short acting and safe hypnotic, when given intravenously in single doses to mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs. In rats of different body weights (50, 100, 200 and 300 g) two injection rates were used (2 sec and 2 min). By rapid iv injection in rats of 200 g, etomidate (ED50 = 0.57 mg/kg) is about 6 times more potent than methohexital (ED50 = 3.51 mg/kg) and 25 times more potent than propanidid and thiopental (ED50's = 13.4 mg/kg). The safety margin (LD50/ED50) in these rats is 26.0 for etomidate, 9.5 for methohexital, 6.7 for propanidid and 4.6 for thiopental. Potency and toxicity of ectomidate slightly increase with increasing injection rates without affecting the safety margin. The duration of hypnosis with etomidate is dose dependent and the safety margin will therefore be widened when sleep of short duration is aimed at. Recovery after etomidate is very rapid. With lower body weights, higher doses in mg/kg are required for inducing hypnosis of comparable duration. No systematic differences were found after etomidate injection in incidence and duration of hypnosis nor in mortality between animals of different sex. Electrocardiogram, blood pressure, hematologic and biochemical analysis, urinalysis and histopathology did not reveal any drug related adverse effect after daily injection of etomidate for 3 wk in rats (highest dose 5.0 mg/kg) and 2 wk in dogs (highest dose 1.50 mg/kg). No tolerance was observed after repeated administration. Etomidate is devoid of any teratogenic effect in rats (highest dose: 5.0 mg/kg daily from day 6 through day 15 of pregnancy), and in New Zealand white rabbits (highest dose: 4.5 mg/kg daily from day 6 through day 18 of pregnancy). The hypnotic effects of etomidate at very low dose levels in different laboratory animals are compared with the effects obtained in human subjects, in which successful induction of anesthesia was obtained without producing any release of histamine and with only minimal effects on cardiovascular and respiratory functions.

AB  - An attempt has been made to determine the aetiological factors in infantile idiopathic scoliosis from a clinical, genetic and epidemiological survey of 134 infants, 97 of whom developed a curve in the first 6 mth of life. Plagiocephaly was present in all cases; mental retardation occurred in 13% of males with progressive scoliosis; congenital dislocation of the hip occurred in 3.5% of cases and congenital heart disease in 2.5%; and inguinal hernia was found in 7.4% of males. Approximately 3% of parents and 3% of sibs had the same deformity, 30 times the general population frequency for the Edinburgh area. Other positive findings included an excess of breech presentations and of premature, low birthweight males, and a preponderance of curves developing in the winter months. Infants with progressive scoliosis tended to have older mothers and to come from poorer families. Only three children, all with resolving scoliosis, habitually lay prone in early infancy, in marked contrast to North American infants where this posture is usual. The almost complete absence of infantile idiopathic scoliosis in North America is noted and it is thought that the two facts may be related. The aetiology is likely to be multifactorial, with a genetic tendency to the deformity which is either 'triggered off' or prevented by external factors.

AB  - Bromocriptin (CB 154) has been found to suppress established lactation at a time when human plasma prolactin (HPRL) concentrations have already returned to the nonpregnant range. This action is due to inhibition of prolactin from the pituitary. It was then thought that a similar degree of inhibition induced during the menstrual cycle may help to uncover other possible biological actions of prolactin. In an attempt to elucidate this question eight breast-feeding mothers and seven normally menstruating volunteers underwent treatment with CB 154, including blood sampling during a sleep period. The dosage was 1 mg., three times daily, for 14 days in the first group and for a whole cycle in the normal volunteers. A control cycle preceded drug administration in the latter group. Prolactin (HPRL), growth hormone (HGH), luteotropin (LH), progesterone (PG), and estradiol (E2) were estimated (mean ± standard error) along the menstrual cycles in the normal volunteers. HPRL and milk volumes were measured in the breast-feeding women in the base-line period and during treatment. In the postpartum group, basal HPRL had already reached normal levels prior to therapy (10.8 ± 1.0 ng. per milliliter) and was significantly (p &lt; 0.002) depressed to 3.7 ± 0.4 ng. per milliliter by CB 154. This degree of inhibition was effective in suppressing lactation within 24 to 48 hours in all of the subjects in that group. The fall in plasma HPRL from 9.5 ± 1.5 ng. per milliliter to 3.2 ± 0.2 ng. per milliliter observed in the normally menstruating women was similar to the one recorded in the breast-feeding group, but the sequence of hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle was not altered by treatment. The overnight study ensured around-the-clock prolactin inhibition. Results indicate no action of prolactin in the regulation of the human menstrual cycle at levels of inhibition at which a biological action of this hormone is clearly suppressed. © 1975.

AB  - A highly specific method for the determination of cortisol in human serum and urine is described. The sample is first extracted with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate (1 : 1, by vol.), then chromatographed on a highly lipophilic derivative of Sephadex (hydroxyalkoxypropyl Sephadex, Lipidex) in light petroleum/ chloroform (1 : 1, by vol.), and finally cortisol is measured by radioimmunoassay using a cortisol-21-BSA antiserum. Bound and unbound radioactivities are separated using dextran-coated charcoal technique. The 8 a.m. values (mean ± S.D.) of cortisol among 11 young females and 16 young males were 152 ± 32 ng/ml (range 111-235) and 185 ± 32 ng/ml (103-232), respectively. The respective values at 4 p.m. were 84 ± 29 ng/ml (26-117) and 84 ± 36 ng/ml (32-172). The importance of Lipidex chromatography was demonstrated with assays of serum samples from children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia; without chromatography cortisol values were 6 times those with chromatography. Specific cortisol assays from pregnancy serum also necessitated Lipidex chromatography. Among 11 young men and 9 young women the mean daily urinary cortisol excretion was 56 ± 26 μg (32-109) and 60 ± 24 μg (39-109), respectively. Specific urinary cortisol determination could not be achieved without Lipidex chromatography. © 1975.

AB  - In six intact ewes, deep anaesthesia lasting 1-2 h was induced with pentobarbital given intravenously at the onset of oestrus. In a second group of six ovariectomized ewes, light pentobarbital anaesthesia was induced following a control period of 4 h and then maintained for 2, 3, or 4 h. No drug was given to control animals (seven in the first group, three in the second). Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) were determined by radioimmunoassay hourly in the first group, and at intervals of 5 or 10 min in the second. In the oestrous ewes, pentobarbital did not prevent or modify the expected LH surge. In the ovariectomized ewes, the drug, while not affecting the pulsatile release pattern of LH, reduced average LH levels to about half their control values (P smaller than 0.001) when given in a dosage maintaining 3 or 4 of light sleep; the 2-h dosage had no such effect. These differential effects of pentobarbital indicate that LH secretion in ewes is regulated by more than one mechanism. In particular, our findings are consistent with a hypothesis that there are, in ovariectomized ewes, independent central regulatory mechanisms for the amount of LH released, and for the time pattern of its release.

AB  - The objective of clinical management of the pregnant diabetic woman is to prevent the serious adverse effects of an abnormal glucose environment on the fetus. Neonatal glucose assimilation and insulin release over the first two hours of life were correlated with various indices of maternal carbohydrate metabolism in the third trimester. Of the 31 mothers studied 21 were defined as normal and 10 as having chemical diabetes. Neonatal glucose assimilation during the first two hours of life correlated strongly with functions of both maternal glucose tolerance and mean diurnal glucose level, the strongest correlation being with the area under the three-hour oral glucose tolerance curve (P <0.001). Two-hour neonatal plasma glucose values of under 1.7 mmol/1 (30 mg/100 ml) were found only in the newborn of women whose glucose tolerance area measured over 41.6 area units (750 traditional units); thus, even in the borderline diabetic range glucose tolerance testing during the last trimester of pregnancy may be valuable in predicting likelihood of neonatal hypoglycaemia. The findings also shed light on the possible sensitizing role of mild maternal hyperglycaemia on fetal insulin production and secretion. © 1975, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

AB  - Diurnal plasma glucose profiles and oral glucose tolerance during pregnancy were studied in normal women, chemical diabetics, and insulin-requiring diabetics. In normal women the mean diurnal plasma glucose rose by only 0.22 mmol/1 (4 mg/100 ml) during pregnancy. Mild chemical diabetes resulted in an increase in both the mean diurnal glucose concentration and the fluctuation of plasma glucose levels during the day. Fluctuation in glucose concentration in insulin-dependent diabetics was about three times that found in non-diabetic women of similar gestation, with relative hyperglycaemia during the day and hypoglycaemia at night. In non-diabetic women and those with chemical diabetes the mean diurnal glucose correlated closely with the total area under the three-hour oral glucose tolerance curve and significantly, but less closely, with the two-hour glucose tolerance test value. © 1975, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

AB  - 1. 1. At sea level the core temperatures of the alpaca (Lama pacos) and llama (Lama glama), recorded continuously by radiotelemetry, were within the ranges of 37·9-38·3°C and 38·l-38·6°C respectively. These ranges were unaltered after 6 days of water deprivation. 2. 2. At high altitude (4·1 km) the ranges were very similar (37·6-38·2°C and 37·2-38·0°C respectively) Six days of water deprivation was without effect on the core temperature range of the alpaca at this altitude. 3. 3. The core temperature of the two vicunas (Lama vicugna) at high altitude was greater than those of the other species (36·0-37·9°C and 37·4-39·l°C). 4. 4. Just before parturition, the core temperature of a pregnant alpaca at high altitude was elevated by about 1°C. © 1975.

AB  - In a clinical survey the relation between migraine and menstruation was studied in 142 otherwise healthy women. In 24, onset of migraine coincided with the year of menarche. Of the 138 patients in whom onset of migraine predated the menopause, there were only 13 in whom attacks occurred regularly, and only, just before or during menstruation; in a further 11 attacks occurred regularly in relation to menstruation and at other times. Those with menstrually related migraine were more likely to have onset of migraine at menarche, to have associated weight gain and breast discomfort as part of a periodic syndrome, and to show improvement during pregnancy. There appeared no clear pattern of change at the menopause. In a study of reproductive hormones, blood was collected daily throughout a menstrual cycle from each of 8 women with menstrually related migraine, 6 with menstrually non-related migraine, and 8 healthy headache-free controls. Plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (F.S.H.), luteinising hormone (L.H.), prolactin, œstrogen, and progesterone were measured in all. Plasma-testosterone was measured in 8 migraine patients. Mean plasma oestrogen and progesterone levels were significantly higher in migraine patients than controls for most of the menstrual cycle, with the most striking differences found in the late luteal phase for progesterone. No significant difference was found between the menstrually related and non-related patients for these or the other hormones measured. Mean plasma-prolactin levels were lower in migraine subjects than controls, but the difference was not significant. Mean plasma F.S.H. and L.H. levels were similar in both migraine and control groups. Plasma-testosterone levels were within the range for normal in the 8 migraine patients studied. No specific hormone changes were associated with the occurrence of a migraine attack, nor did rising or falling levels, or greater increments of change over given cycle phases, appear important in provoking attacks. © 1975.

AB  - 3 patients (2 male, 1 female) presented with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis associated with elevated blood-levels of thyroid hormone and a markedly depressed thyroidal uptake of 131I. The male patients (aged 59 and 47) each had a cardiac arrhythmia, but did not have any thyroid pain or swelling. The female with a goitre had no discomfort in the neck. Thyrotoxicosis factitia was excluded by history. The subsequent course of their disease was typical of subacute thyroiditis. The elevated thyroid-hormone levels spontaneously fell to normal over a few weeks. In 1 patient, however, chemical hypothyroidism developed. These patients could have been diagnosed as having hyper-thyroidism, rather than subacute thyroiditis, since thyroid pain-and swelling in 2 of the cases-was absent. The correct diagnosis was suspected only after finding a thyroidal uptake of 131I near zero. The thyroidal uptake of 131I is still important as a routine diagnostic aid in thyroid disease. © 1975.

AB  - The plasma concentration of progesterone (P) has been measured by radioimmunoassay in maternal peripheral vein (M.P.V.) at early pregnancy and in M.P.V. umbilical artery (U.A.) and umbilical vein (U.V.) at term pregnancy. In early pregnancy marked hour-to-hour fluctuation of plasma progesterone was noted. At term pregnancy plasma P levels of U.V. were higher than those of U.A. and the umbilical venous arterial differences of plasma P did not differ between male and female fetuses. Administration of hydrocortisone and ACTH to patients scheduled to undergo cesarean section had no effect on M.P.V., U.A., and U.V. plasma P concentration. On the basis of the differences between U.V. and U.A. plasma P concentrations and reported umbilical flow it was estimated that the secretion rate of P into the fetal circulation is approximately 23 mg. per 24 hr. and would amount to approximately 10 per cent of the reported total daily production rate of P at term pregnancy. The fraction of P which is unbound to the plasma proteins was estimated by equilibrium dialysis at 37°C. The per cent unbound P in M.P.V. plasma of pregnant patients at term was not different from that of nonpregnant patients but was 40 per cent lower than that in umbilical cord plasma (P < 0.01), and the ratio between the concentrations of unbound P and estradiol in M.P.V. increased as pregnancy progressed. Plasma P in pre-eclamptic patients who subsequently sustained intrauterine fetal death had no value in assessing placental function. © 1975.

AB  - Two materials of nocturnal blood plasma samples, each representing more than 100 cows unselected with respect to health condition, showed acetoacetate variations within a wide range, overlapping with the range for animals with clinical ketosis. Within each of the two materials a statistically significant (P smaller than 0.001) negative correlation (r equal to minus 0.30) was obtained between plasma corticosteroids and log acetoacetate. The lowest corticosteroid and the highest acetoacetate averages were obtained for animals which were within the first month of the lactation cycle. With increasing time post-partum the two components varied inversely, a maximum in corticosteroids coinciding with a minimum in acetoacetate in cows which had calved 2 1/2 to 3 months before the date of sampling. At this stage the mean plasma sugar was about 10 per cent higher than in early lactation. The corticosteroid ranges for different levels of acetoacetate overlapped extensively. Still cows with acetoacetate smaller than or equal to 0.6 mg/100 ml gave significantly higher corticosteroid averages than the rest of the material. But in animals exceeding the 0.6 mg limit no relationship was found between the severity of the ketonaemia and the steroid level. Thus, no difference was obtained between cows with clinical ketosis and animals which were moderately ketonaemic. Some change in adrenal function may be associated with the development of ketonaemic conditions in cows. But no proof has been provided of a direct adrenal involvement in the transformation of a case of subclinical ketosis to the clinical stage.

AB  - A case of adrenogenital syndrome due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency is described in a mother, 25 years of age, who had experienced a successful pregnancy 5 years previously. At that time no abnormality had been suspected and pregnancy was achieved without therapy. Subsequently the patient was examined because of secondary sterility. The menstrual cycles were anovulatory. Only slight virilization was observed and blood pressure was normal. Diagnosis was based on the observation of highly increased urinary excretion of 17-ketosteroids and 17-ketogenic steroids, with especially high excretion of tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol. Following suppression with dexamethasone and adequate maintenance treatment, the patient conceived and had an uneventful pregnancy. This is apparently the first report of pregnancy in adrenogenital syndrome due to 11β-hydroxylase deficiency. © 1975.

AB  - Eighteen normal puerperal women received a combined administration of human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and the ovarian response to these human gonadotropins was evaluated by the daily estimation of the 24 hour urinary excretion of total estrogens. Fourteen of the 18 subjects studied were responsive to the exogenously administered gonadotropins with a rise in the urinary estrogen excretion. Moreover, plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels during the postpartum period were low compared to normal cycle gonadotropin levels. Thus, it might be concluded that puerperal anovulation and amenorrhea during lactation might be due to hypophyseal gonadotropic dysfunction rather than to ovarian refractoriness. © 1975.

AB  - The necessity for controlling the time factor in studies of enzyme regulation derives from an increasing number of investigations reporting significant circadian changes in the activity of several hepatic enzymes that metabolize amino acids. If the product of a specifically directed protein synthesis demonstrates cyclic behavior, it follows that the biochemical steps that precede that enzyme activity (enzyme synthesis and synthesis of specific RNA species) could also be expected to exhibit endogenous rhythmicity. Circadian rhythms have been noted for DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, mitotic index, and alterations in the nature of endoplasmic reticulum, as well as for a number of liver enzymes and secretory products of endocrine glands. In seeking to investigate cause and effect relationships, it would seem necessary to delineate whether reported changes were vicarious or programmatically directed. In the latter case, a particular study could be designed to maximize the results and avoid confusion between coincidence and correlation. The internal variations in cellular activity that have been cited are biological processes prone to synchronization and direction by external correlates. The integration of these signals is manifest in the operation of biological clocks that set the phasing and rhythm of cellular and holobiological events. © 1975, Elsevier Inc. All right reserved.

AB  - To determine if the central nervous system “program” controlling PRL secretion is operative during pregnancy, three pregnant women (12th, 20th and 32nd week of gestation) had 24-hour, 20-minute interval plasma sampling and polygraphic monitoring of nocturnal sleep. All three subjects showed episodic PRL secretion during waking which became augmented during nocturnal sleep. Since the number of “major” PRL secretory episodes was similar to normals, the increased PRL levels were most probably achieved by increased secretion per secretory episode. These findings suggest that during pregnancy, the PRL sleep related secretory “program” is maintained in a qualitative manner, albeit at a higher set-point. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Serotonin:acetyl coenzyme A N acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.5) activity in pineal gland was assayed in rats which were born and raised under diurnal lighting conditions, in continuous darkness, or in constant light. N Acetyltransferase activity in the pups raised under diurnal lighting showed a rhythmic pattern, with high enzyme activity during the dark period. The pups raised in continuous darkness also showed a rhythmic pattern, the phase of which was delayed by 8 hr in 7 wk old pups; the rhythmic phase of N acetyltransferase began in the evening in the 12 day old pups and was regularly delayed by 1 hr every wk. The pups raised in constant illumination also showed a rhythmic pattern; the rhythmic phase was delayed by 3 hr every wk. When the mother rats were coupled in darkness and maintained in darkness during pregnancy and after the pups were born, their pups again showed a rhythmic pattern. These observations indicate that the biological clock for N acetyltransferase is generated independently of environmental lighting. When mothers were coupled under reversed lighting conditions and transferred into darkness or light, the rhythmic pattern in their pups was inverted 180° from that of pups born of diurnal mothers. When the pups were raised in darkness, the rhythmic phase of N acetyltransferase in the pups was similar to that of their mothers. It is suggested that in the absence of light darkness cycle, the mother rat sets the rhythm of the pups to synchronize with her own rhythm. When pups were reared by a foster mother, with a different rhythmic pattern from that of their original mother, the rhythmic phase in the pups was closer to that of the original mother, suggesting that the original mother plays the predominant role in setting the rhythm of the pups.

AB  - PRL and TSH were measured by radioimmunoassay in 14 persons with myxedema aged 16 to 65 yr. 3 of them had galactorrhea. In 13 patients the circadian rhythm of PRL was studied, and in 8 patients PRL was measured after TRH administration. All the patients had a high value of serum TSH, with a mean value ± SEM of 29.4 (24.3 - 35.6) mU/ml. Values of serum PRL were comprised in normal ranges with a mean value ± SEM of 126 (196 - 238) mU/ml. The circadian rhythm of PRL is not altered, since mean values of serum PRL are more elevated at 4 am than 8 am with highly statistical significance. After THR administration the PRL response is normal or exaggerated. The results suggest that TSH release is quite independent of PRL release in hypothyroidism. Three hypothyroid patients with galactorrhea had a normal serum PRL value. This suggests that galactorrhea is a consequence of an altered activity of the 'lactogenic complex' comprising especially TSH and thyroid hormones.

AB  - This chapter discusses the 24-hr patterns of luteinizing hormone secretion in humans. Much progress is made in recent years in understanding factors controlling gonadotropin secretion in humans. This progress is made possible primarily by three technical advances: (1) the development of sensitive and specific assays for LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), especially radio immunoassay; (2) frequent blood sampling by techniques that interfere as little as possible with the subject's waking and sleeping activity; and (3) polygraphic recording of the EEG (electroencephalogram), EOG (electrooculogram), and EMG (electromyogram) during sleep so that sleep onset and offset can be precisely determined and correlations can be made with sleep stages. Using the methods enumerated in the foregoing paragraph, we will describe findings from this laboratory which deal with 24-hr LH secretory patterns in men and women from childhood to adulthood. The twenty-four-hour patterns of LH (luteinizing hormone) secretion are characterized by major changes with ontogenetic development and by marked gender differences. Thus, sleeping activity is distinguished during puberty by an augmentation of LH secretion while, conversely, LH secretion decreases during the sleep of adult women. Adult men do not show such sleep-related changes in LH secretion. © 1975, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The appearance of a diurnal rhythm in serotonin content in the rat epiphysis is suppressed by rearing the young in constant light from birth. If the young are put from constant light into constant darkness at age 20 days, by age 30 days there is a marked rhythm in the content of pineal serotonin. It would appear that this rhythm is inborn, since it appears even after an initial suppression without the intervention of an external synchroniser. Fifty-eight-day-old males, maintained in constant light from 21 to 11 days before killing, and then in constant darkness, showed a normal diurnal rhythm in epiphysial serotonin content. © 1975.

AB  - Under baseline conditions of recumbency and normal sodium intake there was a small significant hyperaldosteronism evident from elevated plasma concentration and aldosterone excretion in presence of suppressed metabolic clearance rate (MCR) in benign essential hypertension (BEH). BEH patients, particularly those with hyperkinetic circulation often excreted more oxo-conjugate and present greater than normal response in plasma aldosterone to upright posture. Upright posture decreased aldosterone MCR in controls, but effect was negligible in BEH. In BEH, decreased MCR and excretion of hepatic metabolite (tetrahydroaldosterone) may be due to impaired hepatic extraction related to increased aldosterone binding to a transcortin-like plasma fraction (TLPF). Concomitant fluctuations of TLPF and plasma concentration during circadian rhythm, the menstrual cycle and pregnancy suggest a possible role of TLPF in aldosterone distribution and dynamics. Recumbent BEH patients had increased plasma aldosterone around midnight. BEH patients showed hyperresponsiveness to ACTH infusion in plasma aldosterone with simultaneous sharp decrease of TLPF binding, while aldosterone MCR increased significantly and the ratio of the urinary and hepatic metabolites of aldosterone changed. Changes in binding degree probably contribute to perturbated aldosterone metabolism in BEH. In the majority of BEH patients with normal or low plasma renin activity 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone secretion is increased. ACTH stimulation or dexamethasone suppression of 18-hydroxydeoxycorticosterone is comparable in controls and patients. This hormone circulates in unbound form. © 1975.

AB  - Plasma LH, FSH and prolactin secretory patterns were derived from the measurement of 20-min interval plasma samples obtained during a complete 24-h period in a patient with persistent postpartum amenorrhea and galactorrhea (Chiari- Frommel syndrome), before and after clomiphene citrate therapy. During nocturnal sleep, polygraphic monitoring was carried out to precisely identify sleep onset, specific sleep stages and waking periods. During the evening and nighttime hours, LH and FSH concentrations were markedly reduced, compared to the daytime patterns both before and after clomiphene therapy. A sleepassociated rise of prolactin concentration was present, similar to the pattern found in normal subjects but at higher concentrations. The reciprocal nature of the nocturnal secretory patterns for LH and FSH and prolactin in this patient suggests an alteration in hypothalamic dopaminergic mechanisms which are thought to control the secretion of these hormones. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Estetrol (15α-hydroxyestriol or E4) is considered to be a specific product of fetal liver and has been suggested as a good indicator of fetal well-being. The concentration of unconjugated estetrol (E4) was measured by rapid and specific radioimmunoassay in 1 ml of maternal plasma. E4 levels prior to the 18th week of pregnancy were often undetectable (&lt;50 pg/ml). The mean plasma E4 level at term of 1.2 ng/ml was 7-fold higher than that observed at 24 weeks of gestation, and no diurnal variations were found. E4 levels in fetal plasma at term were 12-fold higher than those in maternal plasma and no fetal arterial venous differences were found. Umbilical vein but not maternal plasma levels of patients undergoing vaginal delivery were higher than those undergoing cesarean section (P &lt; 0.05) suggesting increased adrenal output of E4 precursors during labor. In patients with severe Rh-isoimmune disease plasma E4 levels were not helpful in assessing fetal well-being. However, in patients with chronic hypertension or pre-eclampsia, subnormal plasma E4 concentrations always preceded intrauterine fetal death. Plasma E4 appears to be a good indicator of fetal well-being in patients with hypertensive disease of pregnancy. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - On 2 consecutive nights, plasma LH, FSH and testosterone (T) were measured every 20 min for 12 h during evening wakefulness and polygraphic sleep in 5 pairs of male monozygotic twins in pubertal stages 1-4, and in a male dizygotic twin in stage 5. The intervening wakeful day was also studied in 3 twins. During sleep, significant enhancement of episodic LH release was seen on 16 of 18 nights in the stage 1-4 twins. During wakefulness, minimal episodic LH release was observed in the stage 1-3 twins, which then gradually increased in the more mature twins, until finally the significant sleep-wake difference in mean LH was lost in the stage 5 male. Testosterone also rose significantly in sleep on 19 of 20 study nights in the stage 1-5 twins. In the early pubertal twins this nocturnal rise in T was small, but in the midpubertal pairs it was profound, as peaks in T occurred which lay in the normal range for adult males. In these less mature twins the majority of the episodic secretion of T also was limited to sleep. In wakefulness, the T levels gradually increased across puberty until, in the stage 5 twin, wakeful peaks in T finally reached the adult male range. In the midpubertal twins, a close temporal relationship was seen between initiation of sleep-enhanced LH release and the subsequent initial rise in T (mean lag time 29.1 min). In the stage 5 twin, this episodic LH-T relationship persisted into wakefulness where the largest increments in T were seen just prior to sleep onset. Evidence of sleep-enhanced FSH release was more equivocal, and was limited mainly to pubertal stage 1 and 3 pairs. Similarities in hormonal patterns were seen within the monozygotic twin pairs and probably contributed to the parallel progress in puberty of the pair. Thus, sleep-wake rhythmicity in release of gonadotropins, particularly LH and thereby of testosterone, was seen to evolve transiently in twin boys across puberty. The existence of such rhythmicity suggests that a fundamental, sleepentrained CNS mechanism plays an important, if not a dominant, role in sexual maturation in boys. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Homoki, J., Teller, W. M., Tschürtz, D., and Fazekas, A. T. A. (Department of Paediatrics, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Ulm/Donau, BRD). The concentrations of total Cortisol and corticosterone in mixed cord plasma. Acta Paediatr Scand, 64:587, 1975.–Cortisol and corticosterone were determined in mixed umbilical cord plasma of 43 healthy full‐term newborns. The method consisted of a combined thin‐layer chromatographic‐ftuorimetric procedure which proved to be specific and reliable. The mean concentration in cord plasma of Cortisol was 10.6±4.9 μ.g/100 ml, of corticosterone 1.8±0.8 μg/100 ml. The mean ratio cortisol/corticosterone F/B was 6.3±2.5. Neither the duration nor the time of day of delivery appeared to influence the concentration of Cortisol or corticosterone in umbilical cord plasma. Also, there was no significant difference between male and female infants. In 18 instances of a pathological course of gestation and/or delivery the mean Cortisol level was 9.1±4.7 μg/ml, the mean corticosterone level 2.2±9 μg/100 ml. The mean F/B ratio was slightly but not significantly decreased (4.2±1.4 μg/100 ml; p>0.05). It is speculated that the high corticosterone concentration in umbilical cord plasma reflects a defect in Cortisol biosynthesis (17α‐hydroxylase deficiency) in the newborn, compared with later life.

AB  - A statistical investigation was carried out in order to establish if the urinary excretion of metabolites of progesterone (pregnanolone and pregnandiol): is correlated with the extent of diuresis; shows daily variations; shows day to day variations and to what extent. The determination of hormones was carried out by a semi automated gas chromatographic method. The results of the determinations were expressed as absolute values and as the ratio steroid/creatinine. The following conclusions were arrived at: there is no correlation between the amount of diuresis and the quantity of hormone excreted; the values obtained in the determination of each of the 5 fractions of urine taken over 24 hr are well correlated with the 24 hr pool; there is no daily rhythm in the excretion of these hormones; day to day variations, however, do exist, of which the relative percentage differences and the distribution for class intervals are calculated.

AB  - A theory of dying is proposed. The evidence and arguments are presented which suggest that the lifespan of mammals is regulated by a biological clock which, in turn acts on the endocrines to produce failure of two specific target tissues, the immune and circulatory systems. Failure of these two systems can account for the similarity among mammals of the final diseases recorded at autopsy. A newly described pituitary factor is used as an example of a possible endocrine mechanism by which the body might control its own demise. © 1974.

AB  - The effect of different amounts of vitamin Be supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and fetal plasma levels of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) at term has been studied. Ten of I3 subjects given 2 to 2.5 mg. of vitamin Bs daily exhibited plasma PLP levels lower than 4.7 ng. per milliliter (the lower limit of normal for nonpregnant subjects). In contrast, only 4 of II subjects given a supplement of I0 mg. of vitamin Bs daily had plasma PLP less than this value. The mean plasma PLP level (64.4 ng. per milliliter) of I0 cord blood samples from newborn infants whose mothers exhibited plasma PLP levels greater than 4.7 ng. per milliliter was significantly higher (P < 0.005) than that (34.2 ng. per milliliter) from I4 newborn infants whose mothers had abnormally lowered plasma PLP concentrations. In cord plasma, an average venous-arterial gradient of I0.6 ng. per milliliter was observed, indicating that the fetus retains and/or degrades PLP. These results suggest that more than 2 to 2.5 mg. of vitamin B6 supplement daily is required for most pregnancies to restore normal vitamin Bs nutrition in the mother and, perhaps, also in the fetus. © 1975.

AB  - Metabolism of estradiol was investigated in 5 dogs, 3 female Greyhounds with radiographically perfect hip joints and 2 female German Shepherd dogs with hip dysplasia (one pregnant and the other non-pregnant). One of the Greyhounds was studied both when pregnant and non-pregnant. The nonpregnant dogs were injected with C1 4-labelled estradiol-17/β i.v. and 5 mg estradiol-17/β benzoate i.m. The pregnant dogs were given only radiolabelled estradiol-17/β. Twenty-four-hour-specimens of urine were collected from the dogs for 6-8 days. Determination of urinary estrone, estradiol-17/β, and estriol was made. It was found that most of the injected estradiol was excreted unmetabolized in all the dogs. A significant amount of the injected estradiol was converted to estrone and a small amount to estriol. There was no significant difference in the excretion patterns of estrone, estradiol, and estriol between the Greyhounds with perfect hip joints and the German Shepherds with hip dysplasia, regardless whether the dogs were pregnant or not. The conclusion was drawn that the capacity of dogs with hip dysplasia to metabolize estradiol and to eliminate estradiol and metabolites is not impaired. © 1975, The Foundation Acta Radiologica.

AB  - Anti-LH-RF serum was produced in rabbits by synthetic LH-RF-BSA conjugate prepard with bis-diazotized benzidine. Employing this antiserum, a radioimmunoassay for LH-RF was established with the assay range from 0.8 to 10 ng/ml. Acid extracts of hypothalami from 4 day cycling rats through various stages of the estrous cycle particularly in the afternoon of proestrus were measured for their LHRF contents. The hypothalamic LH-RF content was high at 10:00 on the day of proestrus and declined until 17:00 and thereafter, the content gradually increased to reach the basal level. Serum LH showed the highest level at 17:00 on the day of proestrus and fell at 21:00 on the same day. Accompaning this change of serum LH level, pituitary LH content began to decrease at 17:00 of proestrus. These results indicate that LH-RF released in the afternoon of proestrus may participate to stimulate the preovulatory discharge of LH in the rat. © 1975, The Japan Endocrine Society.

AB  - Several studies have led to the concept that the length of the rat estrous cycle is dependent on the timing of estrogen (E) secretion. According to this hypothesis E secretion during the 5-day cycle is delayed. However, we have found LH and E levels in both 4 and 5 day cycles are identical. Therefore, even though E is critical for a cyclic gonadotropin release to occur it does not appear to be the factor, which under normal circumstances, determines cycle length. During the day of proestrus, progesterone (P) increase coincided, but did not precede the gonadotropin(s) surge in our study thus eliminating P as the normal physiological trigger of gonadotropin release. If P was the determining factor, one would expect to find 5-day P levels higher than 4-day cycle levels during the earlier stages of the cycle. Approximately 48 h following ovulation, on the day of diestrus, we found that the 5-day cycle did indeed have higher P levels. We propose that the regulation of P secretion during the early stages of the cycle controls the timing of the normal periodic gonadotropin release. © 1975.

AB  - A series of 4 experiments investigated the relationship between daylength and sexual maturation in female house mice. Mice reared in constant light matured significantly later than mice maintained under photoperiods involving 0, 6, 12, or 18 hr of light/day. Results of an experiment involving cross‐classified combinations of pre‐ and postweaning photoperiods revealed that only the postweaning photoperiod treatment was a significant factor influencing the attainment of puberty. Studies of body growth, food consumption, and wheel‐running activity in young females housed under different photoperiods indicated that mice kept in constant light grew more slowly during the first 10 days after weaning, generally consumed more food than mice at other photoperiod conditions, and failed to exhibit regular daily activity patterns like those of mice maintained under photoperiods of 0 or 12 hr of Night/day. Constant illumination apparently disrupts the normal physiological and behavioral activity rhythms and delays the attainment of sexual maturity. Copyright © 1975 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - A 44-year-old woman with diabetes insipidus of 3 years duration was found to have histiocvtosis X. This was based on clinical, radiological and pathological findings consistent with the diagnosis. Furthermore, she developed spontaneous galactorrhea during the course. Endocrine studies of hypothalamic-pituitary function revealed completely impaired secretion of gonadotropin, growth hormone and antidiuretic hormone, and possible partial impairment of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion, while thyroid stimulating hormone secretion remained intact. Persistently elevated plasma levels of human prolactin were also demonstrated, which were unaffected by administration of either thyrotropin releasing hormone, l-DOPA or water loading, but suppressed significantly by CB-154, an ergot alkaloid. These results suggest that abnormalities of the patient's endocrine function may be mainly accounted for by a single hypothalamic lesion. © 1975, The Japan Endocrine Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - It seems that one of the most important functions of the pineal gland may be to synchronize breeding activity in seasonal breeders with the appropriate time of the year. In the absence of this important gland, daylength is unable to exert an influence on reproductive physiology, and either no seasonal rhythm in reproduction occurs (e.g., in hamsters) or the rhythm free runs (e.g., in ferrets). In the latter case the breeding period comes out of phase with the appropriate season of the year. Whether daily rhythms in endocrine functions are synchronized or impelled by pineal secretions remain, for the most part, unclear. Certainly, the rate of secretion of prolactin during the night seems to depend upon an intact pineal gland.

AB  - Reproductive function was studied for more than 2 consecutive years in 3 groups of male ferrets. One group received testosterone propionate (TP) both prenatally and on postnatal day 3; a second group received TP on postnatal day 3 only; and a control group received no hormone perinatally. Annual fluctuations in testicular size together with correlated changes in spermatogenesis, the concentration of testosterone in the blood and the incidence of neck grip, mount and pelvic thrusting behaviors occurred in all 3 groups, suggesting that there is no need for the level of testicular secretion of androgen to be particularly low during a critical perinatal period in order for annual reproductive cycles to occur in adulthood. The ability to achieve intromission was permanently impaired in both groups of androgenized ferrets, even though in adulthood penile size and blood testosterone concentrations were well within the range of the control animals. This suggests that the ontogeny of mating behavior in the male ferret proceeds in a normal fashion only if the amount of androgenic stimulation sustained perinatally by the brain remains below some critical upper limit. © 1975, Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Relationships were examined between prolactin concentrations in bovine milk and various environmental and lactational variables. Prolactin was quantified by radioimmunoassay in 1,316 milk samples from two experiments. Environmental temperatures preceding milking, stage of lactation, daily milk yield, and dominance rank of the cow were correlated significantly with milk prolactin concentration. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to determine, in order of importance, the variables having significant independent effects on milk prolactin. Ambient temperature extremes, high and low, exerted the greatest effects and were each associated with elevated concentrations of prolactin. In Experiment I, conducted throughout the year, the variable representing maximum temperature preceding milking accounted for 14.3% of the variation in milk prolactin. In Experiment II, conducted during late fall and early winter, the minimum temperature preceding milking accounted for 21.1% of the variation. Although earlier stages of lactation and larger daily milk yields were associated with higher prolactin concentrations, inclusion of lactation stage in the stepwise regression model tended to eliminate almost all the variance of prolactin previously associated with daily yield. Dominance measurements indicated that more submissive cows had higher milk prolactin. Individual cows tended to have characteristic prolactin, but this tendency was eliminated by statistical adjustment of the data for environmental and lactational variables. © 1975, American Dairy Science Association.

AB  - 28-day-old female rats were killed at increasing time periods after the injection of cither 30 IU pregnant mares’ serum (PMS) or saline, and pituitary and plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Hormone concentrations were measured at intervals up to one week following injection with frequent measurements made on the afternoon preceding ovulation to better char-acterize and evaluate the PMS-treated immature rat as an ovulation model. Peaks in both plasma LH and prolactin occurred on the afternoon preceding ovulation. Pituitary LH was found to decrease and again increase during this afternoon period before falling to a low value on the morning following ovulation. Pituitary prolactin increased to an early afternoon maximum value, fell to a low value by late afternoon, and increased again by the morning following ovulation. Saline-treated immature female rats displayed fluctuations in plasma and pituitary LH and prolactin similar to but smaller than the afternoon changes found in PMS-treated rats. Pituitary weights were significantly greater in PMS-treated rats on the afternoon preceding ovulation. The hormonal changes encountered in the PMS-treated rat prior to ovulation appear to be similar to those encountered in the proestrous cycling female rat, although more study is necessary to validate this system as a model of spontaneous ovulation in the adult animal. The data suggest that PMS causes ovulation in immature rats by amplifying or synchronizing existing hormonal rhythms. © 1975 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Prolactin secretion was evaluated in 11 consecutive patients referred with nonpuerperal lactation who did not have clinical evidence of pituitary tumors. Six patients had normal fasting prolactin (PRL) levels, 13.8 ± 1.8 ng per ml (Group I), and the other 5 women had elevated basal serum PRL concentrations, 182 ± 72 ng per ml (Group II). All Group II patients had amenorrhea; however, 5 of 6 Group I patients had menstrual periods. The 24-h mean serum PRL concentrations were 12.8 ± 1.2 (SEM), 13.3 ± 0.7, and 165 ± 62 ng per ml for the controls and Group I and II, respectively. A pattern of intermittent PRL discharge during the day characterized each group; however, a normal sleep related increase in serum PRL concentration was absent in the Group II patients. Chlorpromazine produced greater than two-fold increases in serum PRL concentrations in the controls and Group I patients; however, this response was absent in Group II. L-Dopa produced appropriate suppression of serum PRL concentrations in the normals and both patient groups. Normal serum growth hormone, thyroxine, and plasma cortisol characterized each group. Serum estrogen and/or LH and FSH were decreased in 3 of 5 Group II patients; however, the serum concentrations of these hormones were normal in 5 of 6 Group I patients. Short term L-dopa therapy was effective in suppressing lactation in 3 of 5 Group II patients, and it also decreased lactation in the 4 treated Group I patients without significantly altering 24-h mean serum PRL concentrations in the latter group. Conclusion: Hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction was present in certain patients with nonpuerperal lactation who had elevated 24-h mean PRL concentrations and no PRL release following chlorpromazine and sleep. Frequently, however, nonpuerperal lactation is associated with normal prolactin secretion. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

The antiserum, obtained by immunizing rabbits with cortisol-3-carboxymethyl-oxime conjugated to bovine serum albumin, had a high affinity (KA = 1.8 × 109l/mole) and capacity (2.3 × 10-6 moles/L undiluted serum) for cortisol. The minimum detectable amount determined at the lower 95% confidence limit of the buffer control tubes was 8.3 ± 4.7 pg/tube and a log dose - logit response standard curve was linear between 20 pg and 20 ng/tube. The antiserum was highly specific for cortisol with only corticosterone, cortisone, 11-deoxy-cortisol and 21-deoxycortisol showing significant cross-reaction (12.4, 6.6, 3.8 and 3.1%, respectively). The cross-reaction for the other tested naturally occurring and synthetic steroids did not exceed 1%. Regression analysis of cortisol concentration estimates obtained on 20 samples before and after Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography gave a coefficient of correlation (r) of 0.995 and a regression coefficient (b) of 1.04. Recovery of cortisol added to plasma samples was quantitative. The intra-assay error was 8.5% and the inter-assay error averaged 5.7%. The method is simple requiring a single solvent extraction of plasma, therefore permitting large numbers of samples to be handled efficiently by a single technician. © 1975.

AB  - The extent of circadian variation in plasma corticosteroid levels at 30 days of age was normal in rats who received either intraventricular 6-OH dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine on day 3 of life. A 4-h advance in the time of peaking was present in this latter group. At the time of study the depletion of 8.00 a.m. and 8.00 p.m. levels of norepinephrine was significant in the cortex (—49%), hypothalamus (—58%), hippocampus (—65%), and amygdala (—44%) of the 6-OH dopamine-treated animals, as was a similar depletion of serotonin in these areas in the 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine-treated animals. There was no difference between 8.00 a.m. and 8.00 p.m. levels of either amine in any of these areas, in contrast to the variation seen in uninjected animals in whom 8.00 a.m. levels of both amines were higher in all areas than 8.00 p.m. levels. The female 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals had significantly increased adrenal weights. No other significant changes were noted in the adrenals or gonads of either treated group. Body weights were not significantly altered in any of the animals. These data demonstrate that the circadian variation in plasma corticosteroid levels can develop in the presence of either marked norepinephrine or serotonin depiction in CNS areas that have been implicated in the regulation of such periodicity. © 1975 S.

AB  - Delayed or direct pseudopregnancieswere induced by electrical stimulation of the cervixat 1400 h on diestrus day 2 (D-2) or on estrus, respectively. Blood samples for measurement ofprolactin and LH by radioimmunoassay were collectedby rapid decapitation at 5, 15, 30, 45 or 60min after cervical stimulation or thereafter at 3-hintervals throughout the first 6 days of leukocyticvaginal smears of pseudopregnancy (PSP L-1 toL-6). For comparison, untreated animals were decapitatedat the same 3-h intervals throughout the4-day cycle. Serum LH concentrations in all the experimentalanimals did not vary from those measured in thecyclic controls. Compared with the normal cycle, prolactin (PRL)levels were not different until 10 h after cervicalstimulation during estrus. After stimulation on D-2, PRL secretion did not differ from that in the normalcycle until approximately 37 h later, when there wasa short rise following the usual proestrus surge. In both direct and delayed pseudopregnancy, twice-daily PRL surges appeared on L-l and, exceptfor a missing nocturnal surge on L-2 in delayedPSP, continued regularly through L-6. The absence of any immediate increase of PRL following the D-2 stimulus strongly supports the view that information from the stimulus is retained in the central nervous system to be expressed later after a set of new, competent corpora lutea has been formed. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - We have demonstrated that a brief step-like increment in circulating estradiol concentrations to approximately 100 pg/ml, achieved by SC insertion of Silastic capsules containing estradiol- 17β and their withdrawal after 29½ hr, elicited a daily LH surge on 4 consecutive afternoons in rats ovariectomized 2 weeks previously. Since the duration of this stimulus was similar to that of the preovulatory increment in serum estradiol concentrations, it was postulated that the endogenous estrogen signal in intact rats might also trigger repetitive LH surges if ovulation and formation of corpora lutea were prevented. To test this hypothesis, rats were ovariectomized at 10:00 AM on proestrus (day 1) and blood samples were obtained at 12:30 and 5:00 PM on days 1 to 4. Although an LH surge occurred on proestrus, no subsequent LH discharg surge on consecutive days could not be attributed to a difference between the endogenous estradiol stimulus and the exogenous stimulus which elicited repetitive LH surges in long-term ovariectomized rats. Rather, it was determined that in recently ovariectomized rats, in contrast to long-term ovariectomized rats, a daily LH surge occurred only if elevated serum estradiol concentrations were maintained. Thus, by leaving implants in place, an LH discharge was elicited on 10 consecutive days. These results support the concept that a neural signal for the LH surge is emitted each day throughout the estrous cycle of the rat, and that prolonged maintenance of elevated circulating estradiol concentrations is essential for the expression of these signals. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The ability of ovarian steroids to influence the release of LH was examined after ovariectomy in regularly cycling adult female rats and two types of anovulatory persistent estrous rats: Rats treated with 10 μg of testosterone propionate (TP) shortly after birth, and normal rats housed under constant illumination. Two months after ovariectomy the negative feedback effects of a single injection of 20 μg estradiol benzoate (EB) on plasma LH were measured in these three preparations. Ovariectomized (ovex) normal and TP-treated but not ovex constant light-exposed rats had reduced LH values 6 hr after EB treatment. However, LH levels were reduced by the next day in rats in constant light. Positive feedback was measured in similar EB-primed rats following a second injection of EB or progesterone (P). In ovex normal rats LH values remained low in the morning but increased in the afternoon following the second steroid injection. Ovex EB-primed androgenized rats failed to demonstrate this positive feedback. Similarly, in ovex EB-primed constant light-exposed rats, LH values did not increase after a second EB injection. However, high LH values were observed in the afternoon 6 hr after P administration and again 40 and 50 hr later. These results indicate that the lack of spontaneous ovulation in androgenized rats may be due to the absence of positive feedback to ovarian steroids. Constant light-exposed ovex rats do not respond to the positive feedback action of estrogen and show a different response to P than ovex normal rats, in that a regular diurnal peak in plasma LH is not observed. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - According to mutually balanced aspects, the 24 hr rhythmical behavior of serum iron and the total iron 'bondability' (TIBC) were examined at 3 different places in 20 females in each group. The sample taken at random was uniformly composed in respect to age (16-18 yr) and female sex; moreover all test persons felt healthy, had an unremarkable anamnesis, were not pregnant, nor influenced by medicaments or ovulation inhibitors. The serum iron showed a 24 hr rhythm with an unusually large amplitude (on the average 63 μg/100 ml); the maximum values were found between 8 a.m. and 12 noon; the minimum ones between 8-12 p.m. In one case an inverse phase relation was also stated. Menstruation (4 cases) and anemia by iron deficiency (1 case), did not extinguish the 24 hr rhythm. Its endogenous character is discussed. On the other hand, no changes in TIBC during 24 hr rhythm were found by examination. The conclusion drawn is that to increase the diagnostic evidence of both the parameters, specific reference areas in iron, with daytime taken into consideration, new methods must be found. Sampling of blood between 7 and 10 a.m. under fasting conditions and for special formulations of the question and additional sampling between 8 and 12 p.m. is recommended. Within the screening, drawing of blood was carried out between 8-10 a.m.

AB  - TSH, T4and T3 were measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma samples obtained from 77 young adult male and 114 female rats fed a Purina high-iodine diet and maintained in an isolated room, 2-4/cage, at 24 ± 1 C with light from 0600-1800 h. In one experiment, 7 male and 7 female rats were decapitated every 3 h for 30 consecutive h and bunk blood was collected. There was a clear nyctohemeral rhythm of plasma TSH in both sexes characterized by a zenith at 1200 h and a nadir between 1800 and 2100 h. The plasma TSH cycle was approximately 180Ã out of phase and negatively correlated (P &lt;.05) with that of plasma corti-costerone (B) in both sexes. Although glucocorti-coids have been reported to suppress TSH secretion, there was no causal relationship between plasma B and TSH in our experiments since the TSH cycles were normal in chronically adrenalectomized rats. Normal TSH cyclicity was not observed in severely iodine-deficient rats with extremely high plasma TSH levels although the nyctohemeral B rhythmwas normal. Plasma TSH was approximately twice as high in males as in females (overall mean ± SE: M =149 ±11, F = 81 ± 7 μ/ml, p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in plasma TSH at different stages of the estrous cycle. Plasma T4 was slightly, but significantly, higher in males than females (overall mean ± SE: M = 6.4 ± 0.1, F = 6.0 ± 0.1 μ/100 ml; P &lt; 0.001), while T, was higher in females than in males (overall mean ± SE: M = 69.5 ± 1.7, F = 80.3 ± 2.1 μ/100 ml; P &lt; 0.001). No significant nyctohemeral rhythm was observed in plasma T4 or T3 in eith r sex. These observations indicate that: 1) There is a nyctohemeral rhythm of plasma TSH which is independent of plasma B fluctuations and not associated with proportional chaμes in plasma thyroid hormones. 2) A sustained high rate of TSH secretion abolishes the normal nyctohemeral plasma TSH rhythm. 3) There are significant differences in plasma concentrations of TSH, T4 an d T3. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - These experiments were designed to compare prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) secretion in strains of mice with varying incidences of mammary tumors. In addition to the basal levels, PRL concentrations were compared after stimulation with perphenazine. Although pituitary concentrations of PRL and pituitary and serum concentrations of GH appeared to be generally higher in strains with high incidence of mammary tumors, basal PRL levels in single decapitate serum samples seemed to have little correlation with the incidence of mammary tumors in different strains. However, PRL concentrations in sera after perphenazine injection followed a pattern characteristic of the mammary tumor incidence rate of the strain: C3H/St and CBA/St–the two high–incidence strains–had lower levels of PRL; C57BL/St and BALB/cST–the two low–incidence strains–had higher levels; and DBA/2St–the medium–incidence strain–had an intermediate level. PRL contents of the pituitary glands were depleted virtually equally in all strains except the BALB/cSt. These results suggested that the rate of metabolism of PRL in strains with high incidence of mammary tumors may be faster than in those with low incidences. Perphenazine had no influence on GH secretion in most mice. The strain-specific differences in PRL and GH concentrations were usually present even during cyclical and diurnal fluctuations. Serum PRL and GH levels were generally higher during the follicular phase and lower during the luteal phase of the estrous cycle in both C3H/St and C57BL/St strains. There were signs of episodic secretion of PRL together with evidences of circadian periodicity in the secretion of PRL and GH in mice of both strains. The levels of GH were usually high during the morning hours and those of PRL high during the evening hours. The data show a high degree of specificity in the secretion of PRL and GH in mice of different inbred strains, and it is possible that these strainspecific differences may be an important factor in the development of mammary tumors. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - Gonadotropins-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) in selected regions of the female rat brain was measured by radioimmunoassay. Detectable immunoreactive Gn-RH was found in the anterior hypothalamic-septal region and in the mid-hypothalamic (arcuate-median eminence) region. Gn-RH was several times higher in the middle region than in the anterior region. Gn-RH was undetectable in the posterior hypothalamic region, frontal cerebral cortex and pineal glands, as well as in random blood samples, and low to undetectable in anterior pituitary glands. Gn-RH activity varied during the estrous cycle and after castration. In the mid-hypothalamic region, Gn-RH content was lowest throughout diestrus and in late morning and early afternoon of proestrus, and highest early in the morning of proestrus and during estrus. A significant decrease at mid-day was only found on the day of proestrus, a few hours prior to the critical period for LH release. In the anterior hypothalamic region, low Gn-RH activity was found from 1200 h of estrus to 1200 h of diestrus-2. A comparatively higher activity was seen at 1700 h of diestrus-2 and also from 1400 h of proestrus to 0800 h of estrus. Twenty-one days after ovariectomy, Gn-RH in the mid-hypothalamic region was significantly lower than the lowest values seen during the estrous cycle, while Gn-RH in the anterior hypothalamic region remained between low and high values seen during the cycle, being significantly higher than the low values. The changes observed during the estrous cycle and after castration suggest that gonadal steroids play a direct role in the control of hypothalamic Gn-RH. These data also demonstrate that Gn-RH varies in a different way in the anterior and mid-hypothalamic regions. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Peitersen, B., Bohn, L., and Andersen, H. (The Children's Hospital, Fuglebakken and the Department of Clinical Chemistry, Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark). Quantitative determination of immunoglobulins, lysozyme, and certain electrolytes in breast milk during the entire period of lactation, for a 24‐hour period, and in milk from the individual mammary gland. Acta Paediatr Scand, 64:709, 1975.–During a period commencing at birth and lasting for up to 27 months 193 milk samples have been collected from 29 mothers. The IgA globulin content was high immediately after birth, averaging 2.7 arb.U, decreasing to 0.3 arb.U within the first 2 to 3 weeks after birth, then remaining almost constant for the rest of the lactational period. In the case of IgG globulin, similar results were obtained, but the quantity was much smaller. IgM globulin was demonstrated in small quantities during the first 3 weeks of lactation. The lysozyme content varied considerably during the whole lactational period. Individual variations were found for all the immunoglobulins, while the concentration in the individual woman varied only slightly from day to day following in other respects the pattern described above. In 19 mothers IgA, IgG, IgM, lysozyme and electrolyte content were determined in serum and in milk from the right and the left breast on the same day. No difference in content was found between milk from the left and the right mammary gland. A positive correlation was found between the concentrations of IgA and sodium chloride in milk, between those of IgG in milk and serum, and between those of lysozyme in milk and serum. No variations were registered during the individual breast feeding, nor for the 24‐hour period as a whole. Copyright © 1975, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The sites and mechanism of the ovulation-inducing action of estradiol benzoate (EB) were studied by brain implantation of the crystalline steroid through chronically implanted outer cannula at 12:00 on diestrus day 2 in the 5-day cyclic rat. EB implantation in the medial amygdala or the bed nucleus of stria terminalis advanced cyclic changes in vaginal smears, timing of ovulatory LH release, and ovulation by 1 day, resulting in 4-day cycle. When implants in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis were placed for a shorter period of time on diestrus day 2, from 12:00 to 20:00, advancement of these parameters were similarly observed. Serum concentration of FSH and that of prolactin were significantly elevated at 20:00 on the same day in the rats implanted with EB in the medial amygdala or the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, compared with those in the non-treated controls. LH was not affected. The implantation in the arcuate nucleus was also effective to advance ovulation, but the anterior deafferentation prevented the effect. In contrast, EB implantation in the medial septal nucleus, the medial preoptic area, or the medial basal prechiasmatic area was consistently ineffective to advance vaginal cycle and ovulation. Multiunit activity in the arcuate nucleus showed an afternoon elevation on the day of implantation in these areas and as well on the day following, while it did not show such elevation on the day of implantation in the medial preoptic area. It is concluded that EB acts on the medial amygdala and the bed nucleus of stria termianlis in the mid-diestrus in 5-day cycle to stimulate FSH and prolactin release without affecting LH, which changes trigger a chain of reproductive events inducing early release of ovarian steroid responsible for early ovulatory gonadotropin release. The arcuate nucleus in one of the sites of stimulatory action of estrogen, but it requires the neural influence presumably from the medial amygdala and the bed nucleus of stria terminalis via the preoptic area for stimulating the ovulatory hormone release. EB exposure is considered to be endowed with the increase of its resposibility to this neural influence. © 1975, The Japan Endocrine Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Precocious ovulation was induced in 26 day old rats by means of 25 IU pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin (PMS). Rats were given injections at either 09.00 or 16.00 in order to determine whether the course of pubertal changes in corticosterone (B), progesterone (P) or time of ovulation would be dependent upon the time of injection. Blood samples were collected by decapitation at 4 h intervals on the day of expected ovulation (day 28). In saline treated controls at 28 days of age there was a demonstrable daily variation in both serum B and P with maximum values at 16.00 and minimum values at 08.00. In rats given PMS at 09.00, there was a peak of P and B at 16.00 on day 28 but the values were higher than in controls. Ovulation took place at 24.00 on day 28-29. In rats given PMS at 16.00 the pattern of P and B was different, with continual high values from 16.00 to 04.00 at 28 days of age; ovulation took place later in this group (between 02.00-08.00 on day 28). It can be concluded that there is a daily rhytm of P a few days before puberty and that the induction of precocious ovulation with PMS is associated with a different pattern of B and P and a different time of ovulation depending upon when PMS is administered.
The influence of pregnant mare's serum (PMS) on pubertal changes in the daily patterns of progesterone (P) and corticosterone (C) was studied in 26-day-old rats. 25 IU of PMS was injected at either 0900 or 1600 hours to see whether the changes in P, C, and the time of ovulation were dependent on the time of the injection. All of the animals ovulated, but at different times. Animals treated at 0900 on Day 26 exhibited ovulation by 2400 on Day 28, while those animals treated at 1600 first showed ova at 1600 on Day 29. The weights of the ovaries and uteri of treated rats were significantly higher than those of saline-treated controls (p=.01). At Day 28 a definite variation in P and C levels with minimum values at 0800 and maximum values at 1600 hours was observed in controls. In rats treated with PMS at 0900, P and C peaked at 1600 hours with values higher than controls. A similar P and C pattern was observed in rats treated at 1600 hours, with continual high values from 1600 to 0400. It was concluded that the differences in the timing of pubertal events are associated with changes of the P and C rhythms, although it could not be determined which hormonal rhythm is preferred by the reproductive system as a timer.

AB  - Spectral analysis of the EEG using fast Fourier transform in preterm and full term infants revealed significant maturational changes in all three stages of sleep. In quiet sleep full term infants differed from preterm babies (&lt;37 weeks gestation) by significantly higher power in delta and theta frequencies (1.6-7.5 Hz). During indeterminate sleep the slowest frequencies (0.1-1.5 Hz) showed significantly less power, while power of faster frequencies (1.6-7.5 Hz) was significantly greater in full term infants rapid eye movement (REM) sleep differed in slowest (0.1-1.5 Hz) and fastest (17.5-25 Hz) frequency band, showing significantly lower power in the former and significantly higher in the latter in full term infants. From the diagnostic point of view the most important maturational EEG changes were found by computing the REM sleep quiet frequency spectrum difference. This showed significantly higher power during quiet sleep over a wide range of frequencies (0.1-12.5 Hz) in full term infants, while preterm infants had an almost identical spectrum during these two stages of sleep with a significant intensity drop only in theta2 (5.6-7.5 Hz) during REM sleep. Since these differences can be readily identified in the individual infant it is suggested that the assessment of the EEG may be useful for the early detection of delays in maturation.

AB  - This study sought to determine whether behavioral handicaps result in rats when fertilization occurs late in the life of the ova. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were mated so that fertilization occurred near ovulation or approximately 6 hr afterward. Although late-mated females showed more rejection of the male than controls, there was no difference in the probability of becoming pregnant given that copulation occurred (P= 0.80). Measures of maternal activities during gestation and the maternal care period revealed no differences between groups; 34 measures of offspring behavior in the home cage and standard learning apparatuses showed no consistent group differences. © 1975 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Polygraphic study of day sleep was carried out in 30 nurslings with consideration to the EEG, oculogram, muscle tone indices, variations in skin resistance, respiration, ECG, rheoencephalogram and rheogram of the calf. Nurslings with cerebral affections of perinatal genesis were examined by the same method. It was possible to distinguish the main stages of slow sleep and rapid sleep in young nurslings, although the EEG expression of the stages in children had its specific features. Age dynamics of the polygraphic picture of sleep showed EEG, vegetative and motor components of sleep to distinctly coordinate by stages and, at the same time, to possess marked autonomicity; this was also confirmed by analysis of cerebral pathology.

AB  - Previous studies have found that laboratory conditions influence sleep-waking behavior in older infants, children, and adults. The present study employed videotape recordings to monitor continuous 24-hr sleep-waking activity in 2- and 8-week-old infants before, during, and after 12 hr of polygraphic recordings. Sleep- and waking-state organization were affected by laboratory conditions. At both age levels, increased fussy-crying and decreased alertness occurred during the first 4 hr in the laboratory when they were video recorded only and during the first 4 hr that the leads were in place. Decreased fussy-crying and increased alertness were noted in the following periods, indicating adaptation. Latency to sleep was shorter, and drowsiness increased and active sleep decreased while the leads were in place. At 8 weeks, quiet sleep increased and active sleep decreased while the leads were in place. These data suggest that the unfamiliar laboratory conditions inherent in both observational and polygraphic studies are stressful and that time for adaptation is needed.

AB  - In the present study the maturation of states of sleep in kittens from birth to 6 weeks of age was evaluated in terms of the developmental emergence of temporal concordance between defining physiological parameters. In addition, periodicity of the earliest alternation of states, the REM-non-REM (rapid eye movement-nonrapid eye movement) or "basic rest activity cycle", was traced during this same interval. Parameters studied included EEG, eye movements, neck EMG, gross motor activity, and respiration patterns. Kittens were monitored in isolation for periods of 2-6 hr, providing for collection of both longitudinal and cross-sectional data. Statistical and computer analyses were performed on these data. The most outstanding feature of polygraphic data from kittens between birth and 4 weeks of age was the gradual coalescence of initially discordant physiological measures of sleep state. Prior to 3 weeks of age, polygraphic patterns differed significantly from those of the adult cat, indicating that individual rates of maturation existed for each physiological system measured. Sleep state periodicity was weak at this time due to marked pattern fragmentation. Detectable cycles were clearly shorter than those observed in the adult cat. These findings suggest that the developmental assessment of polygraphic pattern concordance might be a more useful index of sleep state maturation than evaluation based upon attempted comparisons with stable adult patterns. They suggest further that sleep state development in the kitten consists of several different stages. The initial maturation of a basic rest activity cycle may begin during gestation, and be disrupted by the transition to extrauterine life. A postnatal period of approximately 3-6 weeks is required for maturation of sensorimotor and respiratory functions in the completion of this stage. It is proposed that from this time to approximately 3 months of age, forebrain maturation and environmental influences progressively mediate a mature sleep-wake cycle which is superimposed upon this more basic level of organization. © 1975.

AB  - A number of drugs cause marked increases in the steroid hydroxylase activity of hepatic microsomes. Beginning 2 days after estrus, 117 mature ewes were each given 14 injections over a 27-day period of phenobarbital sodium, diphenylhydantoin, chlorcyclizine HCl or phenylbutazone. Blood samples for luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone determination by radioimmunoassay (RIA) were taken on day 10 of the first estrous cycle (day 18 if no heat was observed) and on days 5 and 10 of the second cycle. On day 10 of the second cycle, the ewes were given an intravenous injection of 1 ml of 6% solution of pentobarbitol sodium anesthetic per 4.5 kg body weight, and the length of anesthetic sleep time was measured. The ewes were then killed and corpora lutea and liver were weighed. In 33 ewes treated with either phenobarbitol sodium or phenylbutazone, sleep time was shortened (18 min vs 29 min in untreated controls, P<.01), indicating that enzyme induction had occurred. For 41 ewes treated with either chlorcyclizine HCl or diphenylhydantoin, sleep time was lengthened to 93 min (P<.01 vs controls), indicating impaired liver function. Electron micrographs of liver cells verified that enzyme induction or hepatic degeneration had occurred. © 1976.

AB  - Effects of late pregnancy and early lactation on feeding and sleep patterns are described. Jaw movements and the electrocorticogram were continuously recorded from 2 weeks before to 4 weeks after parturition in two stalled cows receiving a constant daily allocation of concentrates and hay ad libitum. The cows were milked twice daily from 24 h after giving birth, except in one instance of 2 days duration, and were allowed to suckle their calves on two occasions. In the week immediately prior to parturition, feeding occurred only during the daytime and rumination occurred in shorter periods. After parturition, the mean daily time spent in food intake and rumination increased progressively throughout the first 4 weeks of lactation. Reduction in sleep duration and in resting of the head on the floor were observed when the cows were allowed to suckle their calves and after the period of no milking. Disturbances in feeding and sleep patterns were also observed during the first 2 days after separation from their calves. © 1975.

AB  - The authors report their experience in recording the fetal encephalogram during labour. They emphasize the importance of the technical problems, the value of polygraphic recordings and the difficulties of interpretation. The fetal encephalogram is the same as that of a newborn infant of the same gestational age, and as in the newborn, there exists a wake sleep cycle; this modulation of the fetal encephalogram during normal labour may be regarded as a sign of a certain wellbeing of the fetus. The authors emphasize that the fetal cycle is independent of that of the mother and that the loss of sleep is the first encephalographic sign of fetal distress.

AB  - A boy born after 25 weeks' gestation is presented. During the first trimester, the mother had experimented with 'uppers and downers', LSD, took 'a lot of' Doriden for sleep and repeatedly smoked cannabis to 'highs'. She spotted from the third month on and before delivery had early toxemia and one episode of syncope. At birth the child weighed 1109 gm. He was exchange transfused, had RDS and was kept in the hospital for 3 1/2 months. His developmental milestones have been delayed, such as walking at 26 months, talking at 36 months. He is below the 3rd percentile in height and weight. He has poor muscle mass and sparse subcutaneous fat. His head is narrow. The eyes have an antimongoloid slant and epicanthus. There is slight left lid ptosis. The bridge of his nose is rather prominent. The palate is higharched but without tooth crowding. The ears are large and low set. There is a blowing systolic murmur at the left sternal border. The hands have slender tapering fingers and transverse palmar creases (not true simian lines). The testicles were palpated in the inguinal canals. The IQ was 55 at 3 7/12 years. Hypertonia, micrognathia, hypospadias and seizures were absent. The cytogenetic report was 46,XY,-21,+ small metacentric. Cytogenetic study of the family showed normal karyotypes of mother (46,XX), father (46,XY) and older sister (46,XX). The mother denied drug experimentation during her first pregnancy.

AB  - Effects of diazoxide on systemic and uterine hemodynamics as well as on fetal circulation and blood respiratory gases were investigated in chronically instrumented pregnant sheep. Diazoxide was administered intravenously either to the ewe or directly to the fetus in doses calculated on the basis of body weight. Transfer of drug across placenta was also investigated. Results showed that: a) when injected into the mother, there was consistent hypotensive effect with increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance; uterine blood flow might not change or might decrease slightly with moderate hypotension; when maternal systemic arterial pressure fell to critical closing pressure level, uterine flow decreased significantly; but despite these maternal changes, the fetal circulatory functions were not significantly altered; b) when injected into the fetus in doses up to 15 mg/kg, diazoxide failed to alter fetal circulation appreciably; c) diazoxide crossed the placenta when injected into either mother or fetus according to a definite gradient; fetal levels were always lower than maternal levels because of rapid loss of the drug by the fetus; d) moderate maternal and fetal hyperglycemia occurred after drug administration. © 1975 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

AB  - We have completed an extensive longitudinal investigation of a patient with anorexia nervosa, in which psychomotor activity measures were obtained continuously. In our attempt to point out the overall value of objective measurements of activity, we have investigated family impact data in this case. This report illustrates the first application of a telemetric mobility system for the assessment of family interaction and hospital ward events. Furthermore, it proposes a method for quantifying one aspect of the biologic impact of day-time psycho-social occurences. © 1975.

AB  - Female rats reared in unisexual (U) or bisexual (B) cross-fostered litters were mated at 75 days of age and their maternal behaviour compared by periodic observation over 20 days following birth of their litters. In two separate experiments, U-females showed a lower incidence of pregnancy and, at birth, of litters with ten or more pups than B-females (P < 0·05). Litters culled to ten animals on the day after birth were significantly heavier in B- than in U-females, although this difference was not evident at weaning as litters reared by U-females showed a relatively greater (P < 0·01) increase in weight during the investigation than the corresponding litters reared by B-females. Using a scoring method, no difference was evident in the opportunities that U- and B-females offered for their pups to suck, and, when not nursing pups in the nest, both groups of females engaged equally in activities such as grooming, sleeping, eating, and rearing on their hind legs. Throughout the 20-day observation period, B-females maintained significantly more elaborate nests (as scored on an arbitrary scale) than U-females. This difference was evident in females rearing litters of both five and ten animals, and was observed in two separate experiments. In addition, whereas only 15 per cent of U-females were observed nest-building, over 60 per cent of B-females were noted to be engaged in this activity on one or more occasions (P < 0·001). It is suggested that, in the light of previous findings, these results may reflect differences in oestrogen and/or progesterone metabolism in unisexually-reared and bisexuallyreared female rats. © 1975.

AB  - The object of the study was to assess the lability of testosterone levels in plasma of normal human males over a long period of time and to search for periodicities in changing levels. Blood samples obtained from 20 healthy young men every second day for 2 months were assayed for total testosterone concentration by radioligand saturation analysis with late-pregnancy plasma. The fluctuations of plasma testosterone levels over the total time span were substantial for most individuals; the coefficients of variation ranged from 14 to 42% (median 21%). The presence of periodic functions in these fluctuations was tested by 4 different, relatively independent methods. Close agreement among at least 3 analytic methods was found for 12 out of the 20 subjects. These 12 subjects had cycles of plasma testosterone levels with periods ranging between 8-30 days, with a cluster of periods around 20-22 days. The majority of such cycles were significant at least at the 5% level. The mean amplitudes of these cycles ranged from 9 to 28% of the subjects' mean testosterone levels. © 1975 by The Endocrine Society.

AB  - The paper describes the case of a 23 yr old primipara who was stung in the head by six bees during sleep 23 days before the date the baby was most probably due. Following a loss of consciousness and symptoms of anaphylactic shock, labour pains set in, and 56 hr after the stinging she gave birth to a live, premature and somewhat asphyxial baby. Another case is mentioned, which occurred five yr later in Dalmatia which was brought to the author's notice. The gravida was stung also in the head by several honey bees and then delivered soon a baby prematurely. The author also discusses chemical and pharmacological properties of bee toxin, which is a composite of various powerful substances whose effects, according to some authors, are not yet fully known. In particular, little is known about how they affect the gravid uterus. The author concludes that further research in this direction might produce interesting and profitable results.

AB  - Blood dyscrasias (leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, megaloblastic and aplastic anemia) are among the most serious adverse reactions. Aplastic anemia is connected with high mortality. Of neuro psychic disorders vertigo, ataxia, headache, vision and hearing abnormalities, anxiety, excitement, confusion, delirium, and sleep disorders are reported, and in most cases general apathy, lethargy, drowsiness and depression. Gastrointestinal disorders are characterized first of all by nausea and vomiting. The occurrence of cholestatic jaundice with hepatic necrosis is not exceptional, leading in 40% to death. Dermatological complications, except after barbiturates, are not frequent and include mild reactions as well as serious ones, e.g. lupus erythematosus and erythema multiforme (Steven Johnson syndrome). Gingival hyperplasia is relatively frequent after hydantoin derivatives: on the basis of 15,000 patients the incidence is estimated to be 40%; the etiology is unknown. Sporadical are kidney disorders and abnormalities of heart rhythm and breathing. During the last few years more than a 2 or 3 fold higher incidence of congenital malformations in relation to anticonvulsant medication administered to epileptic mothers was shown. These findings correlate with laboratory experiments. Most studies emphasize the possible association between congenital abnormalities and maternal folic acid deficiency. A very important problem is the interaction of antiepileptics with other drugs. The interaction with steroid hormones, including those used in oral contraceptives, leads to their inactivation. The result of it is inefficacy of this form of contraception.
